Go into this movie, I was a little cautious. I've always been a bit of a claymation movie. I've always had decent animated movies, but claymation was always different to me. But this surprised me. Wallace and Gromit are extremely lovable characters, and it's a great story with jokes for all ages. There are the silly game / game jokes for the kids and the subtle, but over the head of young children, jokes to us older people. Very nice claymation and while the story had holes, it became my interest that began to end. <br /> <br /> It is so rare to find pure and incorrect humor these days, this movie was the more refreshing. Wallace and Gromit are doing their normal things, which exterminate humanity the bugs that destroy people's vegetable crops. But this time they find themselves in battle with some kind of a freak big rabbit that their humanly built traps can't even hold under tabs. Big laughs and a good one and a half hours. If you haven't exposed yourself to Wallace and Gromit, I highly recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I rate it a 7 and no higher is because it is still a family movie and I don't have children. I enjoyed it, but if I had seen it with some small carpet rats and my wife, it would be at least a 9 safe! Give it a shot!
