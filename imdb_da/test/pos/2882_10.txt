I always want to think about Mr. Firth as Dorian Gray, if I live to be 100. Perfectly acted and directed, which brings Oscar Wildes insight, humor and humor alive with an absolute and complete perfection unusual on television. <br /> <br /> More evidence that the BBC is more than doing talent in what it doesn't always have in money. <br /> <br /> A must for all Wilde fans - and for everyone else. Inspired and perfected, all actors did exactly the role and each shot was well done. In the end, I found that I loved every single character in a way that no other movie of the type had ever inspired. See it, try to see another version. It's just not the same, is it?
