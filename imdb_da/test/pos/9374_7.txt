I did not read the source, Richard Brooks' novel "The Brick Foxhole" which I hope is not as annoying as its title, but I understand the original villain was a homophobe not an anti Semite. (And to be honest, Sam Levene is written as a gay guy who chooses a drunken soldier.) But okay, you have to go with the flow. Consider 1947. Not even anti-Semitism has been treated on the screen yet. Many of the people responsible for modern films were even Jews, but anti-Semitism had been banned for years because it was considered unpleasant. So we can hardly blame the film's decision makers for not leaving the victim homosexual. Now it's really uncomfortable - and besides, there could be many audiences who rowed for Robert Ryan to get away with it. We are by no means free of prejudice, but we have still come a long way since 1947. <br /> <br /> See this again for the first time this year, I was impressed by the rather slow pace of the first half of the movie, they many pictures of two people talking, the shadows, the time between the question and the answer, the uninspired editing. But I could live with it because of the movie's subject and because of a few other things. <br /> <br /> One of the things that keeps me glued to events as they unfold so consciously is Robert Ryan's performance. The guy does a fantastic job. At times he may seem thought-provoking, cheerfully subordinate and helpful to the police - "In some way I can help, yes, sir." So alone or with another soldier the simmering hatch rises to the top, not so much through what he says, but the way he listens. The scream that needs to stare, the dark eyes sparkle. Wow. The movie has taken a lot of warmth because of Robert Young's sermon on his grandfather's murder. It doesn't bother me at all, even though I suppose Dmytryk shouldn't have Young pushing his face into the camera while talking about "MICKS and PAPISTS". However, it is one of the more shocking moments in the film that takes the context into account. Part of its influence is due to Young's almost random delivery of the message, and part of it is because the message has not been heard on the screen before. <br /> <br /> Another feature of the film that almost transforms it into Surrealist is the Paul Kelly character and his relationship with the hear Gloria Grahame. Holy Guacamole, which elliptical conversation Kelly is given to. "You know what I told you?" All the things I just told you? They are all lies. "His character exactly crosses pathos with brittleness. It's impossible to know what to do about him. He adds almost nothing to the plot, but the film would be much smaller without his presence. <br /> <br /> It's a Moody, Foam Film Its people live in the dark, and there are murders on the way, almost no one screams or shouts, the horror these men have experienced, and some of them still carry them as malaria, seems just below the surface. /> <br /> See if you have a chance.
