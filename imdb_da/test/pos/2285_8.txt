Not too many people seem to know about this movie. It's too bad because I think it's pretty good. Sure it is a bit cheesy at times and can have a predictable story. But the presentation of the film is quite well done. I think the casting is good with similar actors / characters. Tom Selleck does a good job of playing a baseball player (go figure ... not too much of a stretch I suppose) and Ken Takakura (from Black Rain) plays the boss (the Japanese baseball team coach). There is not too much to complain about. It's just an easy, light, happy comedy, and I recommend it.
