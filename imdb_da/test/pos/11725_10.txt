I'm a fan of B grade 80's movie, where the hero is a bit of a bad guy, a strong man who finds love - and this movie delivers! <br /> <br /> Towards the end, you do not know how Sharky will not be killed (and he does not take a blow! Realistically portrayed I think). But he does, and it's not through something exaggerated 'Die Hard' stunt. It 'past the' team he works with comes together, thus the title. His team is all the characters - people on the sidelines at work, because they don't quite match. These depictions are fun and sympathetic - they have a real feel for them. They face an assassin assassin with a good team of themselves. The result is a great movie noir.
