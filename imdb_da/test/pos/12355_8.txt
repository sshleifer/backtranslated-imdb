Sheba Baby is another Pam Grier Blaxploitation film. It was one of Pam's less visceral films of this genre. Pam plays Sheba Shane, who is a Chicago gumshoe. Sheba's father is the owner of a small loan company in Missouri. When local mobsters try to drive their father to business, Sheba goes after the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier had already made his mark in Blaxploitation films when Sheba Baby came together. Fans of both Coffy and Foxy Brown know that Pam is capable of an explosive intensity as an actress. In Sheba Baby, the burning performance that the viewers came to expect from Pam was not so evident in this movie. Not that Pam doesn't kick in Sheba Baby. She is just not as much of a lane vigilante as she was in her previous Blaxploitation films. <br /> <br /> Support in this movie is a clear disappointment. So Sheba Baby is Pam's movie through and through. And while Pam is a little more subdued than in her other films, she still provides a compelling performance in Sheba Baby. This movie is definitely worth your time if you are a nice Pam Grier fan.
