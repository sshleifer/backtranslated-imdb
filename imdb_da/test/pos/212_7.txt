Nothing like this was seen on television at that time and probably never again. From the first picture of the police force that dazzled you and from there, you heard the words: "Police Squad - in color" you were shocked to see that this was by no means a common sitcom. <br /> <br /> Also killing a "Guest Star" and then never refer him back to where you have ever seen it before. Then the actual show began and if you were not aware you would miss more jokes in the background. Do not pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry. This was the show that video recorders were made before they married children or The Simpsons. <br /> <br /> The stories were by no means sensible, and the dialogue was sometimes so strange that you should think about it for 5 minutes before it became a joke. The people Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken came straight out of Dragnet and they were just right (no fun accents or expressions), but instead there were puns and twisted phrases played absolutely deadpan. Only once, as I can recall, there was a segment that played to silly laughs - a scene with a trip to a dentist, sucking and a lot of saliva. There were some dull moments - like the informant Johnny and a look of some celebrities. It was strictly a one-joke moment, but they had to use it in all six episodes. Oh yes. Everything can't be perfect. The important thing is that the rest of the time you were kneeling deep in the tears of laughter. Leslie Nielsen was fortunate that this revived his career when they rated Frank Drebin in 3 functions, but it must have also been an Achilles heel. Do you remember seeing him in anything other than Naked Gun type work since? And don't count the awful Mr. Magoo reworked into live action. He probably made a lot of money.
