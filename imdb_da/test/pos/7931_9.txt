Looking at some of the sequences (bugs, a whole 1/3 of the movie devoted to the battle on the ice) in Alexander Nevsy, a movie directed by Russian legend Sergei M. Eisenstein (with director of Dmitri Vasilyev in his only significant credit), got me to realize how much really needs to go, at least on a scale like this. If I were a member of a prize group at the time of the release of this movie, I would probably award Eisenstein with the director's award, posthumously. It is such an ugly battle of cinematic genius to pull some of the things that have come out in the movie, but for someone like this instructor after knocking out his best work - Battleship Potemkin and October - it could have been something he scoffed at in the first place But in the middle of a movie that is sometimes a little frustrating with how little grays come into the black and white subject, it is still a wonder of celluloid almost 70 years later. Lord of the Ring fans, meet the film's grandfather, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Saying something is a propaganda piece already puts a connotation to it, and often a bad one. It is something that has a full blown message to it and a point of view. It's still a matter of a hot debate (see the swarms of the Moore's film for evidence), whether great art can come out of something that is shiny in order to awaken the audience in a particular way. In this particular case, the Russians opposed the Germans. At that time, it was approaching WW2, and Russia was once again confronted with the 'German attackers', and it is interesting to note that Eisenstein was actually ordered to make this movie a rally for the Russians to never forget a crucial piece of their story. The end result comes out as something that is actually a bit common to see battleship and October; If nothing else comes through these movies, it is that Eisenstein is most concerned about how the image and content can come together in fineness to the viewer, this style can completely encompass the viewer without error. Under these conditions, Alexander Nevsky is fearless. <br /> <br /> But even with the whole idea of ​​'Russia big, Germans bad', there are some small moments where things are made a little less strict, a little less strict for these ideals. For example, when we first see the Germans in Privka, they are not a faceless blob that is totally barbaric and has a blind, overwhelming purpose (not that they are not out to take what they can). They also have their own national pride, that it would be no less for them to go ahead with what their Christian led gentlemen tell them. At least, the evil of the image is a face, but kept at a low minimum for the more prevalent side to kick in. There is also a short scene before the ice battle, where the Russian troop has a joke that is told and laughed about, and it adds a little extra depth where else there may be valuable little. Because more often than not in Alexander Nevsky, with his fighting songs loaded with pride in warfare, there is no complexity for characters, especially Nevsky himself (played in the ultraheltic way, only questioning the start of Nikolai Cherkasov) who might must be such in Eistenstein's intention to have him as the only incomplete force to be counted in the narrative. To be looking for naturalism in an Eisenstein movie, it is as if trying to find non-koshergris feet on a deli. <br /> <br /> But the real reason for seeing the picture is not the action, yet, but for the film's appearance, how it moves and takes in such an expansive environment as Eisenstein puts out. On the epic scale, it is as ambitious as his 20s movie, with a number of extra features, not only in the main battle scenes, but also in the urban scenes, by the hundreds of people rolling through. In fact, I would say that any director working in Hollywood or elsewhere is thinking of making a kind of great epic, especially war, would do very well to take a look at this movie, even with just the sound of it. It is even better if you think of as a quiet movie, with the visual lines accentuated great at times. One could spend a whole month analyzing the battle of the ice, how it starts with the German soldiers far away and then emerges as bugs, and then how Eisenstein cuts between close-ups of the actors fighting and then to big shots and with sped-up editing. And of course you can't discount the power of the music either. Sergei Prokofiev delivers one of the great exciting results of any epic work. Nevertheless, the director's editing keeps our eyes moving along with this hectic action at breakneck speed. If it were only a short film, it would surely be with the bigsters, just like the Odessa Trapper sequence. <br /> <br /> If I found it a little less than amazing, it would be because of the errors coming in from a director that is much more suited to the silent medium than to sound. While I have not yet seen the terrible Ivan, my one negative criticism would be the direction of his actors, which is as broad as possible, with the melodrama on such a high pitch its staggering (the two soldiers fighting for Olga are the best example I can think of). But even this is considered, Alexander Nevsky is overall too extraordinary to ignore, and sharpens the commitment to the action and film production to a level that sets a benchmark for movies even today to try to live up to.
