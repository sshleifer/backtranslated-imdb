Talk Radio sees a man accidentally stumble through life, actually the American dream, regardless of the bog standard and everyday job he has in a store; to present a local radio program before going straight to the same job, which is only later syndicated nationwide. It is a role he adopts from his own aggression and natural way, a fragile wild approach to freedom of speech, as he attacks almost everyone and everyone, even those who often call up to agree with him or compliment him. His role as a man who ranks everything good, evil, right, wrong, political, religious, moral, and immoral is something that people seem to take in a form; it is 'entertaining and worth tune in for', but in addition on a plan of rejection and contradiction ?? two things born out of the very things that are apparently encouraged in the professional working life of the Western world. This toward a man when he comes to the top of his game using the American dream and deals with freedom of speech that people take to a man, but does anything but go to what he says. <br /> <Talk Talk starts with an assembly of tall, towering buildings in a business-based area of ​​Dallas, Texas. The skyscrapers are shot from an angle and a tower over the viewer plus everything else in the general vicinity as a voice from a man tears through the pictures, illuminates statements and information on topics, as these monolithic buildings dominate the screen. They are the very physical representation of capitalism, while the voice of what we learn to be a radio DJ is the oral representation of the free west; personal speech and opinions about everything and everything. Stone will complete his film in the same way as he started it, even though the film is anything but a circular journey of any kind, as the characters undergo monumental changes both as they testify and their general livelihood. Rather, the shots of the buildings function as an anchor, the study of which is observed. Ideologies and ideas about a lifestyle exist; people subscribe to them, but it makes them worse than good; Before the restoration, this proud lifestyle still exists and will continue to exist by clarifying the various people on the screen of the movie until someone or something drastically changes things. <br /> <br /> DJ is Barry Champlain, a man with a radio program at a local Texan station dealing with just about everything. Champlain's somewhat carefree attitude to some beautifully explosive content is established when he flies from a call with a confused man who recently visited a Holocaust museum to a young addict whose boyfriend apparently has overdosed and on both berating and mocking a pizza shop. For us, the content is just as shocking; For these people, everything seems to be business as usual, planting some serious seeds of both doubt and horror in our minds, beginners to all this. What Barry's show is about, no one ever really seems to establish: everything and nothing. In fact, the time taken by either jingles or dialogue is that the shows just before and after Champlains show are on specific topics; Gardening, for example, and is hosted by quiet speeches and methodical people, which I certainly do not slip from one random or extreme to another all the time raising efforts. One wonders what Barry's jingle is, the kind of lunchtime play during someone else's show: "Coming later, Barry Champlain show! With the village idiot and psychotic drug addicts!" In fact, his shows are the initial piece of sustainable tone, a shout to the audience that a high rock track accompanies it. <br /> <br /> The success of Barry is reflected in the national syndication proposal. It is born out of confrontation and a relationship built on the contempt he has for his listeners and that they have for him. The promotion of the material and the awakening of the effort should question how far they think they can take this, and whether this goes down a track for the sake of entertainment, is really worth it. It is when the show reaches this level of broadcast that Barry seems to be coming out for the first time in his broadcast life when a supposed rape calls in and leaves most of them a little stunned. It is at this time that the camera pauses at Barry, and with the focus focused on the same threatening, towering buildings, the movie began outside the window, just behind Barry. They remain tall and proud. Especially the ideologies they have been built upon and this promotion of freedom of expression in the expansion of Barry's show nationally when a man climbs his business ladder suddenly collides with the kind of content offered. Everything reaches a point too far, and that with freedom must at least be a clarity rather than just a revelation. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone made Talk Radio in the midst of both a fascinating and explosive film-making period in the late 1980s. During this time he produced a series of really well-received films in a fairly short time; Beginning with one of my favorite war movies in Platoon, before continuing with the glorious Wall Street and finally joining the 1991 JFK. One can even say that this race continued into the mid-nineties with Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio is like its main character in the sense that it is loud, thriving, powerful and confrontational. It is not anti-capitalism, as much as it is focused on drawing a line between what is perceived as entertainment and what just goes too far for the sake of popularity and wealth. Talk Radio is definitely a movie that sticks into memory.
