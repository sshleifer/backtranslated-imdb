"Purgatory Flats", shown on cable recently, is a small film that packs a lot. Harris managed in style. The screen of Mr. Done and Diane Fine make a good thriller. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, you might want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> The movie is the story of a young LA doctor who made a mistake and lives to pay for it. When released from prison, he will hide in a small town where he feels that he is forgotten. Bad choice! What Thomas Reed finds in the Purgatory Flats is hell in the desert. Just after landing a job as a bar tender, Thomas meets a beautiful young woman, Sunny, who is clearly someone to stay away from. The young doctor is called to help as Sunny's boyfriend Randy is shot down by a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> We get to know Randy's family. His uncle Dean seems to be OK, but his brother Owen is a loose cannon. Each one in the household is connected in more ways than one to the nubile Sunny. <br /> <br /> The performances are fine. Vincent Ventresca is Thomas, the man who should have gone to his L.A. practice instead of making a detour to the small town. Alexandra Holden is Sunny, a young woman with an enormous ambition to escape her surroundings. Kevin Alejandro, Gregg Henry, Brian Austin plays the men in the Mecklin family well. Nicholas Turturro also makes a good contribution as a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> The film shows a director with promise that will judge far from this tight movie.
