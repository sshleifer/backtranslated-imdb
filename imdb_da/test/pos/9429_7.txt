In the Universal Series of Modern Sherlock Holmes stories with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, SHERLOCK HOLMES and THE SECRET WEOPON are not one of the best movies - even if it's entertaining. I think the problem with that is that much of the film's "dueling" between Holmes and his nemesis Moriarty (here played by Lionel Atwill) seems to delay the actual point of the professor's work. Moriarty appears in three of the Holmes films with Rathbone. In the adventure of Sherlock Holmes he was played by George Zucco, who gave his beauty to the love of fate for his own sake. For my money, Zucco's performance as the professor was the best of the three (there is even a brief moment of comedy in his performance when he is disguised as "police officer" towards the end - as he prepares to sing "a policeman" from Gilbert & Sullivan). Then comes Mr. Atwill's performance here - more of that later. Finally, there is Henry Daniel's intellectual Moriarty in SHERLOCK HOLMES and THE LADY IN GREEN. It is a typical cool, stylish performance by Mr. Daniell, but his confrontations with Holmes seem to be a boring challenge for him. They keep him from completing the master plan. In the stories that the professor discovers, he really feels Holmes is a nemesis that will remain a danger as long as he lives. In fact, because of the intellectual tennis match between him and Rathbone, Rathbone (in his autobiography) felt that Daniell was the best of the movie's moriarticles. <br /> <br /> If Zucco caught the evil of evil in the professor and Daniell appeared to demonstrate the tired Oxford Don (in the stories the professor is a reputable mathematician whose volume on the binomial sentence had a "European fashion" and who wrote a exciting book, ASTEROIDEN'S DYNAMICS), shows Atwill Professor as a pragmatic businessman. First of all, he sold his services (apparently) to Nazi Germany. This has never come in, but you assume (as it is before the Nazis began to really collapse) he figures that they will win the war. Second, he is not a fool. When Dr. Tobel (William Post Jr.) has shown that he is a state of near physical collapse due to torture of Moriarty's gang, the professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists helping Tobel because he is just as good a scientist like Tobel and would be able to put together the bombing. I can somehow not quite see that Zucco makes such a sensible decision on the spot, and if Daniell were to make it, he would seem annoyed that there is still a delay in his plans. By the way, a trick used throughout the Holmes series about the professor is how to remove the film from him. If you read Holme's stories, Moriarty appears as the villain three times: In the last story of MEMORIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ("THE END OF THE FINAL PROBLEM") according to SHERLOCK HOLMES 'first story ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE") and the last one of the four novels / short stories (THE VALLEY OF FEAR). It's amazing how much mileage the professor came from so few appearances (he is also mentioned in two or three other stories - in passing). But because of his fate at Reichenbach Falls in "THE FINAL PROBLEM" and "THE COTTON" we always see him until his death. Zucco falls off the white tower at Tower Hill. Daniell (with more imagination) tries to escape Gregson and the police, but gets shot while jumping, and the wounded fails to hold onto an adjacent building. Atwill (here it is not seen, but heard) seems to fall down a trap door he is planted in an escape tunnel). It is really boring after a while to see that the professor always falls into these movies. One turns to the Gene Wilder comedy (admittedly a comedy) SHERLOCK HOLMES 'SMARTER BROTHER, where Leo McKern is a wonderful crazy and villainous moriarty (finally, with an Irish accent), who is not killed at the end but just left mulling - in a rowing boat - over how his careful arrangements did not work. I liked it better. <br /> <br /> The use of the "Dancing Men" code here, like the use of "Devil's Foot Root" in DRESSED TO KILL, is part of a mystery from a brief story at night. "DANSKENES OPVENTURE" appeared in RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, and is about a client of Holmes whose wife has received strange, blood-spreading messages in this code. Charles Higham, in his biography ADVENTURES OF CONAN DOYLE suggests Sir Arthur may have retrieved the code from a magazine game in the 1870s, but we really don't know. The code is basically one of the letters of the dancing men's characters. The story in the short story is dramatic, but deals with a triangle. The only innovation in the film is that Tobel makes a slight change that confuses both Holmes and Moriarty. <br /> <br /> The movie will entertain, but I still believe FEARS HOUSE, SCARLET CLAW, and SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DOOD are better movies.
