These guys combine low-budget low budget. It is brilliant. <br /> <br /> Look-if you want Bergman, rent "7th Seal" or something. If you want to see widespread humor and exploitation sex, this is it. <br /> <br /> I think Jane Jensen as Julia does it all. She can actually act (really well), she is a complete dream boat, and she doesn't seem to feel over everything.
