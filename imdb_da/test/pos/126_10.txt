CONTAINS "SPOILER" INFORMATION. Look at this director's other movie, "Earth," at some point. It's a better movie, but this one isn't bad just the same. <br /> <br /> A rare feminist viewpoint from an Indian filmmaker. Tradition, rituals, duty, secrets and portrayal of strict gender roles make this an engaging and culturally dynamic movie experience. All the married characters lack the fire in the marriage bed with their respective spouses. A man is celibate and commits to some form of spiritual "adultery" by giving all his love, honor, time and respect to his religious swami (guru). His wife is lonely and longs for intimacy and tenderness, which she eventually finds with her dressed lesbian sister-in-law, who will live in their house with her incredible husband. This incredible man is obviously in love with his Chinese mistress, but was forced to marry a (not known to him) lesbian. They only have sex when his closet lesbian wife loses his virgin. <br /> <br /> A servant lives in the house and he ultimately reveals the secret that the two women are lovers. Another important sign is the older matriarch that is unable to speak or care for itself because of a stroke. However, she uses a ringtone to communicate her needs as well as her dissatisfaction with family members. She lets them know through her bell or by attaching her fist that she knows what is happening in the house and how much she deviates. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the truth about everyone comes out and the two female lovers end up running together. But not before is there an emotional scene between the swami-dependent man and his former straight wife. Her sari is on fire and at first we think she should die. However, we see the two women united in the film's last scene. <br /> <br /> The author / director of this movie challenges her culture's traditions, but she shows us individual people who are trapped by their culture and gender. We will really worry about the characters and we do not see them as stereotypes. Everyone surprises us with their humanity, vulgarity, tenderness, anger and spirit.
