Though you don't usually enjoy documentaries, the odds are that you find this fascinating. It not only has a well-shortened plot that is easy to follow, contains its interesting detours. It also has a very strong emotional resonance, and not one that is dependent on a simple specific tone. Instead, the emotions here are as deep and turbulent as the seas highlighted. <br /> <br /> That said, if you don't know of Donald Crowhurst and 1968 single-hand boat races around the world ... as was the case for me ... please stop reading and renting / watch this movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOLLOW <br /> <br /> My friend Brian recommended this at the same time that my aunt had sent me a clip linking this movie with Antonioni's work. In 2007, I was fascinated by several of Antonioni's films are still! To connect this movie to Antonioni, I think a bit of a stretch, the character most likely to be seen in one of Michaelangelo's films is Francoise Moitessier de Cazalet. It's fun on the IMDb page, he's not even listed as playing "Himself", which is probably a function of his long name, unlike his self-realization / renunciation. When Moitessier sails right out of the race, it can be considered a bit like Anna in L'Avventura. Although there are many things to love about this movie: The actual footage of the time, the stoic best friend, the powerful strength of the roaring jokes, I went away with a simple connection. A man, really at sea. There have been times in my life where I wonder how I came to such a point, caught between dreams and reality, feeling like a bully in my own skin. It may be that I read too much into this documentary and that the directors, in turn, read too much in Crowhurst, but I found that sensation as spelling as the other secrets held in this movie. <br /> <br /> On the odd chance that Crowhurst's wife (who seemed a remarkable study in reluctance to understandably contradicted overtones) and his children (so young in the found admission and still young at this late date in their sense of their pain and pride for their father), I'm sure the comments here and the film itself fails to catch the man your father was. In his death, however, he has given the world a glimpse of something like a lost myth, he is a pre-GPS Odysseus. Never finding his body adds the air of weak immortality, if not the size of the cosmic being, as he had written. <br /> <br /> This movie sticks with you after viewing as if you were expecting another twist to get out of the deep waters. Or at least you hope for the Moitessier sequel. <br /> <br /> Thurston Hunger 8/10
