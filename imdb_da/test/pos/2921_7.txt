Maybe it's just a personal love for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a feel for things Egyptian (I grew up visiting the mummies in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts), but I think Maltin is a bit difficult on This pretty good movie. The production values ​​are good in terms of color and filmography, and it seems that some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhes character. Victor Modne is well Victor Victor. Peter Ustinov is a pleasure to see in this type of role, which he always did so well and so witty. Bella Darvi's performance as Nefer is a classic camp, and I even find Michael Wildings quite dry portrayal of the Akenaten to have his own appeal. <br /> <br /> The historic look of the monkeys of the Akenat, a short detour in ancient theological history of ancient Egypt, is interesting as the Akenat itself and worth reading; A religious war depiction here is actually a basis. An interesting footnote about Darvi whose birth name was Bayla Wegier: she was a Polish emigre producing Darryl Zanuck and his wife Violet took under their wing (I think they might even have adopted her). Her screen name Darvi is formed by Zannuck's and his wife's first names. She continued her acting career in France, but never achieved great success, and after a rather unhappy life died alone in 1971. <br /> Overall, this is an interesting movie and fun to look after the visual values ​​alone . American Movie Classics occasionally shows this in the mailbox, which is essential to capture the reach and sweep of history.
