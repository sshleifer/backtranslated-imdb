Though the concept of a 32-year-old woman showing a 12-year-old girl may be a stretch for today's sophisticated audience, in the 1920s, what Mary Pickford's fans wanted and expected from their favorite star was. The opening scene shows Annie's tomboy character as the apparent leader of a multi-ethnic street band in cartoon "battle" with a rival group. The sight of a young girl sucked into the jaw and kicked can be a little raw, but the scene is played in such a "Our Gang" way that it would be difficult to take any of this seriously. Anyway, Annie can fade it out as well as take it. When Annie returns to her lease home and replaces her street duds with more girlish attire, it becomes more difficult (especially in close-ups) to imagine this beautiful young woman as a street hedgehog. But for those who can muster the necessary suspension of disbelief, the rest of the film has the rewards. Game between comedy (Annie's gang puts on a show) for emotions (Annie is planning a birthday surprise for her Irish policeman's father) for tragedy (her father is killed on his birthday), giving the film Mary ample opportunity to show a variety of emotions that would like her fans of any time. <br /> <br /> Of course, the necessary "happy ending" is achieved in the end; The Evildos are arrested using Annie's friends and rivals, and she is seen last in the company of her friends driving down a busy highway on a sunny day. Which is a good way to finish a Mary Pickford movie. <br /> <br />
