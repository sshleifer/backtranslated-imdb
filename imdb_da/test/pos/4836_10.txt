I first saw this movie about 3 years ago. I was shocked at how stupid the FBI was to prevent such a tragedy. It could have been easily prevented. This movie was just incredible. <br /> <br /> Now, I see it after September 11, I am horrified and can say that this could have been prevented more easily as most people would know. <br /> <br /> This movie is 100% sand <br /> <br /> In the final scene of the movie, when the mastermind of the 1st attack is taken to a helicopter prison and flies over the towers, he was a spine cooling, it was ridiculous when he said it. "Next time, we'll bring them down * BOTH *." This was actually said by Ramzi Yousef after his arrest. <br /> <br /> This movie reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were carried out just below the FBI and NYPD. It shows how the 1st and 4th changes are partly due to the attacks. <br /> <br /> I see this movie now and know that both attacks could have been prevented.
