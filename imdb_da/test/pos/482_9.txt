There are times I am convinced that The Mikado is the best Sullivan & Gilbert opera ever, but it is only as long as I am not listening to Iolanthe. Be it as it is, The Mikado is probably the most busy of the Savoy Opera. (Yes, I put the composer first. No one says Hammerstein and Rodgers or Hart and Rodgers or Boito and Verdi or What's-His-Face and Strauss. You don't even hear the librettists' name for Offenbach, Soup or Balfe. Gilbert was just the bigger name ( and the bigger ego) at the time, so they put their name first. It's time that stupid exercises were put to rest. <br /> <br /> Anyway, The Mikado is a compliment S & G operetta It has Some of Sullivan's most beautiful songs, combined with some of Gilbert's most wisest lyrics, feature an interesting book and crisp dialogue, with a wonderful degree of madness, and open the door to rich and capricious costumes. This special production, filmed in a live performance in 1990, changes its imagination into striking simplicity, seen in a British seaside resort towards the end of the Art Nouveau period, throwing over the original japonerie result is costuming and setting in an eye-catching medley of white, gray and black, accentuated by occasional pieces of red (and less frequent uses of yellow and green). It takes some getting used to, but it's really spiffy. Of course, when the choir tells you that they are gentlemen in Japan, you would have the right to exclaim: "Oh, pooh, Bah!" (Did I just say that?) It is most gratifying that this fine production is now on DVD. But a warning: The print appears to be photographed through a glass of incomplete clarity, so the expected sharpness of the image is softened and ever so fuzzy. Unfortunately, the tendency to overlay images is annoying. Why do people who make a really spiffy production lose it with artistic stuff of that kind? But that is the performance that counts most. We can skip the overture, since even if you are done, Sullivan never wrote one. (True, it may be that he didn't write anyone to any of Savoy's. But the Mikado overtime doesn't even come from Sullivan's lifetime and was compiled by observing the techniques in the others.) As for the rest of the operetta, the first-class and extremely fun. <br /> <br /> Here is Ko-Ko's estimated Eric Idle, who makes it credit. There is a tradition of bringing a big name into the role. It was an American television production years ago when Ko-Ko was played by Groucho Marx with mixed results. Idle's performance is lovely quirky ... he does "taken from a county prison" assisted by a tennis racquet. His "I've got a small list" is made like a speech to a microphone - of course it has the usual updated lyrics that are much more fun than the usual round of such things, and his delivery is positively hysterical. It goes that way all the way. <br /> <br /> In this operetta it is important to have a good Katisha; It's just not fun if you don't wavy in style. This Mikado has a fabulous Katisha in Felicity Palmer, almost like Big a Name as Idle. She bellows with the best of them in a wonderful rich contralto ... wonderful, especially for a soprano. And her costume ... !!! (Not to mention her consideration with Franz Liszt, apparently companion.) Nanki-Poo is played by Bonaventura Bottone. I have trouble getting around is something un-Nanki-Pooish lumpy short - but is voice undoubtedly a solid and rich addition to the vocal palette. There is a good touch under "A Wand'ring Minstrel", where the choir responds with distast to mentioning "his nancy on the knee" - remember Mikado's decree on flirting. As it is, Bottone is a great song actor, and if his appearance doesn't put the best face on Nanki-Poo, he does his performance. Yum-Yum (Lesley Garett) and her friends are suitably beautiful and stupid. She and Bottone make lovely duets. Pish-Tush (Mark Richardson) plays his persona as a blage watch and does it very well. Poo Bah (Richard Van Allan) is wonderful as a filled shirt out of water ... a role that was later killed in American sitcoms (you know: head butlers forced to cater for bratty kids - that kind of thing). Mikado (Richard Angas) is bloody wonderful, with an imperial voice in absolute deviation with his ridiculous lyrics. I do not recommend getting this as your only Mikado. Also get a good traditional production so you can see what Gilbert intended (more or less) in staging. That said, I will see this one twice while I see a traditional piece once. On the whole, this is a fantastic offer, a vocal and visual delight, with delicious over-acting. There is a DVD for treasure, with dervish-like girls, tap-dancing bellhops and everything. Watch for bell shops with characters.
