I played Sam (Porter, Lou's sidekick) in Film "Dead Rail", which was later sent as "Alien Express". And I have to say that I really enjoyed watching this movie. As a struggling actor, it was a chance for me to work with amazing people, it gave me amazing scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for an hour and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi ( The director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) were very kind in giving me this opportunity to participate in the production. I made many friends (Lou, Todd, Steven) and I consider myself very fortunate to have been able to work with these incredibly talented people. There wasn't a day that passed by, I didn't laugh at my ass. The real tragedy is not very special, it is that every person who saw this movie did not see what happened behind the scenes and all the talent that really went into it. The craftsmen build the set, propmasters, gaffers, wardrobe, makeup artists, script supervisors, cinematographer, production assistants, extras, craft services, manufacturers, instructors, and actors. It is a condition that Sci fi did not spend a terrible amount of money on the film (2 million). But there was a lot of time, energy and manpower instilled in it. I watch the movie now as a production that brought many talented together to a fun project that was shot without complications in less than two months. It was a magnificent cast and crew, and I'm just so happy to be separated from it! On a further note to those of you who don't know Lou Diamond Phillips, Todd Bridges and Steven Brand. They are amazing people who are incredibly fun. Lou I'm still working on my Deniro impression and can't thank you enough for introducing me to "Midnight Run". Todd, every time I hear an Elvis song, I can't forget the story, you told me to hang out with him at his house for dinner. "Can you please pass me on to you?" (IM A GREAT ELVIS FAN!) Steven, "Mr. Brand!" You are a true gentleman and all the advice and encouragement I received from you will always be appreciated. I miss you and hope you are well. Thanks for the good memories, stories, jokes and friendship. Oh, and Miss Utah says hello! shining bright. <br /> <br />
