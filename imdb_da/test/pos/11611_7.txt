Karim Hussain's dreams should be feared. When the right hemisphere of his characters overrides the left, shocking images of blood, dismemberment and various abominations are released. Religion will not save you, neither mother nature nor your own family. Hussain's dark poetry, because that is what this film really is, destabalizes all shrine institutions. <br /> <br /> "Subconscious cruelty" is a current crowd pleaser on horror fantasy festival circuit. The film's opening meditation on madness is both well written and profound. The protagonist's desire to refine the birth process, which brought him to hell, he resides, unfolds with terrible and credible illogical. From here, the film goes deeper into the subconscious and tackles the mother's nature. Hussain offers depictions of lusty pagan fertility and writhing mushroom madness. Nature is exposed to blood-drained and violent in Hussain's frightening enlightenment. "Subconcious Cruelty" is disturbing to everyone and rewarding for those who look past the shock of the mature themes of life, desire and madness exploring this very worthy film. CJ Goldman deserves kudos for his special make-up, like David Kristian for unnerving sound design and Teruhiko Suzuki for score.
