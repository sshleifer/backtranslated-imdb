If you enjoy excitement, this movie has it. The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds her misfortune and increases excitement. Alec Guiness's appearance was beautiful, but did not really add the movie. I'm not sure if Evan Richard's role as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add some humor or if he were just going to be a bumbling idiot. I thought the cinematography was excellent. This added not only to the quality of the production, but also to the excitement. The bath set with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful. Also the scene where the knife comes down and then it changes to Andy Clarke cut a very rare piece of meat, was very well done. I would call it generally good entertainment
