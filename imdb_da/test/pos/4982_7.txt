The violent men are pretty good westerners who definitely enjoy his excellent cast. Edward G. Robinson is the big ranches trying to squeeze out the smaller ranches, one of which is Glenn Ford. Ford is ready to sell to appease his fianc√© (May Wynn) until Robinson's ambitious brother (Brian Keith) kills one of Ford's hands. Then you know what happens next time. Barbara Stanwyck, together with Robinson's disgusting wife, is the kind of role she specializes in. Dianne Foster plays their daughter who is going to admire Ford. <br /> <br /> The violent men are nothing but a "B" picture with an "A" movie, but it is very well done.
