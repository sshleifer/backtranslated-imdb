In the groovy mid-70s, a scruffy bunch of brash young Venice, California youngsters from broken homes and the bad side of the city known as Z-Boys beat the former world of professional skateboarding on the ear with their hard punk attitude, radical unconventional riding style and monstrous spirit with pure aggression that revolutionizes the sport and paves the way for the many extreme variations in sports that appeared in their influential wake. Director Stacy Peralta, one of the legendary Z-Boys himself, tells the amazing exploitation of this amazing ragtag crew member in an extremely offensive and visceral way, both informative and wildly entertaining: the cunning fast fire editing, incessant fast pace and raw gritty photography delivers a hell of an infectious kinetic buzz that shows a sense of pure joy and full lively energy that is a total pleasure to see. Even better, this documentary does not sanitize or document its romantic themes: These coarse and insidious lads were so fiercely competitive and by themselves that they all went their separate ways, as the lure of fame and fortune manifested itself in their lives. The ultimate fate of some guys is exciting and heartbreaking, with gifted and spontaneous ace skateboard rat Jay Adams rating as the saddest and most tragic: he blasted his chances on time and settled the time in jail. The other dudes are also very colorful and personable. Charismatic Ball of Exciting and Threatening Fire Tony Alva is especially across as an arrogant but impressive part of furious assertiveness. Marvelously told with nice easy'n'breezy nasal nonchalance by Sean Penn. The amazing rock soundtrack also looks serious. But what really makes this documentary such a winner is its refreshingly complete lack of pretense: It is every bit as dynamic, bubbly and larger than life extraordinary as the glorious outrageous Z-Boys themselves.
