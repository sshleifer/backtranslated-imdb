The sad thing about Frontline is that when you see three or four episodes of it, you really begin to understand that it's not far away from what is happening in real life. What is really sad is that it also makes it very fun. The Frontline team in Serie One consists of Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence) - a man who really lives and dies only by the ratings his show gets. Occasionally his stunts to obtain these reviews see him run in with his Line Producer Emma Thompson (Alison Whyte); a woman who has not lost all her journalistic integrity and is ready to defend moral scrubs on occasions. The same cannot be said of reporter Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) - a reporter who has got all the substance sucked out of her - so much so that, when she interviews Ben Elton, she must be instructed to laugh. Her reports usually consist of interviewing celebrities (with whom she has or has not "crossed paths" with before) or scandalous unethical reports that are usually resuscitated. Martin De Stasio (Tiriel Mora) is the reporter that the team trusts for gravitas and dignity when he has smarts of 21 years of journalism behind him. Hans doesn't have principles as much as a nous of what makes a good journalistic story even though he occasionally draws the line. Parading over this chaos (in name), Mike Moore (Rob Sitch) is a selfish, naive reporter who can't see that he's only a beautiful face to the gruesome journalism. He often finds that his morality is compromised simply because Brian appeals to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do the rest. Frontline is the kind of show to be more of because it shows that while in modern times, happiness, security, and deep political insight are interesting things; It is much easier to assess with scandal, fear and tabloid celebrities.
