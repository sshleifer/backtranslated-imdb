We simply observe as the story unfolds without taking sides, or that we should confront any "moral" question (or of course we are, but are not the ones). Sure there were some difficult facts to face and choices to make, but it just flowed. Basically it was like any other love story, in any other life, with other sexes.

Retained. It's not about the sex scenes (or those missing), but considering that I felt the movie at its liveliest in the moments they had a good time together, it was in contrast to the rest. Lowkey is good but it's just never quite sizzled as Loving Annabelle or touched me just as much. <br /> <br /> I said highly recommend it, it is by no means a waste of them precious time in contrast to ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
