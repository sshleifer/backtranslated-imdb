Many people have got a movie they think of as their favorite movie. My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing! The main reason why this film is a cult movie is perhaps the splatter effect created mainly by genius Rob Bottin, and that this is the movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from NY). not a good movie because of the effects it has to do with the story, the atmosphere and of course the actor. I have seen thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day for the past 10 years), but no one has influenced me like this, not even the big "Das Boot". <br /> <br /> Here's my suggestion for those who like sci-fi and horror movies: Put yourself in the home on your chair. Make sure you are not interupted by anyone. If you don't have a projector, you are close to your TV and watch this miracle of a movie. Let it absorb you and you can see it in my way! <br /> <br /> Best viewing time: Last February between 5 and 9 in the evening.
