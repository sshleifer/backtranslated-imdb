This movie is a gem! It's the story of Juliette, an ordinary cleaning woman working in a yoghurt company, and Romuald, the president of the same. He does not notice her, he does not notice anyone before several plots to twist his company away from him who all hit at the same time. He is lost, no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers Juliette. As a cleaning woman, paying no attention to her, they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to address and use to help her helpless and rude boss. <br /> <br /> I watched this year for the DVD of this and to see a previous comment that it was released in September 2007, my hopes were raised. Alas, I can't find a DVD, does anyone know if there is / was one?
