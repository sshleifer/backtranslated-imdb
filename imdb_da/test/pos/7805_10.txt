There are some movies that are loved by almost everyone you come across and yet will be box office errors. Andaz Apna Apna, an intelligent and fun comedy falls into that category. For once, an Indian director has remembered the audience's sensitivity and not churned out a Kader Khan type stereo-typical hoax. The film is about two guys dreaming of wealth and trying to achieve it by awakening a millionaire's daughter. A humorous drama unfolds, while many complexities are superficial in history. The complexities add to the pure comedy of the whole plot. Aamir Khan plays a street-smart guy, while Salman Khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the stupid guy. The wild game played by Paresh Rawal, and his henchmen, Junior Ajit and "Kaliaa" make you laugh at your sleep. Although the film borrows from many other films, despite the foam camera work and despite being "loud" at times, it remains one of the scarce "funny" movies Bombay has come for films like Padosan, Golmal and other Amol Plaque film. It is sad that it did not do well in the cashier's office, because it means that the producers return to formulas and creativity is abandoned.
