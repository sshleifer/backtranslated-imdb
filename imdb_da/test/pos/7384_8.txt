I really loved this movie. I thought it was very well done. The character interaction was done wonderfully as was the characterization. The actors were absolutely credible. The plot was very deep and exciting. Although parts of it are a bit slow and sometimes a bit boring, it is definitely worth seeing several times. The chemistry between the three main players was great. If you don't want to see it for that, then see it at least for the drama between the characters. I mean, everything was just "Whoa!" It was as if I couldn't see away. The whole movie grabbed my attention and kept my interest even through the slow parts. I loved this movie and almost everything about it. I loved the end because it was so interesting and if you watch the movie another time, it makes perfect sense. But I don't waste anything.
