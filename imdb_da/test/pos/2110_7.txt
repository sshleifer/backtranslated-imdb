First I am a teenager. OK, and I have to say that this movie was pretty good. I think any child ten and under will like it, but people my age up can be a little, um, a, yes, we will describe the movie as LAME! But I liked it. It may be that I still work as a child or I visit a cattle farm every weekend, but this movie was cute. I liked how the actors were like kids, not small blonde cutesy pies, wearing three layers of clothing, a trendy hat, and about a thousand assecories (as most show today just to name a few, Drake & Josh, Lizzie Mc Guire, well any kid show.) And the setting was perfect but there was a mistake. The family was in debt, right? Why in the world did their inner house look like something out of a "western" versace store? It was a mistake. The comos are good, there are about five hundred of them, and the only explanation is that Julia Roberts is the biggest little girl's aunt. How in the world did they get everyone else? This movie seemed to be on a tight budget. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, it was fun to watch, and I thought some parts were far fetched (Like a cow selling for $ 750,000? ha! my ass a cow sells too much! ) But otherwise it was good, I liked it and I could see it again. But I would never buy it, there are not even special features on DVD! What happens to it? But rent it, especially if you have small children running around the house.
