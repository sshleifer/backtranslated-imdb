Time travel into the past is at best a topic. In this episode, a man who has thought of the opportunity finds himself on the date and location of the murder of Abraham Lincoln. He tries everything he can think of in a short time available to him with predictable results. Of course, he is considered to be very angry. He is arrested and eventually remanded to the very man he is trying to stop. Serling was bright enough to let him return to the present, but is the present the same? This is a kind of precursor to "The Time Tunnel", where once a week's travelers got the same task to overcome what had already happened. Unfortunately, the result of the distortion of time and future ignores the future. Unless you have something like Ray Bradbury's "The Sound of Thunder."
