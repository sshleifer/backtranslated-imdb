I do not understand this movie clearly average rating! <br /> <br /> I really really enjoyed it, I even stayed until early in the morning to finish watching it on slick TV <br /> <br /> There are three good characters here, good characters . Danny DeVito played a gem, a good feat considering that he was also the leader. His down thought sometimes scary character was characteristic written and was surreal in an absolutely credible way. There are people like that, Owen was right on the line without crossing it. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal's comical soul and timing sense was perfect for his role. His frustration / comedy was interesting and captivating and what more ... you could understand his feelings. To really feel that you know a character is difficult to obtain from the author's point of view, to find the right actor to pull it out is an art in itself and both were obtained here three times over. <br /> <br /> Third, who else could have played Momma? There is no one who can play this part as well. There is a style there unlike anything else you love to see, I was waiting for her to appear on the screen ... and not because the rest was bad, oh no, but because Momma's character was again line without crossing It was great to see. <br /> <br /> What's more? A happy ending with new found friendships, no one gets hurt and everyone gets what they wanted in life ... WITHOUT a big cheese tank that is tied to the end. <br /> <br /> Brilliant script, brilliant idea, perfect cast, great movie.
