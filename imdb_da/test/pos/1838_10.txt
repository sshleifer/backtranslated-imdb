Back to me is a charming gem of a movie. With an absolute star-studded cast, who can go wrong with this modern adventure? It also contains many many jokes written by the funny girl herself Bonnie Hunt who wrote and directed this movie. David Duchovny is also very good, showing another approach from his everday alter ego on my favorite show x files. a great date movie!
