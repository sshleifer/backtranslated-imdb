I can't believe how many good actors can be on a show. It is realism and fine acting that makes it a reality. This must be the best comedy ever created for this day and I love Seinfeld and everyone loves Ramond. It's just amazing and it seems everyone in my family agrees. There is no isolated meaning of mine. The whole world seems to be talking about different events and they are trying to restore them. My hat to the crew. Some shows have an actor doing the whole show. This plot comedy has a slew (8) of them. That's what makes it so great. Some people ask for health, wealth or fame. I ask that the show never ends.
