Dan Ackroyd in his primary stars such as Johgn Burns, a mental asylum escapee who, as his own shrink, travels to La La Land and hosts a popular radio chat show while the regular host (Charle Grodin in his creeping prime) takes a vacation. Along the way, Ackroyd hangs with Walter Matthau, a colleague, and the rest is pure hilarity. Ackroyd and Matthau play very well together. Ackroyd's amazing real wife, Donna Dixon, is together for the ride as yet another shrink. The ending feels a little hasty and constructed, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this movie my top rating, a 8. A lost 80's gem.
