Although this movie looks like a Crime Thriller Noir, the plot is actually a bit simplistic and with very few surprises turns or turns at all - and those that look are not exactly shocking. But if you slide out of 'intense action thriller' fashion and into 'mindless entertainment' then it is really a fun movie with several fun moments. Most of these can be attributed to the witty dialogue between Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's characters - but that said Sadie in her greeting opening greeting to Friedman, and it left little else to develop between these two characters. I didn't find these valued British actors version of the southern accents so bad (Ok, Thompson sounded like she rolled marble in her mouth when she tried to speak southern, but Rickman was surprisingly quite good with very little drop in his usual English accent ) - if you want to criticize accents - let's discuss it with Coco - she only spoke southern at regular intervals! <br /> <br />
