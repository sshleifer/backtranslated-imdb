I have to say this is my favorite movie all the time. I've seen it well over 100 times (actually had to buy a new copy due to overweight). That's what the eighties were and what a romantic story with a few morals threw in. I highly recommend to anyone who will revive high school days again. Buy a copy now it is a classic !!!!
