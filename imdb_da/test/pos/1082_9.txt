It seems to be a given, but if a viewer forgets coherence, he risks missing an opportunity for enjoyment. <br /> <br /> It is easy to carp from the high heights of the 21st century to styles and prices of Great Depression years; But the intelligent viewer will remember the magic word, "context" and better understand and thus enjoy "accidents will happen". <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Ronald Reagan again showed himself a beautiful and personal guy and again gave a fair performance. <br /> <br /> A reviewer previously said that Gloria Blondell played spooky wife, but it was wrong: She plays the concession stand's clerk who is in love with Reagan's character, Eric Gregg, but keeps his hand free as long as he is married . <br /> <br /> Gloria was sweet. Not as exuberantly beautiful as her sister Joan, she was still attractive and a good actress. Perhaps she looks a little like Joan was hurt to have a more successful career, and that is certainly our loss. Sheila Bromley was Mrs Gregg and played it well. <br /> <br /> Other players included Dick Purcell, and the great Earl Dwire was to play something beyond a crooked cowboy. Again, most of the players never achieved the "household name" status many of them deserved, but those of gosh gave good performances here in a story that is still relevant.
