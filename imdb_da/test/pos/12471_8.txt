If you are looking for a modern movie version of Buster Crabbe or Johnny Weismuller that overcomes the machinations of conscientious white safari guides or cunning black tribal people while saving the animal kingdom, this is NOT the movie for you. This is a tale of the Tarzan "legend" from the beginning on intelligent adult terms. It is beautifully filmed and true to Edgar Rice Burrough's stories. <br /> <br /> Tarzan is no action hero, but a man struck between two worlds - the natural and the civilized. In an amazing performance, Christopher Lambert depicts this fear with absolute realism. If he slides straight up, the cat will be out of the bag: The audience (especially the adult audience targeted by the movie) will laugh, and the film will completely lose its grip. It will pump into the cheesy depths. But Lambert never lets it happen. (Forget what you might think of him in other movies when I watched this movie at the theater in its original version, I thought he deserved an academic award.) The support cast is uniformly excellent as other commentators have noted. I disagree with most of them because I didn't find anything wrong with Andie McDowell's performance. I would not have nominated her for an academic award - the role is indispensable - but she is up to it as it is. I do not know why her voice was also overdubbed. <br /> <br /> The movie of the African segment of the story is absolutely beautiful. It captures both the beauty of the African deserts and the exotic expectation it holds in the collective imagination of those who have never been there. The landscape is lush and exotic, and the colors are alive. <br /> <br /> But it's also a "period" movie, and the cinematography also portrays the blessed Victorian England - the land, the city, and the interior. The costumes are excellent. The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or intrusive. <br /> <br /> There are some disturbing scenes - especially for animal lovers - but no more disturbing than a few scenes in wolf dancing. This is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature, personified in the young Lord Greystoke, convincingly portrayed by Christopher Lambert.
