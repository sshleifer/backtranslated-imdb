The 80s comedies (especially those with John Cusak) are awesome. Almost everyone is hillarious and instant classics, and this film is no exception. Lots of nods to other movies (ie Godzilla and Jaws) throughout the movie, so hilarious, you will laugh for hours. Some may complain that the movie is a bit corny at times, but hey was the 80s and things were always a bit cheesy. Throw a young Demi Moore and an even higher Bob Cat and you have a laugh party on your fans. If you haven't seen this, you will soon be !!!!!!
