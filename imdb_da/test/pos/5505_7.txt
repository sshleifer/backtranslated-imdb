A sick man Carleton Hendricks (Dee Snider) crosses the Teen Chat lines as Captain Howdy. He is like a teenage boy and invites other teenagers over his house to party. Instead, he knocks them out, strips them, sews their mouths closed and tortures them (mostly with needles). He catches the daughter of cop Mike Gage (Kevin Gage). He finds him, arrests him, and he is institutionalized. Four years later, he has been released ... completely cured. But a lynchmop (led, entertaining by Robert Englund) attacks him and hangs him. He does not die, but he snaps and Captain Howdy is back ... A very sick, disturbing, twisted horror movie. Captain Howdy enjoys pain and torture and tries to show the kids he kidnaps how to enjoy it too. Torture scenes are not as explicit (you hear more than you see), but what you see is very sick. There is no humor, and the (muted) screams of his victims sound too real. I drove off the TV during most scenes. <br /> <br /> The play varies. Kevin Gage is not as good as the policeman - he is not horrible, but he could have been better. Dee Snider is very scary as Captain Howdy - his attack scenes are not pleasant. All in all, not your typical horror movie. I'll probably never see it again (this movie really comes under your skin), but I recommend it to all horror fans - at least those with strong stomachs. I give it a 7.
