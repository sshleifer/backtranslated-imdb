'Toy Soldiers' is the story of five misfit boys (most noticeable as Sean Astin, Wil Wheaton and Kieth Coogan) trying to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the US government catches the leader's father. Lou Gosset Jr. plays the school principal, a headstrong guy who tries to instill his discipline in his students. "Toy Soldiers" is a fun and beautiful cool action, and the better of hostage-crisis-in-school movies. I think most of the appeal comes from the teenagers, but also the terrorists do not come out as completely useless, while in some movies they never seem to be the scary group they should. The prison inside the boarding school and threatened to be killed if the military or police intervene, is a very formidable challenge for this group of guys planning to save the school. They are actually quite wise also about it. <br /> <br /> I was surprised it was a pretty good movie. It keeps a steady pace and doesn't become ridiculously sentimental or anything like that. Astin and Gosset Jr. gives good performances. <br /> <br /> I also agree that this is an underestimated action movie.
