A wonderful movie about people. I first saw four friends when it was originally shown in theaters, and I have seen it many times since. If I don't see it when on TV, I come with friends and rent it. Still, the people I've seen this movie have found it fun. It's about friends from childhood to adulthood, in the 50s and 60s. It is very fun and touching that deals with first love (and first sex), racism, war, politics - the whole 60's shebang. It can also be quite dramatic. If you enjoy movies about people, this one is definitely worth it.
