Received this DVD from the ACCENT series, which is a label specializing in artificial flicks, they released Irreversible and a number of Bergman's opus. What struck me about Alex Frayne's weird movie. MODERN LOVE is that it is an impeccable movie that breathes with perfection and vision, a movie that takes us into the minds of Joe Joe on average, filled with voices in the head, visions and madness. It is set in rural Redneck Australia, the movie does not trivialize or praise the people as so many Australian films. i.e. our movie is filled with "lovable rogues" or people with "hearts of gold" etc etc etc. Not in this movie. Stanley Kubrick's spirit wings big here, it's not flawless, but has a fascinating attention to detail, a romantic stripe and a mood that spans if it's not thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Smaller strangles ... the transfer looks flawed - front credits were cut, they didn't fit in the frame. <br /> <br /> Also one of the short films is destroyed, it stops halfway.
