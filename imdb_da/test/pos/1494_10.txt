... last time I laughed so much. It is a testament to the talent of Rowan Atkinson that he has managed to create multi-layered comic strips and a clearly defined personality - without saying almost never a word. The whole success of the program rests on Atkinson's shoulders, but he wears it with ease. Despite the fact that the show only ran for one season, anyone who is vigilant in contact with the pop culture, recognizes the rubber-controlled social tard, so great is the talent and effort put into the performance. At times amazing, sometimes lovable, Mr. Bean is an innocent, unfortunate chap who also happens to be malignant incarnate. The brilliance of this character cannot be added to words you should see for yourself. <br /> <br /> The show gets too depressing at times, as in the infamous New Year's Eve sketch, or when Bean celebrates her birthday by walking alone to a restaurant and offering a self-signed greeting card and is earned an effort that he does not want. Still, there are times when you can't help feeling impressed with the inventive methods by which Bean gets out of trouble as when he disposes of this rod in many clever ways or when he changes into swimming tanks without taking his pants. off first! Whatever you react to Bean and his unorthodox lifestyle, you are bound to throw fit laughter while you see it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to point out that although "Bean" is classified as a children's program, it is just as much fun for any adult with a sense of humor. Because the more "adult" jokes will cross the toddlers and the intelligent slapstick (yes there is something) is fun no matter what age you are, "Bean" is the true definition of a family program. This is just a classic and it always shines on my day.
