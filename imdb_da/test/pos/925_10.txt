Are we allowed to disturb the lives of our fellow men? Is it possible to invade their intimacy, to penetrate the fervor of their thoughts and to violate the privacy of their own homes without being blamed? The director raises some doubts about these seemingly solvable issues, which are almost sympathetic to Judge Jean Luis' destabilizing decision to express with his own initiated self-seclusion by means of fragments of life confused by him. <br /> <br /> "Trois couleurs: Rouge" is based on the concept of "UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION CONCEIVED AS THE PEOPLE WISHING FOR AN OPEN WINDOW IN THE WORLD". The phone can be considered the main character of the story: after its performance in "Decalogue 9", it initially gives the entrance to Kieslowski's spectators, followed step by step in its fast-paced race around the world. The director looks deeply into the faculty of communication of people without considering the ethical side of the individual behavior. Once again, he points us to unpredictability for future events where we await careful descriptions of strange courses and life courses separated from each other for a significant number of years. Inexplicable combinations oddly converge in a series of continuous and disturbing situations. - Some books fall to the sidewalk. - One of them opens randomly on a fatal side, predetermining the fate of a future profession, as in a previous similar event. - Gleaming of the daily life meeting fleetingly, ideally connected with their quarrel for the fictional musician Van den Budermayer. - Human fortunes characterized by the most forged cases. <br /> <br /> In this piece of work that deserves to be seen with the eyes of our hearts instead of our minds, we can witness a dialectical play between Judge Jean Luis' Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Valentine Dussaut ( Irene Jacob, perhaps the sweetest actress of our time with the beautiful Winona Ryder) in a generation conflict between a world-old old man's experience and a self-conscious impatience of a beautiful girl at the point facing the steepest road in its ever-increasing fashion. Kieslowski talks about "dialogue tests" between a disappointed human life and a youth who is not aware of her future, between a spiritual misanthropist and a spontaneous girl full of good sense of selflessness. <br /> <br /> And the final parade when the damp smell of tragedy still lingers in the air, with all the protagonists of the entire trilogy in full documentation, rescued by an accidental stroke of thanks to the script script writer written, gives us the extreme greetings of this movie master fully used by his great passion for cinema. Only a sense of bitter regret and emptiness is left to remind us of the existence of a void that is impossible to fill. GOOD BYE KRZYSZTOF. We miss you so much!
