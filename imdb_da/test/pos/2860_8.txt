Nurse Betty is really an interesting movie. I suppose we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in a soap opera are genuine, that you can't explain them with any means that these are only actors and not spouses. "Nurse Betty" is not at all a nurse. In fact, she is an ordinary housewife who works for a dinner. To escape her terrible man and the problems of her miserable life, she has become a very dedicated fan of a soap opera. After she witnessed her husband being murdered, she went into a kind of shock and she lost all grip on reality. She thinks she's in love with one of the characters from the soap opera, a doctor, and decides to visit him and start a family with him. However, the hit men think she knows too much and goes after her to kill her. As I have already said, the subject is quite recognizable (if you leave the professionals hit the men and the murder out of it) and the movie was fun. The story was well done and the actors did a good job. It had everything I always want to see when I see a comedy. I give it a 7.5 / 10.
