I first saw this movie as a younger child. My sister had told me, and I thought it would be more of a child's movie. But it's also an incredible movie. It is true that the motive behind the film is ass, but also true, this movie will never stop touching your heart. I was only 6 when I first saw it and just yesterday 7 years later I saw it again. For the first time in a long time. Even after I knew how it ended, I knew I had seen it a billion, bizillion times I cried as a teeny weeny little baby. When I saw it a few years back, I finally got the idea and the seriousness of the movie. So I stopped seeing it for a while. But yesterday I didn't change the channel, I saw it. At the end, I was astonished at how much it still made me laugh, cry, think and, above all, believe in mercies again. I haven't lived for a long time and this movie got me out of my shell and opened my heart. This movie has not only influenced. I was also so impressed with the actors. Especially Bobby. So if you want to watch this movie for the first time, I suggest seeing it alone. With tissue. And be ready to discover your young, sweet, innocent side and the side that still has hope. This movie touched my soul as I was only 6, and even at this time trying to figure out who I am this movie, I helped to realize both what I didn't and still want in life.
