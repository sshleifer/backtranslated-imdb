Claire Booth Luce's "The Women" shows relationships with men through the women's point of view in a game, and 1939's movies that also have Joan Crawford bitch: a sign that may have been Amanda Farrow 20 years before that has no male characters. Here we see the male characters and what a lot they are. They use women as toys and throw them away so that women suffer. Ironically, the women are in "The Women", perhaps because they are all we see, shown in a less than favorable light, alternately silly and delusional, with the only "fine" (Norma Shearer) growing "claws" of the end. In "Best of all," we see the men of the pads they are, while the women are basically innocent and vulnerable. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about women jumping from things. Diane Baker jumps from a car (perhaps the most absurd scene in movie history not in the book). Suzy Parker falls from a fire extinguisher. The women in the movie jump into the workplace and seek success and love at the same time. Women will jump into the future and leave this type of soap opera in the next decade. But they would come back to it in the 80s and 90s through the novels of people like Sidney Sheldon and Judith Krantz (though their trashier works are not as good as this). The best thing about this movie is the way it looks. I love the shiny cinemascope movies from the 50s and 60s. They look so much better than the pixel-challenged home videos we've made since, especially in the letterbox version we see on TV and the DVD, with the picture so clear that you could go into it. The look of the shiny young beauties in it is also memorable. This movie probably has more beautiful women in it than anyone else. It has a supermodel, (Suzy Parker), a beauty queen, (Myrna Hansen, who was not Miss America 1954 as Rona Jaffe says in the DVD comment, but rather Miss USA 1953, per IMDb: but then what) and a Playboy playmate, (June Blair, January 1957). My voice goes to Suzy, one of the amazing beauties all the time. Her performance here is not as horrible as people pretend: they just react like people saw in the sight of a supermodel (the first real) trying to act. No one seemed to care how well she did. Her role, a seemingly secular woman who turns out to be the most vulnerable, is the most complex in the pile, and she does fine. <br /> <br /> The most touching of the movie is now the age of the female leaders at that time. Hope Lange was 27 when they filmed this in the spring of 1959. Diane Baker was 20. Suzy Parker was 26. Hope, who seemed to be Grace Kelly's heir, never made it really big and liked to be Mrs. Muir on television and, per IMDb, who settled in a "coffee table" home because she spent her money on reasons she believed before dying 72 years in 2003. This movie must have seemed a very distant and irrelevant memory to her then . Baker, always a welcome face in the 60's television (especially to Richard Kimble) and still active as an actress and actress, was just 67. Parker found "the best of all" at Bradford Dillman for 40 years before he died 70 years old that same year, Lange did. But here they are young, beautiful and ambitious for success and love, just like their characters.
