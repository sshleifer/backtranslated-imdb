I think this movie version of NORTHANGER ABBEY is actually pretty good. It is definitely entertaining. Well, it's not a masterpiece like PRIDE AND INCREASE ('95), but there are very good things in it .. especially the city of Bath setting !!! ..The Royal Crescent, the Roman baths, the fascinating Georgian atmosphere .. It is excellent. If you're a Bath fan like myself, you'll love watching this movie! The performances may sound a bit too "melodramatic", but I have the impression that this film, like the novel itself, deliberately makes fun of the popular stories of romance and terror and of the period of society. The only downside is probably the female leader, as I personally have another idea of ​​Catherine Morland's physical appearance. The music is also a bit "unusual" .. but I find it oddly acceptable, although it has nothing to do with the historical period that is portrayed. I wonder what would dear old Jane think ... :)
