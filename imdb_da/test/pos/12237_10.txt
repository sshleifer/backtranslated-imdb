I think this is a fabulous movie ... I saw it constantly from the time I was 4 to about the time I was 8 ... But seeing it resulted in many nightmares. I especially got them because of the guy who was always like "other world" and his friends. I'm 12 and I still get nightmares about it today. I can't fall asleep right now because I'm thinking about it. I love this movie, but it's so scary! I absolutely love this movie, though I have very good memories of it. Kate is very good at acting in this movie. Amazingly, I never understood it was her! I also think the graphics were very high quality, unlike what some other people think
