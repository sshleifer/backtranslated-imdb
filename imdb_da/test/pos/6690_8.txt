This movie is brilliant ...... without a doubt. Looked it a while ago after constant pestilence from family members right into their sci-fi movie (which I am not) and thought it was pretty good. But after recently seeing a few documentaries in the outer space etc. we saw it again ... and that's good. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors ever, and I really like Jeff Bridges (Big Lewbowski, blown away, Arlington Road). The film is about a patient in a nursing home claiming to be from another planet. Yes, you think ... but what if his story is so credible that even his psychiatrist is beginning to wonder if he is telling the truth. That's how history evolves with bridges that go through all sorts of emotions dealing with Prot (as he is known), working his own psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother-in-law, and his cosmological astronomer colleagues (who after retrieving data from Prot, pretty much admits that he might be telling the truth!) A fantastic movie ... you get to wonder ..... <br /> <br /> 8/10 Dave
