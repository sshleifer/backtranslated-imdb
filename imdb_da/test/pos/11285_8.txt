Begotten. The magical. Terror. The little boredom. The "begotten" is for acquired taste, of course, saying that you are not just going to see it unless your friends are real artificial movie buffs. You must dig the weird, macabre, the bizarre. You need to dig cool flicks. And you have to dig to find diamonds. "Begotten" is one of the most visually dazzling and mystifying films ever known to man. The visual part is something to see, something that no one can prepare for. But since the film is devoid of any kind of dialogue, the visual part is basically the only part .... "Begotten" is a visual movie. Soundscapes created for the film are magical and groundbreaking but still .... the sight of it .... God commits suicide in a very gory scene, since from his body mother travels the earth who impregnates herself with the seed of God and gives birth to flesh on Bone, a retarded child. She then leaves him and he is tortured by pagan beings. The mother comes back (so is he?), But she and her son are murdered by the terrible creatures. <br /> <br /> The film is about the meaninglessness of life and that we come to this planet to suffer and die and that when something dies, something else is born etc. Nihilism. <br /> <br /> The film's # 1 quality is, of course, the pictures, the setting, the haunting images, this second-grade quality .... After you When you say it should last 30 'instead of 70', they have right. Since they are not, it can be 40 years ago. '. It's just that everything happens at such a slow pace. In fact, the summary summary I have given is all that happens in the movie as no kidding. That's it .... I don't know. Glorious ... <br /> <br /> As a flame, the darkness burns ...
