I am surprised by people after such miserable movies are going to be in the top 250 or just being in the 7.0's, I thought more people would get a kick out of "Throw Momma from the Train". This was a great comedy by two amazing comic actors, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito. Together they made a great duo of insanity and obsession. Billy is a man who has just lost his million dollar story to his former wife and repeatedly wants her dead, Danny has a crazy and senile old mother who just abuses him. When Billy gives some "misunderstood" advice to Danny, Danny offers a suggestion to Billy if he kills his former wife, Billy must kill his mother. This is a crazy and fun story that can always get a good laugh. Please, sit back and enjoy this movie, people! It's a good one! <br /> <br /> 7/10
