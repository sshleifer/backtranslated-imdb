I was "turned on" for this movie by my flight instructor, and now I wonder how it was out there for almost five years before finally finding it. If you have any love to fly at all, especially an attachment to the WWII plans, this is an absolute must see, far better than the pathetic "Pearl Harbor" and up there in rivalry with the famous "Battle of Britain" filmed more than thirty years ago. There are moments when you feel like you're flying the wingman, literally killing the leader's shell caps as you roll in on a Me 109 or He 111. <br /> <br /> As a historian, this movie has deeply touched me as good for it is about the difficulties of tens of thousands of gallant poles, Hungarians, Slovaks and Czechs who fled their homeland in 1939-1940, made it to England, fought the utmost for the survival of Western civilization, and then it was left by the "us" after the war when they were arrested by the Communists in their return to their native lands. I was standing on top of Monte Cassino in Italy and was moved to tears by the cemetery of the Polish troops that stormed the mountain that the British and Americans could not take. I have also traveled to Prague (the most beautiful of cities) and studied their history. Their narrative story I think should be a lesson for ourselves today about obligations to gallant allies. <br /> <br /> But back to the movie. If you love to fly, see this. If you are interested in the plane of World War II, be sure to see it. Without a doubt, the most brutal, direct and scary fast-paced air combat scenes have ever been repeated for movies. And yes, if you are even looking for a touching romance, then it is also in heartbreaking details. Bill Forstchen Professor of History Co-owner of a WWII replica "warbird" P-51 Mustang "Gloria Ann"
