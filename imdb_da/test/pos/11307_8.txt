After all these years I am confused as to why Julie Brown (West Coast) is not a house name or a very famous comic star. She is one of the funniest women on the planet. In this spoof she takes Madonna, which is one of her favorite goals. She is Medusa, a very successful singer like Madonna, who also happens to have documentary "Truth or Dare." Julie Brown spoof Madonna as Medusa, who came from Wisconsin, Dairy and Beer. I remember the segment where she went to Wisconsin to visit her family and a grave. I can't remember whether it was parent or her pet. I remember that someone said that Medusa did nothing original. She just copied others. I have to say that I hope this spoof documentary is available on DVD somewhere. Julie Brown was at her best mocking and spoofing others.
