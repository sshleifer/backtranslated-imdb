Critters 4 is one of the greatest films of the twentieth century. The word classic has never been as expediently used as describing this thinking epic. I agree that the original Critters are the best of the series, but the claustrophobic excitement of the space station where Critters 4 is set really must be seen as being believed. I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in seeing one of the 20th century's greatest movie brands.
