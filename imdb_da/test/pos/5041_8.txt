1996's MICHAEL is a warm and winning comedy fantasy that includes one of my favorite performances from the John Travolta library. Travolta gives one of his breeziest and most sympathetic performances like Michael, an archangel whose silent existence in the home of a lone innkeeper named Pansy (Jean Stapleton) is disturbed when Pansy reports Michael's presence in his home to a "National Enquirer "-like newspaper and editor (Bob Hoskins) sends journalists (William Hurt, Andie McDowell, Robert Pastorelli) to the motel to check it out. Hurt, McDowell and Pastorelli are quite good as the rugged news workers who find it hard to accept that they have met an angel, but this is the Travolta show, and he rules as the pot-bellied, sugar-eating, cookie-smelling, loving, Aretha lovers, the bull chasing Michael, an angel who is just not what you think about when you think of angels. And you must love the stage at the bar when he and the ladies dance to the "Chain of Fools". I love this movie more and more every time I see it, and it's mainly because of the complete winning performance of John Travolta.
