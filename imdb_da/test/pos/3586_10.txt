full of surprises, beautiful, cruel at times. like life itself. leaves a question for more. The best parts are, of course, action scenes and chases. must really wonder how much work these guys put into making some scenes (whale hunting, polar bear hunts, etc.). It is a wonderful experience and not to miss anyone diving, surfing or going to the beach once in a while. the music is alluring and the story is fantastic and extremely good paced. Finally one of the best documentaries ever made and worth not less than a very respectable 10 (for its kind). Some of the footage is very cruel and is not recommended for people with weak stomachs (each killer whale footage is cruel).
