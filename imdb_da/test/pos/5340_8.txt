This scene shows how Wallace's experiment using his brain manipulation invention goes horribly wrong, creating "Were Rabbit". His desire to be a social entrepreneur is to improve society for the better. Therefore, he created a "Brain Manipulator" machine. He risked his own life to help solve Tottington's pest rabbit problem and, more importantly, to overcome overcrowding of rabbits collected and stored in his basement. Although he believed his experiment worked, it resulted in more pressure on him and Gromit to find a solution before the annual green competition again risked his life. Gromit, a quiet faithful dog and a loyal helper, finds himself constantly thinking of innovative ways to save his master, from his radical crazy inventions terribly wrong. What's interesting in this movie, trying to identify: who is more entrepreneur, Wallace or Gromit?
