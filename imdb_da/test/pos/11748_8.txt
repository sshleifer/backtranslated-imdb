Age cannot spoil the beauty of this east-west love story for me. Ignoring the famous and delightful title song and its lyrics, what we have is a dramatized biography of two remarkable people trapped in a moment of contradiction with social conformity, bigotry, war, doubt and the need for enormous courage. With Hong Kong as a background, this film tells the story of a Eurasian doctor and an American journalist who meets and falls in love with the Korean War. Like Mark Elliott, William Holden is intelligent, soft and slightly weak; Jennifer Jones is perhaps perfect as Dr. Han Suyin, who, conversely, is questionable and ecstatic, eager and hesitant. Others in the big cast include Torin Thatcher, Isobel Elsom, Murray Matheson, Virginia Gregg, Richard Loo, Soo Yong, Philip Ahn, Jorja Curtright and Donna Martell; Many of Hollywood's best Oriental actors also played less-credited parts. The script of John Patrick followed Han's exquisite novel closely; Henry King's direction was solid as always. The story of history is how unwilling He was to fall in love with Elliott, with his busy and demanding schedule as a doctor and her doubts about their future; and how uneasy he was, despite the intolerance and interference they faced when their affair became known. The film is unarguably physically busy, interesting and often beautiful as well. The hill that the lovers go to be separated from is the lovely bay where they swim towards an already busy and busy business town, large social events and ugly streets, hospital corridors and traffic-filled arteries. With cinematography by Leon Shamroy, Ben Nye's makeup and Helen Turpins hairstyles, the great work of set decorators, sound and lighting, art department and everyone involved, this must be one of the most memorable productions in a large, non-American city all over time, and one of the hardest to catch on film. But what you remember most here are the lovers, fortunately not very young, face the odds against them and judge exactly what they are - so it is as if love matters and the conditions set up as barriers to love do so does not. The climate of the affair is Marks back to the war; Then he receives his letters even after she knows he has been killed they seem to have messages from a better wold. A world where hope is all that matters, courage is the price of access to that world, and it is always summer on a high and windy hill apart and over a zone where beauty and individual desires can become the victim, fortune or brushed off by the militant forces of evil. Really, love is a very nice thing, says Dr. He; and this film stands as one of the shining evidence of the doctrine, lucent as a pearl, timeless as a Chinese proverb and lovely as polished jade put on a hard background.
