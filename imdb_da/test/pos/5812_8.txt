This was my first look at this short-lived British television horror series, but I had seen a couple of Hammer horror movies (Horror of Dracula, Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter) and thought very enough of them to give this a look. br /> <br /> This first episode was a shocker - not for horror but for whole nudity. Was this "regular" television in England in 1980? In that case, it showed much more skin than what we see in North America. There were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, a scene where a guy put his hand on one, and another scene with man a top of a woman catching intercourse. Hi, I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: a witch who had disappeared in the 17th century comes back to her old house and makes life hard for the married man. The latter, Jon Finch as "David Winter", was not much of an actor, but his wife was not bad and was a real beauty. She was Prunella Gee as "Mary". The man rightly suspected her to have an affair, and it plays a role in this story. <br /> <br /> Patricia Quinn was entertaining as the ridiculous witch "Lucinda Jessup" who returns with a significant touch in her and is happy to torment the couple until things go wrong at the end. As a man I would say it was especially fun to see the two women go there! This starts slowly, but when "Lucinda" starts to stir, it becomes very entertaining.
