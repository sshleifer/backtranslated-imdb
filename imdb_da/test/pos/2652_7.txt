A movie, above all, should be good storytelling. It must be entertaining - and entertaining doesn't necessarily mean "laughing" and that doesn't necessarily mean "light". It basically means you won't be bored while you see it. <br /> <br /> As brilliant as 2001 may be, it's a difficult movie to watch, especially for the current (video game / iPod fumbling) generation. Its slow pace and the sometimes unacceptable time it takes for an actor to perform a single action (for example, trying to save the crew member floating in space) will stretch your patience. On the other hand, the cinematography is brilliant, the film is wisely corrected, the final thought-provoking and the score ... the score is chilling, especially as the crew of the carrier approaches artifact on the moon. Boy, I had goose bids, great time. This does not happen often when I watch movies, and is a testament to Kubrick's instructional skills. <br /> <br /> It is considered a classic and many people consider it the best science-fiction movie all the time. That alone is a good reason to see it if you haven't done it yet. But just because everyone else thinks it's a brilliant movie, doesn't mean you have to force yourself to like it. You will either (like it) or you will not. Maybe the slow pace is not such a bad thing, after all. Taking your attention to something quite static and slow for 2 1/2 hours can teach you a lesson. It will surely be another experience for all those fast and fast images we are exposed to today (whether commercials, music videos or video games). <br /> <br /> I think it's a "memorable" movie. But not one, I'm eager to see again anytime soon (unless I'm in a particular mood for slow-paced movies). <br /> <br /> Therefore, 7 stars out of 10 are from me.
