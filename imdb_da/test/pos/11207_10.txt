For those who are like me and are used to watching and enjoying high-budget Hollywood movies, on large surround sound screens, this movie seems so remote. But it surprised me how close it can be to any person while I see it. It is so natural that you feel that no one wrote a scenario or nobody instructed it. You are the director and you write the scenario while you see it. For me, the time I spend watching movies is the only time I go to another world. This movie is the first test for me, showing that millions of dollars of budgeted movies, surround sound capability to go to another world are not always a must. These movies send you to another world (or maybe you get back to yourself) without millions of budget or technical capabilities. I felt like I was reading L'etranger from Camus.
