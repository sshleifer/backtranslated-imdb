I saw this movie alone when I was an early teenager in my home town in India, at a time when the only thing that fascinated me except girls was tigers. I came home after seeing it, with a glazed look in my eye that would be the blow in the movie that was friends with the tigers. What a movie and what a moment it was! The theater I saw it doesn't exist and has given way to a shopping mall. I do not know how I feel about it now after so many years and will not ruin a childhood memory by finding this movie available on DVD or something similar and not finding it interesting anymore. I have learned from past experiences that a childhood memory is often tarnished when traveling the rugged highways of life, and sometimes trying to rediscover their unadulterated past as a movie, only to find its innocent innocence completely soppy and no more welcome. And I will not throw away the experiences of a memory of this movie into the wind. I don't have kids so I'm probably selfish when I leave this movie in a sepia toned area of ​​my brain that doesn't want it on DVD. But if you are at an early age and in recent years are reminiscent of a loving childhood, try to watch this movie (if you can ever). It will really be worth it.
