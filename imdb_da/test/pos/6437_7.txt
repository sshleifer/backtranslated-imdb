I first saw this movie when I was about 6 ish - my grandmother thought it would be a nice kiddie movie to entertain me and keep me occupied .... but every time I looked at it, I had nightmares that night. Yes it masquerades as a children's movie, but even now I find it very dark in places, especially the joking music that is played every time Engagement's English wife is on the screen and her pretty hypnotic eyes and voice. The actual "evil" of the film, ie. the sharks, Mr Grimes etc. Didn't scare me at all, I always always found the whole movie pretty crazy and dark. This is of course something I can appreciate now that I am 21 years old, but it is no way to show it to my children when speaking from experience.
