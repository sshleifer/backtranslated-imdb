In 1952, Hollywood decided to reuse Al Jolson's first talking classic. <br /> <br /> This time, Cantoren's son was played by Danny Thomas. When he comes home from the army, he is expected to follow in his father's and other men's footsteps by becoming a cantor. However, young Mr. Golding something for show business. <br /> <br /> At this time, he meets Peggy Lee, an aspiring singer. She works very well, and her rendering of her favorite song, Lover, is remarkable. The film authors were wise not to join the obvious Jewish guy and non-Jewish girlfriends. If that's something, this is shining over. In his anger, to betray his promise to become a cantor, his father makes the traditional Jewish sign that indicates a loss in the family. This would not be done under circumstances of breaking a promise that would happen if among the orthodox, an inter-faith marriage would take place. <br /> <br /> Thomas does a great job of playing the cantor's son. His song is up to each other when the film ends positively. <br /> <br /> Is surprised that technical advisers did not realize that women do not wear wallets in synagogue on the Sabbath or at all during that period.
