I spent many a sleepless night after seeing in 2001. Not only because of the psychological horror (as 2001 is a masterpiece), but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity, how i see the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very deep way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke), I found myself inspired (a writer as I am) of the level of imagination. <br /> <br /> Space Odyssey is not something you can just see and see. "You have to be ready for it or it can't be understood. In fact, I don't think it can be understood at least, not at least all that It is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of its genre and still after 32 years technically impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack of 'Straight Sprag Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss and 'Blue Danube' by Johann Strauss . <br /> <br /> Take all the time you want, but in the end you should see this movie, and if it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me, it can certainly do it for you. <br /> <br /> Or maybe I'm just crazy ...
