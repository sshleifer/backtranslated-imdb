It's about time "Kate Jackson" got her credit for this movie .. I remember watching it and trying to understand it on TV .. my grandmother was lying in bed and died of cancer. I was barely 15. I did not find out years later that Richard was long dead tho .. I miss him on the other shows / movies he was in. <br /> <br /> I have a copy of VHS still tape, but it's NOT "CC'd" or Closed Captioned for Hearing Impaired & it's the only flaw in the movie that I can remember or know to date .. I haven't been able to find a DVD or VHS copy, who has subtitles in English themselves If anyone out there is by either copy on VHS or DVD who is CC'd or has English subtitles, let me know. <br /> <br /> thanks - Cofffeenut
