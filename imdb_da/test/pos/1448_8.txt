Frank Sinatra took this role, chewed it up with the rest of nature and spat it out in his way. TMWTGA is stadiumy, the end is trite, some of the scenes need a bit more cutting, but that's all. It's great entertainment from start to finish, and while you see it, you realize that Sinatra, the long-lived MOR crooner, had junkies, gangster cards and all of America's bustling stuff in his blood - he didn't teach it from a working coach. There are all kinds of direct references to keep you entertained and the (non-dated) soundtrack boils all the way. Marathon card game beat Goodfellas, Sopranos, etc. with forty years! So, didn't it believe in the book? Which movie is? And I can't imagine being remembered if Brando had been fired at it; The cold turkey scenes would have been embarrassing, rather than edgy, convincing and moving with Sinatra. No one else has mentioned the seedy, lazy, cynical police - absolutely the place on! And Eleanor Parker would have driven * me * to groom.
