This short has all the elements of a great movie. Every time I show it to friends (on the DVR), they also love it. The dialogue is so, 'right'. The action is amazing. While the effects / props were not so convincing by themselves, taken with everything else in the shot, they are professionally placed / used. The music is so scary, perfect for this kind of 'snapshot'. People who love their beliefs and thoughts are shaken at their core about what they see in this movie. Most people go 'that's it?' The beauty of the film is also skin deep. I love the fact that there are no conflicting views, no other voices, and the voices you hear agree. no conflict, but at the same time there is one. And the end made me love it more! Hard reality is sometimes more movie worthy than any plot unit, or twist. <br /> <br /> (wasn't Joshua Leonard the guy in the Blair Witch Project?) :) Films of a fictional dead guy ... amazing!
