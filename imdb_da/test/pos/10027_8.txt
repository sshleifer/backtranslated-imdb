If you keep a historical perspective out of it, this movie is actually quite entertaining. It has action, adventure and romance, and one of the premier castings tournaments of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead role. As seen from this board, the image does not pass pattern with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their storytelling. To get over it, you only need to put the page history book out and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know it's hard to do when you consider Custer's last stand on the little big horn, and it's prominent in the post church's American record history. So I suppose there is an unresolved problem with the image, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to do with here, but for the picture is two hours plus maturity. Custer arrival at West Point is probably the first main scraper to ride up as he does in full military regalia. The practical joke of Sharp (Arthur Kennedy), who puts him up at the headquarters, should have had both of them in trouble. Ironically, many scenes play in this military comedy movie, as in Custer's first meeting with Libby Bacon, and subsequent encounters involving the tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I hadn't noticed it before in other movies, but McDaniel reminded me of a horrible mass of another favorite character actor from mine from Forty, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in a scene it looked as if it could have been Moreland who hammered it up in a dress. With that in mind, the owl scene was also a hoot. <br /> <br /> With regard to Flynn, it is interesting to note that a year earlier he portrayed J.E.B. Stuart opposed Ronald Reagan's portrayal of General Custer in the "Santa Fe Trail", which both drew attention from none other than Olivia de Havilland. In that film, Reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into Custer's character, as history remembers, while in Flyn's portrayal here is more than clear. But it does not come close to Richard Mulligan's inclusion of military hero in the 1970s "Little Big Man". Let's just say that one was a little over the top. <br /> <br /> The better take away it had for me was the way in which Custer continued to maintain its good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture. He and his loyalty to the men led him into battle with the discipline he developed during history. Most poignant was the last confrontation with arch rival Sharp just before riding into Little Big Horn, where he stated that hell or glory was totally dependent on a point of view. In the past, a similar comment could have given us the best insight into everything in Custer's character when he said, "You're delighted when it's your time to go".
