I love the mockumentary format that Chris Guest and crew have developed over the years. I like this and "Waiting for Guffman" better than "Spinal Tap", which was the first of the group (and made by Rob Reiner, but star guest and several others of his mockumentary regulars). This humor is not for everyone. It is quite subtle and not too physical, so some people may not relate. However, as a dog lover (and a dog show fan), I loved this movie. There are so many fun lines in it! My daughter and I often quote them to each other. I find it amazing that these people can ad lib as much fun material for each movie! What a fun bunch they should be. I highly recommend this to people who prefer their humor on the cerebral side.
