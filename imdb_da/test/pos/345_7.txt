Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a desert home cult trying to revive one of his people just to get a heart attack himself! He ends up dying on a desk, and for the sake of vengeance, his spirit takes over the title of character (Jill Jacobson), who then continues to go about hacking and slashing until her college teachers learn what to do to practice the demon. <br /> <br /> Although I know enough about the director's filmography to know that it is primarily a direct schlock, "Nurse Sherri" is really not that bad. Sure, it is clear that this was very low-budget stuff, but all I found chewy about it was the visual effects. The action is not as bad as you might expect. <br /> <br /> There are two different versions of this on DVD. A much more sex-oriented version with lots of T&A is the original cut with such hilarious stupid vignettes as the victim and her love interest sharing their "strangest sex" moments, including an involvement fellatio during a lecture! <br /> <br /> The movie would then be circumcised to the theater version with the horror elements emphasized stronger. Some scenes have fallen with new added (with Stevens, the role that J.C. Wells plays, expanded). The movie's most memorable sequence in this cut is a scene in a foundry, and it works quite well. This cut of the movie is more interesting overall; I would recommend that a viewer see them both and compare them. <br /> <br /> Both versions take their step in the final third and take advantage of a great scene-stealing performance from Bill Roy as the crazy Reanhauer and a moody climax set in a cemetery (though actually filmed in Adamsons backyard! ). Marilyn Joi is also worth mentioning when the sweet nurse, who is attracted to the football player, became patient Marcus Washington (Prentiss Molded), who has lost his eyes in a car accident and who, incidentally, is the key to solving the story with his knowledge of voodoo rituals. The film also makes entertaining use of music from the composer Harry Lubins' personal collection, including compositions for such television series as' One Step Beyond 'and' The Outer Limits'. <br/> "Nurse Sherri" (known by several alternative titles (including "Beyond the Living" and "Hospital of Terror") than any other Adamson movie) is actually quite entertaining low cost fare. I ended up having a good time watching it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
