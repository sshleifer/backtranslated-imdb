The 1990s were a good decade for British sitcom with many popular creations such as. One foot in the grave, surely the thin blue line, British emperor and men coming to watch TV screens for the first time. <br /> <br /> But MR. BEAN is, hands down, the biggest sitcom in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> MR. BEAN represents the first major attempt at a throwback to the era of silent greats such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton for decades. It brings the audience a single character - Mr. Bean - the game perfect for Rowan Atkinson. <br /> <br /> Many people who have commented on this page as well as on the bulletin boards on this and other websites have engaged in debates on whether Mr. Bean has a mental disability or has significant learning difficulties as a result of such a disability. However, I believe that this debate is unnecessary because I strongly doubt that the creators of this show expect someone in the audience to consider, for a moment, Mr. Bean in such a context. <br /> <br /> Mr. Prayer is shown to be a sign that seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems without guidance from others. Some of his methods of approaching daily tasks such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist are approaching in a way that is bizarre with everyone who sees the show. This is where humor comes from. Mr. Bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he can just be an eccentric person who is used to handling things in his own way. And of course, some of his methods of accomplishing a single task will result in disaster as we see Mr. Bean try to solve. <br /> <br /> Sometimes we see Mr. Bean show an average or petty strip, often trying to compete with those around him or playing pranks on those who least expect it. But no real damage comes to anyone at the end of the day, and the results are always calming. <br /> <br /> Unlike most examples of British comedy over the last 30 years, MR. BEAN is simple, unofficial, harmless U-rated entertainment to suit everyone in the family to enjoy. That is why the TV series became a big hit in dozens of countries around the world. That is why it will still be remembered for several decades from now, as many other TV shows have come, gone and been forgotten. <br /> <br /> Some critics claim that the show only appeals to children, but I just laugh at Mr. Beans antics now as I did when I first saw the episodes as a child in the 1990s. Rowan Atkinson has used her natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem as fun to repeat as they did for the first time. To date, the TV series have created two spin-off films, BEAN and HR. BEAN'S HOLIDAYS. As you are familiar with the kind of humor shown in the TV series, one would expect it to not translate into success on the big screen. The two films do a little justice to the TV series and really fail to capture the magic of the episodes. The biggest mistake in both films may be in the setting. In both films, the producers take Mr. Bean out of his normal British environment in America (the first movie) and France (the second movie). As a result, the film characters react to Mr. Bean different on his behavior than their television series counterparts. Both films reuse gags from the TV series, and the evidence shows that gags were made right the first time. In the second movie, Mr. Bean shown to be out of character with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem stupid rather than funny. At various times I found myself the character I was looking at was not Mr. Bean, but a pale caricature. Obviously, Rowan Atkinson doesn't enjoy as much as he did in the TV series. His heart just wasn't in the performance. After the second movie came out, he publicly said he would not play Mr. Bean again. I realize how he felt. <br /> <br /> Back to the television series, each episode shows evidence of thorough writing and performance planning in each scene. Even the weakest episode is still very entertaining and well ahead of the two films. My favorite episodes are the first three - these set high standards that should continue. I consider the final episode to be the weakest, but still hilarious. <br /> <br /> To sum up, MR. BEAN is a truly amazing sitcom suitable for the whole family. Rowan Atkinson is a true comic genius, and evidence is in 14 episodes of this television series. My recommendation - see and enjoy. But only watch the movies if you consider yourself a die-hard fan after watching the TV series.
