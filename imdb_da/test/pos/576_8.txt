I give it 8 out of 10 because it's a cult classic. It is also directed by the legendary sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan, who also plays Jarvis in the movie. In listening to the latest blog talk radio show called the AARF show (Robert Morgan is a co-host), he tells it because it has become such a cult classic and does well in movie conventions and so is planning to do so a sequel to this movie. I think he said two of the original stars have signed, and he hopes to get a few more. Robert is a good man and I hope it's going well. He has spent 50+ years of tireless work as a Sassquatch Researcher (who is also one of my interests) and author. Check out his show on the paranormal and maybe look for Blood Stalkers II sometime in the near future.
