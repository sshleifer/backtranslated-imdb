Based on actual events in 1905, silent films THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN relates to an imperial Russian ship, where monstrous relationships lead to a mutiny. Shocked by conditions on the ship, citizens of the port city of Odessa rallies for the support of mutines - and consequently found themselves in the forefront of imperial forces attacking civilians with wild force. <br /> <br /> POTEMKIN is a film where individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members, and it achieves its incredible power by showing clashes between the groups and the crowds of a number of unusual visualized and edited sequences. Amazingly, each of these sequences manages to top off the previous one, and the film actually builds in power as it moves from myth to the citizens' rally to the massacre of the Odessa Steps, the latter being among the most well-known sequences throughout film history. The film is very much where the real events actually occurred, director Eisenstone's vision is extraordinary as he builds - not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence - some of the most memorable images ever to have been obliged to film. <br /> <br /> To describe POTEMKIN as a fantastic movie is something of understatement. It is an absolute necessity, an absolute necessity for anyone who is seriously interested in cinema as an art form, purely visual cinema at its most brilliant, often imitating, rarely uniform, never coveted. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
