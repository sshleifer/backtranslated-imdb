A good old-fashioned fly-and-revenge Western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by spraying a small black social story into his plot. Head of Mario Van Peebles, who makes it okay, the gang of misfits fleeing from Billy Zane's (apparently unstoppable) army grandwig all save themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There are some quirky humorous flashback scenes that create the heroes' character and backgrounds, a good shooting ending as our heroes defend the city from greedy white land grabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin is not bad in this cozy, rather powerful Western.
