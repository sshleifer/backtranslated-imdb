Ever since they first came to the outer banks and filmed the film (I've lived here all my life), I've been waiting for this movie to come out. And I mean waited and waited and waited for half a year for this movie and for me it was worth it. <br /> <br /> The film is different from the book, but in my eyes it is still a beautiful work as it is the book. In both, I cried, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and I smiled as much. It's a fantastic movie with a fantastic story line. <br /> <br /> It is about never giving up finding one, who will change you forever. Anyone who wants to shape your soul and awaken you to a whole new outlook on life. I have to say that it is possible to meet someone and make them change your life forever, which is what Geres's character did to Lane's. I met the love of my life and was immediately quite enchanted that I never forgot him or how infected I was with him until I 'met' him again a year later. For me, I could relate to this movie with all my heart. I think if you listen and watch the movie with your heart and your hopes, you'll see what I'm talking about. It is never too late to find your true love, good work, Ms Lane and Mr. Gere!
