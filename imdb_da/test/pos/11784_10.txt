Nothing is sacred. Just ask Ernie Fosselius. These days, everyone has a video camera, and a movie is hardly available before the spokes begin to fly, quickly write and shoot, and often sent directly to the Internet. Spoofs are hot these days and we go out of our way to ensure the filmmakers do not get out of their own self-esteem. 25 years ago, when the first Star Wars was made, it was another world. Filmmaking was the playground for a selection of few and the spoofs were very rare. Then God gave us Hardware Wars. It was shot to look cheap (or was it just cheap?) And the sound was obviously recorded after that fact. Does it go away from the experience? HECK NO! It does so well! It was raw and unpolished and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments in the original film. From Fluke Starbucker I wave around in a flashlight instead of a lightsaber (I did it when I was young!) To Chewchilla Wookie Monster, to Auggie Ben Doggies "nah, just a little headache" note, this movie is just as much a part of the phenomenon as one of the actual Star Wars movies. Rent it. Buy it. Borrow it from a friend. And Farce can be with you. Always.
