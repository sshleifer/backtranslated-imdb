One of the most amazing movies ever made. The act of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown of the leader Winner, who himself was often quoted, and said this was his masterpiece. The reason has been copied many times, but it has never been topped. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, has many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid-80s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, it is art that many generations will admire and appreciate. Although this movie has never been fully appreciated in the United States, it has found a great demand in Europe and Asia, where the film regularly appears in film schools, and it is still a popular hit in student cinemas across Europe. All in all, a true classic.
