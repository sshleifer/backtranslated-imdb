If you enjoyed seeing "Guinea Pig" - then you would like this movie! "Psycho: The Snuff Reels" is a nice pseudo snus movie with many sex elements. In fact, the effects are not as realistic as in "Guinea Pig", but it is still beautiful. <br /> <br /> "Psycho: The Snuff Reels" includes 70 minutes of sex, fetish and then torture scenes. The first 20 minutes is like a normal porn movie. Then there are fetish sex scenes. And the last one is a torture scene. The boys torture and rape girl - they cut off the legs, the hand, the tongue ... Finally, the guy beats girls in the stomach (!) And then the other guy beats him and cuts his balls. Sounds pretty sick, isn't it? :) As I said - it's pseudo snus movie. "Psycho: The Snuff Reels" is quite rarely Japanese film, and as I know, it's really hard to find it. But if you love that kind of movie, I think you can find it!
