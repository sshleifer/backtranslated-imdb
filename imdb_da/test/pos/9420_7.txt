It is one of the paradoxes of Basil Rathbone's war-time anti-Nazi Sherlock Holmes movie (Voice of Terror, SH in Washington and this one) that while the plots and settings are mostly horrible, he is so good in them. Despite a bizarre wind-celebrated hairstyle that aims to make him look younger, he blows through all the scenes with so much bite and attack that one hardly detects how flimsy the plots are. Here, he also has a great play with Lionel Atwill, who makes a wonderful repulsive professor Moriarty - a heavy kidda hook with cozy hints of sadism and depravity (it may not have been acting, children). At the climax, transformed into a lab coat to kill Rathbone's blood "drop-by-drop", he is as over-the-top scary as Seinfeld's arch-nemesis Newman. The film itself is old kiddie matinee fare, but it benefits from director Roy William Neill's attention to scenography and atmosphere. It also looks pretty sharp in the DVD's UCLA restoration - don't even think about buying another edition, all faded, chopped public-domain prints.
