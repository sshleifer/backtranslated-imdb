This was the Bollywood response to Fatal attraction and this is a classic movie in itself. Juhi Chawla was good and so was Sunny Deol, but it was Shah Rukh Khan who shot to fame as the stalker. Since then he has become a favorite of Chopra's (Dilwale Dulhaniya le Jayenge, Mohhabatein, Dil for pagal shark, Veer Zaara and Chak De India). Shah Rukh initially seems to be a villain, but then towards the end you begin to sympathize with him. The scriptures were excellent and the songs were chartbusters. My favorites are for more together and jaaduteri nazar. <br /> <br /> After the bad failure of the underrated Lamhe Yash Chopra, back with Darr. The dialogues were memorable, the ... The Church dialogue is often repeated. Since Darr Yash Chopra has cut a little. The dill for the pagal shark was poor, but he redeemed himself a bit with Veer Zaara, which was far better. This was Yash Chopra's last masterpiece.
