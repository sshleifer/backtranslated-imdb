"Edge of the City" is another movie that owes a lot of credit to "On the Waterfront". From there, NYC sites, to its score, to the belief that no matter how many problems you may be in, you can somehow correct your clock. <br /> <br /> "Edge" also deals with ideas such as loyalty and racism. In my opinion, this is where the film does not succeed as "Waterfront". In 85 minutes, the movie rushes through the establishment of relationships and ties everything up so fast that much of it seems forced and incredible. <br /> <br /> Possible Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavettes could have been further developed at the beginning. I don't think these two characters, from two very different places, would have built such a strong relationship so quickly. <br /> <br /> I think the whole love subplot with Cassavettes could have been eliminated. He is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to see. The only reason it is in the movie is that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. There are other ways they could have shown this. I would also have seen some scenes by Axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is. The play is excellent. Poitier is great in a role that is beautifully written. His role as Tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially in 1957), a man who is confident, respected and intelligent. Cassavettes, such as Axel North, seem really good for the part. Warden is great as the boss, who knows Axel's secret (although his battle scene with Cassavettes at the end is horribly placed.) Too many break-away boxes. I thought Ruby Dee was great in Poitiers wife. <br /> <br /> Overall, the "Edge of the City" is a smart movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir-style image without taking the time to build the drama . <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
