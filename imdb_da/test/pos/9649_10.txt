It's actually a very long movie. But it is pretty beautiful and a good example to show why the cinema can be considered art. A story told cannot be expected in Les Amants RÃ©guliers, but each scene tells every style here more than a hundred dialogues. Touching, different, perfect in its images and soundtracks, showing why the close of the cinema as one of its main features became the greatest innovation in any dramatic representation. Someone who is used to the kind of movie where everything is told and action is going on all the time will find this tiring. But it's worth seeing to find out other options for feeling a story.
