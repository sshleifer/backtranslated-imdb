The words "hidden gem" have never been so precise. Bad movie lovers can search all the time for the next hidden haze, sometimes come up with things like Weasels tear my flesh, but other times luck will win and you can end up with something like Death Bed, and hopefully realize it's not bad movie has It's just a bad title, and not even a bad title, but a humorous one that can throw you off, but somehow Death Bed still fits into the "bad" category. Death Bed is a true masterpiece with low budget horror that is only reserved for those lucky enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of a vision. <br /> <br /> Death Bed involves an incoherent, yet exciting relationship between a demon in bed and the sympathetic ghost caught in the portrait who only wants him to save someone from the terrible fate of being consumed by the yellow suds. Although not all that scary, considering it's a killer bed, Death Bed possesses the qualities that create successful horror. A dark, desolate mood, confusion, a creepy, subtle score and the dream quality that this masterpiece almost flaunts. Such quality or vibe usually seems unintentional. Not only is it intentional, but Death Bed is based on a real dream, George Barry, the director, successfully transferred dream to film, only one genius could perform such a task. <br /> <br /> Old manors make for good quality scare, as portraits, not sure what to do by killer bed with its killer yellow liquid, quite a bizarre dream, actually. Also this is not entirely marked by the B horror I had expected, given the title and all. Before I looked at this gothic gem, I expected something more like class Reunion Massacre, now a bad movie, if you've seen it, you know what I'm saying. After considering all of the above, I feel that Death Bed deserves only eight stars, but as it became so unclear for so long, we would say that the bed that eats deserves nine.
