Shtrafbat - Penal Battalion is a movement, and most frankly, look at the life and death of Soviet soldiers sentenced to wash their crimes with blood in World War II. You can almost call it the Russian equivalent of highly acclaimed "Band of Brothers" ministers. Shaped in July 1942 on the eve of the Battle of Stalingrad, criminal convictions were considered consumable entities and slightly horrible losses (sometimes as high as 90%). GULAG prisoners (political prison / concentration camps), deserters, soldiers caught by Germans, but managed to escape, soldiers accused of violating protocol, got everyone a chance to participate in Shtrafbat and prove that there were " Traitors of the motherland "with their lives. Those who suffered injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and reintroduced into the eyes of the law. <br /> <br /> These miniatures have a look at such a Shtrafbat, led by Tverdokhlebov - an honorable officer captured by the Germans, shot and abandoned to death. It has a colorful and varied group of people sticking to a situation from which there is no escape. The authoritative, but reverent criminal, chief Antip "Kulak" (The Fist) and his little gang of unformed criminals, a young Jewish intellectual who beat his anti-Semitic officer, father (Orthodox priest) Mikhail, joining the battalion when his parishes are destroyed in the political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to GULAGEN, but who are nevertheless willing to fight for the last time for their people and their country, all must find their courage and their reasons to live, and that continue to fight. <br /> <br /> Though set during a war, not all episodes are fighting, in fact, which battle scenes are often chaotic, sporadic, and short - which was probably the director's intention. Meanwhile, the miniseries focus on different relationships between the cast, their backgrounds, their thoughts and tragedies. A young woman's rape by one of Shtrafbat's soldiers and then his execution, execution of suspected AWOL, boredom times in March, the celebration (and subsequent consequences) of finding a German pile of food (and champagne), the moral dilemma of officials who are unable to save their husbands from their own superiors, cheat on a spouse and other situations, emphasizes prominently. The camera is unclear - it does not turn away from the invalidity of war and the human nature of ugly or human emotions. The dialogue does not censor either. <br /> <br /> The play is amazing and deep, and the script is also well written. Everything from rage, fatigue, departure, finding a scrap of joy to hanging on, becomes almost flawless. One complaint may be that some of the Russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by a person who is not familiar with language and culture. Because it is a story drama in a way, some of the terms and situations (military rank, mention of other struggles, certain historical references) can be lost by some viewers. This understanding is not necessary to be able to enjoy Shtrafbat thoroughly, but these references are a good touch of authenticity. Another complaint that could be filed is an occasional anachronism and bending of history to suit the plot, but it is honest that it is such a riveting miniseries that one is likely to forgive these little mishaps.
