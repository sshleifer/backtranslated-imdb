I was surprised to like this movie, since I'm from "check your brain at the door and have fun" movie play. But this movie touched my heart. I have friends who mentally retarded Emily. I have friends like Unialized Evie. And I've been to Evie's shoes, chasing away the opportunity out of fear and out of devotion to others. <br /> <br /> Amy Madigan's disappointment in her daughters was almost tangible on the screen and the unpleasant moments where she was trying to bridge the Gabet with Evie was raw and painful to see. And maybe I'm closer than most, but I've never seen the twist with Evie's father coming. Usually I bomb these things quite quickly. <br /> <br /> My reservations are similar to others posted here. I thought Christopher Lloyd's wonderful, sympathetic character (a very different role to him, I thought) was underutilized. What happened to him when he understood what was going on with poetry? Would he, like James, try again ??? Second, the end, as it was, seemed not to solve or do anything. I didn't expect the pieces to be picked up and all ends tied up nicely, but I felt I was left unlike the signs that there was no real healing going on here or any real healing effort was made. <br /> Otherwise exquisite and lyrical and disturbing and for some very, very true.
