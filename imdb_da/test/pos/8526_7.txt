When I first saw this on tape, about 10 years after it was released, I thought it was one of the better James Bond movies. But after seeing it around the turn of the century, I was disappointed. I think it's a little overstated because critics were so happy to see Sean Connery finish his 12-year-old hiatus from playing Bond that they didn't dare criticize the movie. I guess what disappointed me was the end. After investing two hours in the movie, you expect a less hokey, more satisfying end. And it can be nitpicking, but I was disappointed not to see the regular actors in supporting roles like Miss Moneypenny, Q, Felix Leiter, etc. On the positive side, there were lots of unique action scenes, especially early, and the two villains were interesting. I thought Klaus Maria Brandauer was the more exciting of the two because he was so low-key and saw the "good guy next door." He wasn't your normal Bond villain. <br /> <br /> This had lots of "skin" for a PG movie, especially with Kim Basinger starring. She was never an actress known to hide her figure. The language was very tame, but most Bond movies are pretty good in that department. All in all, it's a "fair" bond and nothing else. Just because Connery is in it doesn't mean it's automatically good. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan have proven that they could also play the role well.
