America's next top model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals in the modeling world who contribute to something they had not yet achieved: presents a true American next top model. Of course, it's not easy to do, so the US and the world will already have 10 top models that match and fight between them in this cruel world. But it's obvious that it's not supposed to present America's next top model, but yes, America's Next Pop Model. The show brings together a bunch of models without experience of different personalities and great personal, professional and financial problems, giving them a chance to bring a dream to life or make their life something worthy. It is clear that Tyra Banks uses everything for her benefit, she gives the dream, but in exchange for that she gets the audience and more popularity. Yet she deserves it because she is intelligent and, if I may say so, a pioneer for this kind of show. Tyra is also a great observer and knows how to give based opinions, different from other models and hostess of foreign versions of the NEXT TOP MODEL franchise. In Brazil, Fernanda Motta is, for example, a hostess and "once-upon-a-time" Top Model. She doesn't even have 1/10 Tyra's professional skills that keep Tyra Banks at the top. Tyra has professional and personal knowledge of what she says and she is a great mentor because she not only criticizes, but she points the error and teaches the right way with wisdom. <br /> <br /> The visage does not suffer from major problems, it does and fulfills what it promises during the cycles. The models that are chosen to work on the show are actually not the best unknown models across the country because Tyra Banks plays the difference and she is right because she (and also a good part of her audience) thinks that is time for modeling the world to change some equal parameters. During the cycles, she and her team make really fair considerations where the weakest go away and the promising ones have new opportunities to prove their capabilities, but must be quick to do so, otherwise they will lose it. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting thing is that Tyra also decides who should or should not win even when she is against people's opinion. She knows that the one who wins will be famous, but has very few opportunities to really be a worldwide recognized top model. Similarly, she knows that sometimes the second place is more valuable than the first, because 1st place wins the title, but secondly you do not get the title rigm. Almost she makes mistakes when she determines the future of any model during the show. After 9 cycles, the show gets a little tired with some old ideas, it's time for Tyra to change some things and lines because it gets boring and compares to the first bikes we can see she gets bored too, so she has to do it If she wants the show to live a little longer. <br /> <br /> In any case, the show explores fashion and modeling the world, but it is also entertaining for those who live outside it. It allows for some girls and also the market, and also gives great tips to those from the audience who share the same dream.
