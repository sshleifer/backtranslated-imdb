And I would have rated it higher than a 7 out of 10 if it wasn't for Barbara Hershey's seriously uneven Irish accent in Mother Madalyn's leading role. Accent came and went unfortunately as I found more than a little distracting. <br /> <br /> William L Petersen's performance in the role of Joad was outstanding, he brought the warmth and depth to the character despite a periodic hokey dialogue. Captivating and genuine, I found him quite amazing in the way he caught the character. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for the movie is quite simple, building a forgotten staircase in a church. It's based, pretty loosely I believe in a true story, and I had heard of this staircase before watching the movie. <br /> <br /> It was a phenomenal construction for its time - a liquid double helix made without nails or screws. It exists to this day, even though it is now in private ownership. <br /> <br /> ** Minor Spoiler ** Good support and Barbara die so well in all her movies and here she does not disappoint. Lots of special moments. <br /> <br /> 7/10
