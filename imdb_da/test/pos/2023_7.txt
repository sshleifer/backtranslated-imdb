So will you be a rock star? Watch this movie. You don't like rock, you say? Or are you really into heavy metal? Then put your favorite album and dream yourself away, this movie has nothing to offer. Rarely have I ever seen a movie that can portray the dream of being in a rock band as good as this. I had long hair in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and I've been playing guitar for the past 15 years or so. Do I like Rock Star? Oh yes. The music is good, not great, the actors are good and trustworthy, even Jennifer Aniston plays his part to perfection. And Mark Wahlberg is perfect as wannabe rock songs. So you know what you want. A movie about dreams becomes true, gets penetrated and finally calculates what life really is about. It's a good solid seven out of ten, no more, no less.
