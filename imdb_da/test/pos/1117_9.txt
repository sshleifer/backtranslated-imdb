A wonderful family movie and a beautiful horse movie. 75 +% entertainment. Casey, Buddy, Kelly Marsh are very interesting and lovable characters. The horses are real beauties. <br /> <br /> Have horse racing as a backdrop to show how good luck is at times, but some good remarks. Shows how children can do stupid things for stupid reasons. Shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. The very realistic depicted figures transform the film's unrealistic theme into something that everyone can relate to. <br /> <br /> Andrew Rubin puts a wonderful performance like Buddy, the sensible older brother. Something reminded me of Aidan Quinn (eyes, speech, facial appearance). <br /> <br /> Because of the seriousness, Casey makes you fall in love with the character. Sarah Blue is also nicely portrayed by Alexis Smith. Lloyd Bourdelle, the father, is played by Walter Matthau and he is the character. <br /> <br /> Although there is room for improvement in the movie, it is a very enjoyable, sensitive movie.
