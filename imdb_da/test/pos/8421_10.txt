This is a film about a six-year-old child from a village in Maharashtra (a state in India) and his grandfather coming to Pune (a city in Maharashtra) to treat the baby's eyes. here grandfather knows that the child has cancer in both eyes and that they must be removed to save the child's life. the film is about the protagonists' and their feelings and actions until the operation. The movie is not a typical clich√© Indian movie, so down expects to see songs or romance or melodrama. This is a highly crafted sensitive film that suggests silent expressions rather than over the top dialogs to get points through. witness the scene where grandfather is told about the need to remove the child's eyes. plays are amazing, dialogues heartbreaking. Your heart is going to the grandfather, who has the inevitable task of telling the child and his mother about the operation. <br /> <br /> handling the item has been excellent. The movie was made under great hardship by the director, Sandeep Sawant, who had to hit many doors to collect Rs. Six million (about $ 130,000) budget. even the final product seems polished and has decent production values. also witness the subtle urban contrast that the director shows by incorporating some random pictures of the boy's life into the village. Sawant definitely seems to prefer city life. <br /> <br /> The act of all is excellent. Amruta Subhash as a social worker is able to add the necessary human touch to her role. Sandeep Kulkarni as the doctor is great, and shows a perfect medical form. Ashwin Chitale as a child is a natural. He doesn't seem to work. Everything about him is natural and does not work. <br /> <br /> But the highlight of all is Arun Nalawade's grandfather. he is amazing in his role. mere words cannot describe his work. It is an achievement to cherish forever. <br /> <br /> Shwaas is a sincere effort to make a good movie theater. It should not be ignored just for the fact that it shows that if things are kept simple, the results can be really surprising. 10/10.
