Five minutes in, I began to feel how naff it was looking for, you have a totally outrageous hero and his overweight fool of a friend. Seen it all before, yes right. I was ready to get bored of my thoughts for a couple of hours. This is something I have become very used to ... we do not all have. Then after a few minutes of testosterone burned insults and such showed the truck. Okay the movie techniques used to make it look fast were clumsy, but who cares! The truck is amazing! But soon it is taken away again and we are back to the nerd and his overweight friend. But now I am convinced that at least it will not be too terrible. I continue to be surprised again and again by the film's wisdom. There are so many jokes at their expense, it's like everyone in the world is addressing this except the two. The mind behind makeup and effects was a genius I swear. Believe me, if you are a man you miss so many jokes in this movie, there is so much here that only one girl can understand. <br /> <br /> Brother Bob is by far the best hillbilly killer that can be found anywhere, the fact that he is stitching just adds the effect. There are of course some real dud science facts here, but that is not always the case. When our 'hero' has a nosebleed and uses the blood to lead Brother Bob to his death, now it's a nonsense. There is no way a nosebleed can be so bad and not mean a separate artery or something. I'm all with the use of too much blood, but it takes it a little too far. The incest jokes are a little predictable but fun anyway. And the way embroidery meets her end is more than classic. Overall, this film rules break out of the exaggerated melodramatic burden of horror, which we received so much in 2003-2005. The end of this move simply couldn't have been better. <br /> <br /> This is a definite must for anyone who likes their horror with more side orders of gore and attitude.
