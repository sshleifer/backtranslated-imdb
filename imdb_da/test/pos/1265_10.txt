I am surprised that Memento (which is an excellent girl) is so well-founded in the Top 250 and this one does not even appear !! What the hell is that?? To be honest - when this movie ended, my knee-jerk reaction was that this movie is better than Memento. After the euphoria of the amazing end averted, I concluded that they are alike in their expertise. I'm just confused as to why it's not in the Top 50 with Memento. I would dare guess that it is unfortunately because it is in black and white or because (again unfortunately) the characters all have British accents ... unfortunately because it is not a reason not to appreciate a big movie like this. <br /> <br /> I tell you that if you loved Memento, you'll love to follow too. Brilliant!
