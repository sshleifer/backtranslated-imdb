This story is an excellent tale of two boys doing what they can to get away from there abusive drunkard father. The "Lord of the Rings" star Elijah Wood is excellent in this unforgettable role. This film is one of the main reasons why I have not touched a single beer and will never be as long as I live. It may make me sound like a geek, but that's what I have to say. It is strange why this is not heard as a classic American tale.
