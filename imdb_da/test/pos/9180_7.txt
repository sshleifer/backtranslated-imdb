When you see romantic comedies, you know what to expect; We have seen enough of them for many years to know how they are going. There is a formula that almost always begins to become films that become popular among the genre's audience ... not always in terms of their actual quality. How to play with it and create something more interesting? This movie has a suggestion ... and it seems relatively good. Instead of just following a leadership, we are able to follow him well to help the unfortunate men who lack the attractive facade that will allow them to reveal the unseen good qualities they possess to the women they fall in love with. The reason follows Smith as he works on his self-appointed worst case; Kevin James. In addition to his help from James, we also follow Mendes, tired of men lying to get what they want (a particular scene that inspires great respect for Smith's character, that he meets such a jerk and put him in his place). After seeing Smith helping the disaster, James, we see him with Mendes ... and despite his talent to help others, he breaks up ... badly ... with her. Making a wonderful point about love and how to fall in love affects us. For a romantic comedy this mostly avoids the pitfalls (sometimes almost feeling like a villain of the genre), although the last few scenes have the sweetness and feelings of this type of movie. Whether they follow the formula, they will not be revealed in this review. The pace is quite good, it never goes really slow and rarely goes too fast. The action is great, as far as virtually everyone goes. The characters are nicely developed and come out as real people. The humor doesn't always work ... there are occasionally gags that are less than happily executed, and one or two jokes that seem forced. But for the most part, the movie was fun. I recommend it to anyone who likes romantic comedies and anyone who is or has been in love. Those who do not believe in love will have a difficult time with the last few scenes. 10.7
