I'm a 20 year old bloke from England. I'm not crying for movies. But this one moved me. I cried like a girl! This is definitely the most moving movie I've ever seen, even though the story was questionable. Joseph Mazello's little face, when he dreams of crying, made me sneak every time. How could anyone hurt such a sweet-looking child? I'm going to cry now just thinking about it! Remarkable.
