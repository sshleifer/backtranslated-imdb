Unconditional love is one of the best movies I've seen for a while. It's an emotional roller coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds up her glass and says' To Victor Fox's memory and the whole pub follows suit, I would cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor. Grace is one of Kathy Kate's best roles. Meredith Eaton steals almost every scene she is in. Rupert Everett does some of his best work unconditionally as Dirk. The kiss between Rupert and Meredith took me to another fight with hysteria. In this day and age of gay rights become questionable, I think this movie should be seen by everyone. As a gay man in my late 40's, I've seen people lose everything when a loved one dies. So kudo is for everyone involved in making this movie.
