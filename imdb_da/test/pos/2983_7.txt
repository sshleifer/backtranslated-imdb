I was in my mid-teens when I watched this movie and I was struck by the beauty of the young stars as well as the loving filmography and the simple sweetness of the story. It amazes me to learn that Alvina has recently died that Bury did not work in the film industry for almost 30 years and that both would be in their 50s. The Elton John soundtrack is incredibly beautiful and supports the air of protected innocence, as the characters experience in seclusion. I watched the movie poster, bill it as "Deux Enfants Quis'Aiment", which apparently means something like "Two kids who like each other" - the English language distributors were wise to shorten the title! <br /> <br /> Paul, the ignored 15-year-old son of an English businessman living in Paris, meets Michelle, an orphan, in the zoo. The two take what they intend as a day-long holiday to Michael's late-father's cottage in the countryside, but end up staying there for a year, isolated from the outside world. They fall in love, Michelle gets pregnant, and they have the baby alone at home. After the baby's birth, the police come to Paul's workplace and take him away. <br /> <br /> "Blue Lagoon" will think of as another movie that almost captures the temple of innocence protected in an isolated paradise. So sad that "Friends" has never been released on DVD.
