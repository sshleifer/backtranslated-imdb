You could tell from the opening opening shot in the bank that this should be a good movie. <br /> <br /> A touch minimalist in feel with a twist of retro this movie oozes style - the brilliant camera work, acting, script, and the way that the protagonist's secret life unfolds all complement each other with possibly make the best Italian movie I've ever seen (up there with La Stanza Del Figlio - albeit differently). <br /> <br /> Shame on the people sitting behind me who made it clear that they couldn't see the relevance of the slow but painfully beautiful scenes carefully crafted by the camera. Do not miss.
