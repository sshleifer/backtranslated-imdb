well-preserved documentary about a sailing, sanity and the loss of both. I remembered reading Sir Francis Chichester's story of his journey around the world when I was in high school when I watched this movie. What an adventure that was <br /> <br /> deep water tells an equally fascinating story. <br /> <br /> It takes a special person and a great sailor to make a non-stop trip around the world ... alone. <br /> <br /> This movie does a great job of demonstrating it. <br /> <br /> I love to sail and my brother runs J-30s. <br /> <br /> But I could never get such a feat.
