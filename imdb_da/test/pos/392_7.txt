Dylan and Bobby are boyhood friends and they are in love as young boys sometimes are. But Dylan has met a girl and begins to set aside these boyhood issues. Bobby knows he's not interested in girls and misses what he had with Dylan. <br /> <br /> Tell as part of the cheesy 80's pop video, some home video, some video collection, this movie tells a confusing and sad but all too often true story that comes home with many who see it. <br /> <br /> This movie brings many memories back and struck a really good chord with me, but I wish the filmmaker had gone a little further and left it on a happier note. Yes, we all love and lose, even when we are young, but there is always tomorrow, especially when we are young.
