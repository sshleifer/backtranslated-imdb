What a great cast for this movie. The timing was excellent and there were so many clever lines - several times I was still laughing minutes after they were delivered. I found Manna From Heaven to have some surprising moments, and while there were things I thought would happen, their way of getting together was anything but predictable. This film is about hope and justice. I left the sense of theater inspired to do the right thing. Bravo to the five sisters.
