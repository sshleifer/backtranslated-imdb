I like movies that show real people "Americans" and tell the truth. The movie is simple and it seems to be the good thing about it. It played well here in Norway (Amazon says above that it is USA / Canda, but the box is called "All Regions." I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played here in World Raw Views, a theater. later I ordered it.The clip was different and much better.See it and you will like it or maybe hate it.Sorry Bush loves, but this movie drives you crazy because it makes sense.Get it and hate it.Share with Everything in it But I for one stands by it. It is not for the empty minds. It is long and hard to keep an eye on, but by other view it is more sensible. I loved Owen's words and the poem made me cry.
