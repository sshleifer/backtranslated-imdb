There are so many episodes that make me celebrate the stories <br /> <br /> I wish I could choose the best. Rocko and Bill make it a weird couple who are out of help, but are able to play the victim and BS their way out of hard time just to pull Dan into their crimes. Canadians will notice the odd joke to Toronto or the federal government, and because CBC is doing a really good show by Frantics that Dan was part of, the show shot at them and in the episode "Dan's Umbrella" the CBC gets rocket over the bullets. When Dan says CBC will never waste taxpayers money on useless venture, Rocko enters the room and gives Dan back his Tape of Friday Night with Ralph Benmurgue, this show was flopped and most would not get the joke unless they knew CBC's history of making shows that people do not see or ax good shows that they see.
