Consistency is perhaps this movie's biggest problem. The movie starts out as a fast, stylish and simple fun political satire, but in its second half, the movie becomes more serious of tone, in almost Oliver Stone sorts. It is, of course, also a very serious issue, but I would say that the film would have been much better and also more effective if it had been completely finished in the same style as the first half of the film was shot. <br /> For a biography and a film on the subject of this film, the film is also quite short with just 102 minutes of running time. The movie because of this feels like it doesn't tell the whole story. Of course, following the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the following events are brought into the movie, but the film does not go deeper into it, and it does not explain much about it, which feels like a cheap way to just glorify Charlie Wilson without showing the other side of the medal. Also, the actual events in the film itself are pretty much simplified, although the story is still told (unnecessarily) complex at times. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie would only have been much better if it didn't try to be so serious at times and generally more light with its style and atmosphere. For example, the film should have been more like "Wag the Dog", which achieved a real combination of satire and sensitive political problems. Because of this incoherent style and way of telling, the performances appear to be mixed too. When Tom Hanks plays more characteristically and in a more comical way, he is just excellent. But it just makes it difficult to take his character seriously in the movie's more serious and sensitive / shocking moments. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always excellent as he is in a movie he plays in. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. Most of the other actors just seem to walk around this movie just to be in the movie. This applies mainly to Julia Roberts, whose character I found mysterious to have a clear enough purpose for the movie. She made a superfluous impression on me and is therefore also really forgettable in this movie. It's not that the movie is a bad watch, it's actually pretty good and also fun, but if the movie would have dared to be a little more edgier, the movie would have been a better and more prominent also more effective on what it tried to achieve naturally . <br /> <br /> 7/10
