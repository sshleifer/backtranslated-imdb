Darr is a brilliant movie. It is 1 of my favorite movies .SRK has made a thought sheet in the movie .... <br /> <br /> This role could not have been played by anyone else because this type of role fits only to SRK ... SRK plays a mental villain in the movie. <br /> <br /> SRK's performance in this movie is the best performance ever in ball wood. .. <br /> <br /> SRK deserves an honor and an encouraging appeal for its amazing achievement ... Juhi also delivers an outstanding achievement .. <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol looked strong and physically fit in the movie .
