Chinese syndrome is a perfect paced thriller and not slow or boring at all, as some people tend to say. The transition from one scene to another is great and the excitement built up in the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat for two hours. Jack Lemmon is fantastic, as always, when the somewhat nervous plant operator and Jane Fonda succeed in bringing some real feelings into the story. You can watch this movie as a political statement of the time, or as an intelligent made thriller. Whatever it is definitely worth seeing.
