To be honest, I don't expect much to go into 9 souls even after reading pile on high ceilings, but it was surprising I would be a great understatement. In short, I was completely gone. <Br /> The base plot is as simple as they come, nine imprisoned inmates range from a drug pusher right up to several murderers' escape from prison and go hunting for a secret stash supposed to be forged money saved by a tenth prison that burst and became turned away by guards shortly before their escape, but that is the direction that director Toshiaki Toyoda takes this simple story that is so brilliant and original, perfectly blends drama, comedy and violence that creates a truly friendly movie that deserves to be seen Not only fans of Asian cinema, but cinema in general. <br /> <br /> Excellent act, emotional, fun, violent and sometimes very surreal, it's a movie that has it all.
