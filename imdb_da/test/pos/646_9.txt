Love this little movie that reminds me of the original Japanese gem, MUST we dance? (not the overwhelmed Gere / Jlo remake ...) Luckily I found it and taped it when it was shown on a STARZ Promo Weekend, as far as I know, it is not available on DVD. I want to see almost everything with Yancy Butler (someone remembers the short-lived TV series MANN AND MACHINE ???) in it, and she shines positively on this. She makes a dance routine for a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy HOT !! Loved all the other characters in it, especially those played by Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron (where has she been all these years?). This is one of the movies I take out from time to time and always comes away smiling after seeing it. Highly recommended !!!
