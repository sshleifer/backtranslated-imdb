When I was engaged, my fiancee and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He wanted to look for his favorite magazines, and sometimes a video that got the eye. As much as I enjoyed one for him with the one the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had only seen another movie way back as there was a satellite channel called XXX (it was about a private eye that dissolved a case) that actually had a proper plot and was fun. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot. There are only so many times you can see a blond bimbo faking 'it'. <br /> <br /> This movie caught my eye and I migrated to it so he could walk the store. He noticed (how hard was it too? Laughs. I was actually interested in something, lol (!) In the video section!) And came by and bought the slightly used copy for me. We took it home and I loved it. Here was a "Porn" with a plot. I wasn't sure it was even classified as porn, but I used the word loosely. The librarian was a sign I could identify with. Alice rejected her boyfriend's progress. She was not familiar with her own sexuality and prudish in her comments. Bill went away and she kept checking books. The white rabbit runs through the library (a book if you notice it, I think (it's been ten years since I saw the movie), was by Lewis C.) and Alice, for the same reason that promotes teens running into the forest when A cut-off madman is behind them rather than following populated areas. It's the best way to get the plot ahead. Alice finds herself in Wonderland. I remember almost every detail, but I clearly remember swimming in the lake and how she was "wiped" off. I liked how they got Humpty Dumpty Up again, the size of the Mad Hatter's member was on his hat to wear it proudly, and the brother sister-in-law Dum and Dee (who disturbed me a little - again they could have been husband's wife, but I could never tell how many times I saw it). The woman at the knight who told Alice goes away and finds your own knight (What is a lovely girl like you do on a knight like this?). The part that really caught my attention when I looked at it about a year later was one of the cards (3 of hearts, I think) that looked exactly like my ex's current wife exactly! We couldn't help but tease her about being in the movie! The king of hearts was interesting and the queen was even more so. Because of the openness of the forum, I can't go into details, just say it was "orgy" based and we'll leave it on it! <br /> <br /> When we split, I was allowed to take the video - he knew I liked it - but in the time since it's lost in borrowing. Today I find another copy. <br /> <br /> Btw, if anyone could tell me I wouldn't dismiss which scene was cut from the Amazon version, I'd really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> I heartily recommend this movie to the over 18 audience. It was soft, sweet and really 70s, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> ***** out of 5. D.
