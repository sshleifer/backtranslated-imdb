Blade is a great action / thriller that keeps you trapped for the entire duration, and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would say to be his best performance yet. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything you would ask for in an action / thriller, it has lots of blood, gut and gore, a twisted, disturbed, poorly-sourced, humorous moments, but most importantly a lot good story line with lots of phrases. There is constant action throughout movies with magnificent stunts and effects, Wesley Snipe's fighting movement is amazing. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is a must see, Wesley Snipes cool, solid look makes this movie and I can't wait for the sequel 'BLADE 2' to be released next year. <br /> <br /> My IMDB Rating - 9 out of 10
