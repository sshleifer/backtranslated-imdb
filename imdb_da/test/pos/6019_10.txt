This is easily one of my favorite musicals all the time. Bette Midler comes so close to real magic on the screen that everyone, in turn, has Gypsy Lee's blustery, compassion, brave and very scary mother. She evokes a sense of desperation that is sometimes both comical and tragic, but always true and pretty. Such a charm and laugh she is actually a pioneer woman without limits. This limit has been discovered for the children. Who, in turn, must decay their own in a world ruled by their dominant mother. This particular version is, as I understand it, in its entirety including Jerome Robbin's brilliant choreography as well as the original Scene instructions.
