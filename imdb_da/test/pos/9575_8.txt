You know this movie reminded me so much about so many people I know, I think that's why I loved this movie so much. I was just laughing on the floor because this had such a serious and documented feel to it, but the dialogue is so much fun that you can't help but feel good. Basically, the film is about these crazy dog ​​owners competing for a big dog show to see who is the best of the best. Where it looks like the dogs are taking this competition seriously, it turns out that the owners are just as crazy. Megan, one of the dog owners, almost goes serial psychic killer on the hotel manager because she can't find the special bee creaking toy for her dog. <br /> <br /> There is another couple just amazing, Gerry and Cookie, this complete nerd and attractive woman who is just so lovable. At the start of the film, Gerry describes how many boyfriends Cookie had. Throughout the movie, her "lovers" see her and hit her right in front of Gerry! It was just amazing and fun to see Gerry's look. This whole movie is just a hoot and you can't stop the recognizable faces that continue to emerge. It's a great movie is just fun to watch, I would highly recommend it! Now I need to find a good way to show this to my friends who are like these couples to see the mirror image of themselves. : D <br /> <br /> 8/10
