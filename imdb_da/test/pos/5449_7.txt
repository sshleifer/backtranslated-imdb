I remember that this movie got a lot of flags from reviewers as it was new. Letterman and Leno even had objections. Letterman called it (paraphrasing) the biggest waste of movies he had ever seen, and Leno protested against the simpleton depiction of himself. But Letterman had John Michael Higgins as a guest at his show, so it seems he didn't take anything too personal. A DVD re-issue with opinions and such from those involved may be interesting, although I suspect the days when late-night talk show warfare has taken place, the nation is gone and will not return soon. I preferred Letterman imitation to Leno, but could never buy it either. They never crossed the caricature, and I never accepted them as actors. For comparison: Paul Sorvino as Kissinger in Oliver Stones "Nixon" is going to think like an imitation, which may have been ridiculous for the first few moments, but at least seemed to be plausible after the first amusement time. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the show for me was Treat Williams as Michael Ovitz. Williams's letter to Letterman was not that big, but reminiscent of Alec Baldwin's entry (and quick exit) like Blake in Glengerry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> They could have done more with Johnny's role in all this. I know he was mostly not involved in the events portrayed in this movie, and most audiences will be familiar with his reputation so Johnny Carson does not need any introduction. But more coherence about why Dave and Jay and all the comedians revere Johnny would have given this flick the substance it lacks in being a gossip. <br /> <br /> Guess I should read the book ... <br /> <Rich Little Imitating Johnny Carson, unfortunately, came over as nothing more than Rich Little imitating Johnny Carson. <br /> <br /> I'm telling you what after watching this movie and seeing either the Letterman or Leno show, all I want to do is open my Johnny Carson DVDs and watch the right thing.
