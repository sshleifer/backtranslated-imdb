Jackass number two is easily the most hilarious movie in 2006 and also hits the hilarious Clerks II. It is one of the best followers of the latest memory and beats Jackass The Movie in every way. Now this movie can be the most fun, but it is also the most offensive, horrible and utterly disgusting. You will find yourself sick several times throughout the film. I'm really serious when I say you don't eat anything before you see or under this movie, because chances are that it literally comes back to haunt you. Also keep drinking at least. You have been warned because, like the tagline says, it will make you pray for mercy. Jackass's second follows the crazy men from the hit show Jackass, Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Chris 'Party Boy' Pontius, Preston Lacy, Ehren McGhehey, Dave England, Brandon DiCamillo and Jason 'Wee Man' Acuna ( Chris 'Raab Himself' Raab is absent) as they perform the most monstrous life-treating and outrageous stunts imaginable. I don't want to tell you what the stunts are, but I will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sickly or mentally scary, and one thrown member (again not telling) will flirt with death several times in movies. What makes Jackass number two so entertaining is not the stuttering itself, but how the cast reacts to them and makes them. To put it simply, if they loved to do it and had a blast, you would too (that applies to 99% of the stamens). All the stunters are very original and 90% of them are never seen before. You will see a pair of recycled, but they are reinforced. You wouldn't think of controlling real factors in a movie like this, but it does; Jeff Tremaines direction makes the movie so much more fun because he gives guidance to the band in their comic timing, which is just brilliant from his side. He could just have sat down and slept in the whole movie (in fact, you will see in the movie that he slept through a movie), but he went out there and helped these crazy guys to make the stunts as fun as he could. I give Mr Tremaine two thumbs up for it. Another great thing about Jackass is its bonanza of celebrity cameos, and this time includes the BMX legend Mat Hoffman, skateboarding god Tony Hawk, director / actor Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers & Beerfest), actor Luke Wilson, Miami Dolphin's star Jason Taylor and director / actor Mike Dommer (Office Space). The scenes with Hoffman, Taylor and Chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the movie, as it is even more fun to see these men as part of the movie. Jackass number two is one of the most politically incorrect, morally degrading and just plain wrong movies all the time, if not the most. Despite this, it is so original and so fun that you don't care about it. You will shudder for air, laugh so hard, you cry and jump out of your room laughing the whole movie. Due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this movie, no one under 18 should watch this movie. You have been warned. I hope you enjoy Jackass number two as much as I did. <br /> <br /> 10/10 - spy
