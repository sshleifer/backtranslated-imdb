Sharky's Machine is a crime drama in the early 80s Atlanta. It stars Burt Reynolds as a dismissed policeman who is cured of stopping crime and corruption in his city. The story is about a dirty politician standing at the top of a crime ring that has burned the city to its knees. Sharky's link to reduce this syndicate is an affordable hooker that he falls into during the movie. The action sequences are well done in the early 80s, and the soundtrack / score is pretty good. The action is B-level, but it's a pretty decent movie to have in your DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Overall 7/10 <br /> <br /> Fred <br /> <br /> Buggies
