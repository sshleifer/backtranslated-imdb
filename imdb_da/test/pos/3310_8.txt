It is interesting to see how the late 1950s society is depicted in this film. Men are gloomy, chain-smoking boozers with one thing in their minds (time has not changed men so much, but "sexual harassment" has) & women are only in the workplace until they find a man and settle down. Some of the dialogue is cringe-worthy, yet it is charming in an innocent, pass√© way. I love opening credits showing a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing "The Best Of Everything" on the soundtrack. I'll jump straight into some scenes filmed at N.Y. streets, around 1959 and experience a time that I have only seen in movies and in photographs. Some scenes in this movie reminded me of Melanie Griffith's "Working Girl". Especially when Hope Lange (who is a cross between Grace Kelly & Dolores Hart) is bombed in the beautiful Stephen Boyd's apartment, he chops her in and just looks at her sleep (like Melanie, she wants to know if "something happened" between the following day). Joan Crawford is certainly comparable to Sigourney Weaver's horrible female boss unless she was extremely uncomfortable (with a soft core), but Sigourney's character was sweet on the outside and horrible on the inside. I found it disturbing how the Suzy Parker character (Gregg) started out as an independent woman with a career goal to be an actress who apparently did not need a man to complete her end. She becomes a stalker / lunatic / nut job when she lets the man she falls in love with her bananas after he finishes her. I loved the character Mary Agnes, the office gossip, with her thick New Yawk accent. If you enjoy movies like "Valley of the Dolls", you will also like this one.
