I've seen a lot of action thrillers in my life, and that's definitely one of the best ever! There are very few movies that I even consider watching several times and this is one of them. Everything in this movie is just right: Clint as the excellent leading actor, Rene Russo as her not stupid female partner (this is a very rare combination - sad but true!). Of course, John Malkowich deserves a great praise for his outstanding villain, but let's not overlook Eastwood's first mate, played by Dylan Mcdermott, which I think fits perfectly. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic - but unfortunately never released on an original soundtrack CD (shame on the producers!). The reason makes sense, and there is no loss of pace, the audience is kept constantly tense on the result of the duel between Eastwood and Malkowich. I give this 10 stars!
