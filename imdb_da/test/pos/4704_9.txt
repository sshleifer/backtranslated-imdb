This is really a documentary about the love of a fascinating character, her outlook on life and her extended family. Filmmakers spent three years tying Sister Helen to her halfway house and managed to capture so much wonderful material that you can't help but feel you know Sister Helen and her "boys". The house holds 21 recovering addicts each with a story almost as involved as sister Helens. The final scenes are particularly involved and emotional. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen's story of marriage, addiction and loss reveals a very complex sign whose hard love is at all times fun, touching and endearing. <br /> <br /> The movie is great in the way it tells its story in a wonderful part of life sequences that evolves into a story that is almost as clear as every scene was written and acted by the best. The "client's" honesty (and obvious dishonesty) is very involved when you learn about their fears and see their attempts to grow. You will never forget Sister Helen, Robert, Moe or Bad Ashish (spelling?).
