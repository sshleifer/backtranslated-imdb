Anyone who has seen Ali G before should be well prepared for the full movie 'Ali G Indahouse' <br /> <br /> Although I prefer Ali G when he interviews the rich and famous, his brand is completely from the wall comedy completely and durably also from start to finish on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters, and a ridiculous script, all making this movie a run for Ali G. fans. <br /> If you've seen him and didn't like him so avoid this movie like the plague, for it is certainly just the same; for everyone else - see it Aiiii! 10.7
