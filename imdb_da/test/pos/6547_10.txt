I saw UZUMAKI about a year ago and was fascinated. The only Japanese horror movie I had seen before this was KWAIDAN (As I proudly own the DVD, by the way), amazing! The idea of ​​a city absorbed by spirals sounds like something out of Lovecraft. It certainly reminds one of SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH, where the residents slowly turn into monstrosities (in this case giant snails). And who can forget about the washing machine's order? I hope we will soon see this available on Region 1 DVD (I see that Sundance has recently screened it on American TV, hopefully they will do it again very soon) so we can all see it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!
