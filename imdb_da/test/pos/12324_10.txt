The entire film, an artificial adaptation of one of Joyce's "Dubliners" stories, takes place on the night of January 6 (Epiphany), 1906. Most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinners (two sisters and their niece, where a group of upper class Dubliners gather for an evening of music, recitations and dinner. Although there is very little plot per se, the interaction and conversation among the group reveals a lot about Dublin at the beginning of the 20th century, when the actors of independence just started. The cast, all the talented Irish stage actors with the exception of Anjelica Huston, is universally wonderful, and you actually feel that he is a guest of the collection. The exciting final scene, between Mrs Huston and the amazing Donal McCann, reveals much about the sign's marriage. There is poignancy mixed with humor and insight, and for those who like quiet, thought-provoking movies, "The Dead" is highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin, we are doing a ritual to watch this wonderful movie every 6th January. After many impressions, it never fails me to move, and every time I record something I've missed before.
