Okay, when it comes to plots, this movie is far from credible and also a bit stupid. Despite its many shortcomings, the film manages to work - provided you turn off your brain and just let yourself enjoy it all. If you can't, then you probably won't like this movie much at all. <br /> <br /> In one of the weirdest plot of the 1930s, Robert Montgomery plays a guy living near the Arctic Circle at a wireless station. How exactly he came to a distant remote station is uncertain, but in this very lonely and isolated existence comes a smooth string of guests - even though it had been years since he had seen other than Eskimos. <br /> <br /> First, Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy come when their aircraft crash. They are apparently on their way to Montreal - how they got what is far beyond belief! Reginald is a boring and boring guy who is really worried about Montgomery when Robert hasn't seen a woman for a very long time, and Owen is constantly appalled that Montgomery is out to steal Loy for himself. As for Montgomery, it's exactly what his plans are! For the longest time you never understand why Loy is engaged to Owen - as he is as appealing as soggy bread. Soon, Loy and Montgomery will fall in love, but it is all for nothing when, out of the blue again, Montgomery's old fiance comes to tell her she is there to marry him !! Considering that for over two years she never wrote and refused to follow him. Of course, Montgomery assumed the relationship was over - but the chipper and annoying fianc√© are suddenly enough to destroy the plans made by Loy and Montgomery. <br /> <br /> How all this is solved is something you can only see for yourself. As for the film, the plot is very stupid and constructed - I cannot defend this. BUT it is also quite fun and charming, and I see this movie as a boiling comedy that is only a step or two under modern movies like BRINGING UP BABY. Stupid, small but also very charming. It is worth seeing despite not being particularly credible.
