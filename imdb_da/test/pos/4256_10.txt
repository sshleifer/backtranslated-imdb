If you get a chance to grab this lost (many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has a strange mix of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation - even hints of slapstick, but it is so strange that it wasn't just before it's time, nothing has been seen like that since. <br /> <br /> I strongly disagree with people who say the movie is dated, especially with Spike Lee's "Bamboozaled" (SP?) a few years back, which was a misfire about trying to catch the same message. (Good film, uneven script.) <br /> <br /> Robert Downy's direction is brilliant, so many of his actors improvise, the movie gets better while it goes together and the jokes change from hit or miss one-liners as forgiven Like those found in a Mel Brooks comedy, for pure non-PC 'I can't believe they just said it' fun. 'Favorite parts, the advertisements. The film changes from gritty black and white depictions of the advertising agency to beautiful (maybe 16mm) color and comes away with it. <br /> <br /> I refuse to tip on any spoilers, but if you get the chance to watch the DVD version, be sure to watch the Downey interview (but let it be after the movie.) <br /> <br /> My voice 10 / 10-- the most underrated movie from the late 60s, early 70s.
