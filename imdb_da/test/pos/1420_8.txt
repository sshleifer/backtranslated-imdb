A short time history is not just a documentary from the beginning and end of universal and reality as we know it, it is a story of man and genius known as Stephen Hawking. It is his story that reflects the history of time and change through the history of the universe. The style of the documentary / editing mode in interviews begins and ends with a quick fade to black. Almost like flashing between segments and interviews, the documentary gives you a strange feeling as this is the point of view of Stephen Hawking and not the camera's eye. Driving time is only slightly longer than one hour. It's a short story, so again its subject can talk about days and days. An interesting and proud story.
