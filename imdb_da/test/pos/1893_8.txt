I was lucky enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight. I have to say I was expecting a terribly cheap movie with poor acting and a mediocre plot. I was completely wrong. This movie was not only incredibly entertaining, but all about what I just loved. Bruce Campbell was as fantastic as ever. The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi, you know Sam's little brother. He played the hands of the mad doctor as far as possible. Somewhere between physical comedy and wise dialogue, he did nothing but shine. But I really can't ignore the magic that is Bruce Campbell. Although I thought Ted Raimi stole the show, Bruce did what he did best on the big screen. Somewhere between the outlined nasty American businessman and the tragic victim, he showed the same energy that he has always proved to be incredibly attractive to the public. The film itself was often interrupted by applause from the viewers. The audience was absolutely thrilled with every little trip the movie took. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be Oscar material, but my goodness, it was amazing. I would highly recommend this to any Bruce Campbell fan. Also, anyone who likes campy sci-fi movies does yourself a favor and see it here. Can't wait for this to make it DVD. <br /> <br /> Take it as you like .... <br /> <br /> - it fed
