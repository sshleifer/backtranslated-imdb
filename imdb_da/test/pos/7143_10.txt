Easy one of my favorite dramatic television films, in many ways beautiful yet sad, heart warming and thoughtful, this is a great dramatization of a few years in C.S. Lewis's life and his relationship with Joy Davidman. I found it to be incredibly absorbent with excellent and "realistic" dialogue and situations. It all seemed very 'right', but there were also 'magical' moments that almost left you breathing with joy. Ackland and Bloom as the key characters were excellent as was the one they support. It is one of the dramas that I find hard to criticize, simply because it is nothing to be criticized for me, it just works so well on so many levels. Highly recommended.
