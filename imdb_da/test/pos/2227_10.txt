It has been since 1972 that I watched this movie and I still remember it as one of my favorite all-time movies. I would buy a copy if it was on DVD and it is too bad, it is not. You would think that everything that was the lead of Peter Sellers would be brought back. Much better than being there and as good as the Pink Panther series. Uschi Digard had a small part for such a well-developed performer. She is a bonus in this movie. I think the medical field might not appreciate this movie as it really makes fun of the profession and it also appreciates that Sellers was never available to treat them as his bed side way also sucked did his analysis of urine samples.
