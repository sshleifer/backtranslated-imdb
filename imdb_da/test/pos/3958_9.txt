Films belonging to the "film noir" genre usually contain similar elements: a "deus ex machina" plot twist that drives the protagonist slowly into bedlam, a beautiful but psychotic girl, a beautiful but psychotic gang, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a degradation in the desert. Think "High Sierra" or "White Heat." <br /> <br /> There are lots of hard-boiled bad movies noir out there. But when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train of human life. <br /> <br /> The latter tradition is that "Blind Spot" belongs. The movie follows Danny Alton, a distressed teenager (excellent play with depth, grace, emotional integrity, and fair fame of James Franco, who plunges completely into this role), who has fallen in love with the rough streetkid, Darcy. /> <br /> From the beginning, you know this is going to be bad. <br /> <br /> Darcy invites Danny to her house. But the house is empty and for sale, and a bloody check for thousands of dollars is on the floor. Danny is robbed of his clothes and belongings, but uses the check to track down the suicidal April - Darcy's other lover. When they come to Darcy's real home, they find Wayne - a dew chasing Darcy for the money he's stolen. Together, the three can find Darcy in a dusty, worn-out motel in the desert. But it's just the beginning of the story, as plastic explosives, drugs, gunfire, a creepy burial ground, bisexual killers, and a lonely desert in the desert bring events to an explosive head in an alley outside a Los Angeles tattoo room. <br /> <br /> This movie features some of the best noir filmography I've seen this year. In a scene, Danny runs through the desert to the semi-manufactured house in the desert, where he thinks Darcy may have been taken that night by mobsters. A very long shot with sharp light effects shows Danny's arms and legs flailing, tangible fear etched on his face (visible even at this distance), dust cloud behind him as the wind whips in his direction - running over the desert apartments against the house. The loneliness, desperation, despair that Danny feels are shockingly depicted. There are many such scenes in this movie, wonderfully crafted by the experienced Maximo Munzi. This is Oscar-winning material. <br /> <br /> Editing is also just amazing. The movie contains small moments where the characters gain insight into themselves or their situation. Bits of time where memory and feeling come back flooding. At these times, fast mounting of images flashes across the screen. This is fantastic editing by director-author-editor Stephan Woloszczuk. In an early assembly, Danny describes the wonderful feelings he has now when Darcy has entered his life. Fast photos of Danny's diary flashing across the screen: the words "4 lives", "lucky" and "safe" stop immediately while page by word, the content of a human heart runs across the screen - out of focus to quickly read It's like the flood of emotions Danny herself feels. <br /> <br /> The river of images reveals something else about this movie: How beautiful Nathaniel Waters' production design is. Darcy's quonset hut home is the perfect match of high tech and slob (a tribute to the attention of set decorator Kimberly Foster). The amazing desert house scene is just absolutely creepy. The ruined motel where Darcy hides can be found in any abandoned small town in America. The horrific (and amazingly lit) burial place where the plot takes a horrible ride blends sharpness with the pothole of death hanging all over the film. (It's too bad the movie's lighting director is not credited.) This film has an excellent production concept that enhances each frame and every actor's performance. It's the fourth element of this movie that does it Take hold of you and hold on to yourself: the actor. James Franco is a great actor. Even in "Spider-Man" - where he got almost nothing to do - Franco showed that he understands human feeling as no other actor in his generation. He's not a pretty boy throwing his good looks like Brad Pitt. Franco depicts deep emotions with full force. His notions contain purely human heart. Consider the scene in the telephone booth outside the funeral home, where Danny collapses after telling April and Wayne that Darcy is dead. Smaller actors could not hold the complete emotional degradation of a human. Franco does. <br /> <br /> Shawn Montgomery, in his first film, simply blows you with his suicide performance in April. Deeply in love with Darcy, suffering from massive depression after burying alone her unborn child (after the fetus spontaneously aborting) in a perfume box in the forest, her life of luxury and perfection is now a shambles: April is one of the best - Signs of movies I've ever seen. While Danny's relationship with Darcy slowly turns off during the movie, April's nervous breakdown is revealed to the public only. Neither Danny nor Wayne seem particularly interested in her as a human being. April's despair, when she realizes Danny has also been Darcy's beloved, is exciting and powerful, though shortened by the character's complete inability to feel emotions for a very long time now. Montgomery brings to April a pathos that puts your heart through wringer. Mark Patrick Gleason gets the hardest job in the movie: To make something human and right out of Thug, Wayne. Initially, Wayne is simply one of the many violent, foul-mouthed, obsessed drug masks / pistol runners who appear in a number of films (from "Kindergarten Cop" to "Beverly Hills Cop 2"). Gleason is doing very well with what he gets, but he doesn't really get to where you feel much about Wayne. It is difficult to say whether this is Gleason's problem or material. There is a moment when Wayne (who is Darcy's brother, although neither Danny or April knows it) is reading Danny's diary and realizing the sexual and emotional connection between the two men - where you just know that Wayne is going to be homophobic at Danny's ass. But the explosion never comes. (Thank God! Trite plots are dead to film noir.) When the revelation of siblings comes to the end of the movie, the audience is pretty surprised to realize the depth of love and compassion that Wayne really felt for Darcy - so deep that Wayne accepted Danny's gay love for his bisexual brother. But all this happens on the screen. Gleason never gets the chance to build Wayne's feelings. It must have been very frustrating for the performer. The story is quite inventive, though the smugglers, seen at the end of the movie, are probably reminiscent of viewers of "Diamonds Are Forever" (yes, James Bands). A traditional narrative voice-over (which shows that Franco is as good a number as he is a physical actor) gives a great atmosphere, though it usually flows into schmaltz a couple of times towards the end of the movie (giving some accidental laughter). Fantastic sites play key visual roles in the movie. Kudos for the place scout to find such amazing buildings! The end of the movie hit me a little hasty; Not pat but a little too firm for my movie noir tastes. <br /> <br /> Now I've seen the audience either hate or love Blind Spot. Modern film audiences, exposed to the most extreme brutality and violence, often have little understanding of the subtleties of film noir. My suggestion is to take a small group of friends who do not see despair, emotional breakdown, desperation or depression as ridiculous. Take them to a small theater where they can enjoy the play about the film's vision, but where their view will not be destroyed by a lot of people who do not recognize good film noir. Get them some popcorn (believe me, they will be so enchanted, they won't end it), get them a soda, and let them be overwhelmed. Go a little bit bright and cheery afterwards, to wash the dirt and awfullness out of your soul. Because this movie is so good to make you feel, you need it restorative.
