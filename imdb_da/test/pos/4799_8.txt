"Nazarin" directed by Luis Bunuel presents an extraordinary view of religion in Mexico. As written by the director and Julio Alejandro, his remarkable collaborator, it was a movie that made Mexican cinema on the international map after receiving the Grand Prix in Cannes that year. It is a disturbing movie because Mr Bunuel is deeply into what is wrong with the church. <br /> <br /> Nazarin is at every expense a saint. This young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a seedy pension in a city. He doesn't have enough for himself, but he doesn't mind separating with a coin when a beggar appears at the window and asks for help. At the same time, in his small room, he takes a prostitute who has been injured in a fight with another woman. Andara, the woman repays his kindness by burning the room and the whole building! Nazarin is seen seen to the landscape begging for food. Andara and Beatriz, two prostitutes from his old town follow him. Nazarine's life is parallel to that of Jesus. In fact, this saintly figure makes a case of humility. <br /> <br /> Of course, Mr Bunuel had no religion in mind when he and Mr Alejandro took it upon themselves to create this movie. It is ironic how Spain welcomed him after this film was released because they saw it as Christian qualities, as in fact, it is an Avaric satire on the Catholic Church and its ministers. <br /> <br /> Francisco Rabal, the Spanish actor, makes a wonderful Nazarene. This was one of his best roles. Mr. Rabal worked extensively in his home country, but also in Mexico and Argentina. Rita Macedo, like Andara, is also excellent. Marga Lopez also makes a valuable contribution to her portrayal of Beatriz. <br /> <br /> An amazing movie by one of the cinema's master film producers: Luis Bunuel.
