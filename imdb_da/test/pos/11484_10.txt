I've seen this movie at least ten times. I do not agree with the previous comments. This is a tongue in the cheek film, and some of the actors are supposed to be stalked. Men like Paul Cowley are few and far between, women like Linda, unfortunately a dime a dozen. The sad thing here is that although similar conditions like this rarely lead to murder and hit ups, it's a far too familiar scenario. Boy grows girl, girl does not know he exists, they grow up, you see woman he fantasizes about down and out and saves her. The bottom line, she never loved him - he came together at the right time and she used him. Thomas is excellent as nerdy but adequate Paul. His portrayal is sensitive and touching. Madsen is perfect as a five-fatal. What really moved me was the last scene. Paul says he eventually cried, but not for Linda, his wife, but for the unknown girl he had seen at a distance so many years ago. And longed for .. and loved. And I loved Thomas' close-up at the end.
