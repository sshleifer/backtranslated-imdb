I have no idea why everyone hates this movie to call the garbage a travesty an unacceptable sequel is just unfair, I mean, what else could they have done for a successor then. I think it should have had a successor (Rodney Dangerfield), saying: Hello everyone should be laid and so little dancing goffer and that's what is the end of Caddyshack, though the movie rating on the first was (R) and the other was (PG) it was still very fun. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
