Both Jackie and Candice are fantastic in this movie. They are well suited for their roles and have several options for shining. Especially the way Candice says the words "Puerto Rican" is very fun as she is kind as she can be but discouraging at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, "Old Acquaintance", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They did not claim to come together, so because the movie is about female friendship, it could have been a problem. Here, the actors admire and respect each other clearly. Hart Bochner and Meg Ryan have support parts and are both excellent, especially Bochner, who has never received many decent parts in movies, as far as I'm concerned. George Cukor didn't make another movie after this, so it was a good thing to go on.
