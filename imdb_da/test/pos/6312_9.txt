This is a very visual movie. This means that the dialogue is sparse, almost to the point of being a silent film for some very long hours, starting with the opening shot. However, the poses are ruined by a stunning sound track that ranges from inconsistent, staccato beats to a haunting mix of violins, and interspersed with vowels that sound like dreams. It is a feast for the ears as much as for the eyes, one of the early visuals is a man who walks along a street, so preoccupied with his interest in a well-off woman, that he enters a lamp post: one of The consequences of love and a metaphor for what lies in the store ... A long time ago, another movie ?? Love Story (1970) - said that love never has to say you're sorry. This story turns this idea of ​​the head in a number of ways that begin with the protagonist Watch (Toni Sevillo), a seemingly innocent, long-term resident of a luxurious hotel somewhere in Switzerland. Every day, week in, weeks out, is he sitting on the same coffee table, enjoying the transient world, his cigarettes, his coffee, his loneliness? And he has been doing it for ten years. He sits, he observes, and once a week he engages in three very surprising activities that you will find out when you see this little masterpiece ... Love is explored in a different way in a direct counterweight to Titta's loneliness and reserved nature: Two older residents of the hotel are still very in love, but the man wants to die in a spectacular way when his time comes while his long suffering wife is telling him to cheat on the other guest, one of whom is watching . Now, by looking at their Twitter, their love, the man's cheating, his excuses for his wife and his whining. How? In a surprising and black-comedic way ... one of the surprising activities I mentioned. <br /> <br /> But there is no comedy, in fact, though it touches on the idea of ​​human comedy in a Balzacian feeling: the irony of life and what to do with it. That decision was made for Ten years earlier when he left his wife and began living at the hotel. He keeps in touch occasionally and it is clear that he still loves his children (now grown up) and the grief in his voice speaks volumes. But there is something more than just grief ... Such a life as Look would seem to be completely boring, of course, and it is from many perspectives. It is only when we learn what lies beneath his almost dead-like face that his horror reaches the viewer between his eyes. But not until we know that the female bartender, Sofia (Olivia Magnani), is very interested in Watch and goes out of her way to pique Look is interested in her. <br /> <br /> And then things start to rave for Watch: he gradually succumbes to her femininity and thus discovers again the consequences of love. Ironically, he finally understands what he must finally do with his life and in the most spectacular way. I know that all of the above is somewhat cryptic; But to say more would ruin the movie and the story for you. If you like Italian cinema ?? I love it! ?? I urge you to see this. The action is amazing; the soundtrack freezes the spine; the camera's work is truly innovative; The direction shows the fashion of a true artist. <br /> <br /> I know I'll watch this movie again and again ...
