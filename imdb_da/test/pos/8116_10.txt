Never have I seen a movie like this; had no plans to see it, but it was worth turning the tv channel. I'm mostly a scifi movie watcher, but I'd be more than happy to add this to my collection. It starts out as a one-sided movie with a simple love triangle and becomes so slightly different (can't tell more than that, but it involves two guys and one girl. It doesn't go as you would expect). Also this movie star Hugo Weaving from "MATRIX" and "THE LORD OF THE RINGS" in a role I would not have expected ... very funny guy. This movie plays on HER TV, but if you don't have satellite, it's worth the rent. So try it; You will not be disappointed.
