I suppose Melville intended this movie to be the definition of the cool; it has the cool access to the late 60's / early 70's thrillers ?? the same discrete quirkiness. LE CERCLE ROUGE, a bitter and fatalistic story, is also the playground for Delon, Bourvil, Volonté and Montand in defining roles. <br /> <br /> Bourvil is a policeman who in his apartment has three cats and a daily routine. Delon is a hoodle. Montand is a sick, unsuccessful policeman. Volonté plays an escaped suspicion. LE CERCLE ROUGE is of course far above a hoist film; Melville uses his techniques ?? long wordless detailed depictions of each step of the hoist, etc. But this particular act is drama far better than his other films, and it is very unlikely that they will be so much better. The look of LE CERCLE ROUGE is very peculiar to Melville, very Melvillian. <br /> <br /> Delon was crisp and cool; Bourvil brings his craft, and Montand may play the finest role in this film; His performance has an unexpected heat. On the other hand, the characters are barely done, no more than strictly necessary, and are personae. Or masks; but the depiction is inspired, economical but suggestive. <br /> <br /> Another of the films showing that Delon is a good, very good actor; And the fact that he is not a genius does not mean that he should be despised as a fourth rate actor. He is good, he can carry near a Bourvil and Montand. <br /> <br /> Only ten years. before LE CERCLE ROUGE did Melville at the end of the 50s make a dull, long-lasting, bland noir pastiche (starring himself)? And after only a decade he is in full shape with this amazing action drama. Stylistically, it is a success. <br /> <br /> Before I saw LE CERCLE ROUGE, I was not a melvillian fan; Now I think I would rather be one. <br /> <br /> LE CERCLE ROUGE is a drama ?? namely an action drama, one of the most exciting genres. Melville scores.
