As I sat in the theater, almost crying to myself in horror at the horror Ron Howard and Tom Hanks call the Da Vinci Code, I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel, there are angels and demons. <br /> <br> Hanks and Company are back to Sequel-Prequel Angels and Demons and they have learned their lesson. <br /> <br /> It is wise that everyone is much better. Aylet Zurer is very good as Vittoria Vetra, and better than the girl who played Sophie Neveau. Tom Hanks is very good as always, he is better at this though, because he is working harder to give the film the feeling that it is a thriller. I think Ewan McGregor is doing the best work for any of the players. He may even deserve a nomination coming March, but doubtful. He had convinced me right to the end. He is dynamic and faithful, but rational, and realizes that the church must put their past behind them. The smaller players also do very good jobs. <br /> <br /> Technically and visually, the film is much improved. The cinematography is much ... much better, and the visual effects are amazing. The final explosion sequence at the end is excellent. Howard does a masterful job taking you through a tour of Rome. <br /> <br /> Pac Howard does a great job this time keeping the story moving and not boring with a story reading that is considered to condemn Christianity. The movie makes you feel more at stake. In our weak minds to discover whether Jesus had children, is not as high on the list as a catastrophic explosion that kills thousands, including the Roman Catholic Church. Part of the reason I think the story is so fast paced is due to the excellent score. I can't say enough about the result. It was sometimes epic, as something from the Lord of the Rings, but sometimes it felt like a Bourne Movie, which is a lovely mix. My only complaint about this movie is that it is ridiculously far-fetched. Chancelengo's chances of being Ewan McGregor's age are very unlikely, and the chances of a cardinal with an adopted son being elected pope are even more ridiculous. Not to mention the entire Antimatter case, which has not yet been created, and Dan Brown wrote the book in 2003 ... Overall Angels and Demons are much tighter knits, faster, more exciting and more important movies than the Da Vinci Code. This is a must see thriller for anyone who loves history and mystery combined into one.
