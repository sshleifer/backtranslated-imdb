Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy. The film clearly supports "it takes a village to raise a child" and recalls an important time in black history and culture. I got incredible respect for Macy Gray as an actress. Her character was a little crazy, yet lovable; We have clearly known someone as Macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely wonderful as Nanny. I never understood Epatha was such a great actress. Law and order never showed the depth of Epatha's behaviors as Lackawanna Blues. I was pleasantly surprised and amazed! The music and the characters reminded me of my own childhood ... it was a sweet nostalgic walk down memory. I really enjoyed the movie and eagerly await the DVD release to add to my collection.
