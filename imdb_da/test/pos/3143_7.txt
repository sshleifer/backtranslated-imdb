Perry Mason: Case of the Fatal Fashion finds Perry and Della Street in New York getting a prize from the American Bar Association. An unbeaten trial should get some recognition that I would think. A friend of Della's fashion editor Diana Muldaur is even arrested for the murder of a rival, Valerie Harper and indeed Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale witnessing a confrontation between the two at a beautiful dining room. <br /> <br /> These two rivals have one thing that makes Hedda and Louella look like schoolgirls. Of course, Harper has a number of other people who loved her just as much. <br /> <br /> The same perpetrator also killed a fashion designer who could have exposed the individual. This throws Perry with his faithful investigating lawyer, William Moses in an alliance with some mobsters. Seems the designer was a cousin of a mobster who also likes to measure some justice in their usual way. <br /> <br /> One thing I could not get is when Moses and mobster Robert Clohessy trace the offender, I can't believe the police didn't forcefully persecute the case either. Of course, Clohessy has access to sources the police just don't have. <br /> <br /> But the best part of this particular Mason entry is Scott Baio as the young man full of his lawyer who introduces himself to Raymond Burr says how he studied all his cases and looked forward to beat him. Foolish Boy. <br /> <br /> In fact, my favorite scene is Burr and Baio on a sidebar with the judge. Baio wanted to reopen his case and give a witness and come clear and prepared with precedents. Burr catches him vaguely and says he has no objection to the new witness and then continues to demolish the test of cross-examination. Absolutely invaluable. <br /> <br /> Scott Baio is the best thing in this Perry Mason movie and it should be seen for him alone if nothing else.
