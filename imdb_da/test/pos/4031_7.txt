This movie is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien movie (which is excellent). It borrows the most important premise - a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the movie trying to find his killer. But I like the authors choosing an English professor, instead of a private cock, as the main character. The reason is also quite original. Generally, the film moves fast enough to keep you awake. But what March this movie is a strangely dated quality about it (probably because of the terrible 80's original music score) combined with an affected "noir" feel. Dennis Quaid laughs inexplicably across the film at odd moments, but he is still convincing in a general way. Meg Ryan is fine as the student helps / love interest. When the movie gets bad, it is when Dex (the Prophet) meets the British bodyguard / driver and their duels are quite ridiculous. The bodyguard works for the rich widow (played by lovely Charlotte Rampling), but these scenes are too self-conscious "noir" to help the movie together, although the family "plot line" is quite interesting. Dex also keeps up with the same place and finds this bodyguard, which is pretty random. In the last part of the movie a man is shot by a window, and from the outside you see him jumping out of it - it was pretty bad. But apart from some of these obvious shortcomings, I still think it's ok. I certainly did not predict the end, so it was good - there is a twist, and although some posters here believe they were misled, I thought it was a fine and credible ending. Dennis Quaid, with his odd smirks and black eyes, is more sympathetic in The Right Stuff, Great Balls of Fire, Inner Space and Cold Creek Manor. But here as Dex, he should be something of a jerk, so he did fine. Really decent movie.
