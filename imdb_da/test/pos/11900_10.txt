This movie was one I have been expecting to see for some time. I was happy to find it has been everything I expected. The writer of this film has been so finely crafted and researched far beyond what is seen by the audience. I found it fun that so many people are not looking at will not read between some very important lines, but if not, the movie will make sense in another way and is very brilliant. The film has many stories and characters interwoven around this one Character Kilo, a man who has risen from the streets in the midst of many creepy and becomes a very powerful criminal. After some time in prison, Kilo finds a loophole in the justice system and through a disturbing event is released only to find everything that is not at all what it seems. Kilo finds herself moving towards the higher kingdom and political kingdom of society to clarify how important a person's word is and stands for. A war begins as the street is in arms against gentlemen of wealth and corrupt power. <br /> <br /> Building explosive and powerful non stop twists. This movie will leave you riveted. I found the draft of this movie to be excellent and is not a movie to be ignored. Excellent. Go rent it today !!
