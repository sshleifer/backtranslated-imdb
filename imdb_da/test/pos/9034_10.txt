Hi there; I just want to say how much I enjoyed your review and comments on the excellent movie 'Intrusion of the Dust'. I think the points you made were insightful, intelligent and completely valid. It is also a shame that this movie hardly ever appears on television these days and that it is not available on DVD region 2 - I live in England. once again many thanks for your review. actor juano hernandez was in another brilliant movie, "young man with a horn" who also star kirk douglas and lauren bacall. It was a very evocative and stylish movie with outstanding music. I want a person with influence to release the entire back catalog of movies like 'johnny belinda', 'I remember mama' and 'the yearling' on DVD region 2, we love these movies in the UK. I'm not at retirement age, I'm still pretty young and my family and I love classic movies !! Movies like these were so beautifully made and they bring back wonderful memories. Nevertheless...! many thanks for your comments!
