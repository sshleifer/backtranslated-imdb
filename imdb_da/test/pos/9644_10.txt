The crew of an American submarine discovers that it is HELL en route while struggling in the Adriatic in 1918. Although it is almost forgotten, this excellent war film still delivers solid entertainment, thanks to a scrumptious script, superior performances and highly credible action scenes. <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery & Walter Huston play submarine officers under war stress, which are rapidly in opposition to each other with dramatic and tragic results. When Montgomery is in love with Houston's daughter, Madge Evans, in a well-functioning role, the situation becomes even more complicated, both on land and under the waves. The viewer is torn between the two strong signs, one of which is controlled by his heart and the other by the rules. <br /> <br /> Robert Young makes an effective appearance as Montgomery's friend. Sterling Holloway creates a short, vibrant portrait of a doomed sailor. <br /> <br /> Eugene Pallette as the torpedo champion and Jimmy Durante as the underworld chef makes it a very fun comedy team and gives the story lots of laughs. Durante's nose comes in for lots of ribbing, and his obsession with amateur dentists leads to some chaotic encounters with British thugs. <br /> <br /> Movie Mavens will recognize Babe London as an overweight Italian lady; Maude Eburne as wife of a British admiral and Paul Porcasi as an Italian admiral - all without claim. <br /> <br /> MGM has provided the film with absolutely superior production values, with the underwater sequences being particularly well-produced. Both the ship's claustrophobic compactness and the inevitable tension associated with the submarine war are accurately depicted. Other moments of unexpected drama (Montgomery & Miss Evans caught on top of a stable ferris wheel during an air strike) and hilarity (Durante boxing a kangaroo) are professionally threaded in the film's fabric to provide a completely satisfying experience.
