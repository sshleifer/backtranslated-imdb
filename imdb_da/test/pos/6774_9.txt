THE GREEN BUTCHERS (Anders Thomas Jensen - Denmark 2003). How do the Danes keep up with these films, which are consistently fun, sharply written, exquisitely filmed and filled with good performances? THE GREEN BUTCHERS are a dark and wickedly fun comedy, in many ways the Danish counterpart of EATING RAOUL and DELICATESSEN, but it has more to offer than just laughing or parody. <br /> <br /> The film brings us the duo of chronic pothead Bjarne (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) and chronic sweat Svend (Mads Mikkelsen). Sick of their evil boss decides the two friends to open their own butcher shop in a small Danish town, but initially the business is slow and the customers get away. When an electrician accidentally unlocks and freezes in their flesh, Svend decides to turn man's thighs to fillets he immediately calls "chickie-wickies". This particular bowl suddenly has everyone in town flocking to their counter and Svend - unable to resist this sudden jump in popularity - turns into a serial killer with Bjarne, acting as his reluctant accomplice. But soon led by their former boss, many people in the city begin to wonder about the special ingredients the two men use. <br /> <br /> Without the extraordinary notions of Kaas and Mikkelsen, the movie may not have risen above the level of average black comedy. On paper, Svend's character may perhaps hit on caricature, but Mads Mikkelsen's portrait is for a serious, insecure and deeply twisted man, but Mikkelsen manages to make him scary, funny and moving at the same time. Kaas actually plays a double role and also plays his comatose twin brother Eigil. When I saw the movie, I never understood that it was the same actor. The other performances are just as wonderful with all the characters in town refreshing outside with some truly wonderful vignettes. The subject material is - naturally - a little bit morbid and the material may not be quite fresh considering few predecessors who treated the same kind of material, but director Jensen gives it a new twist and manages to build some real characters with Svend and Bjarne's strange duo with this wonderful bizarre tale of two social misfits. /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
