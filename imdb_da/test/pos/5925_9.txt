Every year there is a non-missed, highly anticipated, red-hot big-budget title with the right combination of star, director and topic that goes wrong in the cashier's office. This year it was Superman Returns. In 1982, it was Blade Runner. In 1957, it was Billy Wilders St. Louis Spirit, a movie that had everything - senior director, great star, best-selling true story of an American hero - except enough of an audience to cover its costs. Perhaps the public still remembered Lucky Lindy's anti-Semitism and his high admiration for Nazi Germany's pre-war performances (also not covered by the film ending with his arrival in Paris before the legend became too disgraceful). Maybe because they thought they knew the story or that it was just a guy stuck in a cockpit for two hours. Visser Wilder and co-author Wendell Mayes are aware of the dramatic pitfalls of Lindbergh's relatively insignificant flight, which changes between a well-executed flashback structure to key points in his life and the building of the flight itself. When the film is airborne, it is both surprising and exciting to find true drama in his attempt to stay awake and to navigate without proper instruments. It also builds up a quite remarkable sense of fear, unlike anything else in Wilder's filmography, allied to a true sense of the epic: shot as the vicious storm clouds over the hanger the dark dawn before the flight carries a genuine chill of vanity for them. Even the typically subdued and problematic WarnerColor adds to the movie instead of degrading it. Along with the fantastic use of CinemaScope, there is a remarkable score from Franz Waxman: majestic, soaring, yet full of underestimated threat and wisely used as part of the film's fabric rather than merely musical accompaniment. The movie loses the point to mean it was a race to be the first to fly the Atlantic - in fact, Lindbergh was the third man to fly across the Atlantic after almost completely forgotten British Alcock and Brown's amazing flight eight years earlier - but it's still a remarkably exciting and exciting adventure story that deserved the success it never found.
