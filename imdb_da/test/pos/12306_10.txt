John Huston made many remarkable and memorable films. The most frequently and easily recalled were released long before he passed in 1987. It was the year that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evidenced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novel "The Dead". "<br /> A long time ago, a very clever man named Doc told me:" Don't the dead "seem remarkably more vivid and bright than any of the other stories in Dubliners?" tend to think it is. The story and the film include both of Joyce's social comments and criticisms, but mostly a warm and loving portrait of an Irish joyce grinds himself so often and would soon leave. <br /> <br /> Huston's handling of the protagonist Gabriel Conroy, who understands the world as he sees it, is nothing more than an illusion, simply remarkable. To claim that the film lacks plot is to miss the point. As with any of Joyce's Dubliners, plot - though definitely present - is not focused. Plot is only a tool for conveying the protagonist's epiphany. In addition to an apparent lack of action, there is quite frankly little dialogue in Joyce's short story, where the director leans. Houston's ability to translate what Joyce puts into words in visual may be the movie's greatest triumph. Emotions, thoughts ... Gabriel's discomfort during the dance ... all of these intangible plants jump to life and come within the viewer's understanding in Huston's depiction. <br /> <br /> To claim that Huston has softened its author's criticism of society again lacks the mark. While "the dead" can be painted with a cheerful nuance, complacency and acting of the film's characters are merely a commentary for society on a smaller scale: we are the toddling old aunts; the embarrassing drunk; Tenor with sore throat; wife with the sad, rain-woven secret; even the self-falsified middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> But "The Dead" promises its title. It's not a dark story. It is not so bleak either. Forget the moment the snow falls on the living and the dead and the inherent symbolism in it; Forget about the life that Gabriel wakes up in the end of the movie: it is only with the destruction of the illusions that Gabriel has of himself and his world that he can really move on. Such is the film's central point. Such is the central point of our lives.
