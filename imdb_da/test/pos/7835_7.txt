Let's get one thing right, this gets a 7 out of 10 not on a normal scale, but out of the bad movie scale. This is the kind of movie you are deliberately renting, intentionally knowing that it is a terrible knockoff and abhorred by everyone else. <br /> <br /> I went in with a promise from the movie that there will be snakes on a train and it delivers! <br /> <br /> Gore itself is really good and the characters have amazing roles. Come on, it has everything from rocky train pilots to teenage girls who shop for drugs, even an electrical engineer gets his pimp on! You're going to see some topless nudity, explosions, snakes, gore and a Mexican lead that run around to heal his girlfriend by hitting his crack tube and blowing the smoke in her face! As I mentioned and many others have, the film pacing is a bit away, but respectable anyway. <br /> <br /> Movies like this hold our group tradition to tie together and all chipping in a buck or two to watch masterpieces like this. There can be no better time to get together to enjoy a good bad movie. <br /> <br /> It could learn something or two from similar other fine flicks like Alien Lock-down or Boa vs. Python, but it's some big shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> A solid 7 out of 10.
