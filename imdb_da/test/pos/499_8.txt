I remember seeing this in the theaters when it came out, not knowing what it was about and being so pleasantly surprised that I promised to buy the video when it came out. <br /> <br /> Although I won't go too far into dissecting this movie, I'd say I gave it an 8/10, for all the reasons you can read in the other user's reviews. <br /> <br /> What I want to say is this: <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of this movie are incredible. It's as close to a textbook audience grabber as I've ever seen. I once made this movie at a party where everyone knocked down and got ready to leave. I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Everyone who saw the opening stuck to the end.
