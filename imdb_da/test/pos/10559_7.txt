I saw this series after Tipping the Velvet, which I gave 10/10 grade. I had read user comments on this and I expected an equally good series or, if possible, even better. At this point, I must emphasize that this series is good and it certainly caught me all the way through and worth seeing. However, I haven't had it as much as Tipping the Velvet for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Less passion, love and related sexual content. There was surprisingly little weight in these elements that I had integrated into a love story. Fingersmith felt like a watery version of Tipping the Velvet. <br /> <br /> 2. In the same way as in Tipping the Velvet, the story had three parts: the beginning, a shocking second part and the end. The other part should have been the highlight of the story (as in Tipping the Velvet), but instead it was almost completely skipped, perhaps due to the inability to make shocking but credible asylum content. The series should have been in three parts, with two cliff hangers, with much more focus on the second part. <br /> <br /> 3. Almost no weight was given to what Fingersmiths were and how it affected their personalities. I found it rather annoying that the series did not properly address such a central issue. <br /> <br /> 4. The finish was much faster than in Tipping the Velvet. Fingersmith left several interesting plot lines open. <br /> <br /> Despite these shortcomings, Fingersmith is a good series and well worth 7/10. But it's not a classic like Tipping the Velvet.
