It was a very well-written film, and the actors had a very exquisite way of portraying the whole character. but when the movie ended, I felt like there were more, but they forgot to put it on the DVD. maybe they have plans to make a sequel ... well though they are not a good movie and a good rental, but even a better purchase.
