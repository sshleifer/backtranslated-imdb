Tourist Trap (1979) is an entertaining horror movie from the late 70s. The film is about a bunch of young friends who are stranded on an old, deserted track by an eerily old wax museum. <br /> <br /> The owner of the museum seems like a strange but harmless old man, but things take a very unpleasant turn when members of the young group begin to be knocked off, who is responsible for the murders, is the old one man Slausen or is it his collection of creepy mannequins who seem to be alive and hungry for blood !!!! This movie was good things, it was fast in the eyes, the performance was very good from the actors / actors (Tanya Roberts was very sexy) and the film was never boring, and as I said it had some very scary scenes, so be prepared to hide under cover! Definitely recommended for horror movie / ghost story fans! I give this movie a very respectable 7.2 out of 10.
