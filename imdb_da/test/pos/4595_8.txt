I have never seen a movie get a worse release so this. And it's a shame as this is the year's funniest movie! You would think an ad with the line "From the director of" Office Space "" would be enough to justify a great release! But there are no ads, no posters, no website, I doubt the stars even knew it came out this weekend. What is 20th Century Fox Thinking? Mike Dommer's Sci-Fi comedy is set in 2505, but it could come true in about 10 years (if things continue as they are.) Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph are frozen in a secret army experiment and wake up in a future full of consumes zombie inbred retarder. The movie reminds me of Woody Allen's "Sleeper", "RoboCop", "Apes Planet", "Blade Runner" and "Network" and the late big "Futurama". Try to see it before Fox burns all the prints!
