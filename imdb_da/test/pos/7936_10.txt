I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it many years ago. I'm not sure how many times I've seen it, maybe 10, maybe 20. This last time I looked at it, I was hit by a detail I hadn't noticed before. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the picture, the defeated heroes are returned to the city via sledge. There are a few close-ups of the dead men. The one who hit me the most was a shot of the blonde youth. All you see on the screen is his profile from head to hand. His hands hold a flickering light. The wind blows and his thick blonde hair dances in the wind, in step with the flame of the candle flame. The contrast between death and the life he has lost is incredibly powerful. The moving hair and candle flame reminds us of the life force that once inhabited his body. <br /> <br /> Every time I go back to this movie, I see something new.
