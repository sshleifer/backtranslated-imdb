William Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice depicts the 16th century Venice. Al Pacino plays Shylock, a Jewish loan shark who picks revenge on a Catholic who has looked down at him. The movie is a slow moving plot in the beginning that builds up through the two plus hours. The film gives a very good and faithful look to it's characters, especially Pacino. When one hears that Pacino is playing a Jew, one might think that looking at Pacino's former Mobster movie stars would not work. Nevertheless, it works very well, giving credit to the designer's designer and director of the film. The appearance of all characters fits well with the period in which the game takes place. The costumes look like the Renaissance look you can imagine. <br /> <br /> The film depicts a very anti-Semitic vibe. From the first minute to the last, it is shown how the Catholics try to exploit the Jews in every way they can, even to keep them locked in "ghettos" and not allow them regular jobs. In comparison to the passion of Christ, Passion, as a Jewish holiday, shows another newer movie that people believed to be very anti-Semitic, the Merchant of Venice. The film shows how the Jews, or at least Shylock, wanted to avenge the abuse the Jews received. The location images also work very timely, and the landscape is sometimes very beautiful or very ugly, depending on the scene of the movie, which makes it just so much more realistic. Showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be seen as anti-Semitic, because the ugly usually appears around the Jews and the beautiful around the Catholics. Although the film clearly tries to get a serious aura certain parts add a little humor to the action. The so serious trial between Shylock and Antonio (Irons) adds a little humor when Portia (Collins) and Nerissa (Goldenhersh) enter the trial and decide who will be victorious and defeated. That in itself cannot be fun, but it seems that they were women dressed in disguise as men, you might find it quite fun. The whole cross-dressing scene, as it was convincing, might have been even more memorable, the make-up artists and director Michael Radford have noticed that the two women still look like women and could easily be recognized. The director could also have seen in the fact that the women speak through their solid voices instead of trying to sound like men who are partly away from the scene, but do not kill it completely. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film gets a 7 out of 10
