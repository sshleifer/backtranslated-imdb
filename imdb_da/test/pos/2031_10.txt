If you like the 80's rock, you should definitely watch this movie! I have only seen it recently and am in love with it! <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very entertaining, giving you a huge load of rock tunes and not a single second of the movie makes me feel boring! It was a good idea that some of the real musicians were inside this as they did best. I was happy to see Zakk, as well as Blas Elias, they provided solid performances. I tend to agree with many people who say the first half of the movie was much better than the other, especially in relation to the script. It could have been a little better, but not a big biggie. One thing that disturbed me a little was Jennifer Aniston's performance. I thought she wasn't the right person for this role, I just couldn't see her as a rock star friend. But as the film continues, you somehow realize she did a good job on this. There is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity she delivers that just doesn't live you cold. <br /> <br /> To sum up, a good and a fun movie, it does not go deep into characters but gives you a good fun, a sense of nostalgia and of course the mighty vocals of Jeff Scott Soto and Mike Matijevic !
