A few years before the SCREAM spoofed slasher / horror genre with clever, self-conscious young things that knew every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in an uncertain situation, a small movie produced in Russia beat the theaters without any grandiose pretensions . <br /> <br /> This movie was MUTE WITNESS. Contributing to a cast of unknowns (except for an extremely short como of Sir Alec Guiness, whose scenes were allegedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this film), it told the story of a mute make-up artist, Billie, who works on a movie in place in Russia produced and directed by his sister's boyfriend Andy. She is unaware that the set is closed when she goes to retrieve her belongings and accidentally stumbles on a porn game that becomes extremely bloody. Overwhelmed by horror, she warns the murderers of her presence, a hunt follows, and eventually she is rescued by Andy, who takes her home when they warn the police. The problem is ... there's no body, no evidence that any of that kind of thing happened. Still, a mysterious inspector seems to be on Billie's side of the story. <br /> <br /> And to say more would be criminal. MUTE WITNESS is the kind of movie that requires a study to look the same as the most intricate, clever thriller, because as much as it is an enchanted thriller, it is one that pays its contributions to movies like WAIT UNTIL DARK and The best of Hitchcock in his choice of camera cuts, deadpan humor, Americans react in foreign countries where they are powerless and nail-biting excitement until it seems something should snatch. Although the story becomes a little too unreliable due to the fact that the story bow suddenly becomes the focus of an even greater conspiracy, the film manages to try to trick the audience with cheap images (for example, a person's sudden appearance on the camera accompanied by a crash of violins) but with fear of the unknown, and that death is only a shadow away. Very smart.
