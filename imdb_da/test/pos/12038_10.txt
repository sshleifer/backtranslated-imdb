This is a tough movie that comes in the United States, but if you can find it - and you're interested in Percy Aldridge Grainger's life and music, you're in the mood. It is quite historically accurate. Richard Roxborough's Grainger looks astonishingly like Grainger during this period of time. Emily Woof's Karen Holten is pretty more beautiful than the real Karen, but it was an inaccuracy I was happy to discover (!). I think what really struck me was how good Roxborough caught Grainger's outrageous personality. Barbara Hersheys Rose was also a treasure. If she looks much younger than Rose, then it's more than just how good she caught Rose's occupation with Percy. It's an easy movie to recommend. (I should note that when she saw "Passion", my wife had no particular affiliation with (or knowledge of) Grainger and his music, but she was absolutely fascinated by the movie.
