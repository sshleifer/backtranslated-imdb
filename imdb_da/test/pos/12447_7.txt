This DVD usually sells for about $ 20. I wouldn't pay that much for the DVD if I knew what I got, but this is a pretty good disc. It shows the knot in all their glory with recordings from their concerts ... playing Surfacing, Wait and Bleed and Scissors among other tracks, including the "Spit it Out" music video, which was apparently banned from MTV. <br /> <br /> Slipknot, for those who don't know, is essentially a damned symphony: nine masked men showing total chaos on stage, with machine gun drums, shaking guitar and vocals that will tear your face And leaving you wanting more. For those who have never seen Slipknot before, I cannot recommend enough that you get this DVD ... safe from eBay or Amazon so you can get a better deal. <br /> <br /> A short but well-made show by Knuden. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten.
