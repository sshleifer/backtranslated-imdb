Subsequently directly from the last episode of the previous series, yes Minister. <br /> <br /> Jim Hacker is now entering number 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, instead of a cabinet minister and a member of the government, he is now leading Her Majesty's Government. All this after some schematic maneuvers by Sir Humphrey Appleby after the former Prime Minister stepped down at the end of the Ja Minister. <br /> <br /> Sir Humphrey Appleby is now head of the public service. I thought this series was better than the first series, or it didn't last as long as the first series unfortunately.
