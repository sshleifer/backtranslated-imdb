Roy Anderson's movie 'You, The Living' consists of a series of fifty sketches, snapshots and vignettes in a Swedish town. Some characters are on the screen for just a few seconds, while others appear in many scenes and are sometimes seen in the background, while another story unfolds. Many scenes are drawn by the dreams, nightmares and fantasies of the strange but credible characters inhabiting this world. It is a fascinating approach: each of the scenes can be enjoyed in isolation, but together they contain a strong portrait of what it is to be human. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour or so, 'You, The Living' is wonderfully fun. Much of the humor is centered on the members of a brass band whose music practices confuse the neighbors in their housing block. However, the comic is highlighted by an evening track that has gone terribly wrong. After this hilarious introduction, the mood of the film darkens considerably. The evening dream becomes muddy when the monstrous protagonist is put to the test for his life and sets a mixed tone of absurdity and despair for the rest of the movie. In the subsequent scenes, the accident of the casting of characters is becoming increasingly apparent. Their is a world where people are not able to connect with each other, where dreams, nightmares and fantasies are widespread, but no one can be comforted even when others come out to help them. The despondent woman with 'no one loves me' abstains, and the young girl with unjustified love for rock guitarist Micke is archetypal characters. The world of 'You, the Living' is also harmed by self-esteem. An older professor called away from a large banquet to answer a phone call from his monstrous money-clearing son; A thief steals the wallet by a ruthless executive an arrogant and impatient businessman insulting a Muslim barber and receiving his comedy. In the darkest moment of the movie, a woman in the church tells the long list of people's sins, while her fellows push out at closing time. <br /> <br /> And for all dark moments in this movie, the joint renunciation of 'Tomorrow is another day' points to the people's ability to continue despite many miseries. The soundtrack from Benny Anderson (by ABBA fame) seems inappropriate jovial at first, but makes more and more sense as the film realizes this human ability to endure. <br /> <br /> 'You, The Living' has an extraordinary visual style. The same leached, pale green colors recur all the time and there is a shadow in sight; This makes the characters unusually light and creates the feeling that human life is the basis of the study. Almost all scenes are captured in a static camera frame, as if these photographs are destroyed. The few apartments where the camera moves are the more extraordinary; The contrast between life and movement of the big banquet creates a striking contrast to the death of the wardrobe. In the most intense moments of longing and despair, are the characters transfiguring the viewer directly at the camera? They know that they are being investigated and have few moments to pour their hearts to us, the viewers. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful human movie.
