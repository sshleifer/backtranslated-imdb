Terry and June were one of the classic British sitcoms in my opinion. You knew what to expect - and it's not that typical! :) Unlike modern sitcoms with completely constructed plots, this show is still a breath of fresh air. How nice you can't see or hear comments about body functions or not seeing a family that is quite late for breakfast or a family with impossible teens. And there is the secret: Terry & Jun was based on a middle-class couple living in relative harmony instead of today's strained plot with the de-rigueur-dysfunctional family (made to look hip). Personally, I am voting for the "Bridge to Father" episode as one of the best. In a way, Terry's antics reminds me of Basil Fawlty - both times it becomes almost impossible to embarrass! <br /> <br /> Terry & June is highly recommended. Get your tea and biscuits ready!
