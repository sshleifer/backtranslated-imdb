Excellent and charming. Justin Henry is beautiful as a blissed out and vicious Howard Kaylan, leading singer for the top ten hit bands, The Turtles. The real magic is the titular sequence of an academic prize worthy of Royale Watkins. A performance that totally captures the mysterious and yet down to earth Jimi Hendrix. Not many movies, unbelievably so, can find the essence of a special moment in a life and a time. I would like to see this available at any home video retailer without any hassle. Uh .. what is the deal? <br /> <br /> Thanks Eddie. A worthy addition to the story of the psychedelic sixties. A clear blink of an eye on the mind.
