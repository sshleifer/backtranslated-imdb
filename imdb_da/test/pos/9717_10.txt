Unfortunately, every single person I ask about this series says they have never heard of it. I remember fine from my early childhood (I wasn't quite 10 when it came out). My favorite story was "A Story Short". Something about the way the "stone soup" story was woven into a larger story gets me every time. And then the storyteller explains why he has no story to tell and it becomes a story himself. I've always been a fan of Jim Henson, and that's just one reason why. <br /> <br /> I add this DVD to myself with Labrynth, The Dark Crystal, The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride, The Last Unicorn, Willow and MirrorMask. These are all DVDs I share with my siblings who are 6, 5 and 4 years old.
