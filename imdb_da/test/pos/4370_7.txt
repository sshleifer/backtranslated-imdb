Inspection is a wonderful thing. Very spoiled when it first appeared (inspiring the famous review 'Me No Leica'), this predecessor of "Cabaret" can now be seen in comparison and it is not half bad. It is certainly no classic, but it has its own colorful charm (the movie version of "Cabaret" follows this plot while the scene version changed the plot somewhat). One should, of course, resist the temptation to stumble when Laurence Harvey's Christopher Isherwood (the original author's real name; God knows what Isherwood was thinking of it) describes himself as "a confirmed bachelor" and while Harvey is a completely inadequate '(he's almost asexual), and Shelly Winters mistreates abuse like Fraulien Landauer (part Marisa Berenson played in "Cabaret"), Julie Harris is a fantastic Sally (it's a nice piece of cartoon) Anton Diffring is first class as Fritz, the German-Jew in love with Shelly's character. Of course, if "Cabaret" had never come together, you might even ask yourself that it would ever have seen the light of day. The fact that it is revived cannot be the cause of a party, but it is quite acceptable all the same.
