This is a hilarious diamond in the rough. The plot and plot are not so impressive, but the lines just keep coming. This catches very flat because at first glance it seems like a bad movie, but it is so cooked that you can't help but be entertained. The spastic lightning speed dialogue and quirky characters keep it going ... I was especially fond of Sharon, Canuck at Shrooms eh? But the one who really stole the show was Riker's younger brother Andrew (Ira Heiden), his high bend was somehow endearing. The whole movie rocked.
