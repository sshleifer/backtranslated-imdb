Grand Champion is a bit old fashion at first glance. Andrew Morton at Fort Worth Star Telegram said it best "If Walt Disney had greeted Texas, he would have made the Grand Champion" <br /> <br /> The movie does not have the video and special effects, but it has heart and soul. The kids are great and the array of stars is incredible. I bet on Bruce Willis, and Julia Roberts is proud to be in a movie that their kids can actually see :) (G rated) <br /> <br /> This is a masterfully made "simple" little movie made in Texas by Texas Barry Tubb. Take your kids, take your kids friends, also take Grandma .... they will all enjoy it and you will too.
