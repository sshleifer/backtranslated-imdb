Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us not only of the existence of black cowboys but of providing a compelling story that was easy to follow. The reason, background, music and talent were top notch. It was great that you used so many African American artists to tell the story of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Has he ever played a good guy? <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to expand their way of thinking. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it. Hopefully you will feel the same.
