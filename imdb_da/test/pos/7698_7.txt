The plot of Sawdust Sawdust is the usual melodramatic thing - an orphan, rags-to-riches - but the film rises above most silents thanks to three people: <br /> <br /> This is not, of course, DW Griffith's masterpiece, but it shows its film-forming expert in full maturity. He uses all his innovations, which we now naturally need techniques: close-ups, cross-sections, a mobile camera, and the ability to counter act from theatrical exaggeration to cinematic subtlety. <br /> <br /> W. C. Fields also shows his skills - not his signature gruff delivery, but his remarkable dexterity as a physical comedian. He seems some ingenious juggling, cut too short to be fully appreciated, and some very bad pickpocketing, but it seems that every prop that comes within reach is manipulated to comic effect - hat, stick, car tag, dog, cash. He is a joy to see. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Carol Dempster. Much has been said to this actress, but her performance here is also real cartoon. She was 22 at the time and played a teenager, and her approach to the role is a combination of grace and awkwardness that may not be entirely convincing, but she really engages the eye when she is on the screen - especially when she is dancing. She is not a beauty - although she is positively luminous in one scene where she has gone as a Talmadge sister - but her plainness only adds Sally's character, especially in the many moments when she shows very obvious love for Fields as her guardian / "father." Few, if any, Hollywood artists could compete with Fields when it came to comedy, but Griffith gives his leading lady every chance to match her fellow star, and Dempster keeps her own.
