I heard an interview with the main actor who said the movie was not intended to be a horror movie, but he himself would describe it as mental horror. I subscribe strongly to it. It is not clear why he is traveling to this place, but all that is monotonous, no bright colors, no honest smile, nothing personal. Everything is ordered and everyone seems to be happy to live this kind of life. Our "hero" but from the beginning seems to be wrong and feels itself. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so important and good is its remarkable resemblance to life in many big cities or even countries today. You have to work, don't let your colleague know your weaknesses, show off your wealth, your car, etc. And most of all, you lack the true love of life that children have. Of course, you do not see children or old people in this movie - they simply do not fit in a society of strong workers. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to everyone - and make sure this utopia doesn't come right!
