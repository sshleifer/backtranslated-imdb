Werner Herzog has undoubtedly been one of the most interesting filmmakers for the past 50 years, who has pushed the borders of the cinema perhaps more than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now, and I've never been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was a little surprised at how relative the mainstream movie was, but it couldn't help but imagine that Herzog took his actors and crews into the jungle itself, not only to make the movie, but to live it. No other filmmaker is as fond of the purity of the filmmaking process and the subsequent lore of such productions as the Fitzcarraldo has been forged into the film legend. <br /> <br /> Today, I sat down to Fata Morgana, a 1969 Herzog movie that could be described as an allegorical cinematic postcard. Without examining the actual sites, I suppose it was shot somewhere in Africa, both coast and desert, a region that could once be cradle, infant civilization, infant life on earth. It is this origin, the biblical notion of the Garden of Eden and the Apocalypse, which Herzog deals with, as evidenced by the narrative devoted to a 79-minute race. <br /> <br /> Looking at FM, I couldn't help but feel I was a passenger on a deep journey. In the opening sequence, the title translates to "Mirage", and Herzog equates this translation with several repetitions of commercial jets landing on a runway. These images are perverted, their 3-dimensionality shattered flat by a long lens that pills layers of exhaust, heat waves, and light deviations all on top of each other. The effect made me conclude: things are not as they look. FM is divided into 3 very different chapters: 1) Creation, 2) Paradise and 3) The Golden Age. Chapter 1 opens with countless dull images, where gloomy, barren landscapes roll past, dead animals rot, broken shells of broken airplanes, and abandoned cars slowly sink into the desert sun. The people who populate this inhospitable landscape are unfortunate and apparent prisoners in the desert. The story speaks of a time before life, a time when the earth's canvas was empty and everything that existed was heaven. While the narrative belongs to a simpler and cleaner era, a portrait of a young boy holding an asshole animal at the neck evokes a cooling depiction of man's cruel and ruthless attempts to enforce a dominion of nature. <br /> <br /> In the next chapter we are introduced more of the same, but the pictures and the people are more animated and work infused with a modicum of life and vitality. We listen to a goggled biologist talking about the difficulty that a screen fireflies are hunting for prey in a lifeless environment. As he holds the monk monitor, the tongue speaks with flies, he also describes how difficult it is to capture these creatures in 140 degree heat. The parallel has been duly noted, and Herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated, honest portraits of individuals afflicted with the sun, desert and the discerning effort required to exist in this harsh realm. He also pushes out the theme that if you are not in control, you assert your control over your environment and not always in the most pleasant ways. The last chapter leads us out of the desert blast furnace and into the more well-known Herzog area populated by eccentric and absurd behavior. No one seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the world's oddballs than Herzog - possibly this is where he feels most at home. Like Errol Morris, Herzog chooses to place her camera as apparently objectively a position as he can before letting the film roll. The subsequent flirting Herzog has with his subject the result that he is able to continue shooting far beyond the point where most directors would have shouted. As Morris does, this extended role pushes it "at" time, the issues feel obliged to offer and, through their discomfort to be pushed to overtime, give their facade space for something right. The most humorous portrait in this chapter is of the 2-person band playing an odd, polka-like song that Herzog reuses throughout this chapter. The band's drummer wears the same goggles as the biologist, just as another guy makes a magic trick and begs the question: What's with the goggles? They add quite a bit of levity to the movie, but one has to ask whether they have a deeper meaning or meaning, or is this just another example of Herzog's viability. Herzog utilizes the story of folk music and blues music as the experimental documentary's soundtrack. Leonard Cohen takes most screen time, two of his beautifully melancholy songs "So Long Marianne" and "Suzanne." Perfectly accompanying rolling landscapes, adding to the convincing feel that we really are together for the trip. At the end of the journey, Herzog returns to one of the many shots that re-emerges throughout the film: The distant frame of a lonely vehicle that crosses the endless desert engulfed in a water-mirage filling the horizon. Despite FM's general gloom, the film's crescendo and the mirage motif leave a hopeless spirit, believing that against all odds, life will continue and possibly even flourish. <br /> <br /> After writing this post, I referred FM to discover that Herzog shot it in the Sahara-Cameroon just weeks after a bloody coup. True to his legend, Herzog and his crew were arrested, beaten and imprisoned. While in prison, Herzog became ill with Schistosomiasis, a blood parasite. It's really hard not to love such a hypnotic and tight movie as Fata Morgana; Knowing that the filmmaker was willing to die to have it made, only make you respect it all more. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
