In Truffaut's book length interview with Hitchcock, it is clear that Big Als's fear from the police goes back to his childhood. His father sent him to the police station with a note. The note said, "He has been naughty, imprisoned him for an hour." The politicians committed and ever since Hitchcock had a deep fear of being mistakenly charged and taken by the police. <br /> <br /> "Strangers on a Train" is probably one of the best in its "wrongly accused" series. The film is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. It is the same author who wrote the Ripley series. She was always fascinated by smart criminals. Hitchcock's opening is very strong and immediately takes you to the main characters: Guy Haines, a famous tennis player and Bruno Anthony, the hopeful criminal. The two guys share a chemistry that in that day and age was much more than what the audience could chew. Bruno tries to persuade Guy that they could commit the perfect murder (leaving no trace) if they switch victims. Bruno will kill Guy's wife who would not give him a divorce, and Guy would kill Bruno's father. The motives are love and money respectively. <br /> <br /> Bruno's performance is supposed to be seductive and homoerotic. This is not something that was accidentally done. In fact, Hitchcock edited two versions of the movie: an American, a British. In the American version, the volume of Bruno's seduction was completely downgraded. <br /> <br /> "Strangers on a Train" is a very deep movie, but more importantly this is another excellent Hitchcock thriller. An excellent example of an exciting scene is when Guy climbs the steps up to Bruno's room. Hitchcock explained that the audience's attention had to be distracted at this time so they didn't figure out what Guy would find in the room. Hitch treats us to a big, threatening dog at the top of the stairs that gave the necessary distraction. <br /> <br /> The most famous shot in the movie happens during a tennis match. Bruno has always stalked Guy so Guy will meet his end of the bargain (killing his father). When Guy looks at the audience, all the heads swing back and forth. All but one - Bruno's. He looks straight at Guy with a "I'll Get You" smile. The end is another example of excitement. Both men are struggling for a central proof of a good ride that rotates at crazy speed. A worker crawls under it so that he could get to the controls. When we finally get out of this trip and the movie ends with Guy proving his innocence, we are left exhausted and seamless (for those of us who still bite their nails!). "Strangers on a Train" is easily one of Hitchcock's best "wrongly accused" films. Some credit him with one of the best crooks (Bruno) too. All in all, the movie may seem a little dated, but it is a lesson in thriller-making from the master himself. I don't want to turn down Leonardo if he came to teach me Renaissance painting, so neither should you. <br /> <br /> << Review written on FilmDailies.com >>
