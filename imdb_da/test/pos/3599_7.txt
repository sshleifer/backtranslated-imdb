When you come across Nic Cage and play an Italian soldier who loves opera and believes in love, not war, you can come down to enjoy this beautiful looking movie. This could be used as an advertisement for tourism in the Mediterranean. John Hurt is fantastic and Penelope Cruz is not bad as you might expect. Christian Bale's character is somewhat one-dimensional, which is a shame. The biggest drawback of this movie is the adaptation from the book - after having been told subsequently the differences between the book and the movie plots, I feel cheated out of a much better and more convincing story.
