This is a worth watching, though sometimes wild, it is great to see a young Sean Astin and it becomes an entertaining and humorous action movie. I saw it many times when I was young, and I still enjoy it when I pop the old vhs into the machine (I happen to own a copy). So sit back with this movie, let reality go for a while, and you'll be able to have a few good laughs and an enjoyable one and a half hours.
