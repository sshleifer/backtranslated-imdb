As a movie, of course I had read all the scary reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this movie (my favorite is Woody Allen's quip "If I had my life to live again, I wouldn't change anything ... except to see the musical remake of Lost Horizon "). Therefore, I have never been able to see it without choking on choreography / sets / songs etc. Recently, I came across a widescreen DVD and saw it the first time this year with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation. He really enjoyed it, and - after trying to block all the negative prejudices I obviously had about the movie - I did. There is nothing particularly bad about Lost Horizon, and it is far more fun and more visible than many other films from the early 1970s. It is not even a special camp. The lyrics of some of the songs are rather repetitive and simplistic, but it is not clear when they hear for the first time or have the errors pointed out in advance so you are ready to scoff at them. For all the reviewers who claimed that the cast cannot sing in tune, this criticism falls apart when Liv Ullmann, Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch were called (also brilliant, as the vowels match their speaking voices), and Sally Kellerman has a really nice and unique song style. Vocal is the Kellerman's duet with Olivia Hussey on "The Things I Will Not Miss" excellent. There is the legendary Hollywood star Charles Boyer's brilliant performance as High Lama - and his comments on humanity that are destroying are chilling enough for today's broken world. I wouldn't claim for a second that Lost Horizon is a masterpiece (the things I wouldn't miss if it is the uninspired choreography, and Bobby Van's "Question Me An Answer" number that could easily have been cut), but If you haven't even seen the Lost Horizon, or haven't seen it for some time, try to look without "Oh boy, let's have a laugh in this pile of junk" attitude, and you'll be surprised how comfortable it is really is.
