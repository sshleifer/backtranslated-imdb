As is often the case when Manga is translated into live action, a great deal is lost in the translation. However, this is still a very entertaining movie. The prerequisite is unusual and it is presented in the quiet, discreet style that is so prevalent in Japanese films (ha!). The special effects are a small 70's camp, but it adds to the movie's cartoon experience. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you are familiar with (and enjoyed) other Japanese horror movies like "Evil Dead's Trap", this movie will appeal to you.
