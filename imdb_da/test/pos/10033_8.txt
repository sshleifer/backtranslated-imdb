The historical error in this film has been well documented. It was never meant to be a serious story, but an entertaining story, and it succeeds. Errol Flynn was never better, as this role was tailored to him. Olivia DeHavilland was never more beautiful. Arthur Kennedy never more vicious. Anthony Quinn never more noble than Crazy Horse. It had a lot of humor and pathos and kept your interest all the way through. The one historical aspect that I found most unclear was inaccurate was the final "last stand" that emerged on the banks of Little Big Horn. The movie version was filmed in a desert without a river in sight. However, I still consider it wonderful entertainment typical of Hollywood's golden age.
