This is the essence of the early eighties! Shopping malls, credit card machines, food, punk hair color, soundtrack ... I'm in love with this movie. This cute, intelligent Romeo & Juliet teenager is instantly addictive. <br /> <br /> Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite directors. She really employs her actors, such as John Hughes and Steven Soderberg, so check -you for Sex and Real Genius. The soundtracks of -Valley Girl are great. If you can find a copy of the movie, buy it! It's out of print and very hard to get by.
