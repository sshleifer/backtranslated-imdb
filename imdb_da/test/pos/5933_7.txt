Royal Rumble has traditionally been one of my favorite events, and I've been a wrestling fan for a couple of years now. The other shows may have better matches, but I've always found the actual rumble struggle to be full of excitement. I will not reveal the winners of any match that I cannot see It is just as reasonable to destroy the results on a review. However, I would like to comment on the quality of them. <br /> <br /> We have standard 4 games and then the big rumble event. Two from Smackdown and two from Raw. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Edge opens for Raw. This turns out to be a good match from two talented guys. This is a match I would recommend to watch. It's hard to sum up without giving the winner away. <br /> <br /> Next, we have the usual Undertaker against some big ugly monster, be it who is it. Giant Gonzales, Yokozuna, Kamala ... well this time it's Heidenreich. It is also a coffin match. Typical Undertaker fare. See if you're a fan. I must admit I am solely for the entertainment factor. It can hardly be considered a classic wrestling match. <br /> <br /> The next two games are the title matches. For once, Smackdown succeeds in raising Raw. Their title fight is quite exciting and fun, but with an anti-climax and failed to finish it. Raw's struggle is a rather boring and boring affair, which is a shame as I am a fan of both guys involved. <br /> <br /> Now, for the main reason, I'm happy about the event, the room. It is a really good one this year. When we got to the event, we all had a good idea of ​​who could win, and it can't be a big surprise, but hey, it's very enjoyable. There are the usual different ways people are eliminated. There is the token guy who does not make it to the ring, the participant who is ridiculous, and we will overcome all victories, and someone is eliminated by a previously eliminated champion. It has its usual heights and lows, and I loved the end, especially the Vince McMahon entrance. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this show. Not WWE in top form, but it's still good. Add it to your collection.
