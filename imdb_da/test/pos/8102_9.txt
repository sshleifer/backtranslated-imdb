With the Nazi rise to power in Eastern Europe in the late 1930s, Charles Chaplin turned his attention to creating a response to it. The catalyst may well have been a propaganda publication referring to Chaplin as a Jewish sympathizer. In the great dictator, Chaplin created a death-on parody of Hitler, who is as funny as it is frightening at times. The film tracks Hitler's experiences in the German army from World War I until today. At the same time, Chaplin plays a Jewish hairdresser who dress like the tramp coming out of a hospital for a long time, only to discover how different the world is under Nazi rule. <br /> <br /> Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at the time, plays a young Jewish girl whose family is suppressed in a Jewish ghetto. Jack Oakie has a great, Oscar-nominated support role as a Mussolini look-alike (Benzini Napaloni) that gives Chaplin's Hitler figure, Adenoid Hynkel, a lot of fit. Henry Daniell is his usual staid himself as Garbitsch, chief advisor for Adenoid Hynkel. Chaplin wrote and directed the film and received Oscar nominations for his screenplay and his plays. The film was also nominated for the best picture. <br /> <br /> Chaplin made the movie under enormous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known. He financed the whole movie himself with great risk because of the subject, and there were no other great films made about Nazi Germany until then. The movie spent about twenty-one months in production with Chaplin even rebuilding a set and resuming a scene to get it right. At the time of the film's release in October 1940, the war in Europe was well underway with Hitler to win a country after another, so the film became much more relevant at the time of its publication than when production first began. <br /> <br /> There is not much plot in looking at the movie in retrospect; the film seems more like a series of comedy sketches and / or drawbacks squeezed together to come to a purpose independent of the film itself. Several examples of this occur in the final third of the film with the meeting between Hynkel and Napaloni. The scene is very much fun, but it does not lead to where compared to the plot. Similarly, escape from both the barber and Schultz leads to the erroneous identity of the barber to Hynkel in order to give Chaplin (through the shaving character) an opportunity to introduce to the audience at the end of the film. On the other hand, what better way to make a point about the wrong narcissism of Aryan superiority than to have a Jewish barber wrong for Hynkel? <br /> <br /> The movie still contains many high comic moments such as the rally, the new war development (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), the dancing bell scene, the coin in the pudding scene, and the whole scenario between Hynkel and Napaloni (including the razor scene) for highly recommend the movie. Nor can you forget about the risks Chaplin took in making his first speech film, an anti-Nazi film and financing the film itself. *** 1/2 of 4 stars.
