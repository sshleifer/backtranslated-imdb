On the surface, this is one of the most classically entertaining action / comedy / romance films I've seen for a long time and reminds me of pleasant old "Saturday afternoon" movies that just had the right balance between unexpected twists, timed humor and integrated action. Apart from this, however, there is knowledge about this film's context. It has the same elements in "Casablanca" but is set just before many of the characters really understand the seriousness of what happened to their country (and world) and the consequences of some of their own behavior. This adds a strong irony to humor (we notice that one of the female characters has a radical change in hairstyle in her future). This is a movie that you will not regret.
