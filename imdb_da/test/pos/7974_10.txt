Hell for payment is a little bloody for my taste, even though it's not worse than many movies. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the parade with spicy stars and the western landscape and all; But the story was very weak and I couldn't really see it all. But the music that accompanies the film is more than the dark film. <br /> <br /> Where did the father -Nate & Noah Cryns - who wrote this music? They are awesome !! From the moment the music begins, it's far better than anything I've heard this year. I think it may be the best I have ever heard! Although I was not thrilled with the action that took place on the movie, the music produced the exact feel that was needed for each scene. I was transported in time to the old west during the opening credits and really felt like I was living in those old days through the music. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth buying and watching the beautiful music and a trip down memory stick to see the old western stars again.
