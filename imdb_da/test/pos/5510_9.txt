This thriller is one of the few (movie) surprises I have had for some time. Everyone - and I mean everything - I spoke to when it was in the theaters, said it was terrible ... but then I thought ... none of these people really understand horror / thriller or metal rock - so why do you I listen to them in the first place ????? This movie kicks ass - but only if you are able to understand and enjoy this type of entertainment. In short (too late) - see it with an open mind, and it can just open your mind. ... the soundtracks also good ...
