Good movie, acting was amazing especially from Eriq Ebouaney (Lumumba) and very orderly. It also shows how Lumumba became the corner of the Belgians, the United States and the United Nations, and how they felt him a "communist" to scare people as they did for all the honest true African leaders like Nkrumah, Kenyatta, Nyerere and many others. It shows how Western countries preach democracy while having something different on the back of their minds. It is a story of injustice, struggle and brutality. It shows how Lumumba could not control his people, yes, they were his people, but before we blamed him, would he, if anyone from the people he appointed in his government as Mobutu, get him? Or his colleague had other things in their mind to find out, go and watch the movie! It was definitely Mobutu who continued to plunder the land for the next 35 years before he was overthrown and fled the country. Dead a billionaire. <br /> <br /> Some errors: There was too little explanation on how the man (Lumumba) should rise in the first place. Also there should have been more explanation about the country, Congo Kinshasa (after independence), now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as Zaire, when it was under Mobutu. There should have been an explanation why he (Lumumba) could not hold the second largest country in Africa in one piece. And also what happened to Tshombe and Katanga. Just head up if you want to see the movie Tshombe ruled the Katanga region, which (if I'm not mistaken) is the second largest copper producer in the world. In all, it's a good movie to watch. You will learn something new about Africa, it's leaders and it's people and will probably open your eyes, why this continent is ridden with wars.
