Two years after the first release, Goldeneye is still on top of the first-person shooters of the Nintendo 64. Even the Quake and Turok series have not had the combination of graphic details, sound quality, enemy intelligence, challenge and overall fun that brings me back to this games again and again. The missions each have specific goals that force you to think like Bond, not just to shoot up every villain that pops up on your screen, but also to avoid cameras, disable security systems, rescue hostages, protect the Bond girl, and so on. Q gadgets abound in this game, including the famous clock. The game is loosely based on the movie story, including all the great characters and the best scenes in the movie, from the dam to the bungee jump to the prop planet, escape to the tank hunt through the St. Petersburg. Even the layout is preserved wherever possible, so you can recognize different situations if you have seen the movie. Other levels are added to challenge the player and wrap the scenes a little more. With each level of difficulty, mission goals are more difficult, the enemies smarter and the balls more deadly. I still haven't gotten through 00-Agent levels. Cheating can be opened, not by entering codes or pushing buttons, but by filling certain levels within a certain time frame, and more characters can be opened for multiplayer. Multiplayer is still the best among the first person shooters. It is not as sharp as Turok, but it does not lower just as much ... tons of opportunities give your friends a reason to blow each other again and again and again just for kicks. There are better games for the N64, like Zelda and all things Star Wars, but Rare has continued their touch of great game with a first-person shooter who won't and will not be exceeded before they flush in 2000 with Perfect Dark.
