I just watched this movie in Austin Texas at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and it was my festival favorite. Gymnast is a movie that must not be missed. It is an honest "come to terms" story of relationships, self-discovery, growing older, and the courage to change and move on. Not only is this a good story, but the brilliant aerialist performances of Dreya Weber and Addie Yungmee will take the breath! Watch this movie! It will soon come to a festival near you. This movie deserved to be downloaded immediately by a large network or study. I will definitely buy this when it becomes available on DVD.
