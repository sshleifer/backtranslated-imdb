For the most part, romance films were never my cup of tea. But Valley Girl is one of the few Romanesque films that I could not only sit through but actually enjoy. Nicholas Cage is great in her first role, and Deborah Foreman is beyond belief. There are some side stories that tend to get confused, but not enough to reduce this movie.
