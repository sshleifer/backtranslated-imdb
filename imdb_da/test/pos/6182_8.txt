Gary Cooper (Michael Brandon) played the role of an American millionaire who had seven bad marriages, but always divorced his wife with lots of money to live on. Michael is in Paris on a business trip and joins a French department store to buy a couple of pajamas, and the sellers refuse to sell him just tops, he has to buy the bottom or there is no sale. Nicole DeLoiselle, (Claudette Colbert) listens to this conversation and offers to buy the bottom of these pajamas. Michael gets very interested in Nicole and they have the opportunity to meet and go on dates. It's not too long before Michael proposes marriage to Nicole, and she's very much left with her marriage request because she really doesn't know him very well. But when she finds out that she will be Michael's eighth wife, she begins to change her mind, and this story becomes quite entertaining and fun. Don't miss this movie, it's great entertainment by great veteran actors. Enjoy.
