OK ... I've seen almost everything .... and some are considered classics that shouldn't be (like all the Halloween movies that suck crap or even Steven King junk) ....... and some are considered just ok, it's really good ..... (as carnival of souls) ........ and then some are just overlooked ............ as (evil ed) or (pumpkin head and brain dead "bud Cort one") so have some sticks in the head once seen and never left ........... that's what it did for me ........ and for my money is this much better than last house on the left ............ last house was great for the end ... then it blew lumps ..... what kind of dummy should give a blow job to someone who just killed their children ????. totally silly ..go find the movie "bully" or even "fun game" if you want realism and be creeping oath ......... but this damn thing stuck with me this year .... ..... one reason Chuck Connors was always scary ......... two Tanya Roberts is the best female victim ever ... ... three chicken to be thrown in plaster is still one of The most worst kills of film ........ and 4. the telekinetic power things blew my mind and came quite unexpectedly ....... not to mention the dummies wax numbers dolls etc .... .. it should be right there with psycho, last house, Texas chainsaw, etc ....... it's a classic ............. and deserved so ..... ......
