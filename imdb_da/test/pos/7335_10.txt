Wow what can I say it was a good movie, very different from all the boring remakes we saw lately, the only thing I would have seen looking a bit more of an end as, when Jane left her husband Im guesses that she was going to the Serena cause she fell for her, not just her, but all she is, I would want to produce would actually show that kind of end instead of leaving it to your imagination kind of end i really hate it when they do the. The antenna acts looked like fun, but I think you should be light and muscly, I'd like to see more movies like this, maybe they could make some sort of sequel to Jane and Serena.If I was in Jane's shoes I would have been to the girl also she was attractive.
