Four lovely young nurses in their last year of nursing school are experiencing all sorts of turmoil and excitement in their lives: sweet Susan (winning brunette Elaine Giftos) is trying to comfort the bitter, terminally ill Greg (a moving performance of Darrell Larson) eager for but neurotic Phred (lovely blonde Karen Carlson) romance's beautiful gynecologist Jim Caspar (captivating Lawrence Casey), the timid hippie Priscilla (the astonishingly beautiful Barbara Leigh) is impregnated by the playful retailer Les (the solid Richard Rust) and compassionate Lynn (neat played by Brioni Farrell) helps out with the savvy Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie (the excellent Reni Santoni). Despite the fact that this movie was made for Roger Corman's legendary New World Pictures feature, it's anything but your standard thoughtless piece of soft-core schlock learning. Instead, it is a very pleasant, charming and even often thought-provoking time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the early 70s (the subplot involving Lynn and the revolutionaries is extremely powerful and provocative). Special kudos are in order for director Stephanie Rothman, who brings a welcome and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity to the material. In addition, the four attractive and attractive women lead to sound and commendable work. Scottie MacGregor likewise impresses as cleverly guiding Mrs Boswell and the ubiquitous 70's trailer voice guy Ronald Gans supplies a psychiatrist off-screen voice. Stevan Larner's polished filmography, the stunning rock soundtrack and the tasteful folksy'n'funky score of Clancy B. Grass III are all too fast. A real sleeper.
