Nothing boring about this movie, which is held together by fully realized characters with a depth to them. Even hooded torturers have body language. Janning's performance is brilliant, everything will, will and needs. A Henry VIII he must have been. The Henny Gate is perhaps more noble and cleaner than Anne Boleyn, but she plays the part as written: A victim caught in the jaws of a large (large) baby. <br /> <br /> Sparkuhl's films are beautiful in the restoration, tinting sensual. Lubitsch lets these characters breathe and reveal their corruption down to the tiniest insanity. He takes his time to test the patience of an audience accustomed to being carried away by action, but time is worth spending. Lower your heartbeat and see this little miracle of German silent film.
