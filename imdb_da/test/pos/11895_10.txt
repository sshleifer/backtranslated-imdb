This movie is a picture perfect action / drama / and thriller, every scene you've sucked in. I watched this movie and was amazed at how many talented actors were in the movie. Damian Chapa was especially amazing, he played his role perfectly. The story was made for these actors. The characters make the film so realistic. This movie simply gets a plus from me. Finally, look at this movie, it compares to the scarface, but has a deeper history. This movie not only gives you a good picture of the gangster life, but it also gives you the characters feelings, and in the end you really feel the main character. Watch this movie !!!!!!
