This movie deserved better. Mike Doman's satirical wit highlighted that too many in this country are trying to deny ... we are stupid as a society. Can the 24-hour Anna Nicole cover be any more evidence? Mike Judge paints a frightening future where the stupid survive and thrive. Make you stop and think and laugh. Can you see the world and not ask, are we stupid? Do we overcome the human garbage and our own garbage? (Beware of landslides). <br /> <br /> The movie is really fun. I will tell you more about the plot, but I will not destroy it. <br /> <br /> So why release this movie with ZERO advertising? Could it be that the stupid ones are already taking over?
