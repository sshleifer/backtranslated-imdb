It might be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you don't have to throw cartloads of money on a movie to do it well, nor will it guarantee it's worth seeing), but I think It totally lacks the point. If you expect fast cars, T&A or a movie that will spell out for you, don't look at this, and you will be disappointed and stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie was thoroughly enjoyable, kept us on the edge of our seats and made us think right. The author has, of course, put a lot of thought and research behind this movie, and it turns out at the end, just remember to keep an open mind. Note: School scenes were all filmed at McMaster University and most of the rest was done in Toronto
