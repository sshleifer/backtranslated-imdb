I just watched a very original movie that I would recommend to everyone, including `the young and the restless. "However, I think some of the profanity, violence and sexual insinuation in the movie do not fit 'all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the movie:` Nurse Betty. 'Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance and thinks she is a true life character of her favorite soap opera. Because of this she goes on a trip to Los Angeles for the reunions with her supposed soap opera character love Dr. Rubell. To add fuel to the fire, she is also chased by a ruthless "one life not to live" hit people who believe they have stolen their drugs. You can say that this is how Nurse Betty uses 'life in life' throughout the movie. This very `ungeneral 'situation eventually leads her to the' hospital 'set of her beloved soap opera. But the only problem is that Betty thinks it's all right. It's like her mind is in another world. Okay! Enough! I will dry my mouth with soap and not mention any soap names. I've already recorded my vote for Renee as the best actress Oscar nominee. Also Greg Kinnear's performance as Dr. Rubell was as good as it gets in her acting biography. To sum it up, my final diagnosis is that everyone should call in for `nurse Betty. '***** Excellent
