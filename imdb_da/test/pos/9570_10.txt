This is the best of the films (so far) that Christopher Guest has created using his highly talented ensemble cast. Previously they had made the excellent WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and followed BEST IN SHOW, they made the very comfortable A MIGHTY WIND. Regarding their latest, your consideration said the less the better. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a documentary about dog shows and more participants in particular. You follow these few selected dogs from pre-show preparations all the way to the big night, where one of them is best chosen in show at the fictional "Mayflower Kennel Club". However, none of these people are genuine dog show enthusiasts, but talent improvisation actors who parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world. Amazingly, even though the characters are rather indistinct, there is a lot of truth to the personalities they parody - decades ago I had some experience with dog shows, and it's a very sweet group of people! My favorites of the dog's owners were the incredibly high-pressure and tense yuppie couples that just radiated anger and volatility. I also loved the openly gay couple as they were terribly funny and clever. However, the best performance was probably not from any of the couples, but from Fred Willard, who played the world's stupidest and least talented announcer in human history. His comments were uniform inane and often betrayed him as an incredibly stupid person - how he was enrolled in such a prestigious show is someone guessing. The other participants were also very fun - the precious professional poodle dealer and its rich owner, the country's boy and his dog, and Winkie's "parents" who could hardly scrape together enough to make it the show. /> <br /> Despite the improvised style of film making, the pieces all fit together wonderfully and told a very fun and compelling story - one is NOT for dog owners only. Extraordinary plays made this one of the best comedies of the last decade. Clear and consistent fun. <br /> <br /> That way, you are trying to find this on DVD as the extras were actually worth seeing. While I was a little painful to see, I loved watching Harlan Pepper and his beach ball collection in particular!
