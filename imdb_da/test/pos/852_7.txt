I can't really criticize this movie. It is literally the first movie I ever remember watching and leading to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror movies and prehistoric animals. Fortunately, it looked again years later, well kept up. Rod Cameron plays a big hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths. No one believes in him, including his best friend, played by Cesar Romero, whose brother was among those killed. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film was shot in India and has a good nature. The action is at a high level. I don't think Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero and Marie Winsor have ever made a bad performance. The mother nuts, when they finally arrive, are quite effective. The end also has an unusual twist, especially for a 1950s science fiction movie. Definitely worth a look.
