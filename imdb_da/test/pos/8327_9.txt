If you haven't seen this yet, you really need, on DVD. I can't believe how much I enjoyed it! It is incredibly realistic and credible. True, much of it is speculated, and I would have wished to know more about what was speculative and what were documented facts (there are not many of them), but it handles everything pretty well with a "cruel mother nature" theme. It reminds you of the nature programs you've seen on Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel, only the animals here are dinosaurs. They work naturally; they eat, kill, mate, play and fight to survive. You will actually find yourself rooting for some of them and against others. <br /> <br /> Mostly, the effects are excellent. At times, they look a little too much like CGIs, but then you will see them at a different angle that makes them look more realistic. In some cases, you will actually be convinced that you have seen a dinosaur. My favorites were the Coelophysis, the raptors, the diplodocus, the iguanadons, the allosaurus and the arctic bipeds. I was most disappointed with T-Rex, who was so little into computer generated at times. <br /> <br /> In any case, you should definitely see this production. It is educational, well made and very entertaining. For what it is, it's an A!
