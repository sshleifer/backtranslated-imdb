A teenage girl gets her dream horse and is trained by a former jockey to attend London's Grand National Steeplechase. A fine adaptation of the classic children's book, with an excellent start-up by Taylor as the energetic but polite youth. Rooney is OK as her trainer, though he has some overly melodramatic moments. Crisp and Revere are quite good as Taylor's loving parents. Filmed in Technicolor, it looks beautiful. The problem is that there are corny items, nothing very interesting happens and it takes a little too long. The race is exciting, but it could have been much more.
