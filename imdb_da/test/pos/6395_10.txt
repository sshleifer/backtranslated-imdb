It's one of my favorite TV shows. A wonderful cast, a great manuscript and an outgoing plot. <br /> <br /> Looking at the Kyle family routine, it is a gift for amazing humorous moments and amazing comedians. Let's see: - Damon Wayans: no comments. He is one of the best today. Look has a perfect timing and always gets the point point. <br /> <br /> - Tisha Campbell: Her paranoid and sentimental Jay is just amazing to see. <br /> <br /> - George O. Gore II: Perfect for the paper. It is impossible to imagine another as the sweet (and stupid) Junior. - Jennifer Nicole Freeman: The self-centered Claire found the perfect actress. Beautiful and talented. - Parker McKeena Posey: impossible not to fall in love with her. Noah Gray-Cabey: This boy has the future, I'm sure of it. <br /> <br /> I get very sad when it ends, but this show will be in my mind forever. Michael, Jay, Claire, Junior, Kadie ... we love you!
