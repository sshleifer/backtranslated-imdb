There are a few things in life that we cannot experience more than once, and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we live in a foreign country and in an apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the protagonist leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study Spanish to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with a French doctor's wife, and he makes friends who make him look at things differently. When Wendy's brother (Wendy is one of the chambermates) comes from England, the movie begins to become much more fun. Well, nevertheless, Xavier begins to see things differently with all his new friends, and he certainly lives as he will never forget and will change his life forever. All in all, a very nice nostalgic movie, which becomes even more interesting because of the multinational cast. I thought it was very interesting that you could see all these children from different countries, everyone speaks different languages ​​and has different cultures meeting with each other and fun. I gave it a 9 out of 10 because I left the theater with a smile on my face and thought of things I haven't done yet while I'm still in college and would like to do it before it's too late.
