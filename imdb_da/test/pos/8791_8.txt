Great film! Oh yeah! Full of energy, full of fun, presenting our generation, our alienation: a hymn for positive thinking despite this world we live in, a tale of a big party, a tale of a bunch of friends who are desperate to do something week end and the only thing to do is The Club. But fun and extreme need boredom! Very fun, pretty grotesque in a few points, nicely shot ... and great soundtrack!
