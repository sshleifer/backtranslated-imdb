George Cuckor, known as the women's director, could not have hoped for two talented and beautiful women for his last film. Although a remake of Bette Davis' campy "Old Acquaintance" written by John Van Druten, this movie is definitely dated but still lovely. <br /> <br /> Bergen and Bisset sparkle like best friends competing for everything, but manage to stay friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a "serious" author, intellectual and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school, and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition. Later in their life, when Liz is a "promising" but blocked writer of serious fiction, Merry decides to try her hand at writing, which infuriates her friend because of Merry's random approach to the craft she herself may be doing a little for. seriously. <br /> <br /> Much to Liz's fate hit Merry's crooked novels paying dirt, and eventually her old friend Liz condemns her novel to the National Book Award. Bergen steals the show as the haughty author of steaming bestsellers who plan to gather the broken pieces of her life in connection with her final literary triumph, but unfortunately things are never that simple. <br /> <br /> The support model includes David Selby, who you may remember as the tragic Quentin Collins of Dark Shadows, Hart Bochner and of course a delicious young and mercurial Meg Ryan in his first movie role since he left the soap. <br /> <br /> Rich and Famous are catty, campy, witty and clever. It culminates in a New Year's failure that underlines the lasting character of lasting friendship, and I never let a year go without seeing it on New Year's Eve. See it and you will see why.
