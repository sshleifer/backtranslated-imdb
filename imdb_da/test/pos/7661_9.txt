Hercules the Avenger is by far the best single entry in the muscleman genre I can remember. The tax on it made by critics - it is a cut and paste of two former Hercules films, with something added new material that makes it seem fresh - missing the fact that this cut-and-paste approach solves one of the central problems in sword-and-sandal movies. With most of these movies, the middle third is terribly horrible - usually a juicy love story or bay involves political intrigue or both (the queen falls in love with Hercules and her evil brother plots against them, etc.) It is often difficult to stick to this to see the exciting finale. Hercules the Avenger cuts all that shit from the source films and adds a pretty quick story that a Hercules impersonator is bullying his way to power. (It should be noted that this episode also acts as a distant but significant critical remark about the rise of fascism in Italy.) This also creates a fine final wrasslin battle between the real Hercules and his impersonator. <br /> <br /> In a narrower focus, I can also add that further editing has improved individual scenes borrowed from the other movies. For my money, the mutation scene here is much better than it first appeared in Hercules and Captive Women, as it has been tightened with the reduction of multiple signs and their complications. There are also floppy monsters, spooky underworld atmosphere borrowed (literally) from Mario Bava, a whole city destroyed, and the usual amount of lovely babes in revealing dress. As no one expects any of these movies to compete with The Seven Samurai - or even with The Magnificent Seven - it seems to be a bit of a mean to keep the movie's borrowing from other movies against it.
