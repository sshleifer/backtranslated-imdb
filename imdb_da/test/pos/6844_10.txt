Well, there are things here that Coens and Elmore Leonard have done before, but what? If you want entertaining, lusty and smart - "Judas Kiss" is almost perfect. Prudes insulted by the tongue in cheek porn does not get it (Talk about getting your gender and violence out of the way - keeps your investors happy. It is independent film making 101). As for the British who make a bundle, I doubt it a lot. This flick is obviously a love work and the budget probably isn't half of Mr. Tarantino's salary. Maybe guys don't like it as much as women. I thought it rocked. Go Coco!
