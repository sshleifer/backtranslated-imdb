Dakota Incident is a curiosity for several reasons. It will appear from the outset that it was made long before anyone ever believed in political correctness. Although the Ward Bond character softens the edge with "maybe we can communicate with them, after all, they are also people" kind of dialogue. His part stands side by side with the preacher to communicate with the Martians in World of War. In fact, it's scary. The title is also curious. Using the word "Incident" contributes with an importance and sophistication to the movie, which probably has no damaged box office. The stylish assortment of characters and Linda Darnell's fancy dress and hat are wonderful dated hands that make the Dakota Incident a cool western artifact from the mid-fifties.
