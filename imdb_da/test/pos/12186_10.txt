I remember not like this movie the first time I saw it, but it has grown on me. I love costumes and make up the actors, humor, cinematography, soundtrack. The scenes are very rich and it moves very quickly. Every time I see it, there is something new that catches my eye. Aaliyah like Akasha is probably the only thing that destroys it, but not enough. <br /> <br /> Also, Lestat in this movie is different, it's not the same sign. You can see that the character Armand has got Lestat-like qualities because I assume that Anne wanted it in. But there is no reason to separate this movie just because it's not like books, it's fascinating by itself .
