Originally supposed to be part of a large epic In 1905, depicting the revolution of 1905, Potemkin is the story of the murder of the Potemkin crew in the port of Odessa. The film opens with the crew protesting maggoty meat and the captain ordering the execution of the dissidents. A rebellion takes place where the revolutionary leader is killed. This crew has been taken ashore to reside in the state. When the city's citizens gather on a large staircase overlooking the harbor, tsarist troops appear and march down the stairs that spread the people. A naval squadron is sent to resume Potemkin, but at the moment the ships reach its reach, their herds allow the mutines to pass through. Eisenstone's non-historically accurate ending is open, suggesting that this was the seed of the later Bolshevik revolution that would flourish in Russia. The movie is divided into five parts: Men and Maggots, Drama on Quarterdeck, An Appeal from the Dead, Odessa Steps and Meeting Squadron. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein was a revolutionary artist, but at the genius level. Eisenstein did not use visual texture to make a historical drama to give the film a news series, so the viewer feels he is canceling an exciting and political revolutionary story. This technique is used by Pontecorvo's Battle of Algiers. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pontecorvo, Eisenstein was dependent on the style or exhaust of non-professionals who had striking physical appearances. The extraordinary faces of the cast are what you remember from Potemkin. This technique is later used by Frank Capra in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Meet John Doe. But in Potemkin no individual is cast as a hero or heroine. The story is told through a series of scenes combined in a special effect known as montage - editing and selecting short segments to produce a desired effect on the viewer. D.W. Griffith also used mounting, but no one mastered it as well as Eisenstein. <br /> <br /> The artistic filming of the crew sleeping in their hammocks is complemented by the graceful swing of tables suspended from chains in the district. In contrast, the confrontation between the crew and their officials is burdened with electricity, and the clinging fists of the masses show their rage with injustice. Eisenstein introduced the technique of showing an action and repeating it, but from a slightly different angle to show intensity. The break of a plate carrying the words "Give us this day our daily bread" means the beginning of the end. This technique is used last year at Marienbad. Also, when the ship's surgeon throws over the side, kills his pince-nez from the rig. It was these glasses that the official used to inspect and pass on the maggot-infected meat. This sequence binds the punishment to the corruption of the Czarist era. <br /> <br /> The most notable sequence in the movie, and perhaps throughout the film history, is The Odessa Steps. The wide extension of the steps is filled with hundreds of extras. Fast and dramatic violence is always suggested and not explicit, but the visual images of the death of a few deaths will last in the viewers forever. <br /> <br /> The angled cushions on marching boots and legs down the steps are cleverly accentuated with long threatening shadows from a sun on top of the steps. The pace of the sequence is deliberately varied between the marching soldiers and a few civilians calling for the courage to ask them to stop. A close-up of a woman's face frozen in horror after being hit by the soldier's sword is the bank's direct antecedent in Bonnie in Clyde and gives a lasting impression of the horror of the Czarist regime. <br /> <br /> The death of a young mother causes a baby carriage to climb down the stairs of a sequence copied by Hitchcock in the Foreign Correspondent, by Terry Gilliam of Brazil and Brian DePalma of The Untouchables. This sequence is shown repeatedly from different angles and designates what was probably only a five-second event. Potemkin is a film that unfolds the revolutionary spirit, celebrates it for those who are already engaged and propagate it to the unchanged. It looks at fire and roars with the sensual injustice of the decadent tsarist regime. Its greatest influence has been on film students who have borrowed and slightly improved on techniques invented in Russia several generations ago.
