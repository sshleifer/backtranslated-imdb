After reading most of the comments, I would like to say something. <br /> <br /> What matters most to me is that most people here think that this movie is either pro or con for the subject of death punishment and whether it worked with them. I remember having read an article back in 1995 when the film was published (yes it has interested me so much ever since I heard that it would come out that I have not forgotten the articles I read since then) where Tim Robbins said he would not make a movie to convince the audience of neither. <br /> <br /> And I think that's right. I have to admit that I think he tends to suffer the anti-death penalty in the way he made this movie, yet people still have to choose for themselves. And this is a very rare thing in American movies. <br /> <br /> I've shown this movie to many people since it came out and I've seen all kinds of reactions. Death penalty supporters became opponents or became even stronger in their beliefs. And many death penalty opponents (including me) became stronger in their conviction that the death penalty should be abolished throughout the world. But I myself have seen opponents become supporters. This and the fact that people here seem to struggle for it show me that there are many ways to look at it. So whatever effect it has on you, it is important that it makes you think. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that really gives you the choice that doesn't shy away from the simple way of making them doomed either bad or innocent. This can be a tough thing for people who prefer to be entertained or taught in a lesson. There is no lesson here, you have to find one yourself. <br /> <br /> Everyone praises the play, the director and the music, but as this has been said so many times, I will not repeat it all again. <Br /> <br /> So if you haven't seen it yet, do it - if you dare be challenged!
