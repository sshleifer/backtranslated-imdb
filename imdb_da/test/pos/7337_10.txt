This movie was beautiful and touching. It touched somewhere deep inside me and I'm not sure why. I am a happily married woman and I have never had lesbian tendencies, but my movie almost did something I long for. Choreography, storyline, dialogue ... the film was a work of art. <br /> <br /> Synopsis without spoilers is that a woman gymnasts dissatisfied with her life and looking for ... something, something. She's with a man who doesn't want a baby, but she does. He doesn't mean to her, but he doesn't treat her like a woman should be treated either ... I don't think he really appreciates her. All these years she has stayed in shape and decides to go back to the gym. She meets another woman during her acrobatic training, and an intimate and beautiful relationship unfolds. Throughout the film, she has another female friend she trained with in her younger years, and they have been close friends. The relationship that unfolds is .. I do not quite know the word, but very understanding, comfortable, intimate but sexy ... something that could only exist between two women. The kind of relationship that could really bring meaning back into your life. Someone who makes you feel special, exciting, beautiful, confused yourself. The relationship with her close friend is beautiful in a different way. They have a close and intimate relationship. Her friend showed me what a real friend really is. Someone who is understanding, easy to walk, Real, fun to be with, someone who is there for you, no matter what. Someone who is supportive and you can cheat and tell your deepest secrets. Someone who shares your past but does not share your secrets. <br /> <br /> The story is simple in that it was not overdone, but not underdone in any way. It leaves a lot of sensual images to capture that moment. The dance and choreography were amazing. I could see it again and again. The way the artist caught the protagonist's feelings and feelings was. The dance and the picture were very dazzling and fascinating to see. What a cozy a wonderful story! I fell in love with this movie. If you have a chance, rent this and see it !!
