Once again, John Madden has given us a grand movie. A simple but beautiful story lies in a true paradise, and the music can't be better, Stephen Warbeck once again welcomes us and good actions, but ......... Why on earth is Penelope Cruz in this movie? I asked myself the same question while watching this movie. Of course, her Greek accent is not credible, she is inappropriate to work properly not even in a scene. Not even at the end did she do a good job, after many events, after years she finally comes to see Corelli again, and she couldn't change the same face of stupid ones we had to carry throughout the movie. Anyway, Cage was very good in one of his best signs; Hurt is also great in his and the rest of the cast everyone did a good job so the final result is a movie that is really worth seeing. This is a beautiful movie that could not even destroy Mrs Cruz. So far, I think it is Madden's best work, so no fan will be disappointed.
