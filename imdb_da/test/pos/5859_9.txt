I can get very tired of murder mysteries except for a couple of excellent TV shows. Otherwise, there are just too many of these murder plots. I do not like the theme of the two over-conscious, selfish youths who kill as an intellectual exercise. I have no interest whatsoever in Hitchcock who seems to have been associated with this in some way, I do not intend to find out about. But don't get me wrong, the theme is in itself excellent, the whole movie is so well done, and of course, Sandra Bullock is superlative as always. <br /> <br /> Sandra's character (as in Miss Congeniality) is not judged by the male team she works with despite her obvious abilities, and the boss mostly ignores her ideas and forces her aside and gives the cause to her male partner. Of course, Sandra works out what happens and is almost killed in a very dramatic breakdown. It is exciting how the boy who performed the murder plot cannot allow her to be beaten by his colleague - he has a conscience of some sort and might be "rescued while the other is a true psychopath. <br /> < Sandra's tough shell is caused by misery in her past tied in with the murder of her murder, her colleague who acknowledges that Sandra has resolved this case despite being bent by the heavy superior, finally finding out what happened to Sandra herself in her teens, that she must now stand up and exercise and the last scene shows her to start - we hope anyway - to do just that. <br /> <br /> I can see from the few other reviews I have had time to read that this movie would attract a broad group - those interested in the two pampered boys who removed their time with their cruel philosophical will to fool the police and get away with the perfect murder, the relationship between them, who are so cleverly depicted, the horror Some links to the hero's past, a police theme and some smokers and mirrors - as well as to Hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> For those who asked why Bullock's character should have a problematic past, I really think it would be a far less interesting movie if she were just a detective trying to grasp what was going on , with a willing sidekick with help and a man-chauvinist boss. The connection between the murder victim and the detective is necessary to show the detective becoming too involved or otherwise, how would she lose her arrogant boss's confidence and thus almost lose her life? It's hardly an original theme, but it's usually an extremely annoying theme, as this male chauvinist boss brutally tells his frustrated but of course inspired to get out of the case and leave it to someone who obviously doesn't have the right skills to fix it well though sidekick is. I was very worried about the end of what might happen to Sandra's character as her emotional involvement in the case and especially sympathy for the unfortunate victim of crime drove her dangerous with this case alone. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the relationship between Bullock's character and her sidekick. It goes interesting and sometimes very exciting. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two boys is definitely exciting if that is what you were interested in seeing. I felt it was kept low key in some ways, either because the filmmakers didn't want to get into boy-boy friendships too much, or because we didn't have to think about emotions overthrowing their relationship. The film enables you to wonder which boy is responsible for the situation and there are some phrases and the boys show their underlying immaturity in different phases. <br /> <br /> There was one thing I wanted clarified and that's what happens "after the movie ends" when Sandra's character comes to court .... you have to watch movies to know why she is there. <br /> <br /> Very well traded by everyone. I certainly can't agree with those who complained about Bullock's acting - she was amazing. The part suited her very well. The story is gripping, even though murder mysteries are not your thing, and they are not so often mine.
