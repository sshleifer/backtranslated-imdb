I absolutely loved this movie. For me, the best reason to see it is how strong a contrast is from legal dramas such as "Boston Legal" or "Ally McBeal" or even "LA Law". This is REALITY. The law is not BS, won in some final arguments or through some ridiculous defense pulls you out of your ass like "Chewbacca defense" at South Park.) This is a true travesty of justice, the judicial system has gone terribly wrong and the work of good lawyers - not the shyster stereotype that uses all their ability to correct it. It will do more to restore your faith in humanity than any Frank Capra movie or to kill a MOCKINGBIRD. And most importantly, I cried. During the movie, under featurette included at the end of the DVD - it's great. Wonderful movie; wonderfully made. Thank goodness the filmmakers did it.
