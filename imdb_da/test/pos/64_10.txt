Darling Lili is a blend of perfection and magic! The stars; Julie Andrews & Rock Hudson could not have done a better try if they tried. It is full of all the magic a young lady wants, and that makes it seem like everything can happen to you. The director's brilliance Blake Edwards has proved to be the best. He really caught the woman he loved on the screen! <br /> <br /> The mix of each song went perfectly with the moment in the movie. The movie opened with Julie Andrews, who sang Whistling Away In The Dark and closed with the same song by Andrews. For a film of this expertise, which has been such a mistake when released, is a total shock ... <br /> <br /> As is: "Inspiring ... Clean .... Inspiring! " ~ One of Andrew's most memorable lines in this movie!
