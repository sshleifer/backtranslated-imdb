Hilary was great as Julie, and Pat was once again magnificent as Mr. Miyagi, but there should have been more references to the other three movies! I mean, come on! First, where is Daniel? Miyagi makes a very brief mention of him, and that is it. Daniel was his best friend and should at least have made a look in the movie. He could have helped Miyagi take Julie-San! On the cover, the music remained true to the movie, though with a little more instrumentation (Fretless Bass) to accompany the wonderful game Pan-Flute! It doesn't feel like a Karate Kid movie unless you hear Pan-Flute! Thanks Zamfir! Overall, a decent movie though! We miss you Noriyuki!
