Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is COVER GIRL du jour - she is one of the dancing girls in Danny McGuire's club, the most special of Danny (Gene Kelly) and virtually anyone coming over her. Take Vanity Magazine Magnet John Coudair (Otto Kruger): Enchanted by Rusty's resemblance to his grandmother Maribelle (also played by Hayworth in flashbacks), whom he wooed dedicated when he fell in love with her, he tries to revive his youth by fixing of what he thinks went wrong between himself and Maribelle. He doesn't think Danny could give rusty happiness or anything she should be entitled to - he even gets Danny to believe it himself. When Rusty fights as vanity's 'Cover Girl', Danny drove her away in Noel Wheaton (Lee Bowman) ready and waiting arms. So what happens when Danny returns to town with his sidekick Genius (Phil Silvers) tow to discover only that Rusty is getting married to Wheaton? <br /> <br /> As a musical, COVER GIRL enjoys the beautiful score and song written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, including the Oscar-nominated 'Long Ago and Far Away' (possibly one of the most beautiful ballads ever written and beautifully sung like a duet by Hayworth and Kelly), Maribelle's song 'Sure Thing' (the more unclear 'Poor John' is not a Kern / Gershwin collaboration) and 'Put Me To The Test'. The dance is of course front when Gene Kelly had more than just a hand in the choreography. It shows in the simplest dances, such as his dance with Hayworth to 'Put Me To The Test' or the pleasantly stretched 'Make Way for Tomorrow' number (performed by the trio of Danny, Rusty and Genius), obscure the reaction of the character of the gene to police officer in the title number of SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN. Kelly scored a technological and artistic coup with the Alter-Ego dance. Like his successors in ANCHORS AWEIGH and AMERICAN IN PARIS (Jerry Mouse and the 16-minute ballet), this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity Kelly brought to the modern movie music: wants to use the movie medium for current dancer who Unable to be exhibited at a stage, and years before CGI, Kelly insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly match him in talent and style - even. The number is barely five minutes long, but it (and Kelly's genius) still takes its breath away, even fifty years after the line. This is why I looked at COVER GIRL, and if not, this dance is really worth it. <br /> <br /> You can tell that a lot of money was lavish on COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworth - not what she deserves it. Witness the scene when Rusty hits Broadway - the big screen shows all the different girls giving room for a staggeringly large stage facing Rusty's entrance. In fact, Hayworth is one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on the show in the movie, and she dances with a style and grace that is almost worth Kelly. (Very few of Kelly's co-stars have that honor.) She's hilarious in some scenes, for example, her drunk scene when John and Wheaton come to pick her up from Joe's. <br /> <br /> For some reason, her performance still lacks the sparkle of grandeur that would help COVER GIRL overcome its general curse of mediocrity. The curse is lifted only when Gene Kelly is on the screen (dance or no), or when Eve Arden as John's long-suffering secretary 'Stonewall' sits with another cutting comment or clever observation. When the movie finally belongs to Hayworth, neither Kelly nor Arden can save it as a whole. This is not to say that the film is bad - it is not. It's fun, with good songs and cute songs and lots of beautiful girls to watch. But it's just not a classic. The dance is classic though - so watch COVER GIRL for it and you won't regret it.
