This timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated. I can't even count how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing. This is a movie that I could see every few weeks and still love. <br /> <br /> There is something timeless about this movie. I've loved other "blockbuster love story movies" like Pretty Woman and when Harry met Sally. I think their up there, but there's something about Dirty Dancing that just makes it perfect. The characters, the chain between Swaze and Gray, the direction of the movie, the INCREDIBLE dance, the warm summery atmosphere, all about dirty dance is absolutely perfect. It's an instant classic, and I've never really seen a movie like it either before or since. <br /> <br /> I don't think there is a particular element that makes this movie so loved but many things, many of which are mentioned by many reviewers. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, dull, summery mood, realistic characters, a relatively honest message combined with incredible music and dance, and the best dance movie theater ever gave us. <br /> <br /> This movie is always on TV and I will continue to watch it as long as they show it. But I will mention that I have no interest in seeing "Havana Nights", the one they should have left alone.
