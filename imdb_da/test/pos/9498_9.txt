This is apparently the first movie with Gloria Swanson - the movie that made her a breakout star. While she was good at the movie, I can't see how this performance in particular was so remarkable at that time - but it was still a very good movie. <br /> <br /> Gloria plays wife to a rich slob who continually takes her for granted. He cares a little about his care, eats onions and forgets their anniversary! And at the same time, a Lothario enters their lives and begins to place great emphasis on Gloria, and her dippy husband does not even discover or give her any reason not to cheat on him. In the end she separates her hubby and marries the smoothly talking Romeo. But while the movie could have been an overdone melodrama (they were pretty common at that time), it takes some interesting phrases and is an imaginative and fun movie. Although I haven't seen the biggest silent movie, it's a standout and deserves to be remembered. <br /> <br /> This way, the DVD release from Image Entertainment is surprisingly good - with a decent print and music. This has not always been the case for other image releases (especially how scary the managed Chaplin releases).
