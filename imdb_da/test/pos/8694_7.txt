This movie reappears again and again on ABC in Australia at 3 am. <br /> <br /> It starts with the stage of a London crash. <br /> <br /> movies have received flashbacks of every character that the movie progresses, plus the lapsed photo of Big Ben twisted back to symbolize the events that occurred thirteen hours ago until the crash. It took me a while to understand it, but it was fun. <br /> <br /> If Sean Cunningham and Quentin Tarrantino came together to make a movie, it could be the result - due to flashbacks and small stories that merges and deaths. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure about the main characters, as it has been a while since I've seen it, but a rare gem indeed.
