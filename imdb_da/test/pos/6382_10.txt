I saw this on a test screening in Chatsworth a week or so ago, and went with a bunch of my girlfriends. we all really loved it a lot. James Franco is amazing and so hot I just wanted to see it for him !!!!!!! but Sienna Miller is also really good and plays a southern girl who is in love with him so much that she can't get away. David Caradine, who was in Kill Bill, plays a cowboy and he is perfect for it. The story is a little strange, but if you believe in power of love and magic, you will love it !!! It's really original and it's also very fun, and everyone laughed a lot, but eventually it gets more serious and we all ended up crying. I'll see it again with my friends as soon as it comes out, it's really good !!!!!!!
