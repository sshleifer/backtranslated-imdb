I loved this movie. To be very fair, the film starts very slowly, with none of the characters being terribly sympathetic. It continues this way for a good half of the movie. <br /> <br /> But if you are patient, you will be highly rewarded. What the first half of the film lacks in character development and / or sympathy is adequately compensated in the second half. It's a bit like driving a roller coaster - a slow climb up the mountains, then speed, twists and some surprises. As always, Meryl Streep is great. She is our finest actress. William Hurt is good if a little wood in stains. Renee Zellweger does a very good job showing that her performance in Jerry McGuire was not a fly.
