Octavio Paz, Mexican poet, writer and diplomat who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990, said of "Nazarin": "Nazarin follows the great tradition of mad Spaniards who originate from Cervantes. His madness is to take seriously good ideas and try to live accordingly ". A humble and spiritual priest (Francisco Rabal in a wonderful performance) tries to live by Christianity's principles, but is thrown out of his church to help a local prostitute by giving her a shelter after she has committed a murder. Nazarin walks the country's roads in the 20th century Mexico, offering help to the poor and begging for food. His two followers, a murderous prostitute Andara and her sister Beatriz, who are a failed suicide desperately seeking love, consider him saint, but do not prevent him from hate and humiliation from both the church and the people he encounters on the road. He ends up being beaten in jail and begins to question his beliefs in not being able to forgive his attacker. <br /> <br /> Bunuel tells the story in a way that a Christian parable masterfully and uniquely combines admiration and irony for the protagonist and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. The film is simple and deep and beautiful, ironic and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> I see Bunuel as one of the best movie makers ever. I have seen twenty of his films and they belong to all the different periods of his life, but they have in common his magic touch, the masterful combination of gritty realism and surrealism, his curiosity, his curious mind, his sense of humor and his darkness and shining fantasies. With great pleasure, I add a little and almost unknown but incredibly honest and touching surrealistic tragic comedy "Nazarin" to the list of my favorite films.
