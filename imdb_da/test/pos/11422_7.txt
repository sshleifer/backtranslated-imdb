This Stan Laurel comedy card is a cute little parody of Valentino movie BLOOD AND SAND. If you've seen BLOOD AND SAND, you'll probably appreciate this movie and laugh at a couple of the scenes that mock Valentine's film. But if you haven't seen the movie and just watch this movie, you probably won't be very impressed - even though I really liked the title cards, the word "bull" was used repeatedly in very funny ways. <Br /> <br /> Stanly plays "Vaselino" a bullfight that seems pretty bad and wins only because bulls seem lazy and non-aggressive. Even the bull at the end of the movie, which apparently killed ten men, is of course just a domestic bull. Not a good movie of any kind of fantasy, but still a sweet and harmless movie.
