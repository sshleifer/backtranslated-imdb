What can I say about the series called NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm .... Just that was one of the best TV shows ever collected !! You have actors of all ages, the actors who are a little known and then forgot. Everyone plays their role for exact perfection! These shows always have a kind of moral history to them as most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is baptized over the credits and in the beginning and ending, thinks what he says wholeheartedly! Not only do these shows have great stories, they also throw you into them, get your thinking, and your blood is pumped. The original outer borders were a black and white in the 60's right. These shows made a triumphant comeback that I have never seen! The new twilight zone with Forest Whitaker was fun to watch, but New OUTER LIMITS is where it is! If you haven't seen: I'm asking you to check out these episodes and you'll see exactly what I mean! LONG LIVE THE NEW OUTER LIMITS !!!!!!!!!!!!
