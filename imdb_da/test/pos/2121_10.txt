Went to Preview Engagement of "Grand Champion" today (Dallas / Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and a few other Texas cities). There are so few movies suitable for young children ... but this one is and it's great. Although the plot is a small "Hokey" (also the name of the board in the movie), it is a wonderful story for children. And I enjoyed it too. <br /> <br /> The movie represents pretty much West Texas ranch family life, though slightly exaggerated. Director / Author Barry Tubb should get it ever since he grew up in that environment. He called the movie his "love letter to Texas." <br /> <br /> Joey Lauren Adams plays the only mother of Buddy (Jacob Fisher) and Sister 'Blow' (Emma Roberts). See Emma Roberts (Julia Roberts' niece); she is very good and i think she will be in several movies. There are also cameo appearances by Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, musicians George Strait, Charlie Robison, Robert Earl Keen, Joe Ely and Rodeo legends Larry Mahan and Tuff Hedeman. <br /> <br /> If you have young children or just want to watch a good movie, check out "Grand Champion" when it comes to your city (supposedly later this month). You will enjoy it and it will make you feel good. <br /> <br /> I think when I'm from West Texas, I can be a little biased ... yes, I'm impartial. The movie is excellent!
