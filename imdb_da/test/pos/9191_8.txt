This existential thriller, in Portuguese with English subtitles, is a modern version of the American movie modes of the 40s, complete with a surprising twist at the end. It's riveting from the beginning to the end. My only criticism is its poor production values. The movie looks cheap, and it was probably so black and white cinematography is subordinate to that of Godard in Vivre Sa Vie, to name another movie noir more than 30 years earlier. Most insane people, the subtitles are often difficult to read. When will filmmakers learn and give yellow subtitles so they can be read against a white background. I would give this an 8 overall, but with better production values ​​it could have been higher.
