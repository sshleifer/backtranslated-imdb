Loved today's show !!! It was a variety and not just cooking (which would have been great). Very stimulating and captivating, always keep the viewer looking around the corner to see what's coming up next time. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us who made the show even more enjoyable. Special guests who are also friends for a wonderful surprise. Loved the 'first' theme and the audience was invited to play together too. I have to admit that I was shocked to see her come under her time constraints on a few things, but she did it and by golly I write these recipes down. Saving time in the kitchen means more time with the family. Those who have not voted in, find out which channel and time I assure you that you will not be disappointed.
