A fabulous movie that I have seen several times since then buying the video just four days ago. Yes, I'm a Colin Firth Fan and Colin was his usual talented, natural beautiful self. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matthew Field) and Fissy (Sammy, Nimi's 7-year-old son) was very special and so natural to see. They were hilariously fun together and also touched my heart strings. The scenes I loved most were Sammy and Matt sitting on the wall and chatting, and Matt then fell backwards in the fun way (I won't reveal the content of their discussion so as not to ruin the plot). Also very funny was Sammy quizzing Matt about sex, Colin and Fissy were perfect in this scene and doing what can be an awkward topic between adult and child, just so natural. Colin's words and face at the end of that scene were so lovely and said it all! just brilliant. Of course, credit must also go to Fissy Roberts for his lovely depiction of Sammy. He played such a lovable and naughty children's sign. The two actors were just perfect together. The interplay between Colin (Matt) and Nia (Nimi) was perfectly balanced, and I couldn't agree that chemistry between them was great to see, show love, excitement and of course passion. It was exciting to see how their delicate flowering romance gradually unfolded and also showed how their cultural and social divisions influenced their relationship, and it was good to see how Colin and Nia are sensitively portraying Matt and Nimi discovering, accepting, and overcoming these differences. It held me on the TV and guessed right to the end of the movie. Colin's depiction of Matt's vulnerable and juvenile side was also perfectly portrayed, so much so that I found it difficult to see when Matt was so mediocre and childish toward Sammy because he (Matt) felt that Sammy was in the way of his romance / relationship to Sam's Mother Nimi. One could not help feeling very disappointed, angry and frustrated by Matt to treat Sammy in this way, and this threatens to spoil Matt's special relationship with Sammy and Nimi. Colin's special talent for "entering a character's head" and pointing to the audience the various sides of a sign was very present here and pure magic to see. I also have to mention that Colin also has such a good report with young actors (see also "My life so far a wonderful and not to miss movies"). <br /> <br /> I also loved the relationship between Matthew and his wife Jenny, both were excellent at showing the audience the dark side and the tensions within their marriage, and that not all seemingly 'happy marriages' are right what they might think from the outside. <br /> <br /> I must not forget To mention the reverent one I thought was very fun in a serious way! Nimi's mother and family were also fun and bring about the importance of Nimi's culture and her situation. The downside, I can't really find a downside, but to be objective about the film and to give credibility to my review, the only negative comment I would make is that the scriptwriters did not explain in sufficient detail why Matt collapsed in the car, there was only one vague suggestion from Nimi that there was something wrong with his heart tea, however, did not detract from my enjoyment of the film far from it. I just needed to rewind the tape for a second time. I felt that this movie had it all, entertaining, uplifting and I loved the rich colors and sunny scenery. The film warmed a cold winter day and made me smile :-)) All the important elements were there, laughter, love, excitement, sadness, anger, drama and a warm feeling good factor with yes enough of the delicious Colin Firth moments, including a very soaked Colin in a 'Wet Shirt scene', not to miss any fan, what more can a girl want ;-)) <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie, especially to any Colin Firth Fans ;-)
