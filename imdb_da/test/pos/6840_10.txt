In the DVD era, you would think that you could find virtually any piece of crap committed to celluloid and for the most part it is true. So why WHY is it so hard to find this big little girl, clearly done by people who love noir as a loving greeting (very never down in spoofland) of the most cinematic genres. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are here in this and superstar-in-the-making Carla Gugino (KAREN SISCO, SIN CITY) now makes her the trademark red hot babe / great acting routine. <br /> <br /> This movie really has everything for fans of movies. A b noir on steroids, the wise and steaming JUDA KISS succeeds in all counts. <br /> <br /> Please Columbia TriStar PLEASE release it on DVD soon !!!!!!
