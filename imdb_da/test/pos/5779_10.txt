A good documentary reviewing the background of our society's oil dependency, the problem of our current energy consumption, and finally discussing the effects of upcoming energy consumption due to the oil production problem. <br /> <br /> This film must be trained to all students as part of their education. Show it to your children, parents, family and friends. They will finally thank you. <br /> <br /> Having reviewed the contents of this documentary and comparing the sources mentioned, I would say that the facts of this film are well-scientifically supported.
