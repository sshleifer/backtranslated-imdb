"The Honkers" is probably Slim Pick's best performance all the time. When we shoot, everyone was with the production that Slim was the Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond image released at the same time and didn't pay much attention to "The Honkers". Personally, I feel that this film was underestimated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's "Junior Bonner" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our films. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo movie out a few months before our release and it could also have hurt us too. The picture is worth seeing if just for the rodeo footage - some of the best ever filmed - shot by James Crabbe. The director and my co-author, Steve Ianat, died a few weeks after the photo's release, cut short a promising career and left his lovely wife Sally, his daughter, Gaby and newborn son, Stefan. Please give this movie a shot. I bet you would say it was well worth it. I thank everyone who has taken the time to read this. Stephen Lodge
