A very nice film that should have had wider distribution. Ian McShane is right at home, plays the soul loving DJ who gets the can because he won't "go along with the program" and sets out to let the world know what they are missing. The support is also good, and the music is the "soul" of the movie. I just wished the movie would be released so I could get a copy of this for my movie library.
