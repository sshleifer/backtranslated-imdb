I'm torn over this show. While most parts of it turned out to be HILARIOUS, other parts of it showed me to be stupid and simply shock for shock sake. From the wall parody of some of the drawings are brilliant, which are actually many of the scenes with the kids. But I do not think it is wise to make small children say rude things. It's not that I think "oh bad kids they are exploited" - it's just that, it's really not smart !! It's something that anyone could do, so making it as simple and meaningless as making a paper plane. To make this show better, they would have to stick to the natural responses of children that I think may be more fun than the scripted on time. <br /> <br /> By far the funniest part of the Wonder Show is Clarence, the blue puppet wondering around the streets and talking to and annoying strangers. It's really fun and it's most improvised. To see him in a long scene about the importance of patience, the patience of an extremely patient man, was by far the funniest scene in my opinion. <br /> <br /> You should see this show, but because it is all very fun, though silly at times.
