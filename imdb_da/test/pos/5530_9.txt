It was one of the lines of a trailer about this movie, and for once exaggerated publishers did not exaggerate. All six of the highlighted players here are on display 99% of the time so they should be good. <br /> <br /> It's always fascinating how certain plot premises can be worked for either highballing comedy to a deadly serious situation. Mary Boland of ditzy and Charlie Ruggles of henpecked plays their usual characters who are planning to engine all the way to California. Sharing expenses they advertise for someone to share the trip. They get Burns and Allen and a dog's monster. The same premise was a deadly serious one several generations later in California. Of course, if you travel with Gracie Allen, you know you're going to have to try to figure out her Monty Pythonesque reasoning all over the world. And if that's not enough, you'll run into W.C. Fields, part-time sheriff and full-time pool hustler living in sin with Alison Skipworth. But back when we do not dive into such things. <br /> <br /> A really classic comedy from the thirties, not to be missed.
