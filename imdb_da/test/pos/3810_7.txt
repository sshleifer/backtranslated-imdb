DO NOT try to figure out the logic of this story. But ride with the 10-year-old Gus on the most bizarre road trip ever witnessed. More strange characters and incredible situations than a Twin Peaks reunion! Nothing makes sense, but it is impossible to stop seeing Motorama! Now, where can I find that 'R' ????
