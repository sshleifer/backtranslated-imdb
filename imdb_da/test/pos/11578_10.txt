I've seen 'The Sea Within' today and I loved it. The film actors are wonderful (especially Javier Bardem, of course), but I thought Belén Rueda would have a better role. Lola Dueñas, Clara Segura and especially Mabel Rivera perform excellent interpretations. And I can't forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau (brother and father of the protagonist). <br /> <br /> There are two technical aspects I loved a lot: Aguirresarobe's photograph and score of Amenábar itself. I liked the song 'Negra sombra' ('Dark Shadow') by Luz Casal with music by Carlos Núñez. In short, I think the Spanish Academy should choose 'The Sea Within' in Order to compete in the Oscar Awards. I liked other Spanish productions, like Almodóvar's 'Bad Education', but Amenábar's movies are much better than them. 'The Sea Within' deserves all the awards.
