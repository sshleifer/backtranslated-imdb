I went through boot camp at MCRD Parris Island in 1953, and this film is about as accurate a portrayal of what the boots went through during that time, even to bury the heavy sandpit. Many of the "actors" in the movie were active service Marines. This movie can be more entertaining for marines than others, but I feel the movie itself is well done, and Jack Webb made a "good DI". Semper Fi!
