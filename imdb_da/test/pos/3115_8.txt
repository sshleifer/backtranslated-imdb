The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'The Gunfighter' by Henry King and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. 'The Gunfighter' was historically remarkable, as it clearly affects Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist western. <br /> <br /> But I personally find the 'Wagon Master' superior to the modern counterpart. Ford's smaller masterpiece is not just about storytelling; It should be devised more like a poem that describes the concept of old west. Although optimistic and warm in heart, we deserve naivety because it is completely free of pretentious underlining. Green landscape is suitable as it perfectly supports the poetic narrative. Add natural camera work and we are transported among the Mormon travelers to see Western folklore told in cinematic means.
