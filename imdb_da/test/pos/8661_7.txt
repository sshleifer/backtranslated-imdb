This Norwegian movie starts with a man who jumps over the subway, who apparently commits suicide. But the next scene shows him that he comes in a lonely bus into a desert. He meets a man and is sent to a mysterious city where he starts working in an aseptic modern office as an accountant. The employees look good, if they are guarded, he quickly encounters a girlfriend, but the city seems quite strange since food does not have any flavor, alcohol does not fill you up and there are children nearby. Is it a dream, or is he in paradise or in hell? While at times the movies look like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone (though ninety minutes, the movie looks a bit long), it's pretty thoughtful. The best scenes are those where the exaggeration is minimal, as when people engage in banal conversations about decor and recoil to discuss deeper issues. I always thought there was something inhumane in advanced capitalist societies, in the way they are trying to suppress the basic forces of human nature. And this movie is best when the devastating criticizes this lifestyle. Unfortunately, the movie ends very long, and the director doesn't seem to know how to finish it, but most of the time it is very worth seeing.
