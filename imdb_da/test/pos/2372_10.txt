Dead or Alive: Final, the movie that apparently brings the three films together in the very loose Dead or Alive trilogy, and is mainly associated with its stars, Riki Takeiuchi and Sho Aikawa, and that each movie has its share of bizarro world fittings and neuroses and lots of violence are the weakest of the party. The fact that none of the three films end up being a disappointment is less of a testament to the creativity of the material, but to the pound-for-pound intestine that director Takashi Miike takes with the surroundings and material. Here he presents an overtly dystopian future, yet low key, where a gay mayor / dictator (Richard Chen) has drugged the whole village apart from a group of rebels. There are also replicas-robots - in this year in 2346, one of them is Ryo (Aikawa), a robot with complete lethal skill, but also with the ability to love and learn, and so on. Then, a policeman, Takeshi (Takeiuchi), happens as the mayor's supreme guard. But things start to tear on both sides, Ryo joins with the rebels and Takeshi with his employer, although blood-pervaded accidents like a hostage have gone bad, and with Takeshi finding out his wife and son are robots (not finished in a strange mood , think of you, just suddenly as if in power went out, and that he himself is one. And it all leads to a last inexplicable showdown between the two men. Nice that there is still a movie where Miike has peaks and falls here, sometimes finding the middle success story where science fiction may have some impact on it. But there is really nothing to do with this story, except that the mayor / dictator is a backbone dingbat that gets his stones away and makes sure his drug stops couples from getting pregnant and that everything stays under control. He also has with him his love slave, I would guess, in the fun, non-speaking part of a saxophone player who also doubles sometimes as a human armature when he does not join the moody blues. Meanwhile, we get the conventional pages for Ryo and Takeshi's stories, and they are never uninteresting, just not quite convincing enough to interest. Of course, Miike has no fun, as when Takeshi plops Michelle (Maria Chen) into the water to make her swim after a close-up search on the mayor or to have the original rebel leader speaking English for no good reason at all. There is even a playful greeting to old sci-fi cartoons at the start of the film. But there is nothing very convincing, except for Takeshi's smaller turn to become "good" midway through the movie (helping a couple bring in clearance to have a child), and mostly Miike's forces this time are purely stylistic and in choice of places and sets. <br /> <br /> It's like a grungy Japanese Alphaville where everything still has a modern feel through all the special effects. And I really liked the yellow-green hue Miike used through the movie, as it has been very good in outdoor scenes and added just enough grinetiness to the indoor scenes. But with regard to peaks and valleys, this is increasingly evident - and the sci-fi movie channel level of visual effects, with perhaps a few dollars put into it - under climax. This contains some of the funniest material in the most frightening, freudian sensibility of the director, even though it has to start with unbearable controversy; The way Ryo and Takeshi finally meet up is a bit random and only a means for the producers to try and cheaply tie the last two films together, as it was not necessary. On the other hand, with regard to the pure guilty entertainment value of a girl like Miikes, where one sees something completely unexpected and very grossly sexual, it is right up there with the best scenes in Katakuris and Visitors Q's happiness. Overall, the death or Alive: Final is a cheesy 90 minute effort that doesn't take itself too seriously, and is better off the more for its evil contrivances, militaristic decay, and cultural hangings showing pulp level display.
