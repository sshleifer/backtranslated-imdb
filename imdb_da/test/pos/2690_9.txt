I think my husband and I are a little slow. We usually do not heat up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn't start to see KoQs until nearly the sixth season. I'm not sure how far it was from our radar. Apart from the fact that we are not big fans of "deal" TV viewing. Our plans are ours, so we don't like to commit ourselves to watching series every time they come in (and we didn't have a DVR yet). So I suppose it wasn't until TBS started running reruns on their daily lineup that evening, which we began to see consistently. <br /> <br /> When we were hooked, there were only a few seasons left before the series was canceled. But we still see it almost daily on TBS. I almost prefer to watch series this way because you can see more episodes day after day and it helps build continuity and what happens to the characters without having to wait a whole week. <br /> <br /> But the episodes stand alone since the stories are not transferred from week to week. But it's fine with me because you can see an episode, so miss weeks - and still pick up. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that writing was not always consistent. Some episodes would be scandalously hilarious, and some would only be mildly fun. So I'm not sure it had the quality of writers that Seinfeld or Raymond had. But I loved the casting and the characters are all credible and realistic. Kevin James is just fun to watch! So, although the ground is not so big, James makes body language and expressions worth seeing. Leah Remini is great as the "play-it-all" wife. I think it's harder to play the same character for laughs than the comic character, and she does a good job. She has an ability for sarcasm and insults like no other. She's a tough cookie! And who can forget Arthur as Carrie's father, who lives with them in their basement. <br /> <br /> This was a fantastic series and I was sorry when it was canceled. But a big thank you to TBS for keeping the king alive in reruns!
