How often do you see a movie of any kind that has a talent show with refreshments? Waldo's last stand is a refreshment. Here Waldo sells lemonade, but doesn't make money. Alfalfa, Spanky, Darla, Mickey and Buckwheat are going to visit him, which is ironic because in both men in a bathtub and came The Brawn, where there was competition between Alfalfa and Waldo for Darla's love. Back to the story: The Gang tastes lemonade to see if Waldo did it right. A fun moment is when Alfalfa gets a glass cup for lemonade, and Waldo fills is and gives it to Darla and Alfalfa has an angry expression on his face. Spanky suggests a floor show to go with lemonade and even Mickey agrees with that ever so sweet. When the floor show starts, no one is on the barn, but then a customer comes in (Froggy). Spanky asks him if he wants lemonade, but all he does is no no. Spanky asks him time on cards and every time Froggy nods no Spanky shows many expressions on his face, which is fun. Spanky tries many ways to make him thirsty. One way is when Mickey ever said so sweet. "These crackers are salty and they made me thirsty". There are also many entertaining musical bits this card. The opening number is by Darla, which she presses on dances and sings. The other contains Alfalfa singing off-key (as usual) with Mickey, Leonard, Spanky and Buckwheat about "How dare I!" (I think they sing it to make Froggy thirsty. It also made me laugh.) The closing number includes boys and girls, all dressed in an old fashioned way. This was Waldo's last Our Gang card. A great musical card that is a mere 10 out of 10.
