I love the Thackeray short story on which this movie is based. And while this modern version of Becky Sharp's story is a B movie, the casting of Loy in its first top-billed role is pretty fascinating. Before Loy, MGM's reigning good girl in many beautiful and comical roles, she was an actress. VANITY FAIR was Loy's follow-up film to EMMA, where she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroyed the loyal housekeeper (Marie Dressler). Loy's Becky is much nastier than Miriam Hopkins' version 3 years later in BECKY SHARP. Loy's Becky is very much a pre-code movie character with her offensive neck and amoral ways. It's the kind of character that Jean Harlow or Clara Bow could easily have played, but Becky here still needs to be the giant set. That's what makes her fallen character so tragic. <br /> <br /> Unlike Loy's grasping, Becky is the good good Amelia (Barbara Kent) who is just not an interesting character. Mary Forbes is icily good as Mrs Sedley. Most of the other players in this version are pretty blah: Conway Tearle as Rawdon; Walter Byron as Osborne; Anthony Bushell as Dobbin. Others are almost Dickensian's quirkiness: Billy Bevan as Joseph; Lionel Belmore as Crawley; Montagu Love as Marquis; Lilyan Irene as Polly maid; Elspeth Dudgeon as housekeeper. <br /> <br /> Loy is in the front and middle of the whole. While the finish is pretty shocking, she has several good scenes, such as the gambling scene in the casino, where she tries to steal another woman's winning roulette bet. The more Loy's Becky comes down morally, the more beautiful she gets until she is finally "caught". The bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance of Loy in a movie to be seen.
