Last year was the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the release of the "Origin of Origin", so it is appropriate that Jon Amiel's "Creation" was released. The film focuses on the period of Darwin's (Paul Bettany) life while writing his famous work and the gentle strain it put on his family life. I suppose the movie played over Darwin's excitement with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly) and his guilt over his late daughter Annie, but I still think of Darwin's theory as a karatehak on religious dogma. As it was, the United States was one of the last countries where "Creation" found a distributor because of the debate on creationism evolution (yes it still goes). All in all, this is not a masterpiece, but I highly recommend it as I recommend "inheriting the wind". One day I hope the debate on creationism evolution will not be a problem. If this movie helps put the debate to rest, then more power for everyone in the movie! Also starring Martha West, Jeremy Northam, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch.
