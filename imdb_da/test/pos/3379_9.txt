GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has to be the best Robim Williams I've ever seen. He seems perfect. It was like seeing Robim Williams as he really was and is. It almost made me cry and looked at him. <br /> <br /> I didn't know that Robin was as close to a friend of John Belushi as he was. The description of this relationship was very good and could almost be at its own merit. Very sad, what both went through. <br /> <br /> I really felt for both Val and Robin in their hard times. I'm glad they ended it with a high note! <br /> <br /> I hope Robin puts a $ 100 bill into this guy's hat! <br /> <br /> And it was great that it was filmed in Vancouver!
