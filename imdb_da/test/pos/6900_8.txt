OKAY. Finally, a horror movie that's done well. As soon as I heard the music, I knew that an effort was made to create what I consider to be an almost masterpiece of good accident. Zombies, whores, splashes, digging snatching and more. A great cast, well acted, well directed, well-written --- there was hardly a mistake. Even the American actors with Irish / English accents really pulled it out. I thought the actor Larry Fessenden knew me. It was the missing tooth. Finally, I realized that this guy was the leader in "Habit" a movie about vampires in NYC. I thought he was excellent in that role. Now I wonder if he is American or not. His accent was so convincing in "I sell" that I thought he should have grown up in the Emerald, not in the United States. He is apparently a born and raised New Yorker. A great actor - really made his own role in this movie. Nothing beats a horror flip in the early 19th century Europe (like the old Hammer flicks.) I urge anyone who wants a good time to watch this well-developed movie.
