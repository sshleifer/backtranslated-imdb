I just can't believe the low scores for this movie. Likely cause has to do with the low number of votes, which means few people have seen it. This is simply a fantastic movie! There are so many stories inter-wined inside, but it's not complicated. Each character grows with the movie, and we experience with those who undergo life changes. The landscape is simply stunning and the final credits are the best ever in any movie I've seen (like a Shakespeare game). Yes, it is a bit dated (filmed in 1982), but the problems facing the characters are very current. It could have been filmed in 2002 without any changes to the story. Raul Julia is great, best role ever in a movie - this is his signature. A young Molly Ringwald is excellent as she matures from girl to young woman. Susan Sarandon is perfect as a young carefree woman and John Cassavetes is the power that puts everything together. Do yourself a favor, find this movie, see it and enjoy it. Come back to IMDb and score this movie in the top 250 of all time where it really belongs.
