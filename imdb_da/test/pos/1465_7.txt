The Soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant on parts. You must see it because of its strong characterization and the risks that the plot of two troubled individuals fall into love takes. You need to know the story through various other reviews so we can talk about what is brilliant about this movie. First, the two main characters are so real and such exciting personalities. The first is a woman who has chosen a relationship in four years and is angry enough to sleep with someone who comes to her. The other is a man who has always wanted to be a woman whose pain and loneliness is shown with so much sensitivity and shine. You hate the former and your heart is bleeding for the latter. <br /> <br /> The other thing about this movie is the whole concept of loving one for who you are, regardless of gender. So, would you still love your partner if he / she had to change his gender? The film explores the idea and it is a beautiful one. <br /> <br /> But there's a point where the movie fails. I wish the relationship between the protagonists had evolved in a better way. That what they feel is love does not come to the end. But see it and write your thoughts on this .......
