Aaliyah blows all the female cast members out of the water, including the official love interest of Marguerite Moreau. <br /> <br /> I would have loved to watch this movie play out as Akasha's power trip. Aaliyah is simply electrifying when she is on the screen. She makes sensual, beautiful and threatening power of 10. Watching that she takes a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold. <br /> <br /> Lena Olin is thrown into the ungrateful role of "the elderly woman", which is very unjustified. She looks great, and at 46 (according to IMDb) it still looks great. Unfortunately, the story is very limited plot wise, we've seen everything before, etc. <br /> <br /> The most heartbreaking is Akasha's death scene, especially considering what happened to Aaliyah after the movie. All in all, a remarkable vampire movie.
