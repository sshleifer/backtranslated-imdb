Wow. We saw this movie in the hope that it would have at least some decent rock climbing scenes. We were disappointed there, but it was still a good movie! It was sooo cheesy it was amazing! I haven't laughed so hard at a movie for a long time. If you are in rock climbing and you enjoy cheesy movies then this is for you!
