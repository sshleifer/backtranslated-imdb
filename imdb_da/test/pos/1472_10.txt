Ok, when I rented this several years ago, I had the worst expectations. Yes, the play is not amazing, and the picture itself looks dated, but when I sat there, a strange thing happened. I started to like it. The action is great and there are few scenes that will make you jump. Brion James, perhaps one of the greatest B-class actors next to Bruce Campbell, is amazing as always. The story is not bad either. Now I would not rush and buy it, but you will not waste your time at least seeing this good b-grade post-apocalyptic Western.
