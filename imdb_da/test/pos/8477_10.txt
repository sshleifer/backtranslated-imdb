Brilliant Biographic FILM ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Now, it is definitely one of my very fav. Biographical film. This movie came as a total surprise to me. I had avoided this movie for a very long time. Now it was because I'm not a fan of Jamie Foxx. I'm still not a big fan of him, but I'm sure I'm a fan now. <br /> <br /> Well, he deserved every BIT of that Oscar. His performance is one of the best performances I've seen for a long time. He's really sensational! <br /> <br /> Now, the story or Flow of the story Brilliant for a biographical movie. I'm a DRAMA fan so I wasn't bored at all. <br /> <br /> I was too much surprised to feel like the movie so much that I didn't see any mistakes in the movie. I think there are no mistakes in the movie. Maybe some events error But who's caring? <br /> <br /> The performance of the woman playing Ray's Mother was also really good. And well Kerry Washington ?? she has so much potential .. if they get the right role she might just be the next oscar winner. <br /> <br /> Well the story of those movies was so EMOTIONEL so silly .. I cried ?? I cried very badly ???? <br /> <br /> I don't give anything wrong if things were crazy or not cuz this movie mad me crying ?? And that's a lot for me! <br /> <br /> All in all, a SUPERB FILM ????. One of the very best of this century! <br /> <br /> 10/10
