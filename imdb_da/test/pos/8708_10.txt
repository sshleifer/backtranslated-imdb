This is a perfect example of a movie in Classic Full Moon Pictures. Any fan of the Horror / Vampire Flicks should definitely check this out. Original Plot and good, easy to follow story. Also, this movie has some heart-racing scenes that combine Horror with action. From now on, the only sequel I've seen on this movie, Part IV, which I must say is almost better than this original. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this should check puppet master, slumber party massacre, skinned Alive, Sleep Away Camp and other Full Moon Pictures flicks.
