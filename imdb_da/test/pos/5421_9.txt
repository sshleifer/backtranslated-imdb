This is a very strange little short film that initially did not impress me. From a purely aesthetic point of view, the animation here is certainly not beautiful - but after a while you notice that the simple and silly drawings have some odd charm. This is probably due to the fact that with the script as screwed like this, the animation works. <br /> <br /> The movie shows an older couple sitting at the table, playing Scrabble. At the same time, they are fixed on this game or other bizarre pursuits (as man's compulsion to see things - even chair and table)! And all this happens as the television warns of awaiting nuclear destruction - Armageddon is certainly here! Of course, the neighbors are screaming and running amok - during which time the couple continues unconsciously with this idiotic game. Heck, even their cat knows that the end comes when the couple begins to confess who may or may not have cheated - leading to a very surreal ending! The movie deserves kudos for being both unique and fun. While not winning Oscar, it was nominated for Best Animated Short - as it really deserved.
