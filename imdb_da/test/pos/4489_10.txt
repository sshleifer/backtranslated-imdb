This is one of the classic TWILIGHT ZONE episodes, where in the simplest of situations the viewer was drawn into a seemingly symbolic conflict, only to find the solution surprisingly and strangely acceptable. Five characters are inside a container / prison: a major, a ballerina, a bagpiper, a clown and a tramp. They are certainly an odd choice of types to be in this isolation chamber, but they are all in it (anyway) and they are trying to figure out why they are there. What do they have in common? No one can figure it out. But gradually the major organizes them to work to knock out by standing on each other's shoulders. And the major who goes to the top of the figure when the entrance, and .... I'll leave it, though one of the other criticisms on this thread actually gives the story away. <br /> <br /> The title seems to be suggested by SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH FOR A CAR, Pirandello's famous game. Whether the real purpose of the show was to spoof the game is questionable: Pirandello's characters analyze their roles and relationships. But the five characters here, while trying to understand their situation, are completely in the dark - they are not in the situation of the six figures in Pirandello who know their current situation. This uncertainty about what is going on allows viewers to believe it is an abstract drama. <br /> <br /> Actors, William Windon as Major and Murray Mattheson as especially the Clown, provide good accounts for themselves. And the conclusion whether it is planned as a spoof or not is quite effective.
