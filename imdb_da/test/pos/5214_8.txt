This is one of the best TV movies I've ever seen! The title makes it so obvious and predictable, but come on, all TV movies are like that! <br /> <br /> The story is amazing. It may seem ridiculous, but it is based on an incredibly true story. Gary Cole plays a military man named Dave who feels trapped in his marriage. He surrenders his wife and children and then his death falls! All in all he could be with Alyson (Karen Sillas). How far will Dave go to keep his secret? <br /> <br /> The action is top notch for television movies. In particular, Gary Cole holds the film together as a charming, smooth-talking sociopath that has an answer to everything when his wife becomes suspicious. Karen Sillas does the best she can as a wife who discovers her husband is a LIAR and doesn't know what to do about it. Teddi Siddall, who I believe is Gary Cole's real-life wife, plays her role well, especially when she cries about her husband's "death". Wendy Makkena adds a good touch as Alyson's sister. Linda Goranson is amazing in her little role as Dave's mother. <br /> <br /> Predictably, however, the play and story take this movie up several notches.
