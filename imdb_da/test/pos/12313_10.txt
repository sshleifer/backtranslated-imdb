I think John Houston's "The Dead" is a true classic. It was not just Houston's last film he was quoted and saying "everything I know about filmmaking is in this movie." The story, closely matched by "Dubliners" by James Joyce, is a large ensemble piece featuring sterling performances by Angelica Houston, John's daughter and a cast of English and Irish actors bringing life to life. This is a movie that should be part of a serious collection, not only because it is visually elegant but because the story is timeless and very appealing. The movie is not hurried, nor is it charged with action. The story unfolds rather from the characters that bring light and meaning to the dialogue. The end of the movie is fantastic, poetic and joking. I recommend "The Dead" without reservation as one of the finest movies ever made.
