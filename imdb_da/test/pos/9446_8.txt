Okay, so I don't understand why people get so worse about this movie. So I thought it would be the usual Amanda Village movie, but it wasn't. It was amazing. Okay, okay, so the play wasn't the best, but I thought the show was still great. You could also tell that the actors were having fun while making this movie. In other movies that have surprisingly won awards where the actors did not like to work on the movie, you could tell it. All the actors had chemistry, and it also showed. <br /> <br /> A lot of people are ripping off the football skills that the actors have. Yah, so they're not perfect ... get over it! They are actors, not football players. I have played football throughout my life and trust me, it's hard to learn, so stop ripping at the level of skills they have. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be stupid, but it was really fun. The way Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum can make a situation fun without saying anything is fun. I found myself laughing a lot in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall .. I love it!
