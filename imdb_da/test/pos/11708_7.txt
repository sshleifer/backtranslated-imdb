I was very impressed with the latest production from Mick Molloy. As a fan of his, I was used to a different kind of humor than shown here. He chose wisely with a more subtle, broad comedy style in Crackerjack, rather than his usual low forehead, in your face ramblings. It is sometimes inconsistent and uneven, but a decent script works past it and gives some entertaining viewing. Directed by Paul Moloney (who has directed almost every Australian television series conceivable), the Crackerjack tells the story of Jack Simpson, a block belonging to his local bowls club for the sole reason of parking. When the club hits financial problems, he has to compete competitively in an attempt to raise funds to save the club from becoming a poker player. A well-known and successful formula that is well managed. There is no denial that the film owes it to the success of Molloy's great casting. He seemed to have a big report with Samuel Johnson and excellent chemistry with Judith Lucy, and while the character is probably not far from his own personality, one cannot wonder why he hadn't tried his arm on film before. To smooth the experienced casting, the glorious Frank Wilson and Bill Hunter support and often steal their scenes. They are two fine actors, and the couple cross their roles with ease. Had it not been for the great success of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding', Crackerjack would have made it number one at the Australian Ticket Office, but when you consider what he is filming about and who is involved, it even does The number 2 was an excellent bet. All in all, a witty, good movie. Great cast, great crew and a good soundtrack, combine to make one of the better Australian movies from 2002. 7/10.
