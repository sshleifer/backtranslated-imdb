And nothing wrong with that! I welcome the comments of Boblipton and Snow Leopard. <br /> <br /> I'm thrilled to find this movie available on American DVD - I've only seen it once - I persuaded the Goethe Institute here in London to show it in their Conrad Veidt season for some years ago - and long to see it again. <br /> <br /> Barrymore is glowing when involved, as in this movie, possibly due to having a famous German actor as a foil. And Veidt is such a wonderful stage speaker (doesn't he choose his nose at some point?) This is one of the prominent films to connect 'Dr Jekyll' to '20th Century', 'Grand Hotel' or 'Midnight'; and 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 'or' The Student of Prague 'with' The Spy in Bladk ',' Contraband 'and' Casablanca '. <br /> <br /> See it!
