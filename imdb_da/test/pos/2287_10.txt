This is an excellent, little-known movie. Tom Selleck does an excellent job of performing in this movie, with the Japanese 'Clint Eastwood'. I would like to see if this movie has come out on DVD yet, there are some spots that have been clearly cut. Hiroku (Tom's love interest) has clearly had some parts crooked. It would be interesting to see more of Japan in the movie. The baseball sequences are by far the most realistic of any baseball movie, I am quite sure that most of the actors were current or former baseball players. I love to put the tape on this movie at least once a year. Best scenes involve the lack of hat tipping after Tom gets beaned in the big game and an intense sensual scene by Tom has a hot bath with Hiroku. Dennis Haysbert also does a good job, it is good to see that he finally gets some recognition, not only in baseball movies (he was also in Major League).
