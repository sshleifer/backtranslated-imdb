This is a solid underrated little thriller that has thrill-a lot, with a cool story, Sandra Bullock is amazing! All the characters are great, and I was surprised at how unpredictable it was as there were only some predictable moments, plus Sandra Bullock is simply amazing in this! Jeremy Northam played a great villain and I know what Bullock's character is all about because I'm the same type of person (I almost never go out), plus it's pretty well made and written mostly. This should be higher than 5.5 in my opinion, plus Denis Miller was surprisingly better than expected in his small role. The scene where Northam terrorizes Bullock on his boat was quite exciting and was one of my favorite moments, and I also liked the chase scene in the carnival, plus I liked the end too, as it was quite well done, though I did think Northam was defeated too quickly. There are also many other good hunting scenes and it is also wise at times too, plus there are also a few shocking moments. This is a solid underrated little thriller that has thrills a lot, with a cool story, Sandra Bullock is amazing, I highly recommend this one !! The direction is amazing!. Irwin Winkler makes a fantastic one! Jobs here with excellent camera work, adding good atmosphere, good angles and keeping the movie at a very fast pace. The action is amazing! Sandra Bullock is amazing as always and is great here, she is extremely sympathetic, tough as nails but quite vulnerable and I could feel for her, because as I said I am like Angela, I almost never go out, I really do Enjoyed her work in this movie! (Bullock Rules !!!!!!!). Jeremy Northam is excellent as the villain, he was insidious, unpredictable and very threatening, he was great. Dennis Miller is surprisingly OK and not annoying in his little role and managed to bring some comic books. The rest of the throw is fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. *** 1/2 out of 5
