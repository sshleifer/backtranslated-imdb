One of Warner Brothers' best and highest-selling films during the thirties was this charming family drama about a widower living with her virgin sister who raises four daughters. But not four every day write daughters. Everyone has been trained by their musical father on instruments and one as a singer. They make some beautiful music together, even if it is for the long-haired set. <br /> <br /> You can see the infinite number of roles that Claude Rains played over the years and still odd as he shows you yet another aspect of his creative personality. The opportunistic Vichy Captain in Casablanca is as diverse as the researcher is sour in the invisible man as a patient and wise job in Mr. Skeffington. All the same man and everyone so incredibly different. <br /> <br /> Here he travels the four girls with love spiced up with a little grouchiness by their willingness to accept modern music. Lane Sisters and Gale Page can know Beethoven, but they are also hep cats and can beat Dad eight to the bar each time. And if Rains gets a little too testy than Aunt May Robson can put him in his place. <br /> <br /> With four daughters unmarried at the time you know it will change. All sisters develop romantic interests in Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, Jeffrey Lynn and John Garfield. Of course, the mating process becomes a bit complicated, and one of the sisters suffers a tragedy, but it promises to work out when the movie ends. Four Daughters is also known as John's debut film Garfield. Other than a little bit in Footlight Parade years earlier, Garfield had no other film roles. But he was praised on the New York scene for his performance in Golden Boy and Warner Brothers signed him and found the perfect movie debut role as the cynical musician who just can't quite get a decent break in life. It earned him a nomination for the Best Support Actor in 1938, but he lost to Walter Brennan for Kentucky. <br /> <br /> This movie was so popular that it was virtually a small cottage industry for Jack Warner. Sequels with cast members like Daughters Courageous, Four Mothers, Four Wives all cleared up at the cash register office before World War II. And Warner Brothers reminded it of Frank Sinatra and Doris Day playing the parts from which John Garfield and Priscilla Lane originated. Now they made two beautiful music. <br /> <br /> A timeless mold was still created in Four Daughters, and the movie stays 70 years after it was first seen.
