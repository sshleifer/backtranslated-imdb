Abandoning the drawbacks and shortcomings of the movie mentioned by other viewers, I have to say that it seemed to me a movie of power which, in my opinion, is one of the most ambiguous illusions. I saw an emperor and people's drama. It seems to me that the director wanted to ask a question of what the benefits of nation are and what the price of "happiness" is for everyone. Is there justification for the enforced benefit and "happiness"? How much can be forfeited for the nation's security and peaceful existence? Is the idea of ​​a strong will be empire worth reducing to misery and killing thousands of citizens now? It seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and seeks to learn it all the time as the film runs. He is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically harassed by the discovery of his true origin. He seems to half hate his subjects in order to renounce his father and his love, half love the people as a good emperor should. No wonder his actions are controversial and emotions confused. I think that like another movie that presents the problem of power over man over other men, the movie is a success.
