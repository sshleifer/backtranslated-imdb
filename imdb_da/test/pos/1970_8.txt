I've watched this movie twice, and the theme is a refreshing one. I have been in computers for many years now, and this film inspired me in a technological sense, like a fresh love that burned the furnace of my poetic passion in the heat of difficulty. Very original idea, great collection in the way it keeps you as it tells its story to minds who need a release from everyday life in this life.
