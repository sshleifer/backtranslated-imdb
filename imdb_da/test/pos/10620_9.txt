I've seen this movie only once, and I'm looking forward to seeing it again and again. Dear David (from Beligium), why are you having trouble writing a comment on this movie? I just think we can think of you (after reading your comment), you are deliberately a non-sexual person (like Erika in the movie) and you are not ready for the new cinema that comes up. I think you are a bit old and sexual expression is not part of your "visage". The Cannes Film Festival is by far the best film festival, and I am pleased to say that this film was awarded with: Best Actress, Best Actor and Grand Prix. Isabelle Huppert is magnificent, as always, who would make this movie like her? One of her best performances ever. The music is amazing, and again Michael Haneke puts reality on the big screen. It's like a Dogma95 kind of movie because of the subject. Try to see it. <br /> <br />
