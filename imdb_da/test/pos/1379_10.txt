I tried to find out why I enjoyed this movie ?? It's not because of money spent on it, that's for sure !! Did I see a painted water gun in there? Maybe they don't have the same kind of visual effects houses in Scotland? Or maybe they just don't have money? The show clearly shows a gang of very good guys making a film against the odds. Fantastic! But what I really liked was the laughs of the performances. Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead parts as 2 normal guys. No Hollywood histrionics here. <br /> <br /> So the effects don't work very well. The spaceships just don't look as good as they should in today's FX world, and I've seen much better free stuff on youtube. But the film stays together very well when they come to the planet. Was this filmed in Scotland or just by a Scottish crew? Or does it just work better? Did they edit the water? In the end, I kindly loved this movie and was disappointed when they all died.
