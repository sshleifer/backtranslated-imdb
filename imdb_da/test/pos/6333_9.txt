Having watched the film many years ago and been disappointed with the wasted potential when I heard it was a television series, I refused to see it. My best friend immediately became a huge fan and knew my love for horror movies that I couldn't believe I wouldn't see a single episode. I told him that the movie had scared me for life as far as something BUFFY was worried about and he told me to forget that the movie even existed. He insisted that I give two episodes a shot: "Once More With Feeling" and this one. <br /> <br /> Both are why I'm a BUFFY fan today. He was right - I was immediately connected. I have never seen a gut show to dare to try an episode that has no dialogue and nothing else could have turned it off with panache and the pure creativity of BUFFY. I think X FILES might love it if they first thought about it, but I'm glad BUFFY did it instead. <br /> <br /> It is a credit to everyone involved that you are ridden for the whole hour, sometimes hanging on the edge of your seat. And when it was over, I wanted to know more about each character. So I went out and bought Season One boxed set. And the rest is history ... I guarantee you that if you've never seen it, you'll also want to see more if you do this episode for your first. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give it 10 out of 10 is because I reserve this score for "Once More ..."
