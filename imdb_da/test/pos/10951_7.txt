A vampire prince falls for a human girl, unaware that her brother is a famous vampire hunter. It is the underlying theme of this martial art that borrows ideas from "Underworld" and "Buffy The Vampire Slayer", but manages to maintain its own style. I was bemused by the UK and Hong Kong title "The Twins Effect" as there are no twins involved in the story. It turns out that the two main female characters are played by Hong Kong pop stars performing as "The Twins". Don't let this put you off. These girls can act (at least well enough for this type of movie) and add a lot of charm to the case. Jackie Chan faces a few cameo appearances adding a touch of his own brand of slapstick mayhem to the case. All in all, it is fun for those who like their vampires, served by a helper with heavy-in-kind humor.
