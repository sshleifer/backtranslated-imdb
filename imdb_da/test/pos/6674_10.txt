I thought this movie was heavily underestimated. The subject seems that it would be a little strange and I was dismissed first, but when I saw the movie it didn't seem strange at all. I was fascinated by all the different opportunities the story had to offer, and I couldn't wait to figure out how it would end. When it once ended .... I thought about it long after. I was happy with everything about K-Pax, from the play and the story and the scientific elements and psychological problems to the end. It's not a particularly optimistic or happy movie, even though it makes you chuckle from time to time, but I found it to be particularly entertaining and thoughtful. I own it now and intend to see it many times.
