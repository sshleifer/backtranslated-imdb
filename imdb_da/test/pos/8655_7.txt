Went my attention to Netflix Instant Play because it was only an hour and a half (it is approaching 4 am here) and because it is Norwegian that I wanted to follow with Dead Snow and see what the country is offering in international cinema right now. A movie and a gigantic storm, this movie has a man, Andreas, who is sent out to some purgatory of a brave new world city where everyone is happy and bland, and food has no taste, no smell and even sex loses its appeal . After a hilarious attempt at the latter, Andreas tracks down a man with similar complaints, and the two discover a small, vagina-shaped hole in a concrete wall from which music radiates. The two attempts to break through to see what is on the other hand, trace a little light they can hardly see. But of course, in fantasy allegory country it is not allowed and disagreement, and the city's elements work to end Andreas's attempts at freedom and sensuality. <br /> <br /> Jens Lien and crew create a simple, straight-forward movement to the story, one that flows well with its themes and moves along with just enough of a pace to stop disappearing. The similarities in other similar science fiction are not worth mentioning, but still the film has a unique feeling and balances some very funny scenes with some quite scary. I like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie, some disembowelment and flagellation that get your heart strain harder than Christ's Passion simply because it is so completely out of the grayish mise-one scene. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is a reliable squirrel actor who physically feels out of place from his surroundings, which works very well. Despite the fact that the concept itself is nothing to write home about, everyone is involved, and the film fully discovers its own world. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
