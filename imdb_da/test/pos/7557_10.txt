... that maybe someday people will wake up to. People who can resist the urge to separate everything and who sees the 60s for what they were. People who see that were the people who made these times; not the other way around. <br /> <br /> The Forrest Gump comparison is a good one. Both films look at the 60s, but "Four Friends" is about people, as opposed to caricatures. FF delves deep into the much that FG (quite successful!) Tries to condense and classify as nothing more than a backdrop. But while "Gump" puts the 60s away in a ceiling like old toys in a box, "Four Friends" picks up and embraces each toy and thus blurs the lines between what you hold a lot and what you are. <br /> <br /> If you connect romance with shock polish, you will hate this movie.
