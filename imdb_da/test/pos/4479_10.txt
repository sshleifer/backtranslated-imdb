I remember reading the original Balzac story in college French. <br /> <br /> I remember Ken Nordine from WGN TV in Chicago, who reads it as one of his sennat shows. <br /> <br /> Always loved history but never believe they could or would make a movie of it. To my surprise, they did and did very well. Few of any Balzac stories lend to dramatization, which is unfortunate, and -cat loves me, I always hoped it would be filmed without a lot of Hollywood dress up. This is as close to perfect conversion as possible. <br /> <br /> The theater of the mind is always better than what the eye can see, but it is as close as I think it can make the imagination of reading meet the reality of seeing.
