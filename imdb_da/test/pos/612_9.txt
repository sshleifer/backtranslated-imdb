Grief and nostalgia permeates Late Chrysanthemums, a 1954 film by Japanese author Mikio Naruse, which now undergoes a retrospective of his long inaccessible films thanks to James Quandt of Cinematheque Ontario and The Japan Foundation. Based on three stories by Fumiko Hayashi, the late chrysanthemums tell the story of four retired geishers who are now middle-aged, whose lives have become full of disappointment and regret. The performance is uniformly excellent, especially that of Haruko Sugimura, who played in films by Ozu's Late Spring, Floating Weeds and Tokyo Story. Sugimura portrays Kin, a former Geisha who does not have children and lives only with his young girl who cannot speak. <br /> <br /> She has become cynical about men and has turned her attention to money, especially real estate speculation, and lends money to her friends, Nobu (Sadako Sawamura), Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Tomi (Yuko Mochizuki ), all previous geishas. Kin's friends live in bad circumstances and complain about how Kin has become greedy, and Tomi spends a lot of time playing to try to make ends meet. Both Tomi and Tamae are losing their children. The Tama's son goes to work in the colonies of Hokkaido, and Tomi's daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an elderly man. Both resist the change in their circumstances, but will accept it as inevitable. Two male friends visit Kin, Seki a former lover with whom she once considered double murder and Tabe (Ken Uehara), another lover whom she looks forward to seeing again after many years. Her mood is optimistic, but soon turns to anger when she discovers that the two men are only interested in borrowing money. Naruse cuts between two extended sequences smoothly, as Kin confronts Tabe and Tomi and Tamae console each other over the loss of their children The dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are strong women who, although their future does not seem bright, refuse to see themselves only as sacrifice. Late Chrysanthemums has the simple, humorous and stoic acceptance of life prominent in Ozu's films and is a bittersweet reminder of the slow passage of time and the comfort that memory and company can bring to the road.
