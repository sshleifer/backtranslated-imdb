The second characteristic of Majesty Ramin Bahrani's is that as a poem's work, he portrays the human soul and lets it bloom on the screen. In addition to the reach of most other indie films out there, the CHOP SHOP is clever and exudes the very best of the major cinemas of all time; We can look back at the works of Bresson and Pasolini and compare Bahrani's work with theirs, yet Chop is shopping fresh and urgent for modern society. We can see a master's work here? A certain sense of beauty, style and content brings everyone together in a movie that reminds us what it means to be alive. Instead of focusing on NYC's side, we see so often we live and breathe with our young heroes, Alejandro, in the distressed Willits Point ?? a fascinating quasi-sub-world of our culture ?? and yet it is a very real place. Alejandro must try to stay abandoned and he must support himself and his older sister. Watch this movie and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that Bahrani leads us toward ?? all with deep and concise realism.
