Hello To read the whole plot around "OZ" just look at IMDb here to find it. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING SPOILERS IN THIS OVERVIEW! ** Oz is a series that has not only moved me but also shows a little. Of the American prison system, but I have to say (judging by channels of discovery over the prison), it is not really realistic. Although I have to say, there is no shy, rape, shivering (stabbing) allot. It's still TV so it's for you to seem realistic wrong. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of violence in it, and some here and there overdone scenes (plot of plot over plot) it can get pretty boring. But remember the series is almost old by now. So times change too, I think I should judge this in the timeline when it came out. As the season extended to season 5 it was pretty good! Until one of the drawbacks wins a $ 2 million lottery ticket because he spoke to God, it struck me as "ok, it comes to the point I don't want to see this series anymore" Continuing I continued! And now I've just seen episode 3 in season 6. This is where the corn causes its brain to be zapped, and then his "mother" keeps him while he suffocates. Then you see O Reilly cry and see his brother like that too (RL BROTHERS, so well) Now it's by far the best scene out of the whole "OZ" series, it was right for me! Don't let me read this wrongly, I'm trying to collide and burn it. It's a really good series! And even now 2010 is worth a look! I give it a 7 because of the story that weakens with the season. But still a golden glove.
