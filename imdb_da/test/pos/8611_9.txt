Smashing movie about film making. Shows the intense and strange relationships that can develop between directors and their actors; manipulation and madness the priest's selfishness. As in any workplace, sexuality complicates matters, but here to the second degree when they play a sex scene. Absolutely amazing performances by Gregoire Colin as the fragile, wannabe macho male leader and - to a great extent - Anne Parillaud as the director's self-portrait. The picture of her laughing and eating a banana at the end, after finally getting what she wants out of her dolls, is pure joy.
