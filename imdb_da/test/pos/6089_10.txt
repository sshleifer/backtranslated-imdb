TEP is like a long, cool drink of water after crawling across the Sahara to classical movie buffs that have been deprived for too long by that cinematic magic! Not only is it beautifully photographed, but the characters are perfectly portrayed. If you are looking for the movie to be a mirror of the book, you will be seriously disappointed. Instead, it's an excellent "companion" to the book, and I think that's what Anthony Minghella intended. Ralph Fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world; Not to mention a brilliant actor. Juliette Binoche is the poster child for vulnerability and childish enthusiasm. And of course I will see some movies where Kristin Scott Thomas is featured. She must simply be the best actress when he has it like Deborah Kerr. So much was promised with this movie and so much has been delivered!
