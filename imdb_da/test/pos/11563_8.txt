A very unknown strange little western with mindblowing colors (probably the same material as it was used in "Johnny Guitar", I think "Trucolor" or something, making blood drops resemble shiny rubies), almost surreal scenes with twisted action and characters. Something else, far from being a masterpiece, but more emphasis should be placed on this little gem in Western encyclopedia.
