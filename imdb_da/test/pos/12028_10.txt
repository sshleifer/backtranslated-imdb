Spending an hour watching this brilliant Dan Finnerty and his "Dan Band" performing their special at Bravo is the most enjoyable hour I have ever spent watching television. This young man (Dan) is such an incredible talent as a singer, performer and even dancer. He can go from the cheesiest ballad pop songs, all of which have only been sung by women, to hip hop, rock, also songs written to women. This guy can do everything. I've seen him live at least 11 times, so I didn't expect so well that his show would adapt to a TV or movie format, but all reservations immediately went away when the show started because of Dan's overwhelming star quality. a service and see this, or better yet, buy it.
