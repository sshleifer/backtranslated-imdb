As a person who used to spend hours driving around the back of northern London in an attempt to avoid the horrible overload, this film appealed immediately. Throw in my interest in what London was like back in the late 70's and you have the basic premise for my version of the sky! On paper, the movie crossed all the right boxes, and right after looking "The Knowledge", the movie itself lived up to, if not exceeded, my high expectations. <br /> <br /> Visually, I was surprised at how different London looked back then (I lived in Islington in the 90s, long after gentrification had transformed the area). It really came across as grimy, tatty and down-at-heel. London may still have poor housing, but the general feel of the place is much cleaner, brighter and comfortable today (based on what this film shows instead of my own memories). <br /> <br /> As far as history and you are concerned, good top marks go naturally to Nigel Hawthorne as The Vampire. Absolutely brilliant! He deliberately acts unpredictably and alternates between total straight-faced severity and surrealistic mind games to nurture the Knowledge Boys as he puts them through test after test. All in all, this was an excellent, thoroughly enjoyable trip back in a very specific time and place, which I find endlessly fascinating. But even if you are not particularly interested in London around 1979, you still enjoy the witty dialogue and similar signs in "Knowledge".
