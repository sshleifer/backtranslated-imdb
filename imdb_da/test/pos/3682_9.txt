Man, I had my doubts. I love Kathy Bates, but I thought how good it might be, I had never even heard of this thing ...! You know it was one of the things we gave it "20 minutes, and we shut it down if it sucked" and we were locked in from get-go. This is a very wild, fun movie. It's quirky, you know? I mean, you have a lounge singer, a killer (and a credible one), you have farce, so Kathy Bates in all her actresses Rupert Everett is finally acting for her real potential Dan Ackroyd and a dwarf who will make you laugh high. I say to you you will laugh / you cry. <br /> <br /> Maybe I had a weird week, but I think this movie is on par with Fried Green Tomatoes. If you don't like that movie, you might not like it here, but I think it was a good movie. I went out and bought the DVD.
