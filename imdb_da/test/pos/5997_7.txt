This version of the Gulliver stories is certainly bizarre. The production adds a frame story (that's what is known for) by Gulliver, who returns to his wife and son. In a vieweing, incredibly long-lasting and sometimes fails to keep the attention all the way through, but the odd pictures and different cast will keep you looking. Mary Steenburgen does her best work. Danson seems a little out of place with his American accent. The whole asylum case is terribly disruptive often, but is nevertheless interesting and keeps Gullivers traveling well together. Danson's character seems really insane, though ... he should have been working to be a little more faithful to everyone, in my opinion. Also confusing goes from present to past. Anyone else think that Yahoo's the ugliest thing ever to reach a TV screen (or in line with it)? Confusing, sometimes boring, but still highlighted by some good actors, overall wonderful visual effects and a few enjoyable parts. NBC's first of many event films from Robert Halmi, Sr. See it yourself to determine how it goes for you, but I give it * * * 1/2 (out of 5 stars).
