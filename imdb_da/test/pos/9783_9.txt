This movie was amazing and I waited for it for a long time. When it finally came out, I was really happy and looking forward to a 10 out of 10. It was amazing and lived up to my potential. The performance was great for the adults and most of the children. The only bad performance was with Milo himself. There was a problem I encountered with this movie (and others like it). All the characters I wanted to live were killed. Overall, I give this movie an excellent 9 out of 10. Maybe we should choose better people to kill next time, but okay?
