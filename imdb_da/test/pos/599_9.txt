Who doesn't love muppets?! It is impossible to see them without getting a kind of warm, fuzzy feeling inside. So I guess what's important is that this movie seemed to be very successful in capturing what makes the muppets so special. I can't remember much about the details of the plot, but the different moments and characters in the movie, I remember pretty well. In fact, there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere for the whole movie, but without being self-conscious in a bad way. Refreshing for someone who may be too hung up on careful detail and technique; The "magic" transcends all the other things. 'It's true which movies are made of. <br /> <br /> So how does the movie achieve these things? Hmmm, nice question! Am I stumped? Let's see. Really, I feel like it's pretty simple. The filmmakers believe in their material and do not take seriously the process. I probably won't say that the movie has many really inspired moments, but it has a certain life to it (it's so funny that many "real people" movies are missing). A shame. You will truly believe in these fun little people and their adventures. They also have some innocence around those who make them more eager. <br /> <br /> Generally, I get the impression that the people who made the movie just weren't afraid to try what made them feel right on time, giving it a totally loose feeling. Kind of like a truly accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session. Lots of talent, little predictability and lots of warm personalities come through. The cameos were, of course, a bunch of nice surprises for example. Maybe I don't feel I have much to say about it because I slept halfway when I saw it (and / or as I write this review). Anyway, I'm kind of semi-repeating myself here, but I really liked the feeling of family movie had. Full of love, I suppose you might say. Again, a sense of nostalgia comes to mind, which not many movies manage to achieve as effectively or effortlessly. <br /> <br /> And to repeat once again, one of the movie's best charms is the very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Just as Nathaniel Hawthorne quotes happiness as being (as) a butterfly, The Muppet Movie succeeds in part because it doesn't seem to be trying to do it. Same with beauty is best undiscovered or untouched or undisturbed or something like that. At least, if it sounds sappy, I also think it was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie was very fun, touching and hard to smile at. Plus it has lots of good music! Recommended for all people, both young and young at heart.
