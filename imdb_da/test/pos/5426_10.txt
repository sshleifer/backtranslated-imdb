This movie is about people. This movie was like my very first favorite card cartoon for years. <br /> <br /> Isn't it the simplest thing that makes life so much more interesting? We humans are so soft, compassionate, funny, caring for a moment - we discover the most beautiful and amazing machines to kill as many as possible with the smallest effort the next. In our short life, we destroy our world, each other, and often our own lives, than we spend the rest of our lives trying to correct what we have destroyed. Sometimes there is nothing to correct! <br /> <br /> This movie can entertain, educate, and even help us realize what's wrong in our lives! Life is short and can be even shorter! The end is far too optimistic, I'm scared. <br /> <br /> I love Richard Condie's mind and what he does with it! <br /> <br /> Enjoy <br /> <br /> H.K.
