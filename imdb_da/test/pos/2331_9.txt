Surprisingly good and fast-paced adventure containing Kelsey Grammer (supposedly in his first leading role in a move) as an unconventional marine subcommandant wishing to drive a nuclear part of his own; He has earned it by competing against the US Navy in a series of war games with a crew member of untested, dubious and beloved men (and a woman too). Director David S. Ward "Major League" and his writers have composed a hysterically smart and optimistic comedy that tries to make the movie easy to understand, which they do pretty well. Second, most of the crew, in addition to the Grammer character, gives some or many of the film's humor, which is treated as a double-edged sword. Three members of the supporting cast - Harland Williams, Toby Huss and Rob Schneider provide the funniest scenes that include weird gestures, imitations and well their personalities. "Down Periscope" is more than a Navy version of "Police Academy" or "The Dirty Dozen". What the movie does is get the job done in the right way and I liked it.
