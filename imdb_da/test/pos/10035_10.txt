The movie is excellent. One of the most remarkable things about it is that Flynn's performance is amazing. This is worth emphasizing as he was often emptied as an actor by Bette Davis et al. <br /> <br /> I remember the scene where Flynn gets Arthur Kennedy drunk to take him to his death in the Battle of the Little Big Horn. The cold, glancing look at Flynn's face, as he does, is extraordinary - much better than the much avenged Spencer Tracy or many other stars could have done. <br /> <br /> The other thing to note is George's outstanding performance of P. Huntley Jr. as Lt's "Queen's Own" Butler. It is amazing why he stopped making movies shortly after - one would have thought he would have been created for years as a drawing actress.
