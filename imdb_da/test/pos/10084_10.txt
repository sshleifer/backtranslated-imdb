We open in a doctor's room of some sort. A girl is escorted to a seat across the doctor. He asks her questions. Silence follows. He continues to ask questions, ignoring the girls' obvious traumatized atmosphere. The story is about two girls being taken home after having some time in a mental home after an "incident" that happened before hand. They are greeted by their arrival of their trial-for-hard-to-be-nice but-so-evil evil stepmother whom the girls of course are angry with. As time goes on, the evil founder finds new ways to torment the girls. And on top of that, there is an avid ghost that far from helping the girls' recovery ... <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing. It has twisting, turning and definitely leaving you much to think about without making sense. The relationship between the two girls is so heart-warming, it makes you cry at some points (I know I had a tear-moment on two, especially the "cabinet scene"). But what I love most about this movie is the overall feeling of fear all the way through to the rolling credits. The soundtrack is flawless, the furniture in the house, and the use of color is fantastic. A pure joy to the eyes. This is a definite must-see for all Asian movie fanatics. Or any kind of movie fan! And just 10/10.
