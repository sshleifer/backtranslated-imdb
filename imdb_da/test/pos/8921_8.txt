OK, so some of the plot points can be a little obvious, but over all an interesting idea that works against a tight end. The plot is solid, especially Lachy Hulme, who plays one of the key figures in this ensemble piece. He certainly has a screen presence and he is interesting to see. It has a low budget feel that works for the kind of thriller / horror genre Four Jacks belongs to. The film does not attempt to take itself seriously, which increases overall charm. The character of Phil (Dave Serrafin) must be one of the most annoying characters seen on the screen since Rupert Pupkin / King of Comedy. Worth adding to a weekend pile of DVDs.
