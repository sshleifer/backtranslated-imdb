I especially enjoyed Delly's review of this movie and agree that Howard is not the only "damaged" character. Howard is rather ruthlessly "set up" by the manuscript, but there is no evidence that his former employer is actually dead or, if she is, he murdered her. Howard doesn't know it either. In fright and confusion, seeing the woman lying there, he bends. However, he never harms Helen Gordon, no matter how furious he is. In fact, he reacts horribly to Helen's fainting and the fact that he holds a scissors ... then resumes his clearing and greets the restored Helen with the almost pathetic "I'm very tired now. I think I will go home". Frankly, I don't think he's a psychopath. A sick puppy, definitely, but not a psychopath. The problem with Howard is that he has no real male identity. He wanted to serve his country, but his mental state refuses him somewhere in the army. He is uniquely rootless and isolated: no wife, no girl, no home (again, at least as far as we know). And he does a woman's job - "Flooring is my specialty". Helen's niece ruthlessly removes this pride in her thoroughness by saying she wants a man with a real job. Although he is very attracted to Helen, he is neither able nor willing to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual passport. He is remarkably powerless - can not fight, can not work, can not love. Helen is rightly scared. She tries to connect to him, but by finding out that he does not respond normally (ie outside the comfort zone from her rosy memories of man Ned), unfortunately he presses on all Howard's buttons by lying to him in his attempt at to escape. <br /> <br /> Both characters trapped in the house, captured by fear, neuroses, rage and memory, deserve sympathy. I know that the sudden end has disappointed some reviewers, but I felt well-seated as it gave some kind of release to the characters. Helen is liberated, I think, from the past. When Howard tries his husband's army clothing, Helen's disgusted reaction is highlighted. Undoubtedly, she feels that the "Holy Spirit" of NED's possessions has been violated, but hopefully her need to keep everything "untouched" has been lost in reality of her own struggle with danger. Maybe she can continue. <br /> <br /> Howard is also liberated - from his endless cycle of anger, evil, and violence. Whether he's moving on to treatment or prison, it's debatable, but I hope it's the first. Great performances from Ryan and Lupino. I prefer "On Dangerous Ground", but it's good too.
