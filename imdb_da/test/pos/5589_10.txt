I think Crewes did his bad part very well, she should have won a prize. Everything Dunne is in. Is worthy of life because Dunne is a great actress and can pull something out, even a weak script. Therefore, I would recommend it for this reason alone. This movie may have been a little ahead of time, the plot may be more acceptable these days. <br /> <br /> During Hollywood's golden age, movies were meant to entertain or teach, mostly to make us feel good or clear. This plot seems to differ from that profile. Yet again I have to say what Irene Dunne was in, at least was "good" because she made things so credible! The only other actress I can say made me think this way, maybe, Deborah Kerr. See Silver Cord if you get the chance to "act" if nothing else.
