K-PAX is exactly what a heart-warming film should be. The story is about a mysterious mental patient Prot, played by Kevin Spacey, and his incredible psychiatrist Dr. Powel, played by Jeff Bridges. The two have a very friendly bond, and as their relationship grows, Dr. Powel does not do without whether there is more to his mysterious patient who insists he is from another planet called K-PAX. This movie is very fun, and Kevin Spacey well placed a liners as if it were his second nature. K-PAX is a smart movie and I didn't expect it to go where it did. In the end, I thought myself about the little things in life, and the wonder and magic of everyday life we ​​so often take for granted. I left the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling inside, and for families and couples on a date, K-PAX is a great movie that doesn't disappoint. I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in anything more than the monotonous releases of shiny, action-packed, gore fests.
