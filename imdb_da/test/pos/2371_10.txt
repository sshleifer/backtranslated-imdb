If you loved the 1993 (erotic, sci-fiction) cyborg movie "Nemesis" then you will love this one. I loved the minute that Elvis Pompadoured Hero pulls out a samurai sword during a shoot-out. Like "Nemesis", it finds its place in a post-apocalyptic slum of the future. Both are police players, where the well-armed hero must pick up well armed rebels to solve a conspiracy of the forces against the unwashed masses. But that's where the similarities end. The ambiguous mayor of death or living tries to keep the masses sedative on the drugs he sells them. The rebels supported by mercenaries and a cyborg are trying to slow down their choking team on their subjects. After several unsuccessful attempts to slow the rebels back, he sent his supreme policeman to murder the rebels. This movie follows the trail of most action adventure, but is not afraid to color outside the line.
