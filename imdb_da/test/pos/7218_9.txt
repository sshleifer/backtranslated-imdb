This film is a brilliant tale of Shakespeare's classic love story, complete with "kinky sex, body piercing, and dismemberment". It follows the same spirit as all the other Troma films [except the Combat Shock ... The sucker was depressing], but it's not just for Troma fans. Anyone who appreciates lowbrow images and a hilarious script will surely fall in love with this movie. Don't expect pretentious, artistic wannabe crap as the version of R&J with Claire Danes and Leo DiCaprio; this one knows his silly movie and pulls his humor out of it. The action is also surprisingly good, and you can just feel Sammy Capulet's pain as he tries to put his brain back in his head. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack containing many original and high-energy bands such as The Wesley Willis Fiasco, Supernova and The Meatmen are also four-star. This movie is to be seen by everyone because it remains true to the original story while still confronted with Troma's trademark gore / sex humor.
