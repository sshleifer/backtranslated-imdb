Don't you just hate scares that never seem to get started? It sometimes takes them a full hour of lame red herring before a real action takes place. "Tourist Trap" is not like that! If it is typically cruel slash you want ... than it is typically cruel slash, you get it! Lots of it and constantly from start to finish! This movie contains what is probably the biggest opening sequence in the 80's horrorbios when a teenager, on a quest for engine problems, is trapped in an abandoned house and attacked by a grim collection of wax stands. Four other lambs for slaughter arrive at the house and encounter an insane lunatic who resembles a mix of Leatherface (from "Texas Chainsaw Massacre") and one of the crazy sculptors from ancient wax museum films. "Tourist Trap" is exciting horror entertainment, with a real excitement, pigs pictures, ultimate weird, morbid humor and amazing makeup effects. The plot connections are not always original, and the play is rather miserable, but seriously who cares? The fast pacing and groovy killer icon caused this "Tourist Trap" to earn a place among my 5 favorite slashers. A little surprising is the overall lack of nudity. Too bad because all the girls look unrelenting and after only 10 minutes, the mandatory line "Who needs a bathing suit?" is spoken.
