Cooley High is such a great movie that even with the period's soundtrack, cityscape, wardrobe and tubing ... it still doesn't feel dated. The sound track along the way is a timeless classic in itself. <br /> <br /> Instead, you absorb right into it. It's a staple of a good movie. From the start to the end, it doesn't miss a battle, and I never get tired of seeing it. <br /> <br /> The ending is unique in that it is one of the coolest and at the same time uplifting of the entire movie ending. There may have been a few ago (Backdraft is going to think), but Cooley was the first and much more emotional.
