Bon Voyage is fun for the public because it combines the stupidity of a comedy with just enough curiosity to keep viewers actively engaged and invested in the outcome. But most importantly, the film is also historically educational; it captures the excitement of the so-called "false war" and later the French aristocracy's flight from Paris in front of the German attack. But Bon Voyage is not a "war movie". It is a comedy about the life of a handful of people based on extraordinary times. Bon Voyage generates the chaos, confusion and emotional confusion of a nation of the brink of collapse and the broad spectrum of French reactions to the new political order. This film is a comedy that entertaines the audience, a romance that skillfully exploits many clich√©s and a story of a handful of people whose nation coincides around them.
