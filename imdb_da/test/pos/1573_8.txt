Writer director Dean Bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest but compelling movie. His dialogue was snappy, and his use of very short flashback sequences was especially effective in the film's narrative structure. <br /> <br /> In the heart of the movie is Alice's character, running away from her New England past in a desperate effort to get to Florida. Along the way, she travels with a couple of excentrics, Bill and Sandra, who try to marry Alice as a prostitute earning money by truck stop. As a beginner performs in her first screen role, Emily Grace as Alice is sensational. There is no false note in her character choice. But the film is worth seeing first and foremost on Sandra's clever, yet sensitive character, masterfully created by Judith Ivey. There is a special blurred subtitle for almost every moment where Ivey is on camera. As a viewer, I found myself stopping the tape, pressing the rewind, and reviewing its scenes to try to distinguish between the psychological features. <br /> <br /> The movie raises the following questions about the characters: Are Bill and Sandra good Samaritans, or are they an evil pair of Dickensian predators that characterize the youthful Alice? One of the film's strengths is that it never fully answers that question. Alice seems more confident than she started as a result of her experiences with Bill and Sandra. But is she really a better person? <br /> <br /> Sharing comedy, cross-section, and some com-of-age drama, this carefully crafted movie manages to engage us at many levels.
