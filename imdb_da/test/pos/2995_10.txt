First of all - I'm not the one to go all juicy over movies. I saw friends in the 70's when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at that time. Even now, at the age of 50, I can still remember some of the scenes. The movie is cute and sad and can actually be too pretty for teenagers today, but I loved it. The story is about innocence, pure youth's love and determination of 2 young people to create a better life for themselves when they were at home. At that time, it was quite risky to have a movie about a couple of young runaways that successfully set up houses and have a baby alone. I'm not surprised at the movie, and Elton John's soundtrack is almost unknown today. The music is beautiful. It was unforgettable.
