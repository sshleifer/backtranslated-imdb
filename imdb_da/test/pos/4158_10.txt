I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (so far known in the United States as 'The Golden Door') and was very impressed with both the dreamy and occasional surrealistic story of a family immigrating from public to the United States in the early days of the 20th century. It also acted as a (proverbial) middle finger attached to the Homeland Security Eye Club (preferably all the way up to the third crack) in the depiction of the bad treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they got from their original motherland. The (mostly) Italian roll, with few exceptions, works well. This is a quiet, discreet movie that is great to watch (occasional but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure), while the manuscript is well-written. This is a movie for those who are sick and tired of thoughtless escapism from Hollywood, who earn a little more than selling popcorn (not that I have some burning popcorn issues, remember! --- I actually love stuff). You would do well to find out the Nuovomondo / The Golden Door (or whatever it title is in your area).
