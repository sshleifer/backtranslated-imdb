It's started quietly. If you're looking for an action movie, this is definitely not the right choice. All characters are slowly depicted on the scene. Battle for battle on stage canvas. No one can take his hands out to the priest, and then the life of the seaside affection can only remain in the village. Philippa and Martina know their fate, belong only to the village. So when you understand it, you are on the movie scene, in the village that will be the whole world in that time. When no technology can let you imagine anything other than the campaign, the village, the sea. You feel the rhythm of the old village life. Seeing the movie in a cold snowy late afternoon can make you approach this evening afternoon with some lavish expectations ... The final phrase that gives a title to Babette's sacrifice far from Paris: An artist is never poor. <br /> <br /> Superb photography. Many situations show portraits and landscapes as they were styled on canvas in Jutland in the 18th century.
