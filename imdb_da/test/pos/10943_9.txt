I think there was too much action in the end? Don't you think so too? There was romance, adventure that, like me, told 9 to make this movie, but the action was too long. I liked Reeve a little. I didn't understand why he was going to die. I thought one of the girls will die too, but my lucky one! No one else I liked did not die! What about you? What did you like? I saw the movie twice in fact. And then I bought it too. It was worth it! Who did you like best (person)? The book was really, really, really cool. And the actors and actors too. Everything was perfect ....... What was the song name in the end? Will anyone answer my questions too ... PLEASE, please please?
