I watched this movie on Galway Film Fleadh the year it won best short film. I have to say that I thought the direction was fantastic and the notion from the main cast members was very memorable. Both main casts are definitely names to watch out for. <br /> <br /> The final shot of the rock was fascinating and I would like to find myself there if I waited for the end of the world to happen. The kiss was definitely a big payout, ready with great enthusiasm !! <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the film was shot on film and I have heard that DOP won a prize at the Tribeca Film Festival for his work on this movie and I must say .... well deserved. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who was a teenager in the 1980s. It brought back some good memories and some scary.
