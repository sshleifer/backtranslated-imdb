I have read approx. 10 reviews of this movie but have not taken any of them "to heart". Harrison Ford is being criticized for everything from his haircut to the earstone, and I really can't see what any of these things have to do with the movie. As I recall, he had bad hair plus bad reviews in Blade Runner, but it's still a favorite among us video files. It is slower than the majority of its previous films, but not worthy of the garbage collector it has received. <br /> <br /> I want to pay $ 7.50 just to see a bald Harrison Ford beat its lawn.
