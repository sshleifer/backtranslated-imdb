The truth and reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This film does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I think everyone should watch this movie as I think few people outside South Africa understand their past and what is being tried in the truth and the reconciliation process. Almost every country has a part of its own history, which is still a source of continued hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What happens in South Africa should lead us all. I found it credible, moved, and sometimes disturbing. There were no outstanding performances, but this was added to the strength of confidentiality. Once again, the BBC has been involved in taking a complex subject and showing a top class movie.
