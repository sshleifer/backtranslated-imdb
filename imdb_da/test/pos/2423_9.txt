*** SPOILERS *** Feeling alone and needing companion as well as love Frances Austen, Sandy Dennis, holds all those feelings as she goes through life as a popular young single lady who has many high-class friends. But because of her own deep uncertainty, she keeps them in arm's length. With regard to France's male friends, there is nowhere near her age so she has no reason to have any romantic interference with them. <br /> <br /> An early evening, when Frances was entertaining some of her friends, she stains off her apartment window, a young man, Michael Burns, sat alone in the cold pouring rain. Feeling that he is homeless and alone after her girlfriends leaves Frances going to the park and offering the young man shelter at her place until the rain goes down and even staying over for the night in a guest bedroom she has. You can see right away that Frances is more interested in just having the young men out of cold and rain, as she wants him as a friend or even a toy for himself and as the film progresses, you see you had right. <br /> <br /> A truly stunning performance by Sandy Dennis, who is much like Kathy Bates' Oscar performance in the movie "Misery", made in 1990 about thirty-one years later. Frances thought the young man was alone and homeless, and later, when she meets him, mute sees the perfect person for her to have as a true friend. He is in no way equal to or better than her as the friends she has, doctors lawyers of Indian chiefs, and thus totally dependent on her. It turns out later that the young man is not the lonely and homeless, as Frances thought he was. It is when she slowly discovers that he really does not need her, as well as manipulating her in the opposite, it devotes something to Frances' mind that turns out to be a force of murderous proportions. <br /> <br /> A really strange movie by director Robert Altman, deep in the depth of loneliness and depression of the human mind. Actress Sandy Dennis is perfect as Dr. Jekyll and Miss. Hyde personality in her act as the lonely but at the same time dangerous Frances Austen, and it is a shame that she not only got an Oscar for her role in the film but was not even nominated for it. <br /> <br /> Like most Robert Altman films, there seems to be a lot of improvisation among the actors in the film and ad lib dialogue, especially between youth sister Nina, Susanne Benton and her boyfriend Nick, David Garfield. The only thing in the movie that I found confusing is when we see Frances go to a city clinic to get a full gynecological exam and tell the doctor that she expects to get married very soon. Was her husband being the young man living in her apartment? But apart from the film sticking to the story pretty well, the end is a real shock to the audience as well as the young man. Finally, when he finally realizes that Frances is not just a little outside the wall, but also murderous insane.
