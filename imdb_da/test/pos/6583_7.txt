This was a movie I was reading reviews over and over again; and despite being played at the Film Museum and not at Pathe theaters ?? I decided to give this movie a try. The reasons were many ?? In the reviews compared to Pulp Fiction, it had several parallel stories in the movie, and finally, it had already won 17 awards internationally in different categories. I was eager to watch this movie and because of my off-day at Greenpeace I decided to make myself happy to go see this movie. It is a story based in Finland. I think it reflected the current life of people in general? drugs, crime, sex, anger, anxiety, fear and guilt. Each feeling was recorded brilliantly in the film. There are several signs and stories interwoven, but a few characters come back in the last half ?? to create a link to the initial sequences, and it takes the story forward. <br /> <br /> The story is about two friends ?? one of which is computer geek and the other is a drug addict? son of a violent father. The drug-abused boy is trading a Euro 500 note ?? printed by his friend ?? To buy back your music system, and in return, get huge money back to buy more drugs. The Euro 500 note deal continues with bizarre events ?? from the retailer to a car mechanic cum robber ?? for a car dealer ?? for a vacuum cleaner seller ?? for a prostitute ?? to a police officer ?? then to her family and children. How the beginning of a small thing ?? creates a chain reaction that leads even after 5 years of the first event to a depressing last note ?? which I will not reveal here. <br /> <br /> The direction is excellent. The character development of the film is first rate. The character that sticks in mind, even after you get out of the movie, is by the vacuum cleaner dealer. All the departments in the film are handled nicely. Here I would like to make a few critical comments. First, I felt that the coincidences were too fast and forced under the sequence of an event that led to another. But this manuscript written error is sorry when you see the whole canvas. Secondly, the trace of a character leading to another one somehow leads to the first two characters, and it again showed me to be a forced decision from the playwright. There was no need to have the same signs again when there are different causes that lead to different effects in such a big city. But after saying it ?? It's an excellent movie! It's a dark movie with very few sex scenes. The characters have the black, white and gray shades and feelings that change from turning to different situations that are brilliantly recorded by the director. <br /> <br /> A top-rate movie! It has all the ingredients of becoming a cult film. I hope that only such movies should not become and become a cult movie and win lots of prizes, because without crime, sex, violence, drugs, etc. Can you make great movies too? Bicycle thieves and Pather Panchali are its primary examples ?? The only thing is that they were a long time back and times are changing, and I think movies reflect current times.
