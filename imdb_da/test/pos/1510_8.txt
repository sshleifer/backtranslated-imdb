Un Gatto Nel Cervello, or Nightmare Concert as it is more known among English-speaking audiences, starts as horror movie director Lucio Fulci (the play by the man himself Lucio Fulci) goes for lunch after filming a very gory & violent scene, but he orders steak & has a terrible vision of cannibalism. The grotesque visions, hallucinations and dreams continue and begin to affect his mental state, Fulci decides to seek help and contacts Professor Egon Schwarz (Dvid L. Thompson) for psychiatric help. Schwarz claims that Fulci cannot separate imagination from reality and advocates helping him, but Schwarz has a more sinister ulterior motif when a serial killer starts to brutally kill prostitutes and Fulci thinks he might be responsible .... < br /> <br /> This Italian production was co-written and directed by Lucio Fulci, who also stars in the movie as a horror movie director Lucio Fulci, who doesn't really feel like a lot of effort went into it, but at least is Un Gatto Nel Cervello gory if nothing else & for that alone I loved it. The script from Fulci, John Fitzsimmons, Giovanni Simonelli and Antonio Tentori is nothing but a terrible excuse to edit together lots of gory footage from other Italian films. It serves the purpose well enough I suppose & to see Fulci on the screen have some fascination, if you are a fan of his or are familiar with his movie, the end is very rushed almost as if they ran out of money as it just have a policeman tell Fulci they killed the killer and that's it. Another thing about what ends when the two policemen put the white sheet over the dead killer in the field and then they go away and leave it without any other police presence, I think the police in Italy just want to leave a dead body in the middle of a field on its own? It moves together at a good pace, and if you like your gore then you should see this, though if you don't like Gore then you will hate it with a passion. It all depends on your disposition, so the choice is yours. <br /> <br /> Director Fulci was never the most artistically talented filmmaker, and it shows here, when his footage is gentle, flat and looks like it was shot on television, the footage of the other movies (7 in all ) t match the stuff Fulci shot & it is obvious that this has been pieced together from different movies. If you're looking for gore, you've hit the jackpot, people are merged with chainsaws, put through meat grinders, faces are melted, there are a few beheaders, there are some split necks, some body is crushed under a car, a tongue is torn out, someone has their throat crushed, when a wheelchair runs over it, there are lots of stabbing, someone has their gut removed with a hook that is a mess like magic, a hand is cut off, someone has their head bashed in and their eye falls out, a gory death by piano wire as it slices through any neck, there are lots of cut limbs, blood tones spurted around and a scene of some cats eating brains and there is more too. That said, some of the special effects are a bit fake and look cheesy. <br /> <br /> With an assumed budget of about $ 100,000, it shows it's pretty cheap, it has no visual style or artistic profit, but then again why do you want them when you see a Nazi orgy sequence and wall-to-wall gore? The action in this is horrible, including Fulci. <br /> <br /> Un Gatto nel Cervello is a top film if you are a gorehound like me, but if you are looking for something with a little more substance or indeed some substance then this is not for you. This is the kind of movie that shares people right down the middle, you will either love what it does or hate it.
