No music. No stupid masala. A reasonably realistic depiction of the police system in India and based on a true "meeting" specialist in India, Daya Nayak. It is Ab Thank 56 (56 symbolizes how many criminal leaders "Sadhu Agashe" have killed "- you already know it.) Brilliance exudes Nan Patekar in the role of a relaxed and compelling Indian policeman. If it is a bit predictable to go through it, it is quite fascinating: Another of the films from Ram Gopal Vermas The Factory, movies that are either decent or really good, Ab Thanks CHappan is close to very good. published from India, commercially and artistically included. <br /> <br /> What is amazing is the story story is relaxed and finally shows (in an Indian flick) how the police network works. Cast is really wrong but seriously the one lines fun as hell (although I don't know if the subtitled version will look like fun) Producers are trying for a Cannes release that is interesting. Made by debut leader Shamit Aman (I think that's his name). <br /> < br /> Again 55 yo Nana Pat echoes away from his stupid shouting roles from the past, just showing what a good director can do with a good actor. Really good stuff. If you are interested in Indian movies and are spoiled by nonsense some of our father's bowl out then this is definitely a relief. Through Patekar is the guy who happilly carries the film on his shoulders and designates style in the movie - relaxed, fun, intelligent and calculating. Good dialogues, good acting, good direction All in all Great things. Recommendations: Gangaajal, Ram Gopal Verma Company (both Indian flicks)
