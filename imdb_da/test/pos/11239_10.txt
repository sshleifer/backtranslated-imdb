I think it's an excellent show with cool talking heads and very cool action. 2 guys pretending to be gentlemen in female seduction demonstrate their abilities at various nightclubs and 4 experts (pickup artists themselves) commenting on them and choosing the winner. Their jokes are entertaining and some participants are really fun to watch. Incidentally, this show really teaches men how to get in touch with women, lots of expert comments are helpful while you might see how it works on the pitch. In fact, I think this is one of the best TV shows, and I recommend it to all men who like women. <br /> <br /> I'm complicit in my broken engrish.
