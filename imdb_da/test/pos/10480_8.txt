If you find the first 30 minutes of this movie to be so slow that you wonder why you see it, don't give up. The Danish language is also a little new for most North Americans who cannot see and hear many Danish films. In any case, as the film progressed, it got better and better, and the viewer is rewarded for his patience. <br /> <br /> Become a fan of the movie "Out of Africa", this film drew my interest because it is based on a short novel by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), the protagonist of that movie. <br /> <br /> The food - Babette's feast - was amazing. I'm not a cook, but I was impressed! How to interpret the story also varies, I assume, depending on how much you read into this and where you stand religiously. If the latter, how you look at the definition of "legalism," can influence how you interpret this story. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's a great movie, but don't watch this if you're dieting.
