I don't want to say anything about music because this topic can be so deep that it can be a great separate review, so let's concentrate on movies that are brilliant ... Without a doubt, one of President's best works. <Br /> <br /> The simple story of love, friendship, freedom and ideals ... oh yes, the ideals that even pacifists are ready to go to war ... <br /> <br /> There is not a single false word, simple false character, simple false sense of history, because love, freedom and friendship are not complicated for the characters of the film. These things are not something that "everyone can see from different angles". These are not things that require much to think about ... their love is simple, their friendship is simple, their ideals are as simple as the word "simple" themselves, and so these figures are so deep. Berger, the leader of a hippie played by Treat Williams, is a guy who lives to live and that is the greatest happiness for him ... he has his ass - (which he sings in one of the scenes in the movie) and that's enough to make him happy with his property ... Berger never accepts that nothing can be done ... and his real ... If he wants to go to some rich guys knocked in his dirty old clothes and big long hair, he'll do it ... if he wants to go to another state just to see his friend, he'll do it ... he never thinks twice ... he just does it. <br /> <br /> How? Why is he so powerful? The answer is simple: because he is FREE. Just see how the wind makes the hair wavy in this movie and you will understand everything, maybe you will free yourself.
