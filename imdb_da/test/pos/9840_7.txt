"The Hell's Mayor" has the feel of an early Dead End Kids movie, but with a much tougher edge and very few bright spots that precede Dead Enders first four-year appearance. James Cagney has a full screen opening credit, though technically, the "mayor" of the movie's title is actually portrayed by Frankie Darro, one of several boys sent to reform school during opening scenes. Darro's character is Jimmy Smith, a young hard witnessed by 'Patsy' Gargan (Cagney), and chosen for the post when Gargan takes a chance to humanize the affairs of a state reformer. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers made many of these types of movies trying to give a conscience of a kind in an era that knew only too well about the effects of crime and poverty. This movie is pretty gritty, without excuses for ethnic stereotypes, as in the strange attitude of a black father in court or in the way a Jewish child gets to run a candy store in the reform school. The rules of the Reformation are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut off the line and you personally respond to Warden Thompson (Dudley Digges). <br /> <br /> Cagney's role in history seems a bit ambiguous, because even though he is making a serious effort to improve the conditions of the Reformation on the outside, he still has a nominal control over a criminal racket. The film's attempt to juggle this dichotomy falls into my assessment, the final attempt to pack things into a nice package, as Gargan awaits the result of a near-deadly shooting of one of his henchmen. Not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers wanted to sanitize some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake called "Crime School" with Humphrey Bogart in the Cagney role and Billy Halop in the Frankie Darro section. If you're part of Dead End Kids, you'll probably like the latter movie as it also offers well-known faces such as Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan and Gabriel Dell. But the end is something muddied in the one too, with Bogart's warden character involved in a cover up of a prison breakout. Both films offer a romantic interest to the protagonists, in 'Mayor', Madge Evans is a reformist nurse who falls for Cagney's character. Incredibly, many James Cagney's early films are not commercially available, so you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for a screening on Turner Classics, or download the movie from a private collector. Personally, I can't get enough of this kind of thing and find exciting points of interest in the films of all genres from the thirties and the eighties.
