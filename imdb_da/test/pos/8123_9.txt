By acting in this movie it is sometimes difficult not to imagine that the cast is as they portray themselves as being. Unbroken passion and acting sometimes make this a very enjoyable and engaging film. Wouldn't even have known about it except for HBO late night. And the biggest reason I like British movies, much better than the American ones, is that the actors are not afraid to act out what is needed.
