Sony Pictures Classics, I'm Looking At You! Sony is entitled to Harry records - you need to distribute the movie and you get radically increased sales of his catalog! In any case, this is a fantastic study of a fascinating musician who is strangely strange, full of good stories, bigger music, and it could have been 3 hours longer, and I would have loved it even more. Saw it at the American Cinemateque Mods & Rockers Festival at the Aero Theater in Santa Monica, where it played for a packed house. They turned people away at the door! I went to many of the Mods & Rockers festival films, and let me assure you that no other movie came close to selling out, let alone turning people away. Watch it in the theater, buy the DVD and make sure some slow-on-the-uptake companies * * host SONY cough *] download it as soon as possible!
