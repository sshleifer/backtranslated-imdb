I rented this obscure aussie relic some years ago to show up at a friend's place and it was an instant success. The classic story of the wizard oz with a particular cornball 70's Australian twist. and Robin Ramsay as a delicious 70's campfire godmother / father character. Also note the musical contribution of ex-Daddy Cool frontman Ross Wilson on the title song. In a similar vein to later-daily aussie comedies such as "Priscilla Queen of the Desert". Good fun.
