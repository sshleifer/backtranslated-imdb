(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> People who put a lonely heart ad in the newspaper are often idealists. They try to put in a few words everything they are and expect. The correspondence is full of hope. Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo), owner of a cigarette company at ile de la Reunion (east of Madagascar) is so affected by Julie Roussell's letters that he proposes to her. But not the expected beautiful brunette comes from the table "Mississippi", but - Catherine Deneuve. And we know from the outset that she is a criminal offender and that a crime has taken place. She shows no interest in "Julie's" wardrobe (she doesn't even get her suitcase open) and neglects her canaries until it dies. But the most basic tricks of seduction (an open zipper) are sufficient to transform Louis into a flexible little dog. First: A common bank account. And then, when Julie's sister points out to herself, the flight. With 27,850 million Louis '28 million - she would need her signature for the whole amount. <br /> <br /> Louis and Julie's sister involve a private detective (Michel Bouquet). Louis intends to track Marion (Deneuve's real name) in Antibes, where she works as a taxi girl - her gangster lover left her barren or rather centimeless. Louis does not find herself able to kill her. She tells her story: Orphan. Old Wise. Lesbian experiences. Many sugardadies. Prison - and soon she brings him through her nose again. The detective turns out to be blunt as a fox and persistent as a blood dog; Louis and Marion bury their body in the basement. They fly to Paris, where Louis discovers that Marion has a precious taste. She worships money as a deity. He sells his company at a fraction of his value. But when the detective's game is discovered (a flood), they must escape again - without the money. Life in a mountain hut along with an insidious loser - Marion can think of a more cheerful life without this appendage ... A high point of career for everyone involved. Belmondo's self-deception almost makes him endearing. Deneuve looks beautiful in her wardrobe by Yves St. Laurent, and her performance is lovely: First, she matures the fragile wifey - too scared to ask her husband for money, so the common bank account is needed - but after being exposed she sounds like Katharine Hepburn in the prison scene bringing up BABY. The landscape is spectacular - the tropics, the Riviera, Paris. Truffaut obviously controls the aplomb: the sixties were the only decade when European films were head and shoulders over American productions. After this movie, Truffaut could see his idol, Alfred Hichcock, full of face.
