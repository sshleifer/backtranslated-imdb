Planktonrule's comments must have been written on Topsy-Turvy Day, because all said of the simple way of life is the opposite of true truth! 'Bluebeard's Eighth Wife' is fun in every scene, in every way - the chemistry between Colbert and Cooper could not have been finer ... supports are excellent. Scripture and direction are magnificent !!! <br /> <br /> Like so many other comments On this board, I regret again: "Why can't movies be like this anymore?" <br /> <br /> This is the classic Paramount 1930's screw basketball comedy when it's best, people!
