I am fifteen years old and have seen thirty-three of Sinatra's films (not counting videos of TV shows and documentaries) and have only been impressed by only two of them. '' For the clouds', 'and' The Miracles of the Bells' do not count properly, as in the first thing all he does is sing a magnificent "Ol 'Man River", and in the latter he is not half bad - only the image is pathetic. My favorite records, radio shows, TV shows and movies about Sinatra change almost every day - everything on a different connotation at each show and occasionally seems the best he has ever done, and occasionally the worst until the cycle comes back, but there is one few things that are not comparable. When it comes to movies, "The Man with the Golden Arm" is on the list. Anyone who knows anything about Sinatra knows that he thought this was his best ever performance, he was Oscar nominated, that was the first serious look at drug abuse, etc. etc. The jazz score is unforgettable, Kim Novak likes In spite of a ridiculous accent, Eleanor Parker is annoying and waaaay too dramatic, the turtle-like Arnold Stang is entertaining fi the first time, but more embarrassing every time, and Darren McGavin makes a wonderful slimy drug dealer, the sets are compelling - at first glance It seems to be a peculiar mixed bag thrown together by the great Otto Preminger with an off-center charm. <br /> <br /> Then you come to Sinatra. Like everything else in his life - apart from music - reports of his plays are still divided in half. Directors like Fred Zinnemann, Frank Capra, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kramer, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich and Otto Preminger, agreed that Sinatra had worked so hard on his films as he did on song, he would have been among the greatest actors in the world - if not the biggest. Humphrey Bogart even said, "This guy has the most natural acting talent I've ever seen." Not bad for a man who never took a play in his life, at the same time created discography that would make him "the greatest singer of the 20th century" and did almost all his scenes in one roof. <br /> <br /> In direct conflict with all this, the other reviews and biographies sniffed by what a miserable actor was this Mr.Sinatra and how many "bad" movies he made. The question would never be answered to everyone's satisfaction because the controversy was among Sinatra's greatest assets, and both arguments were somehow in hand. In any case, Sinatra is currently magnificent. One reviewer said at the end of the fifties, "Sinatra may not be the greatest actor in the world, but there is no one more fascinating to see." Whatever Sinatra is doing in a movie, it's hard to take his eyes off him. This is, of course, a "charisma" that I have only seen in a handful of other people-Orson Welles, Richard Burton, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift-maybe James Cagney. There is no real definition for it, and it often makes it hard to find out if you really enjoy a show or just spellbound, but the quality shown here is what makes the movie. Sinatra is actually nitriding, true, intense - transcending decades and thousands of paper dolls pop stars with something called quality. Like it or not, this is a one-man show with a few character players hanging in the background. He covers all emotions with remarkable subtlety, from sweet, lonely tenderness to Kim Novak to Frank Sinatra's terrible shock (Frank Sinatra!) Scares and screams in the fear of "cold turkey". Sinatra was right - this is his best performance. No question. <br /> <br /> I was eight when Frank Sinatra died. I wasn't around in all the years of bobby-soxers and "Anchors Aweigh", Mr. Ava Gardner and 'From Here to Eternity' album with lamp posts and swingin lovers, Kennedy, Vegas, ring-a-ding thing. Basie and Mia and Reagan and concerts from Madison Square Garden to South Africa to the White House to Sands. I can't say I like Sinatra because I heard him at Paramount or because I hear "September of My Years" autobiographically - the usual excuses. And my apology? When I was eleven I saw a movie called "On the Town" ...
