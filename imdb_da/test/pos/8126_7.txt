This movie was a pleasant surprise because I didn't expect much. I didn't know that some of the actors have since become bigger stars in bigger pix. As you move on to the Matrix not a plus in my book (hated it), I'm sure it's a career plus for Hugo. James Purefoy is amazing in this and Jennifer Ehle is sweet and wonderful. It sometimes seemed like a Carnaby street romp 30 years later, but I enjoyed the savings store Janis Joplin's clothing blended with the modern mindset of sexual and sexual blur. The real estate agent who has an erotic relationship with his listings is lots of fun. The Iron John group meetings are a bit dated, but I still loved them. It's a social satire sex comedy in the best way and reminds me of some of the old "Carry On" movies. The British know how to make sex comedy, and it is an old tradition, unlike the United States, which is too prudish to really understand that sex is fun.
