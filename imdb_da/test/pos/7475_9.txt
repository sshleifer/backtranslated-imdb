I turned to this movie in the middle of the night and almost jumped over it. It was only because there was nothing else that I decided to see. In the end I thought it was great. <br /> <br /> An interesting story, good characters, a wise script and brilliant instructor make it a good movie to sit down and watch. It was actually the first thing I had heard about this movie, but I would have been happy to have paid money to watch this movie. My IMDB Rating: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br />
