Uzumaki (it's Japanese for "spiral" or "vortex") is one of the most absurd movies I've ever seen. A city is occupied and then consumed by the swirl pattern in some very grotesque ways. Finger tips are cut off, people commit suicide in washing machines ... just wild and crazy Japanese scare. Possibly as mentally harmful as "The Ring". Generally, not as scary as "Eye", but imaging in this is more disease than most of the things in "The Eye". And not as thrilled as "The Untold Story" ... but that's not to say there's not a lot of blood and degradation. Seriously, if you enjoy horror movies and especially Asian horror - add this movie to your list. A few parts are a little weird with the sound effects (the story is adapted from a manga comic and it shows), but it really fits. Unlike some movies trying to catch the original source ("House of the Dead"), it makes it perfect. The most original movie you will see ... not only this year, but probably ever. Recommended!
