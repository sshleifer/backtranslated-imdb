There are movies that are just another version of another, not remakes, but just like others, it's not. Although it tells of mafia, it is seen differently, and it often seems like a secondary theme. I went to watch that movie for cause (because someone else's theater was full) and I was happy at the end. It surprised me because of its black irony or cynicism, and there are more and more interesting things to analyze. It doesn't follow the classic movie forms, it's just different, and I don't think it's the only one to like it. I am also very pleased that it is Italian and I was afraid that Italian directors and producers were not brave enough to change themes. In this movie you can also see new Italian style but are not blocked in clich√©s. I hope to be understandable, I know it's hard, I also hope this movie can be exported outside our borders, it's a good product to export. I also want to point out music, very good soundtrack, the movie needs it because of its long quiet break and they are covered perfectly by that music. Many compliments to the director, and thanks, the cinema needs these movies.
