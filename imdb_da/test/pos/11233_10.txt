The Polish brothers are unique movie artists, and they have really pushed the envelope here. A fantasy that has a point in common with "Wings of Desire", "Northfork" tells the story of a 50-year-old small town in the middle of the sky, two days shy of being flooded and submerged thanks to the US government's desire to Make a reservoir at the place where the city stands. It is a disgusting parable of loss and remembrance that offers angels, dreams, premonitions, and the most hilarious government officials since the "Repo Man." The performances are all excellent, especially Nolte and Woods. I have noticed in reading some of the comments that there are people who were offended, simply knowing that the Polish twins are using elliptical storytelling tactics, and I want to say this is one of the things that makes this movie So great: its willingness to embrace the mystical as an aspect of everyday life. David Mullen's movie is amazing. Highly recommended; If you have suffered a meaningful personal loss, such as parental death, I would even call this movie the necessary display. - Ray
