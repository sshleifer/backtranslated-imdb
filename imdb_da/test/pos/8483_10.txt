Jamie Foxx did a great job with Ray Charles. I loved this movie because every so often there would be a flashback scene and then the current movie. When Ray Charles was small, he went blind, and his mother did not love him. She was a strong woman who did not treat him differently because he was blind. She made him do things on her own, and it really shot him to become a great musician later in life. His mother also sent him to school as well. So when Ray Charles became a man, he could stand up for himself and take care of himself, but there was a decline in drugs, sex and fraud. When I am discouraged by something, I can only think of this movie and it will inspire me.
