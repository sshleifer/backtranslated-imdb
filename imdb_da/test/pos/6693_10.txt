Life consists of endless possibilities; some knew, others a mystery and destined to remain so. And what of the great unknown, they rule beyond what knowledge has no established boundaries or parameters? Who should say what exists or what is possible? Valid issues, all discovered and explored in the story of a particular person's personal journey, a strange and dramatic odyssey that can withstand facts and logic, in 'K-PAX', directed by Iain Softley and starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. In the wake of an incident in New York's central station, a man named Prot (Spacey) is transported to a psychiatric hospital in Manhattan, where he is delivered to Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges), trying to uncover the truth about his patient claiming to be from the distant planet K-PAX. It quickly becomes a challenge for Dr. Powell, as Prot, with his tranquil, direct, upcoming way and propensity to produce (he eats banana peels and everyone and Red Delicious Apples are his favorites) is quite convincing. But it is Powell's work, as well as his nature, to be skeptical. However, Prot's claims remain intact and stand up even during Dr. Powell's most intensive probing, which finds itself in some of a swell - Prot tells himself the exact date and time he will deviate for K-PAX, a scheduled return trip that allows Powell, but a short time to sort everything out. And Powell just doesn't seem to think about the idea that he's dealing with a true alien being; And it's something he'll have to solve quickly if he ever gets to know the truth. And he must know. The truth is, after all, the only thing that will set him free in his own mind. Softley has created and delivered a sensitive, thought-provoking film that challenges the viewer by maintaining the mystery of the surrounding Prot, forcing you to reflect on your own concepts of what is actually possible. And as you never know for sure about Prot until the denouement, you can identify with Powell, see the situation from his point of view and try to solve the riddle right with him. Softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real feeling of being confronted with something unique when history unfolds, and you begin to realize that Prot can just be what he says he is. And in the context of the reality that the film has set aside, trying to wrap your mind around is an exciting thing. How do you react when all the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations we have set for ourselves? While in the heart of the film there is a resounding depth of humanity that is evident not only in Prot but also in Dr. Powell. All of this provides an extremely engaging and gripping drama. As we expect, Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant performance like Prot, presenting his character from the outside, emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time. This is a unique individual, and Spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share the moments that are particularly revealing, increasing the character and credibility of the story itself. For this movie to work, it is important that we believe who and what Prot is; We do, and it does. Spacey simply pulls it out. It is a memorable achievement from which a sign is being developed that will remain with you for a long time. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Jeff Bridges is on a par with Spacey, who makes a talented person to Dr. . Powell. It is a rather straightforward role, and the challenge for bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make him unique in his own right, which, contrary to the nature of prosthesis, was not a small task. And again, for this movie to work it was necessary for Bridges to rise to the occasion. And with superb skill and being the perfect professional that he is, he undoubtedly succeeds. Bridges infuse Powell with an underlying complexity and thus, in its performance, it makes the interaction between Powell and Prot live and sometimes intense. It is a demonstration of two of the finest players in the company that do what they do best, creating a dynamic that is vibrant and inspiring. It's a good job from Bridges, who never tries to steal the spotlight from Prot, which serves to raise the film's level to an even higher notch. <br /> <br /> Support support includes Mary McCormack (Rachel), Alfre Woodard (Dr. Villers), Ajay Naidu (Dr. Naidiu), Vincent Laresca (Navarro), Kimberly Scott (Joyce), Conchata Ferrell (Betty) and Saul Williams (Ernie). An entertaining, emotionally involved film, 'K-PAX' is a thesis on opportunities, as well as a study of the ever-evolving complexity of the human condition. It is a film that requires an open mind and rewards those who are able to approach it on their own terms and embrace it. In the end, make you realize how true K-PAX is; And it appreciates Prot's journey, and how much we all share and have in common with those around us, humans or strangers. And it can just make you reflect on your own journey - where you have been and where you are going. And that's the magic of the movie. I rate this 10/10 <br /> <br />
