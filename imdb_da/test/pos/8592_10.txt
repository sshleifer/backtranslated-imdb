When it comes to political films, I usually seem to feel empty. They generally take a moralistic attitude and you have a clear good vs bad storyline as if it were a kind of Batman movie. <br /> <br /> But with Lumumba, it's the first movie I've seen that showed policy for what it is and the real trouble trying to control a land of devastated people who haven't known anyone else rule than violence. There were no good or bad, just interests and conflicts of interest. This is the only political film in my opinion that you can get out of it, really learn something. Especially for anyone with their eye on politics as a career, this movie shows you, you can't control what you want for a country, but what the country wants from you. Therefore, I disagree with a lot of reviews that say that everyone comes too bad, I think they come too idealistic (the Belgians want the perfect colony, Lumumba wants a perfect Unity Congo, Tshombe wants wealth and wealth America wants it perfect allies against communism, Russia wants the perfect help for communism). And the Congolese? They come from used and abused (best example in the movie when Général Janssens tells his black troops, your government lied to you and it leaves them all in a rebellion) they are always drawn and pushed to support that person or another. /> <br /> This movie shows in politics an error can cost you dearly, and this movie all fails after a mistake until it escalates and ends up destroying the country. Their intentions may be good (or at least in the characters' sense), but that is everyone's fault leading to the decline in Congo. I do not think anyone is bad in this movie, I just think they want too much from people who are sick of giving and want to start taking. <br /> In general, it's not just the best political movie, it's a big movie in general. Acting is fabulous (Eriq Ebouaney as Lumumba was perfect casting I really believe him) script flawless, editing perfect pace and production value higher than I expected for a central African movie. A must see.
