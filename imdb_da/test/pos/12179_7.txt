pretty good, don't expect any high culture ....... the play is bad, the story fails, but it's still a pretty nice movie to watch. Why? because it is dark, a little stupid, as unpredictable and just entertaining and fun to watch. Don't expect anything like I said, just watch it for yourself and you know what I mean. It's a movie without a plot or a memorable play, but there are enough scenes that will make you laugh, cry or at least make you feel compelled to see it to the end ... <br /> < br /> That's all I wanted to say .... 7/10
