The sinister demons "The Gentlemen" capture the voice of the people of Sunnydale, to steal human hearts without screaming. Giles finds that, according to a legend, if a lady screams, the creatures will be destroyed, but Buffy and her friends, including Riley, must fight the monsters without speech. <br /> <br /> "Hush" is definitely the best episode of Buffy's fourth season so far. I had a lot of humor and fun situations, I liked a lot. Spike is funny, the romance between Xander and Anya is cool, but I loved the "intense" dialogue between Buffy and Riley at the end. The Gothic scenario in the final battle against "The Gentlemen" is reminiscent of the environment of "Dark City". My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "SilÃªncio" ("Silence")
