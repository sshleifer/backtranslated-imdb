A particularly nice movie for those of us who saw this when they were young, because it was the intention of the young people to see - when they once again see it as an adult, it is better if rose-colored glasses can kick in . It was the first of the 16 Jungle Jim movies and later TV shows Johnny Weismuller continued to make for Columbia (in the last 3 movies he had to use his own name even though they had lost the rights) after getting the bag off play Tarzan for Sol Lesser. Johnny Sheffield also quit playing Boy to become Bomba the Jungle Boy in a series of 12 films. Jim and the party go on a perilous safari to chase the hidden temple of Zimbalu manned by an unclear devil-stoned doctor who seems to have the secret of a poison that can also be a cure for polio. Edgar Rice Burroughs is likely approved. After 16 years, monosyllabic Wismuller spoke inappropriate stringent phrases together, not that it was important. On the fast march, we meet many of the exciting but generally playful inhabitants of the jungle, barring the creepy crocodile to eat the leading lady with her legs trapped under a twig and the surreal elephant stump (stock footage squeezed into one corner of the frame). Skipper dog and Caw-Caw collar had many adventures, none of which proved crucial to the plot if you concentrated! The biggest problem with the movie is the dangerous climax, which can be exciting, but also unfortunately reminiscent of the end of a serial part ?? and the original excellent series had been made 12 years earlier. Although I personally did not intend to do so, it also took a few hours! <br /> <br /> The only thing that was heavy about this was Wheeler; In so many ways a fun youth movie from the old days - not recommended for serious adults, so I love it.
