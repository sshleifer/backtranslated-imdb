Just before dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. Backwood's slasher started mostly with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning and Madman. Just before dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is beautiful. The action is top notch. Heroine of the movie is not your typical 'last girl'. <br /> <br /> Constance is a "woods" girl, but when it comes down to the primary instinct of survival, she's one step behind. Only when it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, the primary concept of survival goes in. There is a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the final girls' hidden sexuality - coinciding with its will to survive. Just before Dawn isn't for everyone, but for the slasher fan it's as close to perfect as you can get. The killer is very threatening - Almost as if it were a game to mage and murder anyone who crosses their territory. The final scene is a bit away from kilter. For the first time viewer, it can be a bit shocking. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of backwoods slasher. Even non-slasher fans will find something to like about it. The setting is creepy and makes one feel uneasy. The death sequences are not very gory, but I'm not sure the movie needs to go. See it!
