I got a couple of laughs out of this, more than many other so-called comedies. The big ship was a knockout and came to see a lot of it was scenery was fun: as was seeing some of Dyan Cannon's curves. This was not the height of Lemmons and Mattheau's career, but it was not a total dog as some suggest.
