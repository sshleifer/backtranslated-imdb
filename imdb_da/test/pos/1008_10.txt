This was one of the few Norwegian films I was actually looking forward to seeing. It started out as a couple of advertisements with a modley bunch at football matches. Then they made a movie out of it. The wires are not benefits (and you can see it), but they still do a good job and the film struck me all. <br /> <br /> Norway is known for making crappy movies (no offense) but I had a good sense of this. Even you, I am not interested in football, I wanted 2 see it. The story is much better than expected, and the laughs just have to stop. There are lots of cameos from Norwegian celebrities and players. The characters are well portrayed and you feel like them. IF YOU NEVER GONNA SEE A NORWEGIAN MOVIE. Let it be the one !!!!
