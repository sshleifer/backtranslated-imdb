I thoroughly enjoyed Manna from heaven. Hope and dreams and perspectives for each of the characters are excellent, and we, the audience, teach us every one of them, warts and everything. And the end was a wonderful, wonderful and uplifting surprise! Thanks for the experience; I look forward to more.
