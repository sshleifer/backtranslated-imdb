How do these guys continue? They are about 50 years old and work as if they are only 30. They play 3 hours of music at each concert, and barely spread a sweat. This DVD is their first concert in Rio, Brazil. While people do not speak English, they try to remember the words of the most famous Rush songs and try to sing a foreign language in the concert with their best friends. From Tom Sawyer to The Spirit of the Radio, this concert DVD will keep you in the chair and not want to pause or move away from the classics that you have listened to when you were young. This is their 30th reunion tour (started in 1974). I went to their Scranton PA concert and it was just as good, even though the PA did not play Freewill, so I was sorry. <br /> <br /> They have Freewill, they have the Trees, they have YYZ, The Pass, Driven, Dreamline, Red Sector A, Limelight, Roll the Bones, 2112, and more. 10 out of 10, because nothing else compares. If you never go to a Rush concert, at least buy this DVD.
