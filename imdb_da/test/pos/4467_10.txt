This is Lucio Fulci's best. If only all the movies he made were like this one. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary movie is as exciting as Dario Argento's "The Bird With Crystal Football" ... <br /> <br /> If you're an Argento fan but you don't like Lucio Fulci movies, such as "The Beyond", "Manhattan Baby", "The House by the Cemetery", etc., this has nothing to do with the others ... that's what the Italians call "giallo" ... that would be something like a "who-made" film in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> You don't know who the killer is until the last minute movie. <br /> <br /> But apart from that there is the plot: A lunatic who lives in a small village, starts killing little boys ... A journalist (Tomas Milian), a sexy young woman (Barbara Bouchet), a priest (Marc Porel), his mother (Irene Papas) and a witch (Florinda Bolkan) are the protagonists of this mixed, bloody story. <br /> <br /> Talking about the actors, I would like to say that Tomas Milian is fantastic (as always), and Florinda Bolkan is a fantastic village witch ... <br /> <br /> Want to know who is the killer? ... I can't tell you ... but I can tell you to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> (10 out of 10) ... of course!
