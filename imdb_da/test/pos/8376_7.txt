Former commentators have noticed the similarity in appearance between this film and The Third Man, director Carol Reeds classic film noir with Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. This similarity hits the viewer almost instantly. In fact, it is high praise to be compared to Robert Krasker's academic award-winning filmography in The Third Man. <br /> <br /> The reason for the Chair Identity has also been delimited quite precisely, but in quite common terms. I found it very creative and entertaining. As common as the "Mistaken - or Chair - Identity" unit is in both theater and cinema, it is only a unit and not to confuse the plot itself. Although the viewer may have seen this device "a thousand" times, the plot of the Chair Identity is full of surprises and phrases based on this device. It is the unexpected turns that make this movie much fresher, more original and engrossing than a plot synopsis can convey. The Identity chair does not rely on the kind of excitement that characterizes most film noire because there is no real mystery here. Instead, it relies on constant, minor surprises. In short, the Identity unit error is pretty common; But this plot is not. <br /> <br /> Finally, although I was not familiar with the casting, I found the play to be uniformly good, occasionally outstanding. I could easily have imagined other actors making this movie a melodrama, with bombast, overblown gestures and obvious facial expressions. The action is always more reluctant and subtle. Donald Buka is particularly restrained and credible, and he must never "blow the tire" with a clear facial expression that we often see in films that rely on the maintenance of subterfuge to maintain dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment in this otherwise fine movie was the very weak development of the plot of love history. As it stands, it seems like an afterthought - a gentle surprise, in fact - tacked to the end. Or perhaps during their joint trial, the actors simply could not convey a reliable level of chemistry that I could appreciate. This subplot should have been more apparent when the story unfolded. All in all, I thought this movie was a nice little gem, and I wondered why I hadn't seen it before. Try what you like it.
