This is a Disney movie from 1972. Currently I was eleven years old and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I felt nostalgic, I bought the three series of DVDs of the Dexter Riley films and even now, in 46-year-olds, I still enjoyed them. It was about fantasy, magic and pure fun. And it's still! I was not sure which of the three movies came first then second and last. So now I have the official dates. December 31, 1969 The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes - July 12, 1972 Now you see him now, you do not - February 6, 1975 The strongest man in the world. I still think the middle film was the best. The special effects were fantastic back in 1972 to us children. I definitely recommend it for all ages.
