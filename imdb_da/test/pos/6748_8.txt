There must have been a sale on this story back in the 40s. An epidemic threatens New York (it's always New York), and nobody takes it seriously. Some may say that Richard Widmark and Jack Palance did better in the street panic, but I disagree. There is always something about these poverty lines that really hit a nerve. The production values ​​are never so polished, and the play is a little rough around the edges, but that's why I think this movie and them as it is effective. Rough, granular, angular. And thrown. All 2. stricter or A list actors past their prime. No ego here. These people were happy to get the job done. Whit Bissell, Carl Benton Reid, Jim Backus, Arthur Space, Charles Korvin, and the melodic voice Reed Hadley float in the background like crude oil. By the way, I've been to the hospital a few times; how did my nurses never come out as Dorothy Malone? In these kind of films, they do not like much about makeup and hair, but they really managed to turn Evelyn Keyes into a favor. Or maybe they all put together makeup and hair. Anyway, it was pretty efficient. She plays a lovesick jewel smuggler who picks up a case of small packs in Cuba while smuggling jewels back to the ultra villain Charles Korvin (who in the meantime bounces his sister). You've got the customs agents looking for her because of the jewels, and the health department is looking for her because she is completing New York. No fourth change rights here. Everyone gets hassled. <br /> <br /> You need the right attitude to enjoy a movie like this. I have a brother who investigates movies for death. If they do not adhere to their Orson Wellian standard, he will bomb them unduly. They must have the leading expertise of a David Lean movie, the score of Wolfgang von Korngold, respectively Sound and Art by Douglas Shearer and Cedric Gibbons. It is not. <br /> <br /> But I have the right attitude and if you do well, you will love this movie.
