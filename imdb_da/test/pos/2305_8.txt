In 1895, in a small village in Japan, the king of the chapel Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura), Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), has an affair with a man twenty-six years younger, Toyiji (Tatsuya Fuji). Toyiji becomes jealous of Gisaburo and suddenly with Seki killing him. They choke Gisaburo and dumps her body in a well in the forest, and Seki tells the locals that Gisaburo moved to Tokyo to work. Three years later, the locals gossip about the fate of Gisaburo, and Seki is haunted by his ghost. The situation becomes unbearable for Seki and Toyiji when a police authority comes to the village to investigate Gisaburo's disappearance. <br /> <br /> "Ai no Borei" is a surreal and supernatural love story. Seki's remorse and the guilty complex make her see the ghost of her murdered man and destroy her lover's perfect plot. The camera is threatened by the quality of VHS released in Brazil, but there are very beautiful scenes including "Ringu" and the American remake "The Ring" using the view from the well from the inside at the same angle. Performances and directions are great for making "Ai no Borei" a great movie. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Império da Paixão" ("Empire of Passion")
