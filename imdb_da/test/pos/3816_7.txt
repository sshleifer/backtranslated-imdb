This movie kept my interest enough to see it several times. The reason has holes, but leading artists make it work. <br /> <br /> Katarina Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge) does a good job as a woman of 37 who has sacrificed everything else to become a doctor. She worked years to make money to go to medical school. She performs brilliantly in her home and is about to take her board control and realize her dream. At the same time, Julia's sister and brother-in-law are being murdered and as a closest living relative she is forced to enter into her niece, Amanda (Arlen Aguayo-Stewart), to avoid being a branch of state. Amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance. Amanda is so traumatized from her parents' murder that she has mute. Needless to say, Julia's 16-hour days are getting more care for Amanda. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney, a charming neighbor in their apartment building, working into Julia and Amanda's life. He is always there with a trick or joke to help Amanda address her distress. Amanda really starts to warm up to Kevin as the movie progresses, perhaps more than to her aunt. Julia starts trusting Kevin to take some of the burden that wears Amanda when she tries to handle her load and prepare for her boarding. Kevin is always there when a crisis breaks out for Julia. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was great. You watch out for them to come together before the end of the movie. The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was also good. Arlen managed to convey a great deal without the benefit of words. The reason Julia and Amanda had gradually warmed to each other. You can see them drafting a relationship that the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> We find that Julia's sister and brother-in-law (Meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer. They had three associates who intended to share the proceeds from theft. Julia discovers that Meyers was planning to cross the country under assumed identities. The plot is unclear whether Meyers intended to double their partners or was double crossed. <br /> <br /> In all cases, Meyers is murdered in their home with 2 of their former employees. The murderers make no attempt to extract the microchip's location from Meyers before they kill them. The murderers search the home and fail to find their prize. They leave a living witness to their crime, Amanda. The kills then use the rest of the movie and make clumsy attempts to extract Julia and Amanda's microchip, which have no idea where the price is. Eventually, Amanda's kidnapping murders, hoping she knows something about the microchip's location. <br /> <br /> Finally, Julia finds the truth about Kevin. He is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip. After some uneven moments in the relationship, they manage to save Amanda and send the evil ones. The predictable ending has the three who form a family and look forward to a future together. <br /> <br /> What struck me about the plot was huge gaps. Kevin moves into the same apartment complex as Julia and Amanda the day after the murder of Meyers. How does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killings? The murderers blithely leave fingerprints on the murder scene, without worrying about hiding their identity. The murderer pretending to be a psychiatrist is revealed to Amanda by remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe sole. He was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film. There are other weaknesses along these lines for many to mention. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been much better if the script had been refined more before recording. Filling the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort.
