Gary Cooper and a Marshal Change Identity, since they both agree Cooper would be more effective towards the banned. What is remarkable in this movie is the costumes, both the Marshal and Steve Cochran's, the bad guy. Cochran carries its arms backwards, probably to cross. The movie starts quite exciting with a showdown with Wild Bill Hickok. Ruth Roman, looks very pretty, is the marshal's fiancee. There is lots of action, never a dull moment, but you have to concentrate because the story is a little complicated. Good entertainment.
