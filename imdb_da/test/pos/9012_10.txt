I have never been forced to write a review, but seeing such bad reviews about such an innovative show made me say something. First, people just have to overcome the fact that the voices are different. When you see an episode, it will never ever think again. The humor is original and while yes, some jokes transfer from the movie, they are delivered fresh. Some of it even reminds us of Shrek - self-referring humor. Many of these jokes seem to be aimed at teenagers or original fans of the movie as much as tweens and younger. Patrick Warburton and Eartha Kitt are both hilarious as they represent their roles as Kronk and Yzma, and their Annie Award nominations were well-founded. <br /> <br /> This show takes some time to love, to really get into the track "of things so to speak. If you ignore the horrible theme song (which really should not guarantee so much in the way of how you judging a show as it is only 30 seconds of the total product), this show is laughable hilarity and does not lose any of the emperor's new groove spirit.
