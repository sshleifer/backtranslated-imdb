A nurse travels to a rural psychiatric clinic run by Doctor Stephens. She is sorry to know that the doctor is dead and leaves her assistant doctor masters. She is dissatisfied with the inmates, including a crazy judge, a shell-shocked Vietnam veterinarian, a catatonic and a spooky nympho, but soon becomes befriended by a Hulking Black Man Sam.She needs all the friends she can get, then people die around her. "Don't look at the basement" is my first horror movie of SF Brownrigg. In spite of its low budget, it does provide some real chills plus a good amount of cheap gore including a very unpleasant scene with a spindle through an eye. The climax of inmates who take control of mental asylum is an intense melange of wild camera work, gore and piercing screams.8 out of 10.
