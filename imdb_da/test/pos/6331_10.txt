Although it is not a comedy in the usual sense of the word, it is more rewarding than any movie full of laughs but without content. I don't think Bergman's movies can easily be classified under narrow genres, even the lightest ones are quite complex. This film, despite its light touch, poses a number of issues related to marriage and its deficiencies, and what happens when the flames begin to die, etc. I do not really communicate personally with all these problems that I am sure others do . But the atmosphere of the movie is extraordinary, you almost don't want to quit. I must admit that I was swept away by Bergman from the fifties when he became aware of most of his later groundbreaking efforts. Before Nykvist, von Sydow, Ulman, etc., the master produced some of the richest, warm and touching movies I have ever seen. Although it is a long shot, I have seen this kind of love of human nature, in its complexity, only in Fellini's film from the same period. A lesson in love with Smiles of a Summer Day is worth seeing for Bergman fans, to get the full picture of the man's abilities and for those who love cinema with a heart. May he rest in peace!
