"Man of the Year" tells the story of Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) a political comedian (like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert) who has his own TV show. At his show, he talks about all sorts of things, but his main focus is political issues that he is very convinced of. One day at his show, a fan from the audience claims the idea that Dobbs should run for the president of the United States. After this episode, millions were sent to the Internet to make various petitions and vote their opinions on why Dobbs would make a major candidate for the president of the United States. A few weeks later, Dobbs decides to run for president and low and see, wins the election. Everything seems to be going as planned until a woman named Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) appears and starts a series of controversies about his position. A fun but serious political thriller follows? <br /> <br /> People entering this movie, expecting to see a brainless comedy, will surely be disappointed. I always wonder how some people are film marketers when I see how misleading their marketing campaigns are. "Man of the Year" is a good example of bad and misleading marketing because everything from poster to trailer, to online advertising makes this movie feel like a comedy. I would honestly say that about 1/3 of the movie is fun, while the rest of it plays as a political thriller that provides good arguments and allows its audience to think. I'm curious in this case if the marketing was done appropriately, as this movie deals with rather serious issues between its comedy routine. <br /> <br /> But enough about marketing, let's get down to the movie itself. <br /> <br /> I really liked "Man of the Year" even though I was expecting to see a comedy instead of a serious movie. One of the many things I want to give this movie is that the film does a decent job that changes between comedy and drama, although at first it seems a little awkward. I really think after you find out that the movie is more of a political thriller than a comedy, you will be comfortable with it. Some may not be because they lead to believe they see a comedy and do not understand what this film is trying to say at the end, but for those people they can blame the marketers for not advertising this movie properly. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Year" speaks of a lot of things and seems to have a very strong opinion. As Tom Dobbs speaks, he says things to be said and not about candy. I also believe in the whole political subplot, while most critics say that the movie is probably damaged again by the misleading marketing, was very good. The idea of ​​computer voting has been thrown over the last few years, and with all the problems computers have to solve the problem in this movie, it could probably be realistic. The control that large companies have over voting rights is also being addressed. <br /> <br /> As far as counting is concerned, I think everyone involved has done a good job. Robin Williams had a chance to be fun and yet serious at the same time by playing Tom Dobbs. Some say Williams has exceeded his welcome as a comedian, but I still believe personally, he's funny and he's also a good serious actor. This is probably one of the few occasions, although we'll see him going back and forth from serious to fun and I think it works well. It's also nice to see Lewis Black's co-star in a decent movie. Again I like Black when he appears on "The Daily Show" and gets up, but most of the movies he has been in were horrible. This was a good movie for him because I believe his political views fit into the story that director Barry Levinson tried to convey. Laura Linney is a great addition to the cast and once again shows that she is a very good actress, and eventually Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum do a good job as always with these roles handed down to them. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Year" was written and directed by Barry Levinson, the man who brought us movies like "Rain Man", "Good Morning Vietnam" and "Wag the Dog." Levinson does a fine job writing the movie and controlling it. As I said, I know many critics did not like the whole political thriller aspect of the movie, but I thought it was fine. It was really nice to see a mainstream movie that allowed me to both think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson did a fine job with this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, don't go into this movie, expecting to see the movie that the ads sell you. It has laughs, but at the same time it plays more like a political drama. It's not as silly or silly as the marketing campaign makes you believe. I really liked this movie that this movie was not a typical Hollywood movie. It was trying to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and at least worked for me. I like the fact that the movie doesn't really talk down any of the issues it addressed or had a typical Hollywood ending. I tried to call the end from that time, but surprisingly it didn't end as I thought that made me happy. It is a movie that makes you laugh, but then a few minutes later allows you to think and wonder what will happen next time. I think it's a good movie that will be harmed by its poor marketing.
