Camp North Star and it's Camp counselor extraordinaire, Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray) will definitely end up with decades of losing touch to rival Camp Mohawk, an ivy league type place where only the wealthy children can attend. Meanwhile, we see when Tripper tries his hand in love when he cares carelessly with his female adviser Roxanne (Kate Lynch), who other teen counselors mate and fall over also. The movie comes to mind at Camp Olympiad when the rivals squared in competitive athletic competitions with Tripper who almost understand their doomed for failing another year. The movie also shows the growing bond between Tripper and a quiet lonely, puppy dog ​​eyed Rudy (Chris Makepeace of "Vamp" fame) whose father is often gone all the time. Rudy doesn't seem to fit in with the other kids of his age, and he seems to spend most of his time either jogging in the morning with Tripper or taking his peanuts on Blackjack. The movie mostly contains the jin jinx of fellow teen camp advisors cut up and goofing around. <br /> <br /> You have hottie advisers, total nerd Spaz (Jack Blum) with his taped glasses and bad acne, beak "Hardware" (Matt Craven) who likes to blow up, fat kid Fink (Keith Knight ) that often puts his face, among other things in the film. There is a basketball game where poor Spaz can hardly jump the ball against rival Camp Mohawk much less shoot an accurate shot with poor Fink throws underhand, mid-his-knee fly balls that sail over the back plate. There is camp fire coupling (with a scary scary tale of Tripper about a hooked killer) and boys choking over the lovely ladies. Yes, I know it is desperate sometimes to try to squeeze out every laugh it can and occasionally pamper during sentimentality (such as the scenes with a sad Makepeace and Murray), but as much as this recent show I found myself even giggling away. I'm licked and just can't help loving this. It is a summer camp movie through and through which simply will entertain you. I can't explain or amplify the overwhelming joy that is flooded when I see a sleepy Murray's hand stretch from the covers of the alarm clock that is loudly speaking a summer camp movie is beginning. His intercom jokes are particularly entertaining. But the girl is, let's be honest, a series of comic vignettes with Murray dead-panning infinitely .. there is nothing wrong with it. However, the film could not survive without him, could it? It's hard to even think of this movie without Murray in the lead. It's a happier time, and I think nostalgia in that summer camp experience plays a good part in why we adults still associate with "meatballs" hot. And bad Morty (Harvey Atkin), the camp leader who wants so hard things to run smoothly and to turn Camp Mohawk into a change, is the constant source of Tripper and gang entertainment as they often play gags on him. especially when sleeping on his bed! Great excited cast that seems to have as much as us.
