Aristocats are really quite charming and are considered too low on IMDb. The songs are not as memorable as those in the Jungle Book, but they were not bad at all. The animation is really nice, the best sequence is the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another big piece of animation was O 'Malley, who looked at the Dukes' eyes, as their romance was so credible, but not overtly. (A good thing) The reason (about a greedy butler and a fortune reminds me of Bailey's Billions) was a bit unoriginal, but worked very well, and the manuscript was really fun, especially the fighting between the kittens. They remind me of me and my brother and 3 sisters who are always fighting. My favorite scene was Edgar's hunt with the two dogs who always fought for who was the leader. The voice talents were a joy, especially Phil Harris, whom I recognized from Jungle Book, and Eva Gabor, from the Rescuers. The support characters, Scat Cat, were also well done. In conclusion, a really comfortable movie that is absolutely underestimated. 8.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
