These guys are excellent and everything they send to the public is first class. The music in this band is amazing and we should all be very grateful we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and personal. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it all the time !! I could recently watch these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and were blown away. I have not missed a show since the power windows and I have to say they are better than ever. Everyone should embrace these guys and teach others what true musicality is! There will never be such a tight and well-composed trio again in our lifetime. Let's just hope and pray that they won't retire anytime soon!
