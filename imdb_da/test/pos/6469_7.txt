John Cassavetes is on the run from the law. He is at the bottom of the pile. He sees Negro Sidney Poitier as his equal and they quickly become friends and form a kind of alliance against a bully of a fortune played by Jack Warden. <br /> <br /> As one who has worked in a warehouse even when I was younger, I can tell you that the warehouse is struggling, complete with tumbling package cases and flailing grappling hooks are as realistic as it gets. I have been in battles like these even though no one was killed. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Sidney Poitier's widow is a variation on Shakespeare's Shylock "Don't I?" This is an anti racist movie that was much needed at that time. <br /> <br /> All three main characters - Warden, Cassavetes and Poitier - are excellent, with Warden the most outstanding of the three.
