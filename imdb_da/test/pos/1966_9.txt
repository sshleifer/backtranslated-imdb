The river's edge is not a PLEASANT movie to watch, but it's an incredible one. Having seen it many years ago, I really think it would still be possible to shock if it were to be released or restored or something. Perhaps no movie has ever captured the essence of young suburban inertia like this distrubbing scary movie. Since this is based on a true story, it is even more disturbing. Very well acted and just uncomfortable many times to see, but also a little known masterpiece and a really important movie. Must be mandatory to look nationwide at all highschools. Fantastic.
