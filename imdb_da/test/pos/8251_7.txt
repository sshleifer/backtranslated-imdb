Just brilliant enough to be plausible and still very fun, this is a pure piece of the 1970s (though the police need hard hard!). Shot in and around London, the American ex-con who tries to go straight, but finds himself sent as an electrician to a bank in Mayfair, and then the screws put on the crime master David Niven and finds himself plotting the crime of the century is good handled. <br /> <br /> I liked its simplicity and even innocence, it goes back to a time when hijackers movie, just what a creator and violence was not part of the deal. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can do much worse than look at this: it has enough twists to give it something oomph and a throw that of course had fun doing it. <br /> <br /> Nicely made and durable.
