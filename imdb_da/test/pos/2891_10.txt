I bought this DVD recently, and I was totally surprised that Rush's songs sound the same as they did when I first listened to them in 1980. The lineup of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart is so talented that I will build them again and again. Songs I remember as Tom Sawyer, XYZ, The Big Money, The Trees, Freewill, Closer to the Heart, 2112, Limelight and The Spirit of Radio were played and 40,000 plus fans singing together and having a good time and I swear by half of the audience was under 25! Authors who put Rush as far as Rush fans like me are concerned are a bunch of jealous dunderheads who like to taste rancid cream mixed with lemonade in a taco. <br /> <br /> Rush does not put on makeup, wear spikes, lip sync, wear lipstick, have trouble with the law and have a band member about how long they have been unmarried. Everything they do is entertained! <br /> <br /> I give this DVD a 100 out of 100.
