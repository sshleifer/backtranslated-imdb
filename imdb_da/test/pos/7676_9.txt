I've been searching for this movie for years. I have good memories of the first-class acting and singing in this movie. I never knew the reason why the movie was unattainable was because of the Gershwin family's actions - SHAME ON THEM to try to suppress the American Classic !! I can only hope they will relate and allow this movie to be released and enjoyed by the American public. <br /> <br /> Sammy Davis, Jr. is in its absolute best in this movie. The only other performance of his, that's right, was in 'Anna Lucasta' - another great movie that I would want to be released on DVD. <br /> <br /> Porgy & Bess featured a first-class, all-star molded. Hopefully one day you will see for yourself.
