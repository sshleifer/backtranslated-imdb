To say I didn't expect much to sit down to see "The Couch Trip" is an understatement. I didn't know what it was all about - I thought it was a journey into the realm of sexuality when I heard Chevy Chase playing a condom man, and the movie's title involves the word "sofa trip" * flash, blink. * Then I found out that it had something to do with a mental institute and a patient fled. My expectations fell even lower. <br /> <br /> I was literally expecting a laugh movie - the type where you smile once and go out, feel a bit cheated. And in a way it's cheap comedy - it doesn't have the biggest gags, the plot is ridiculous, but you know what? I had a big silly smile on my face all the time I saw it. <br /> <br /> Dan Aykroyd plays John Burns, a patient at a mental hospital who may or may not be mentally. He gives the psychologist Lawrence Baird (David Clennon) lots of grief and misery, which makes us believe he is a sane person. After a bit of a rebellion in the mental institute's cafeteria, Burns awaits a heavy lashing from Baird in his office when the phone rings. Burns picks it up, pretends to be Baird, and finds out the caller on the second line, Harvey Michaels (Richard Romanus), wants the right Dr. Baird coming in for a radio shrink called George Maitlin (Charles Grodin) takes a vacation with his wife, Vera (Mary Gross). Michaels wants Baird so bad that he himself has booked him a ticket on a plane. Burns escapes the institute with the help of a receptionist and drives to O'Hare. He gets dr. Baird's ticket comes on the plane and is put in the air as Dr. Baird. His show is a phenomenal success. "People love him!" A man says, and the other man answers, "That's because he actually cares about them." <br /> <br /> Donald Becker (the late, great Walter Matthau) is an ex-mental patient who recognizes Burns' clothing as being enclosed pants and shirts. To keep him quiet, Burns Becker promises a percentage of his income. The secret is closed. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Maitlin and his wife come into an argument. He flies home to finish his holiday card and realizes that the man on his talk show is not, in fact, Dr. Baird after all, but no one believes in him. He gets the right Dr. Baird, but unfortunately he has lost his id so the police take them as keys and not listen to their story. Let me mention a few of the plot holes I noticed while watching this movie: Burns pose as Dr. Baird, however, is never asked for his ID even when he claims his plane ticket (he was robbed, he says, but they will still make sure he is Baird). If Burns gets so famous, how does the real Dr. come? Baird in Chicago never to hear people talking about him? Words Travel. And finally, why should the police ever arrest Maitlin and Baird (the real Baird, that is) without following up on their stories? <br /> <br /> To be honest, I couldn't care less. I went into this movie with a closed mind and it surprised me - I really liked it. It entertained me. Its ideas are essentially ridiculous and not at all realistic, but Dan Aykroyd gives a really exciting performance as a half-a-pay that makes "The Couch Trip" a worthwhile trip. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 Stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
