As you may know, Norway is the most developed country in the world (regarding the HDI; Human Development Index). This film reveals our future the future for us. Our future would be for Norway since we all paddle to achieve the best and offer the least. The life that was shown was perhaps an exaggeration, but comparison of today's concerns with our ancestors is not far from reality. <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie free of all our preconditions, we can find both our faces; the one who laughs at Andreas' brilliant scene, dumps his girlfriend and the one who searches through magazines hours and hours to choose a stupid chair among stupid collections. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the hole with the hope of lightness was another great idea of ​​the movie. The little honesty; But the only one and the effort that was put into achieving it made us feel closer to Andreas. <br /> <br /> Although I was attracted most to the idea and production of the movie, Trond Fausa Aurvaag played pretty well and the atmosphere in the film was quite matchable.
