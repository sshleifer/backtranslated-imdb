I have seen and enjoyed all the Chameleon movies and I have to say that they are getting better and better with each one. Bobbie Phillips is great and my grandson wants to be like her. I'm glad they brought a "Brother" sign to Bobbie (Kam) so we can expect to see more exciting shows. Bobbie is beautiful, sexy and sweet and independent at the same time, and everything a woman wants to be!
