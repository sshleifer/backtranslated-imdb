Venice, in 1596.Jews are separated from the good Christians.Bassanio loves a young but poor Venetians the righteous Portia, who is a wealthy heir. Then he approaches his friend, a merchant named Antonio, for three thousand ducats to travel to Belmont and propose Portia. All Antonio's ships and goods are taken up at sea so he turns to the money provider Shylock, the Jewish faith. do not like Antonio because he spit on his face. He offers Antonio a three month loan of no interest, but if he does not want to pay the money in that time, he will own a pound of his meat. Shylock's daughter Jessica also works with Christian Lorenzo. Merchant of Venice is based on William Shakespeare's game, which is thought to have written between 1596 and 1598. I read the game last summer and now I have seen the movie, made in 2004 by Michael Radford. I liked the game and I do not quite agree with the allegations of being anti-Semitic. Jewish character does not seem like an inhuman monster, even th ough he is ready to cut a piece of Antonio's flesh. There is much depth in his character, which everyone comes into his speech, asking, "If you stick us, we will not bleed?" etc. There is much more human in Shylock's character than in one of Antonio's who spits on the good Jew. Al Pacino is unbeatable as Shylock. He gives such a strong performance. Jeremy Irons is also great as Antonio.Lynn Collins is most beautiful and brilliant in the role of portia.zuleikha robinson does good work as jessica and charlie cox as lorenzo is also very good.kris marshall plays gratiano and he does a good job. in the role of nerissa we are seen heather goldenhersh. Mackenzie Crook plays Launcelot Gobbo.As in Shakespeare plays normally, also this one contains the most brilliant dialogue. The film paints a fantastic depiction of era.It deals with some major problems, in a Shakespearian way.
