"Labyrinth of Passion" - with the possible exception of "Matador" - is Almodarov's best film. It shows its unique personality at its best and least censored before he started to go more mainstream. Almodovar is just about the only modern director who can turn to Preston Sturges wonderful brand of lunacy. It is pointless to try to explain what the film is about, the real point is Almodovar's will and skill in taking his situations to the outer limits of sensuality, and sometimes also by plausibility and taste.
