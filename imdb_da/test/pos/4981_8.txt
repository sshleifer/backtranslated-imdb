Extremely entertaining mid-1950s western, packing a great deal into only 96 minutes of driving time. Most viewers will quickly be drawn into this story and will find the experience quite enjoyable. More than just a B-Western, but not really an epic, the budget was modest and thrown affordable despite several big names. Glenn Ford was the only cashier at that time. Edward G. Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck were past their primates and looking for work, Stanwyck was 10 years away from a new popularity in "The Big Valley". Brian Keith and Dianne Foster had just started. <br /> <br /> Ford plays John Parrish, a small ranch who decides to sell out when the sympathetic sheriff is murdered by the big ranches (Robinson) hired the shooter. Parrish is a former Confederate officer who only moved out for health reasons to the west. <br /> <br /> Robinson plays Lee Wilkison, who already owns most of the valley and intends to acquire the rest, promising his wife Martha (Stanwyck). Lee was paralyzed in a land war he fought 12 years earlier; his brother cole (keith) has come up from texas to help him run that huge spread. Lee has looked in the eye for obvious contacts between Stanwyck and Keith, but sensitive daughter Judith (Foster) is understandably disturbed by what is happening in their home. <br /> <br /> John Parrish has promised his fiance Caroline (May Winn) that he will move back to the east. Caroline, modeled on Grace Kelly's "High Noon" character, breaks the engagement at first sign of trouble and simply disappears from the movie. This gives the way open to a John and Judith romance to develop. <br /> <br /> The violence starts early and continues the entire movie, where Parrish is able to use military tactics against an enemy who underestimates his ability and determination. He has a very original confrontation with the main gunfighter about half way in the movie. Ford plays one of his standard characters; the modest guy who disarms everyone with a self-defeating way, who is slow to take offense but brutal when finally provoked (much like his role in "The Sheepman"). <br /> <br /> Robinson is also excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity, even though it is physically just a shadow of his former self. And he gets enough lines and the screen to develop his character adequately. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck has the most difficult role, and she is simply not convincing as the classic biphasic woman, a seemingly loyal wife who is ashamed to replace her husband with her brother. Partly because it is not given enough time to do anything more than superficially convey each side of the character. That said, a talented actress could have done a much better job even with these limitations. <br /> <br /> Dianne Foster is a pleasant surprise. She should remind viewers a lot of Carroll Baker, both physically and in acting. Although it is required to play Judith under the 1950 Convention (she is allowed to be harsh but then obliged to break into hysteria after each major confrontation), Foster shows a good selection. She conveys a growing attraction for Parrish, but makes it so subtle that it is only gradually that the various tracks are in place. <br /> <br /> The real problem with "The Violent Men" is that it tries to be both an action western and a character study moral game. Because so much has to happen on the screen, much of the action is premature and many of the characters only get a brief treatment. This is neither a fatal mistake nor a reason to avoid the movie, but it could have been significantly better with another 20 minutes of driving time or the absence of unnecessary characters like Caroline. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know well? I'm just a kid.
