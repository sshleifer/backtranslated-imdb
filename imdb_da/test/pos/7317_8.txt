This is an early from the boys, but some people may not be happy with this as all the others. I found it different in a way than your average Stooge slapstick. It was more fun because it is jokes instead of the forehead in the eye or slack. Look for a hilarious part when Larry grabs the stethoscope from Moe and sings into it. Moe gives him a good alley. That part made me look up for a good ten minutes. Another hit for Stooges.
