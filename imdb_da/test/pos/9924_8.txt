Dario Argento is a filmmaker I slowly enter after the iconoclastic action of Deep Red and Suspiria; He is not a filmmaker to always care about stupid things like "plot". It may be his one minor (but obviously) responsibility: he will not let a little thing like reason turn up his plan for his elaborate killings, as his killer (s) can go through any kind of elaborate set-up of being invisible until the detection passes the point of POV tracking shot of the psychopathic killer. But it is exciting to see a filmmaker take chances like this anyway from a pure Italian aesthetics that goes into the soul of a Hitchcockian warp (in fact, as an interest, if you have recently seen the scorseese short film where he took three pages by an unfiltered Hitchcock movie, which also took place in an opera, Argento had been nearly twenty years old, probably without the knowledge of the text). It's also effortlessly the 80s (CD players and heavy metal and hair, oh my!) And with an absurdity that makes it more sweet to swallow. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: an opera by Macbeth is produced with high stylized pyrotechnics and trained raven. There is even a talented, up-and-coming star replaced at the last minute, Betty, played by Marsillach. But a murder occurs during the premiere - not interrupted by it, but by a falling light - and now the murderer is Betty! She can't go to the police (how can she escape the opera is really damned?) But will it mean in the face of a murderer who doesn't want to escape? One has probably seen a local place like this played out in another Argento movie girl who was chased by a killer - but that is how Argento, like De Palma, designs and performs its sequences and adds a distinctive flavor itself to add touch of bizarre humor (raven's outbreak to attack the killer and the subsequent version of points in the lineup), a kind of over-styling ala Leone (the ball through the core hole through the door probably inspired a similar shot in Kill Bill 1), and even sado-masochistic inspiration with the founders taped to Betty's eyes more than once! <br /> <br /> Argento puts her actress through wringer, and she's all games for it, even when things seem to just go into 'what-the-hell' territory (I almost throw my hands down gives as she is led down into the secret passage of the little girl as if we were suddenly in foreigners now). And through such dark genre material, Argento keeps the violence thick and fresh, the excitement of as much as opera music coming straight out of a stereo speaker and a filmmaker who might have had a few drinks (and rightly so!) In some scenes the way they are shot and vibrate to a heartbeat. It should be considered as a garbage can, but it is elevated beyond any limitations of the genre by the director's bold attitude, this despite a silly end-of-life than anything that preceded what came before it (thank you little lizard) - and an attempt to break Macbeth cursed, which unfortunately did not seem to happen in real life on sets of Opera. 8.5 / 10
