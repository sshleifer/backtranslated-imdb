This was a great movie I wanted to compare to the movie The Game. You come to the end of the girl and can't move ... your brain has been removed and shaken (not touched) and laid back in the head. Don't plan anything for this movie, you have to spend time thinking about what just happened. <br /> <br /> Do not come to this movie, expecting the Matrix style to spend millions on special effects, these movie effects come from the actors, they keep you involved, no, they suck you in and let go of the entire film's duration. Great acting, great plot ... very funny movie, I can't say enough. Also very original plot, lots of phrases and ideas that I would never have thought of. The end is abrupt and lets you hang wondering, was it real? Is this really the end? Good ending, not to say it's bad ... just leaving you wondering and a little frazzled. Great movie for those who like action as a good plot (don't get up for a bathroom break on this movie you will come back lost) and like mind games because it's exactly in a nutshell what this is.
