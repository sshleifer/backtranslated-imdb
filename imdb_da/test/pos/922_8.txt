In my analysis of "Trois couleurs: Blanc" I wrote that its tone is much easier than the tone of "Trois couleurs: Bleu". I think it's the same with this movie. This time it is not because of a tragic comedy element, but much more because of the protagonist Valentine. Although her boyfriend lives abroad and is ridiculously jealous, she manages her life with ease and optimism; The opposite seems to be the judge, who is very pessimistic, a grumpy old man who experiences great loneliness. In my opinion, Valentine and the judge are pretty much the same, the judge is just as much older and has experienced many more disappointments. They share another kind of naivety, and they both discover that they can learn a lot from the other. Finally, I would like to emphasize Ir√®ne Jacobs' performance, she rounds off the course of amazing female contributions to the "Three Colors" trilogy.
