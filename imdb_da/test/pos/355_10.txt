I've been a Mario fan as long as I remember, I have great memories of playing Super Mario World as a child, this game has brought many of these memories back while adding something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise. There is very much different about this game from any other Mario before, while still keeping intact the greatest elements of Mario, the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space. The story begins a lot As another Mario game, Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach, inviting him to a party at her castle in the mushroom chamber. Upon arriving at the peach castle, Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attacking the castle with their airships. Bowser kidnap Princess Peach and lift her slot up in space. In the middle of the castle, space is lifted Mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to Luma's home, a floating space station, here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has removed the space station Power Stars and spread them across the universe, it's up to Mario to help Lumas find them and save the peach so the adventure begins. <br /> <br /> The way you play the game is to fly from the space station to other galaxies, each galaxy consists of several planets that mario moves on levels through these shooting stars to retrieve power stars. Mario can go all the way around planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others are big, many planets look like classic Mario environments. The best thing about the game is the controls, all things like jumping and such are still the same, but wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. You shake the remote control Mario will perform a spin used as the primary attack in the game and it will also activate the shooting stars. You can also point to the remote control on the screen and use the pointer to turn off star stumps from enemies or objects in the environment. Then there is the graphics, it is by far the best graphics on the Wii, it's just so hard to describe how well this game looks, you could almost say it looks as good as some 360 ​​games. <br /> <br /> My only minor gripes is that it goes up and down the effect some get used to and also the story is pretty weak. The worst part is that you lose all your life when you turn off the game, no matter how many you had when you last quit restarting on 4 lives. Still these minor issues aside, it is a great game that is very entertaining and is very challenging. This is the kind of game we've been waiting for on the Wii. <br /> <br /> A perfect 10 out of 10!
