A brilliant and sensitive film with interwoven plot lines. As a general warning, the film becomes quite dark halfway through. So suddenly it is a change that I found appropriate for the film's themes, especially the comparison of the ishkanan to the crooked kingdom, and (as stated by Finn in the end), how each person constitutes the tribe and how the whole tribe is reflected in every person. <br /> <br /> Anton Yelchin (Finn Earl) is spectacular in this movie. He is probably best known as Chekov from Star Trek or Kyle Reese in Terminator Salvation, but he has been in a large number of movies that you have never heard of (Alpha Dog, which is another brilliant performance at Yelchins part, House of D, Hearts in Atlantis to name a few ...) Pointe is that this kid really takes this movie and makes it his own. Other great performances by Diane Lane and Donald Sutherland are what take this movie up in a notch, from great to excellent.
