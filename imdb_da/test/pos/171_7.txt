Three ten-year-olds born at the same time during a solar eclipse begin to abuse anyone who offends them. <br /> <br /> While murder movies were not brand new at the time of this twisted 80's slasher theme for kids as murderers seem nice to this movie. Bloody Birthday delivers some good chills and excitement while managing to be a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities. It stretches a fine line between cheesy and eerie, but it remains entertaining throughout with an interesting plot. There are some strong murder scenes, as well as a good bit of nudity to establish this as a solid slasher of guilty pleasure. The cast does a pretty good job. Young Stars Elizabeth Hoy and K.C. Martel delivers some threatening performances while rising star Julie Brown makes a striptease before a memorable scene of murder. Veteran star Susan Strasberg performs well as the teacher, and Jose Ferrer has a cameo look. <br /> <br /> This whole off-beat slasher entry is not bad, although it is not flawless, but it is worth looking for genre fans. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
