When I first saw it, I thought, "Wow, this is the most spectacular movie, visually speaking I've ever seen." Since then, I've seen some who peaked, but it's still one of the best in that department. I'm just disgusted, the long awaited DVD was so poorly finished, the quality of this transfer is hardly better than VHS tape. The Jungle scenes are filmed in Cameroon, and "lush" is the best adjective to describe what you see. Apart from jungle sounds, "seeing" is probably almost everything in the beginning, as there is almost no "hearing", no dialogue until Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) turns to Ian Holm and vice versa .... so be ready for it if you haven't seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Historically, all I say is not Tarzan many of us come to know in Johnny Weismuller's film ..... but it's not a complaint. For the demanding actions and don't care about filmography as I do, just go past the quiet introduction period <br /> <br /> In this Tarzan version, our way back to Scotland (his roots) adapts to this environment (for mostly .... and a little too fast for credibility, honestly) and then return to the jungle without Jane. This is allegedly more true for the Tarzan books, written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> The special effects here are made by Rick Baker, one of the best in the industry. Sharp DVD or not, it's still a great movie to watch and very interesting within 2 hours and 15 minutes.
