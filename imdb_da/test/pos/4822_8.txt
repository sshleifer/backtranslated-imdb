This has no relation to Virtual Encounters 1, so it's not really a sequel. The two videos just share the general concept that people have simulated gender through a virtual reality machine. So if you were really blown away by the story and the dialogue in VC 1 (yes, right) and expect a continuation in VC 2, just be warned. All actors and actresses are new, but it has the same excellent director, Sybil Richards. <br /> <br /> But like VC 1, you get lots of beautiful women and many beautiful sex scenes that push the envelope of soft core almost as far as possible. <br /> <br /> If you have VC 1 and you liked it, you would like VC 2. If you don't have either but as really good softcore sex, get both.
