As a previous commentator, I saw it in 1980 and has never been able to shake memory of the poignant story, amazing plays and dramatic musical score. It certainly contains some of Sam Waterston's best work. He and the authors portray Oppenheimer not only as an unjust victimist - as he was - but also so naive, fond of alcohol and snob, a rounded portrait rather than a stereotype.
