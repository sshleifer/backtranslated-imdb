This is a beautiful smart, well-behaved version of the "modern" 30-woman adventurous romance. In this case, she helps the man she loves to become the head of the company while serving as his secretary and eventually winning his love from a shameful social butterfly. Interestingly, her business sense is shown as subtly parallel to her homemaking skill, and the office members are depicted as "the powers behind the throne." The promise is far above the average of Mrs Astor's intelligent performance.
