Just one of the biggest movies ever made. Worth sitting next to such European masterpieces as the rules of the game, Grand Illusion, Nothalghia, Andrs ROUBLEV, 8 1/2, WINGS OF DESIRE, VIRIDIANA, SATISFIED FOR THE PROTECTIVE STARS, LA STRADA, THE WORD, PASSION OF YOURS OF ARC, THE FOUR HUNDRED BLOWS and MADAME DE ... Both a blessing ... and an almost perfect work of art.
