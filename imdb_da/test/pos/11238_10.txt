For all losers who made a negative review, it's because you probably have sex once in 2 years or you're in the LTR with a girl for years. And guess what? She'll cheat on you when the player like them on that show approaches her somewhere. Of course, any man who is not as good as these guys will hate them and hate the show. And the one chick that thinks of this show is supposed to mock those guys. It's actually more how to show a clueless man how to pick up a woman. What do they do in a way better than what most people do - not approaching at all. For someone who has an open mind, I recommend reading the book "played" by neil strauss.It is about similar theme to this show
