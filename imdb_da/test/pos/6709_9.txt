Many say the end didn't make sense, but it did. With the female vampire dead, the connection to the ground was destroyed and the ship departed and had retrieved many Lifeforce from hundreds of thousands of souls. Enough to reactivate these hexagonal cells and create new wings It seems that they do not have sexual gender, like legendary vampires. <br /> <br /> Vampire fluttering from outer space can be ridiculous, but killing them with a shot to fight in the middle of the heart is consistent. All you can ask for is consistency. The viewer must suspend disbelief, even for scifi. <br /> <br /> The only problem is to be a sword or a bet, not bullets. It puts in a supernatural twist that doesn't fit sci-fi. So that's a problem. <br /> <br /> The only major disagreement I found is killing the male vampires with the sword, but the soul of the girl and Carlsen goes up to the ship. I suppose men's souls also went up on the ship, but not shown. <br /> <br /> What about all the people killed? If their qui forces ("souls") go up to the ship as discrete units, are all the life forces merged into one, for use as the ship sees fit? In other words, all the human souls who went to the ship could be recovered as bat creatures. <br /> <br /> The basic concept is no more ridiculous than Star Wars "Force" or even reincarnation. <br /> <br /> This movie was over the top, kitchen sink (Dawn of the Dead meets Alien meets Dracula), but in many ways in-depth. It was also a beautiful love story. The beginning and the end were ethereal. Both began ("what happens to me") and ended as a love story. <br /> <br /> Most of the criticism of the movie is about being bizarre. So what? Bizar is an art form. As far as it is ridiculous, it all fits. The pest concept is much more interesting and subtle than foreigners who just kill people. Perhaps they did not need Patrick Steward's blood to form a picture of the girl, but it was a very far-off surreal scene. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the movie is hated is because of the ending. But the end perfectly fits the beginning. People are so wrapped up in the naked girl that they miss the film's core. It's a love story from start to finish. It starts with Carlsen and the girl on the alien spaceship and finished the same way. So it fits perfectly. Most people are fixed on the hero to kill the monster, and this movie did not end in that way, which is exactly why I love it. <br /> <br /> Instead, it has a good ending, where the two go back to the ship to be reborn. The road cooler than the hero kills the monster end, but that's exactly why it bombed. It was not a straight-up horror or even scifi / horror at all, but a love story with a beautiful beginning and end. All these souls flash on the ship. And the crystal room pulsating with new life. <br /> <br /> Most people can't handle a love story that is also Alien meets Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula.
