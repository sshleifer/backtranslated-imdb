"Hit and Run" is a divisive story with the always wonderful Margaret Colin as a community lady who "has it all" until she hits a child with her car and leaves the scene. Thus, the title. The tragedy is that she goes to call for help and returns, but is frightened by angry passers-by who believe the hitter left the scene. This was made in the days when not everyone had a cell phone or there would not be a story. <br /> <br /> Colin's guilt and anxiety are tangible and make her work so strange that a detective comes to her right away. Her lies sink deeper and deeper into a self-hiding hole, causing her to make a bad situation worse. <br /> <br /> This is a very thought-provoking story and one can only help feel this lady's pain that wants all the time, she would simply come clean. <br /> <br /> As a television movie, thanks to Colin and a strong script, this is a well above average television movie.
