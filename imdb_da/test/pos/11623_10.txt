Most recently available in DVD (11/11/08), Severo Pérez's film ... and the earth did not swell him (1994) based on one of the most recognized and discussed novels in Chicano literature. Tomás Rivera is ... and I have not told him (1972), is still recognized by many critics and serious readers as the classic Chicano novel. Originally written in the Spanish characteristics of South Texas and also translated into English, Rivera's novel continues as an indispensable presence in the Chicano literary landscape. <br /> <br /> Perez's film, originally made as a highly rated American playhouse PBS production, has taken some time to be released in DVD. One can only wonder about this case because its high quality is not a problem. However, as far as I know, the film, and now DVD, remains the only cinematic adaptation of any Chicano novel and clearly a tribute to the incredible resilience of the Earth. This movie version also hits an unusually deep-rooted nerve, which I maintain, both specifically ethnic, but also generally universal. Doubts about the Earth may have arisen because it is too "ethnic" also for strangers from a basic American mainstream, too much a "foreign" artistry, too limited in financial resources. Yet, in his art version, Perez connects very effectively, artistically, and creates a sharp etched depiction of a Chicano migrant collectivity that focuses on daily family life. As for a production made with relatively limited financial resources, the wonderful film work and haunting music goes far beyond the available funding. Just watching the film promotes the artistic value of this movie (or DVD). In short, and. The Earth did not swell him in a neo-naturalistic way, the depiction, suffering and despair of Chicano migrant workers, following the crops north of South Texas to Minnesota in 1952. The local priests bless the overwhelming, crowded vehicles of these Chicano workers. who can no longer find work in the area and must follow the agricultural trail of migrant workers north This Chicano collectivity, as the depression era of Steinbeck's Wrath grapes, constitutes an epic tide driven by economic needs, a survival instinct, and horrified despair and last end a barely shimmering belief. A tribute to these people on earth, a collective hero, the DVD is centered on a fire family, and especially emblematic is a young protagonist of the family, a boy, maybe twelve or so. This work also works as an image novel. Ultimately, viewers' sense of identity is generated through the protagonist's experiences, subjectivity and struggle. Poverty, alienation, child labor, illness (sunshine and pregnancy death), discrimination, school absenteeism (the boy's escapism from the discrimination bullets spent lying in a lovely and peaceful cemetery) are actually laid out, also symbolic. The worse is that the problematic conflict between youth and his mother goes beyond socio-economics and political conflict in deeper areas of psychology and metaphysics. In a desperate but artistically rendered struggle, the youth fights his mother, an archetypal Mexican-American traditional, a representative of God's will, contented with prayer, departure, comfort, and acceptance. The rebellious youth cannot believe in a god who will allow such evil and suffering to be visited on them. How can God be so cruel, he asks, as his little sister is certainly innocent, to come down with severe disease in the fields? At this point, the boy must overcome obstacles even more frighteningly than poverty and discrimination. The problems now include death, doubt and despair and lack of meaning. And he has few resources available to him? Character of character, his own willpower, his intelligence and a powerful survival instinct. In this desperate but artistically retaliated struggle, the unnamed youth, the central figure, feel the necessity of being persistent, achieving an increased sense of meaning, and the viewer hoping for a renewed and strengthened life force that can serve as an inspiration to Chicanos and others. This strong struggle makes use of a plot unit that is only affected by the original work of tying episodic work together: Missing migrant workers from Mexico who do not leave traces of their death, although this DVD does not deal with Mexican but Mexican US migrant workers an extremely existential work: anxiety and despair; a search; a focus on a project; and redemption? All under free will despite the deterministic socio-economic and religious conditions. Perez has a long list of credits as a documentary. His many awards are affirmative. The producer Paul Espinosa is also known and has also been honored for his work. The 1994 film actually won and deserved a number of awards: first place, audience favorite at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1995; first place at the Cairo Film Festival; and a number of other well-deserved prices. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie and DVD, Earth, by Perez is the best Chicano movie made.
