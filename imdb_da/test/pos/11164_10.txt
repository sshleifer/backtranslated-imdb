I just watched this movie in an example and I can only recommend seeing it. It was about 90 minutes long, and when it was over, I felt like it could go for hours. The stories from the protagonists are so realistic and you really feel at home. The movie basically consists of dialogues, but I didn't bored for a moment. 18 people of really different characters, and each one of them acted so well. I had to laugh, felt awkward, sad and still happy. All in all, it is a movie that shows the different kinds of people in our society, the way they communicate and how love is changed and today is handled as an economic thing. Dating becomes something like an audition. The whole audience loved it. So please see it if there is a possibility. You will love it!
