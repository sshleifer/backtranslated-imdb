Yes, let's get it out of the way before we begin: * This is what Sean Connery returned to in 1983 after the style we had by Roger Moore. * It's Connery's last movie. * And yes it is a (kind of) remake of Thunderball, but more of a movie inspired by it. If all you Bond purists out there think I'm getting controversial, you're right. Bond is one of the greatest movie series ever, but that doesn't mean that a series should continue forever. This I think is one of two films where they could have done themselves a great favor and ended the Bond saga. Not offended yet? Then I continue ... Hey, if you think I don't care about Bond flicks, you're wrong. I grew up with my mother who was aware of them. Any extra moment, Bond and his antics would be on TV. Bond rules, and 'Never say never again' (directed by Irvin 'Empire Strikes Back' Kershner) are one of the best. It may not be 'Goldfinger' or 'From Russia ...' and may not have been done by the same production house as all the others (as I hear why they refuse to accept it was ever made!), But still stand head and shoulders over the latest Brosnan excursions ... (if you haven't spit on the screen, read on). CHARACTERIZATION !!!!! Something so many blockbuster movies forget these days, but something important to tell a good story. 'Never' played a fantastic hand by treating 007 as he had been aging since 'Dr. None'. He is coming a little and then one has to do things like going to a health farm - a direct order from 'M' (!). Yes, if you have not seen this movie, I will not give away too much with the plot because A) Loads are happening and B) Of course, I want you to see it for yourself. Connery must not be discouraged by my 'old Bond' revelation, and he still gets lots of amazing sets to charge, swim, beat, fast, smash, and twist. The man is a legend and this film is one of his most enjoyable trips like Bond. High-tech gadgets to a large extent, some great villains and an excellent support casting (including a great cameo by Rowan Atkinson) elevate this movie high above the expected audience. <br /> <br /> This could have been the last Bond movie ever and it would have been a celebration to remember. Playing the secret agent as a person approaching retirement was refreshingly brilliant stroke - the last scene wraps things perfectly with the series .... ... but we still had more and more and more and more and yet another Moore . Still, if you want to find out what "Fatima Blush" is about, get this movie. Then, at least, let as though 007 spent his last moments as a wisecracking secret agent, in Kim Basinger's arms and grinning at Mr. Bean. (P.S. * The second movie I think might have finished it all? The gritty 'License to Kill'
