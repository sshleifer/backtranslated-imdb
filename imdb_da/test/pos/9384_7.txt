A large bed occupied by a demon eats people among other things. I can't do it. <br /> <br /> Completed in 1977 and not officially released before it came to DVD in 2003, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is a movie whose plot is impossible to describe. You know the most likely of it thanks to Patton Oswald's excellent piece of it, as well as Stephen Thrower's essential book "Nightmare USA." As you see it, you wonder the following <br /> <br /> What is George Berry and what drugs does he smoke / inject / lace before writing and controlling this movie? <br /> <br /> a horror comedy? A combination of a horror flick and an art film? A strange prank is being drawn to the audience? <br /> <br /> What the hell do I see? <br /> <br /> "Death bed" really counts for some explanation. I know the concept is over, but it couldn't be more true than it is here. This really beggars description. It's a horror comedy, as well as art movie / horror hybrid. But the whole thing is so surreal, it must be seen. The result sounds like the electronic bits from an old Candlemass album, the play is terrible and disconnected, the direction is surprisingly competent, and the movie sometimes feels like a Jesus Franco movie, that is, if his film was intentionally fun. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is really no proper way to describe this movie. Gentlemen know I've tried, but really, getting movies is as strange, unique or fun as it is. See it ... but you've been warned. It's also the only movie George Berry has ever made. He has definitely noticed his utilization genre with this, I tell you so much.
