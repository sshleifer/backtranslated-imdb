This indie film is worth seeing because of the huge talent of its creators, Wallace Wolodarsky and Marsha Forbes. Mr. Wolodarsky has directed the young cast and he is to be praised for this effort. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie is a warning about the dangers of having something you can't have. What is the story of Alice and Ed. Having lived together for a while, Alice suddenly becomes restless because she imagines she lacks experience in the sex area. Alice and Ed's relationship, but not an example of ideal happiness, is a pleasant way to share their lives with each other. It was until Alice and Claire, her sister, happened to hit a sexual encounter by another couple who had no idea of ​​being observed. <br /> <br /> This incident makes Alice reconsider his own sexual life with Ed; She finds it lacking substance. When she suggests seeing other people, Ed is shocked to say the least, but does not want to contradict Alice, he decides to join. What happens next is that both Alice and Ed enter a world that has been unknown to them. The people they meet in the end are not worth the trouble. They are unfortunately aware of the end they were made for each other. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth seeing to see the amazing Julianne Nicholson, whom we happened to want in another movie, "Tully". Mrs. Nicholson reminds us of a young Shirley McLaine; She designs such a luminous quality about her, it is difficult to take her eyes off when she is in a scene. This young actress shows that she is a successful performer who gets better with every new look. She basically bears the film. Her Alice is a contrast study. Alice is a decent woman who thinks she is insufficient in pleasant ed because of her experience. Jay Mohr is an excellent match for Mrs Nicholson. Both do wonders together. His Ed is completely trustworthy. We have known people like him. Deep inside he is a good person who suddenly gets himself into a situation he has not called for, but he only goes together to discover that he is too decent and not cut off for a life of free sex with the willing women It has no problem with a dryer in the hay, just for fun. <br /> <br /> The rest of the throw is wonderful. Lauren Graham does some great work as Claire, Alice's yuppie sister. Andy Ritcher is also wonderful as it founded Carl, the nerd friend who finally finds out when he meets Penelope, a single mother. Like Penelope, Helen Slater, makes a joyous, though short, look in the movie. <br /> <br /> The director is hugely gifted, who will undoubtedly go places because he shows that he is fit for the job.
