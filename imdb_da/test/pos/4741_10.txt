Having seen "Waco: The Rules of Engagement", I was just dissatisfied with what I was witnessing. A big cover up by the FBI, a massacre of gung-ho / trigger happy government agents? I remember clearly Waco standoff, I was 17 at the time and saw it all at CNN. I remembered reflecting on all the kids when I looked at the fire in Mount Camel in April 1993. I remember being upset by the children, but it was obvious that it was their evil leader David Koresh's fault and the other David's sake. Gazecki's film clearly and undoubtedly shows, even though it is anticipated, that the FBI lied again and again. I think this movie was a major contributor to the reopening of a new investigation into the incident in 1999. The result of this new study was somehow predictable, the judgment was based on the fact that it was just as crying as the facts presented by the davies. I was very disappointed with the judgment as far as I know it did not take into account all the lies, misinformation and evidence covered by the FBI and other officials. Why has no one been prosecuted to impede the work of the Texas Rangers investigators? Why were they allowed to contaminate the crime scene and bulldozer connection shortly after the incident? These are questions that I have not received from the government. Most importantly, what about the kids? In this new study, I have not been informed who was responsible for spraying the flammable tear gas into a connection with many hazards to ignite this gas, and I have not found any answer as to whether children's muscles are contracted due to the effects of the gas while they were alive. If they did, I would surely believe that Janet Reno or who was ever responsible for the raid would have been accused of mass murder or rape. The question raised by Gazecki but not mentioned is; Where is a direct plan for those responsible and their thought to cut holes and burn down the building with intention? (a plan that would have been achieved with 112% efficiency) or were the officials responsible so incompetent that their was ignorant of the consequences of their actions? Both are equally scary. Even if the davidians are passionate about the connection, the responsible officials have probably given them the opportunity to do the job. If the responsible officials, as they claimed, knew that the davidians would turn off the connection, why not? did tanks cut all the holes in the building and made it a furnace and why didn't they plan to handle the fire they knew would arise? Dark issues that still do not go away The final and most relevant question about this movie is the way the Davies are demonized by the government through the media, who just give it to the public. I clearly remember the anger I felt for the evil davids that I saw on CNN in 1993. Now that I'm older I can see a clear line of communication coming out of the government every time they gear up for a massacre of civilians along with the intended goals. Demonstrate people with words like; "they have different illegal values, so we" "do not enjoy freedom" and "they pose a threat to our freedoms and lifestyle" make them so much easier to kill ????
