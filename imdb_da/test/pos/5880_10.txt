I was blown away when I saw "the best years of our lives". The actor, script and master William Wyler's Direction (winner of Best Director in 1946) is Brilliant. This movie is about three WWII veterans coming home from the war and reuniting with their loved ones, but dealing with the difficulties coming from the war. <br /> <br /> The first man Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar winning role) comes home to find his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and the children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) has grown up and different than before he left the war. The other man Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews) must find a good job and come home to a wife, he had only been married for 20 days before he left the war. He begins to find out that she is not the same. Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his Oscar-winning role) has lost his hands in the war and has to deal with his family and fianc√© 'Wilma's (played by Cathy O'Donnell) reactions to the hooks he has in place of his hands. <br /> <br /> All these men and their families are reunited in the movie in various scenes. The stories of these men are all interwoven together beautifully. <br /> <br /> This movie really defines the meaning of a "Classic". This unforgettable drama (winner of Best Picture in 1946) is a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If I was asked to choose a favorite movie, it would be! <br /> <br /> Out of 10 I will give "the best years in our lives" a 10. <br /> <br /> So next time you go to your local video store rent this movie, you won't regret the! <br /> <br /> No offensive material a good family movie.
