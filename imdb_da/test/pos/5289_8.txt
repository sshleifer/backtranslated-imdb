For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: He is still in top form and created another worthy experience. Okay, you don't have to read on now. <br /> <br /> I already think most readers are older than the two main characters in this picture, so I should say that Ponyo is not as much a family movie as a chance to remember the feeling that Be a Little Child: Discover the world as you would see it, create your own rules and boast an exciting excitement for doing things on your own for the first time. Ponyo swears away from many of the problems that aging films tackle. It never condemns, all signs have good genuine hearts and credible problems. The two main characters can be two of the most trusted children I've ever seen on the screen. They are not simple, arrogant or naive, just curious, enthusiastic, and learning the ways of the world. They are so easy to love, but even easier to identify with. Many films consider children from the outside, as the adult looks at a world that only a child can enter. Ponyo brings everyone back to that world. In Ponyo, there is the first time to learn and choose what you are most interested in, as the film appreciates with high esteem. It's worth remembering to feel it again.
