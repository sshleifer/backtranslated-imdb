The heartpiece of cartoon pioneer Alex Raymond, "Flash Gordon", was the great fan of all sci-fi epics. This series is the first time Flash was brought to the celluloid life. Despite the low budget, this is a large space opera. The story begins with the earth sentenced to apparent destruction when Planet Mongo is spreading through space on a collision course. Maverick researcher Dr. Zarkov is heading for the nearby planet in a self-made rocket ship, convinced he can do anything to stop the hollow celestial body. He gets some last minute recruits in the form of resourceful athlete Flash Gordon and beautiful Dale Arden. When they reach mongo, their problems really begin. They run out of the dreaded emperor Ming, who is Merciless, conquers of his world, which has some ambitious plans for Earth. The rest of the series is about Flash's desperate attempt to save the earth; the various foreign cultures he meets the allies he makes spaceships he flies the battles he fights and the monsters he beats. <br /> <br /> Brilliant-cut by Raymond, "Flash Gordon" features classic archetypes from legendary myths and antiques. Echoes of famous tales as the sagas Troy and Camelot and Sherwood Forrest are seen here. You have the dashing, beautiful heroes on a mission to save the kingdom (Flash); The evil king (Ming); The Old Wise Man (Zarkov); The lovely lady in distress (Dale); the seductive siren (aura); loyal allies (Thun, Barin, Vultan); Plus monsters, dragons and various beasties. <br /> <br /> Flash is a modern Robin Hood, Jason or Beowulf. Ming is Prince John or Aggamemnon. Dale is Helen of Troy or Gwenevere or Maid Marion. Zarkov is Merlin or Odysseus. (Or Gandalf) Thun / Barin / Vultan are the merry men or the knights on the round table. <br /> <br /> You get the idea. <br /> <br /> You can't help but notice how many ideas from "Flash Gordon" would later come back in STAR WARS. The Cloud City; Ice World; Forest Moon; The rolling opening text (From the second series); There are others, but you get the core. The whole sci-fi genre owes a great debt to this timeless classic. <br /> <br /> Buster Crabb is the perfect action hero and I personally think he is better at this kind of role than any of the current acts of stars. He also played Buck Rogers and Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton is the performance of diabolical nastiness as Ming. Sure, he seems a bit melodramatic today, but that was what the audience expected from their evil in the 30s. <br /> <br /> Jean Rogers is our hero's love interest Dale Arden and I had such a crush on her when I first saw this as a boy. I can easily understand why Flash always rushed to his rescue. She is the distinguishing good girl to counteract the seductive manipulations of Aura, the quintessential bad girl. The support aids seemed perfectly selected to emulate their comics counterparts, and despite the now frivolous FXs, a lot of exciting actions were in this groundbreaking serial. <br /> <br /> An all-round fun romp and the beginning of the sci-fi genre in the cinema.
