I love this movie !!! <br /> <br /> This beautiful, charming love story immediately drew me in with its lovable characters and heart-warming romance. I was so attached to the characters throughout the film that I felt I knew them personally. The story is very enchanting and it brought me tears in several touching moments. Duchovny and Driver have a very cute, coastal environment that you can't help getting involved in. This is worth seeing more than once and show to all your friends. I'm just curious, why wasn't this a big hit? <br /> <br /> I give this a 10 out of 10! Spectacular movie! (And it comes from a guy who thinks that 9 out of 10 movies aren't even worth seeing.)
