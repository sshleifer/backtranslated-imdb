I will admit that I might have missed small moments when I was not aware, but I got plenty of history to accept that it is a great family movie, from director Lionel Jefferies, who played Grandpa Potts in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Basically, it starts with a happy middle-class family living in Victorian London. One night, the father (Iain Cuthbertson) is visited by two strangers and he leaves with them and does not return. They move to a cottage in the country, and here are the children; Bobbie (Jenny Agutter, whom I first saw in Child's Play 2), Phyllis (Sally Thomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren) keep their spirits up with their fascination with the nearby railway. Every day they wave faithfully to the passengers in the passing trains, and with courage and vigilance they also avoid an accident and make heroes. Their kindness makes them friends, including important people who can help find the mystery of their missed father. Also starring Dinah Sheridan as mother / wife. Waterbury, Bernard Cribbins as Albert Perks, William Mervyn as Old Gentleman, Peter Bromilow as Doctor Forrest, Ann Lancaster as Ruth and Gordon Whiting as Russian. It was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 24 on the 50 largest British films. Very good!
