'Radio' is a beautiful movie based on a real story about the mentally challenged James Robert Kennedy, named 'Radio' and the football pitch from T.L. Hanna High School, Harold Jones. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding, Jr. is excellent as a radio! I would never imagine seeing him in a serious performance, especially because most of the movies I see with him are comedies. Ed Harris is great as Harold Jones, but this actor is great, so this is nothing new. The mentally challenged young man named James Robert Kennedy always goes around in T.L. Hanna High School, without bothering anyone and almost not noticed. One day, when the ball of the football throws himself close to him, he decides to stay with the ball, for the impatience of Johnny Cash, one of the best players of the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you ever wanted have met. One day Cash decides to punish James, trick him with other football players and even go as far as tying him. <br /> <br /> When coach Jones discovers the horrible action, he remains angry and punishes the entire team who decide to help James, who is named "Radio," for his passion for radios in general. <br /> <br /> The film shows how Radio becomes a talented assistant that helps the team's trains despite the hardships of the players, and even gets respect from virtually all the people living in the small town. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a real and beautiful story. It has a life lesson that specifically shows us how a person can make a difference, not even what we call "normal". Radio has a big heart and is incapable of hating anyone, and that is one thing we must all apply to our daily lives.
