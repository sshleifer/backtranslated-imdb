The Twins Effect - Chinese Action / Comedy - (Charlene Choi, Gillian Chung) <br /> <br /> This vampire action comedy is one of my favorites because I was thoroughly entertained throughout the movie. First of all, the characters are memorable and contribute a myriad of classic scenes. Charlene and Gillian are naturally sweet, charismatic and humorous. This movie was my first exposure to them, and all I wanted to do was reach through my TV screen and give them a really big HUG. The remaining cast was good in their supporting roles, including Jackie Chan, Karen Mok, "The Duke", Josie Ho, Edison Chen, Anthony Wong and the Vampire Boys (one of whom looks honestly familiar with Will Ferrell). Even the terribly horrible Ekin Cheng was good at this. Good characters are, of course, important because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between action sequences. <br /> <br /> And it's about action, this movie has lots of it. More importantly, emphasis is on quality in combat choreography. One aspect that helped in this respect is the protagonist's highlighted weapon? a sword with a retractable spear rope. This weapon, in itself, opened a series of movements that would otherwise be impossible. Josie Ho and Gillian Chung perform in particular some vicious airplanes using these devices. <br /> <br /> In addition, the swordplay is excellent and highlighted by two major sword battles ?? one takes place in the order of the opening train and the other that occurs in the church's final. In fact, the knife-guiding maneuvers exhibited in this film radiate some other highly overstated fan favorites for great shame, and I really feel sorry for those who would quote the terribly choreographed waste seen in Ashes of Time, Storm Riders or A Man Called Completely with the well-planned, precisely executed sequences seen in The Twins Effect. It's not even close. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why this movie gets so much criticism. I'm sure the mortal apologists for the Hong Kong "Golden Age" will hate this because it doesn't fit in with their narrow view of what the Hong Kong action should be. We had to learn from John Woo's downfall - a one-trick pony that never learned to reinvent itself. We don't need another clone. We need something else. The Twins Effect is a good example. <br /> <br /> This movie was so good that it actually set me up to be disappointed by other Chinese films with the same actors and actresses. This is especially true for Ekin Cheng, whose other films almost always suck? And yes it includes the indecently overrated and utilizing wuxia crap mentioned in the previous paragraph. Even The Twins have never been able to match the value of this movie, since both were leading actresses in a movie, although they have managed to beat some good movies when one or other takes the lead (eg Beyond Our Ken , Good Times Bed Times, House of Fury, or when one or both help support roles (eg, the Color of Truth, New Police History, Just a Look). The Twins Effect 2 should have been a direct successor, rather than a family fantasy. I still long to watch the Charlene and Gillian team and kick some shot in another movie, but the fact is that The Twins Effect hits all cylinders, optimizes their charisma and avoids a descent into annoyance (as in Protégé de la Rose Noire ). <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie has everything you need to entertain. And do I have to remind the reader that this is precisely this ?? Entertainment ?? who judge the film's grandeur, more than artistic dramatic elements or meaningless prizes from established academies by critics who usually have no idea what they are talking about. <br /> <br /> In the end, Twins Effect is a CLASSIC not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Rating = 5/5 stars <br /> <br /> PS ?? The Hollywood executives decided to slaughter this movie when it was released in the United States by renaming it The Vampire Effect and cutting out 20-minute footage containing parts of the action scenes. However, the final match in the American version has a better soundtrack than the original version. Therefore, I bought both versions, which allows me to first see the original until approx. 1: 20 mark, and then change discs to watch the final match in the US version.
