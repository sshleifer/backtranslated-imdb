As Roger Corman has said in an interview, low-budget film making allows filmmakers to take chances for offbeat ideas. Now you would be hard pressed to find a movie that thrives on offbeat as mightily as George Barry's "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats". <br /> <br /> The movie has a back story to it, and it's an interesting one on it. I will refrain from disclosing any details so you can hear them yourself if you take a chance to see it. Suffice it to say that the title of furniture has an insatiable hunger that consumes the unwanted with a bubbly yellow foam that dissolves its victims as acid. <br /> <br /> "Death Bed" is a creepy, joking little girl who plays her absurd performance in such a way that it exceeds the usual range of schlock fare. It takes its particular dream world in such a way that it was possible for me to take it seriously. It's a really weird and unconventional horror flick. It explodes into exploding ingredients - there are some tasty dolls of female nudity - and yet art, albeit art with a totally skewed sensation. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not so bad for a movie with a microscopic budget, and Barry gives the film a good and atmospheric "midnight movie" quality. The cast from the cast is as uninspired as you could imagine, although Patrick Spence-Thomas gives a fair amount of gravitas as an artist / narrator and a particular point of interest is to see a familiar face at hand: the future 'Boy Meets World' father William Russ! <br /> <br /> This movie may not even have found the little cult following it, if it wasn't for pirates making the rounds; This must certainly be one of the cases where such a practice ultimately ended up helping the movie - even though the exposure took years. <br /> <br /> If you have a taste for really bizarre obscure things, "Death Bed" can be just what you have in mind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
