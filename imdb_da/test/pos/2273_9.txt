I just saw "Everything is illuminated" at the Telluride Film Festival. This is a truly remarkable movie. Very emotional, fun at times and heartwarming. Take your handkerchiefs! For those of you who enjoy a movie that brings tears to my eyes, I recall the end of "Babette's Feast" and "The Notebook." The stories were completely different, but had the same emotional power to bring tears to their eyes, as this film did. <br /> <br /> No spoilers here. The summary, as IMDb describes, is a young man's journey to Ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is in English and Ukrainian (and also Russian I believe). This allows for some wonderfully linguistically-based moments, as a sign interprets more or less faithfully for the English speaker in the group, as the case may be. Nature is wonderful, and musical scores are a treat with wonderful Eastern European influences. Make sure you stay through the credits for the final tune. <br /> <br /> This is Lieve Schreiber's direct debut and is well done. I give this movie a 9, one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. I highly recommend it.
