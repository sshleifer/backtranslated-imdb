The beloved Rogue is a wonderful time. It portrays the 145th century Paris in Grand Hollywood fashion, but offers another deeper side to existence there as it would be experienced by the poor. And the snow. It is constantly whirling to add to the difficulty of the setting - brilliant! The setting is enhanced by the odd cast of characters, including beggars, ripples and dwarfs. <br /> <br /> A brilliant performance is set by John Barrymore, excluded exclusively by the magnificent Conrad Veidt, depicting a degenerate, dissolute Louis XI perfection. And yes, Veidt deliberately picks his nose and pushes his portrayal into wonderfully ugly borders.
