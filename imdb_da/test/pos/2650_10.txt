Of course, being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange was "no doubt about it" that I had to see this. But I hit it all too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments such as "extremely boring" or "nothing happened" "a complete waste of time". But when I saw pictures on the internet of the mysterious black monolith, I was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001: A Space Odyssey. There was no doubt I was going to rent that movie that night. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be the greatest visual experience of my life. Of course, it can be wonderful to see a very good painting or picture, but seeing a movie built with the same kind of virtuosity in each frame adds a whole new dimension to it. My God ... I like my friends, but it's a shame that I can't share with them what makes my heart jump up with excitement and makes my spirit fly like a bird in the sky. The thing my friends are beauty. As this film proves, beauty is underestimated in our technologically advanced, intellectually superficial, consumer-driven fast food western society. However, this does not mean that I reject these fast-paced societies or that I look down on them (and not Kubrick), but only that they can be so much more if only people would stop for a moment and take some time to absorb the pure beauty in the world we live in. And what better option is there to do so, by slowing down to the elegant pace of this movie and letting yourself be taken to this place between waking and dreaming. <br /> <br /> When we go to this place it is possible to get a so-called "natural high". This is something our spirit can do when we meet clean and boundless beauty. And never in my life has this "natural high" or "spiritual orgasm" as it is called by some or "samaddhi" by others become more intense. Yes it is more intense than a regular orgasm ... several times more intense indeed. Many religions have claimed that this particular feeling shows that they are right. Do they right For me, a right answer to such a question would only detract from the universe's impenetrable fascinating mystery. In my opinion, the film tries to convey the same mystery through the monolithic depiction and by saying the following: "Apart from a single very powerful radio emission directed at Jupiter, the four million-year-old black monolith has remained completely inert. and purpose is still a total mystery. "Trance, which Bowman experiences, is the same thing I see when I see the beautiful images. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that mystery can be frustrating for those who need healthy fast food answers to great ontological issues. But instead of giving us comfort, we are constantly annoyed by the awareness of the simplifications contained in these answers. The subsequent doubts and discomforts will draw our attention to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of all these problems, while we only have our simple answer to the blame. But this film shows us that when rapid ontological statements give rise to nothing but doubts, we can always rely on phenomena to make sense of the world. From the moment you realize that beauty is something that can only be presented to us as a phenomenon and never as a "thing in itself", the mysterious black monolith is no longer disturbing, scary or annoying, but instead becomes fascinating. enchanting and perhaps even soothing. We do not need an answer to what is really out there to be in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives. When we are able to make mystery what it is to embrace it ourselves ... we can finally bring our souls to rest. I'm pretty sure a movie that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never surpass. Especially now that the greatest instructor who has ever lived is no longer with us.
