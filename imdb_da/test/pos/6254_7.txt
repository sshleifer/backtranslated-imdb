The slasher subgenre has been quite exhausted - in fact, in 1979, just a year after the supposed "first slasher", Halloween (released seven years after the Bay of Blood) was released; The subgenre was not far from being exhausted; but the Tourist Trap represents one of the more original excursions. The film follows the same basic formula as most slashers - ie. madman kills a lot of children, but draws his originality from the fact that madman is shown from the beginning (as opposed to an invisible attacker or a man in a mask) and we actually get an insight into his character. The fact that this killer also has telekinetic abilities, including being able to control the wax thumbs that fill his house, adds the originality. We start with a large opening order, which sees a young man fall into having a flat tire after finding himself in a gas station of terror. The scene is incredibly unsafe, as the wax thumbs cheat him and things fly from the shelves - and that gives the audience a good insight into what is to come; for a very horrible horror movie! <br /> <br /> Actual credibility is as non-existent as one would expect from the seventies, but to be honest; it's not that bad. The girls look good, the boys do not really do anything; and Chuck Connors is more than sufficiently scary in the role of psychosis. He is not exactly Anthony Perkins; but still good enough. It is not the play that is the star's show, and as you might expect - the eerie atmosphere takes that price. Waxing models proven by the House of Wax (Vincent Price version ...) are very scary; and the film makes the best use of this fact. There are very few things in the cinema that can be scary by just being there - but wax statues are definitely one of those things. The killer's special ability could easily have got in the way of the atmosphere, but the film makes the best use of this fact even by having different things fly from shelves, and it goes well with the rest of the movie. On the whole it is a very good movie. While the Tourist Trap may not be absolutely necessary; It's worth seeing and I can recommend it.
