Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer are not for people born before 1980 or after 1989. Most of them would not appreciate the amazing things that are 80 comics. The fact that Rainbow Brite was made for a movie is a guilty pleasure for many of us who remember to watch the TV show as a child. Granted, much of the dialogue is quite funny and silly, and the plot is non-existent for meaningless, but it is a very cool movie anyway.
