Being Russian myself, sometimes it is difficult for me to get the reference jokes about American television personalities or celebrities. Apart from that, Family Guy is the smartest, funniest and most politically wrong show on earth. The voice action is excellent and sounds clear enough even for a non-English speaker like myself to understand. Animations are also good, maybe even good for a TV show. Here we have answered the adult swimming channel, but there is nothing that simply compares to this gem. Not even the Simpsons or South Park. Hope the creators will continue to entertain and entertain us. Don't want to see it all, which goes down in mediocre entertainment.
