The third entry into the "Stepford" franchise, but apparently, the three televised observed successors are incredibly unclear and difficult to track down, while the 70's original as well as blockbuster remake with Nicole Kidman is widely known and very popular. Nor have I seen the early 80's "Revenge of the Stepford Wives" or the mid 90s "The Stepford Husbands", but this "The Stepford Children" is a pretty charming and very entertaining little movie. It's basically the same movie as the original; Of course, less mysterious yet much more cheesy and incredibly 80s to nth degree. The main difference here, as the title suggests, is that not only are the liberated wives, but also the rebellious and punk teenage offspring of the city undergo the typical and highly effective "Stepford treatment" approved by the local men's association. For some reason, the scenario tries to maintain the Stepford mystery until late in the movie, although no one is likely to see this sequel before they have checked out the original and probably everyone also knows about the denouement. The Harding family is packed and ready to move from the pigs city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford. Especially father Steven is thrilled with their new life because he already lived in Stepford and always wanted to go back since his first wife, whom his new wife Laura and young children Mary and David know very little about, died under mysterious circumstances. The city is almost too perfect, with picturesque neighbors and model students, and especially the modern teens face great difficulties adjusting. Their efforts to modernize the site and take the local youth in Stanford due to confrontations with prominent citizens, especially the members of the Men's Association, and stressing family relationships. David meets and falls in love with the last "normal" girl in the school of Lois, but when she even turns into a domestic dummy overnight, David can convince his skeptical mother to investigate the creepy Stanford secret. The first hour of "The Stanford Children" is slow and pretty pretty, but the final is trashy and cheesy like the VHS cover promises, and as an 80-year-old thriller should actually be. Fashion operandi behind the Stanford secrets is illustrated in more detail, and I think horror fans and lovers of the original movie will appreciate it. At least I did. The overall plot still makes much sense, and the manuscript has come across irrational aspects, but it is nevertheless an exciting formal and undoubtedly one that evokes an atmosphere of excitement and fear. The acting performances are far above average. Particularly the arrogant and unpleasant members of the Men's Association depict plausible characters and even teenagers Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff give away impressive performances. Highly recommended without hesitation!
