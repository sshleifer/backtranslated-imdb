I ended up feeling this movie, but it wasn't the easiest to get through. What makes the movie great is music and landscape. The songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented. A good job was done to show different settings for the people of Rome. <br /> <br /> But the viewer was not guided enough. A more in-depth history of Rome people would have been nice. Only a fraction of the spoken words were given English subtitles. In addition, several explanations about the settings and who were their and some of their challenges would have been appreciated too. It would have helped if there was a narrator also explaining about customs, dress and music.
