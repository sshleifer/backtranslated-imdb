Most criticisms of the "Attack of Show" are from people who unfairly compare it to an old computer television program called "The Screen Savers." People are disturbed because G4 decided to cancel "Screen Savers" and replace it with pop culture-based "Attack of the Show". To compare the two shows is like comparing apples to oranges! <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Show" is a unique hour-long program covering current Generation X / Y culture. It has segments on film / TV, panel discussions, video games, new DVD releases, sex advice, new gadgets (MP3 players, mobile phones, etc.), comics / graphic novels, magazines and internet fads. <br /> <br /> It's a fun show, definitely worth checking out, you're in your 20s or 30s. I give it an 8 out of 10.
