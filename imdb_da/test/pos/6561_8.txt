Uzumaki is a visually stunning movie and I don't think anyone can argue for it. But unfortunately the story is somewhat flat. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie is very entertaining. It uses the wild style to tell a somewhat non-existent story. The film almost works, just based on its character and style, but in my opinion leaves something to be desired.
