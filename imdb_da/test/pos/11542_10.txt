This documentary about Bill Hicks life and comedy contains bits from Hicks' "Revelations" and other stand-up footage. It also contains interviews with fellow human beings and people in the industry who knew him, as well as journalists and journalists talking about how his political comment was raw and brutal. I enjoyed it very much. I had already seen "Revelations", but the comedy clips were still refreshing. It's a great balance between comedy and documentary that will explain Hick's popularity to non-fans and please those who are already familiar with him. <br /> <br /> I've judged it ten.
