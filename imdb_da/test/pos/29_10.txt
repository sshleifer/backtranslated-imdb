<br /> <br /> What more could you ask for? An amazing manuscript based on one of the finest games of the last half of the 20th century, two fine emotional performances by Courtney and Finney, a realistic vision of wartime London, a great support casting. This movie takes you on an emotional roller coaster through humor, sadness, loss and fulfillment. if you are in the theater it is even more effective. This is a true 10 on the rating scale!
