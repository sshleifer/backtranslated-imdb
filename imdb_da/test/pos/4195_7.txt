You would really need to remember Monkees and have a clear understanding of where and how they fit into the second half of the 1960s to fully appreciate this movie. There is no plot as such. Basically, it is a crazy, mixed pastiche of various, unrelated sequences. But it is interesting and entertaining in its own peculiar way when you reach its wavelength. In short, it was a classic, cleverly conceived and well-designed example of the late 60's experimental cinema. It includes some great songs, some state-of-the-art movies and lots of other valuable film technology ideas. I give it 7 out of 10 for several reasons. First, it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox movie in the commercial mainstream, where both its stars and its producers were severely curtailed at that time. If a feature film flutes at the box office, the consequences can be bleak for all concerned. Second, it was mostly a creative success. And finally, as already mentioned, it is undoubtedly a classic of the genre, and as such it is now historically important. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Head" came late in Monkee's career. But again, they would not have been allowed to do so earlier because it was essentially a very pointed and cynical satire of their own image. <br /> <br /> It was clear that the group's members knew only that the whole of Monkee's juggernaut was almost running his race when they started working on this project. In a way it should be their swan song, and they were determined to let everything hang out. They were tired of being treated as just fines in the high powered corporate game where they had been manipulated and exploited over the previous years. In short, "they wanted" and they had to say a few things before they left. The story, however, has justified the band. Let the critics be condemned. The Monkees, left some of the best, most polished and successful pop registers of the decade. Yes, they had plenty of help. But at the end of the day they stood in front of the studio mikes, they fronted the film and TV cameras, and they did the concerts. They were funny and just a little crazy. But unlike some of their contemporaries, they were never threatening. You can probably introduce a monkey to your older aunt. <br /> <br /> "Head" probably borrows a bit too strongly from the Beatles' Hard Day's Night, but it's still a good choice for those around at that time or for younger retro files who have the ability to put appreciate its importance. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
