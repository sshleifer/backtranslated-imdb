KIRST IN AUGUST is a perfect movie. A flawless film about all of man's shortcomings. On the outside it may look like a movie about death, but is actually a movie about life. I simply cannot recommend this movie enough. And don't be scared, dear readers, it's not a depressing movie. As mentioned, it is a film about the brightness of life being trained during the dam of death. You will laugh. You will cry. You will realize that life is fragile and short. And you will leave the view with a better understanding of how precious life is. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other foreign films, go to www.nixflix.com
