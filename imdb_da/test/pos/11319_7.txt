I lived in London most of my adult life before moving Stateside, so I missed this movie when it came out and only saw it now on HBO. I disagree with anyone who thinks this should have been a Hollywood production. The British team gave it a chilling and terrific atmosphere from day one and I was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes and wondered what would happen to my home town. And of course, nine months after the movie comes out 7/7 happens. Yes, the truth is alien to fiction. Having lived in both countries, it is also clear that the likelihood of this happening in the UK is far greater than in the United States, Muslims live in ghettos and isolate themselves in the UK, and in the United States they appear much easier.
