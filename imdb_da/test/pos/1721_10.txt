First, I was a fan of the show back when my PBS station started showing it back in 1981. I learned many things about the show and the people who were contributing to the show. <br /> <br /> This last installment of Doctor Who made a good impression on me. The original series, also classic series, was made fun of the bad special effects and / or wobbly sets. Well, that is no longer true. The special effects are awesome, but what's even better is the writing. You get a chance to learn more about our beloved doctor and maybe a bit of a reason why he loves the planet earth so much. Without giving too much away, it's a very worthy series to see. Christopher Eccelston brought a side of the doctor that we will never see, a bitter and sour, yet lovable at the same time. <br /> <br /> One must see!
