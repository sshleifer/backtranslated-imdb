There is a version of "Nevsky" that appears with a live symphony orchestra, choir, soloist and film. If it's ever done within a day's journey, you'll see "Nevsky" done that way. The Oklahoma City Philharmonic did it with OKC Canterbury Choir (one of the finest anywhere) a few years ago. I think I cried through it all, it was one of the most emotionally powerful movie experiences of my life. I'm listening to "Nevsky" on the radio right now and it still tears me. There are movies I love and classical music I love, but there is no combination I can think of that comes close to the impact of "Nevsky" done in real time.
