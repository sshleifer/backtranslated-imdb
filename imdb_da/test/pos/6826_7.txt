I cannot understand the need to jump backwards and forwards to stage sets and brush out the plot. Shows that someone has a skill just before they use it, I think violates our intelligence. It starts to feel a little confused and as if they are making up for being so vague for the first three series. A little disappointing this episode. <br /> <br /> Using previous quirks, which Locke's ability to know when a storm ends, is it frankly abusive ... should we ooh and scar, or laugh the softer side of Locke? <br /> <br /> This episode was everywhere.
