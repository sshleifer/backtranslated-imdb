Anthony Quinn is a master to capture our heart and sympathy. He depicts a Romanian farmer with a below average IQ, harassed by his wife to do more. It is the Second World War, and the Nazis have taken over their country. Soon he finds digging in the hope of exploiting himself in the eyes of his wife. The Nazis have different ideas. Over the next few years, we see events unfolding through his naive eyes, but all he wants to do is go home. His manipulations and misfortune just get him into extra hot water. Finally, we see his picture on the front of "Der Spiegel" as the perfect Aryan. The war ends and the Allies put him to trial for war crimes. But all our farmer wants to do is return home to his wife.
