Although I have certainly read this Agatha Christie book at some point, I remembered nothing about it except for the name "Abernethie". That's a good thing because seeing this story unfold without knowing how it will play out, I once again understood the pure GENIUS of Agatha Christie: the way she misleads you and then pulls the blanket out Under your feet is the main reason for her success and timelessness. In addition to her stories, they are excellent production values, beautiful places, wonderful music, top-notch performances, elegant control, etc. the reasons for this series of success and timelessness - and all these virtues are present in "After the Funeral". An advice: Be aware right from the start - there are tracks that have fallen everywhere, even in the opening sequence! There are also some rather unpleasant moments as opposed to the peaceful exhibits in the English countryside and some small touches of humor. A must-see for mystery buffs, and just a very good movie in general. (***)
