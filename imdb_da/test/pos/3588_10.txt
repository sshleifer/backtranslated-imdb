This series has a lot to do with beautiful pictures of some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in the work would be hard pressed to expect less. I got the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter, which of course is only a minor grip. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative and leave enough room for one's imagination and well-played out, so viewers get plenty of time to reflect on the breathtaking imagery. If you get the opportunity, try not to see a translated version of this series. <br /> <br /> A clear must-see for anyone interested in our blue continental's intricacies and easily the best documentary on this subject I've ever seen.
