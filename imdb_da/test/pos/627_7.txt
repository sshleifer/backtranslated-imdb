I have been waiting for 9 years to watch this movie simply because I never saw it on TV. Eventually I caught it and it was well worth the wait. It's much better than your overheated scream or last summer Sunday because it's all at a pretty fast pace without being pulled out and crawling through the house for cheesy music scenes. Only the bad dubbing lets it down a little, but don't let it put you in any way. What lies beneath - over hyped and crap. Mute witness - low budget, not hyped at all and very good.
