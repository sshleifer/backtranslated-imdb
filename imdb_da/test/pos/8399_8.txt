I have both read and seen Gone With The Wind found it very difficult not to compare this movie with the original. Although I thought Scarlett, the novel, was amazing, the film didn't add. It was a completely different story. Of course, there will never be another Scarlett and Rhett in addition to Leigh and Gable, but the new actors did a fine job considering. I loved the way the book and the movie wrapped up the story of Gon With the Wind, because after reading it, I felt a wave of disappointment because it just stopped and left the readers to wonder what happened. Scarlett finishes the story very well, and Alexandra Ripley did really well on the book. I just wished the movie followed the story more, even though it is amazing in itself.
