I enjoyed two of the three films in the "Sarah, Plain & Tall" trilogy. This, the final of the three, was certainly one of the "good ones". It's an excellent family movie featuring wonderful plays by the three adult stars: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Jack Palance. <br /> <br /> The story is simple but well-told. The only underperformance was with one of the children. It was interesting to see how the children had grown since the first film. <br /> <br /> Of the three, the first "Sarah" was the best recorded with a beautiful filmography. This movie didn't, but it had the best story. It had some genuinely tearful sentimental moments and a very nice ending. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
