Oz is a great series, one of TV's underrated shows. It has a certain relation to soap opera, since something evil always happens, and it is the unfolding of every occurrence of evil that fascinates. From my discussions with people who are actually in prison, they call right. Each interaction has a lot of background processing. Behind every action there is a scheme, a plot to make another in. I like this series so much that it is one of the few TV shows I have bought completely on DVD. <br /> <br /> And, yes, I agree with the author in front of me who commented that there are elements of satire in it. The character in the wheelchair, which gives its shuddered view of life, does so with a certain ironic humor.
