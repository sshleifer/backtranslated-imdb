Many have never disparaged Say Never Again because it is not an official Bond movie. Nevertheless, it is clear that the producers adhered to the fruitful Bond formula. Although the film does not have a pre-credit sequence, it is clear that the training exercise at the start of the movie is supposed to be the initial scene. It would have been impossible for EON to stop manufacturers from including a pre-credit and title sequence, albeit without the introduction of gun barrel. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is in great shape as the immortal secret agent and this movie is definitely better than dr no, thunderball you live only twice and diamonds are forever. Although NSNA is supposed to be a remake of Thunderball, it's a big improvement. 007 spends more time on terra firma and a more varied selection of exotic locations is included in the film. <br /> <br /> There is something resounding in this movie. Barbara Carrera is impeccable as the bizarre Fatima Blush. One of the best scenes in the film is the coup de grace between Bond and Fatima in Nice, which takes place through a dynamic motorcycle hunt through the city. Klaus Maria Brandauer plays the psychotic Largo and Max Von Sydow is free of the melodrama that other actors depicting Blofeld have spoiled. <br /> <br /> NSNA tends to concentrate on Connery rather than farmer's character. In the beginning, it is stated that Bond is aging and has been out of action. This seems to refer to the 12-year hiatus in Connery's portrayal of Bond. Bond promises "never again" to work in Secret Service; a reference to Connery's portrayal of Bond. It appears that the producers were trying to damage the official Bond franchise. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this movie is definitely worth seeing. It's the last time Sean Connery played James Bond, but his performance convinced me that he might never have said "never again".
