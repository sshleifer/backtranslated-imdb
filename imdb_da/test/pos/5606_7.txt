Although not Halley's best work (my personal favorite is "Surviving Desire"), there is still a lot to like about this movie, especially for fans of Hartley's dialogues. Even to the audience new to Hartley, I would definitely recommend this movie over the sophomoric "Dogma". This movie is more intelligent, more threatening to its source material (the Bible) and more fun than any of the other pre-millennial apocalypse films. This movie is actually part of the French "2000 As Seen Ved." (2000 Par Vu) series; as such, it may even be a cheaper movie than Hartley's other works. While the need for simple scenes shot with digital camera is understandable in this context, the main problem with this movie is the unfortunate overuse of the blurry / jittery effect. I would be glad never to see this effect used in a movie again; Especially in the beginning it almost makes the movie unmatched. But this error is overlooked and you are treated to a fine movie. Particularly noteworthy is Magdalena (played by P.J. Harvey) how Jesus rescued her from being stoned to death; a short scene I found surprising to move. (Despite the fact that it was not Mary Magdalena, this happened that the woman in the Bible was named.) <br /> <br />
