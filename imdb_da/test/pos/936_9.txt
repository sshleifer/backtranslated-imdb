This is the last film by Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of the cinema. He wanted to retire after this movie, so in a way it is his artistic will. He died a couple of years after making the film, and although it is said that he intended to re-direct, Destiny decided that this was actually his last. And what movie! <br /> <br /> 'Rouge' the last movie in the three colors French trilogy is actually a very Swiss film. Seen in Geneva, one of the two main characters is a Swiss retired judge, and Durenmatt immediately comes to mind. But there is more Switzerland in the cool atmosphere, in the absence of communication of the characters, in the courtesy that surrounds the cruelty of life. Several characters starting with a small relationship come together at the end in a moving and human finale that only a great artist could have played. <br /> <br /> Little else can be said that was not said and written a hundred times. Yes, the movie starts slowly and the fans of the American action movie or melodrama will first become discouraged and will be lost as viewers. They deserve it. The film becomes quality as it evolves, and one of the not so hidden messages is that the reality and the real people are more interesting than the Hollywood comic book and plastic acts and characters. Cinema quality is very original, the picture is a 'Study in Red', as the title shows. Action is fabulous, with Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant - the later in what will remain likely the best role in his old age. <br /> <br /> A great movie. Seeing it again probably adds and I'm happy to get it recorded on tape. 9/10 on my personal scale.
