Babette's feast for me is about healing: Mending the schism between spirit and body in Orthodox Christianity. This puritanical community in remote Denmark lacks an adequate understanding of all God's gifts in creation. They have taken St. Paul's dualism to an extreme, stressing "the life of the spirit", not "the life of the flesh". Both older sisters, in their youth, feared the lure of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village. They and their parishioners cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader and sister's father. The aging congregation has become testy and ruthless, and the sisters do not know what to do. Enter Babette, a French stranger and one to whom they can show kindness. They have no way of knowing that she will eventually return their kindness and provide fertile land for their dry, dusty theology. Babette will give everything she has, and along the way will teach the sisters and their flock of grace, sacrifice, how sensual experience (as in the Eucharist's bread and wine) can change lives and why true art moves so deeply. When they can forgive each other and themselves, they can focus on God's love that unfolds to them in a concrete way in the present. As a minister and an artist I cannot recommend a movie more strongly. True art and true grace !!
