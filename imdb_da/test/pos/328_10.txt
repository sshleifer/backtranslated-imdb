Kannathil Muthamittal is definitely a fantastic movie. I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for a real leading job and A.R. Rahman for good songs. The camera work is just excellent and looks like Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I want to be shocked if this movie doesn't win an Oscar for best foreign films or even best camera work.
