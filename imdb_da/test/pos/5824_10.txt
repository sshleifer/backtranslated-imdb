HBO created this show in order to make us see the most realistic perception of prison possible and they did a hell job. Oz was created by the creators of murder who wanted to show a raw version of the prison. This show is what launched the idea of ​​any other HBO Original Program like the Soprano, Sex and City, The Wire, Arliss, Deadwood and Six Feet Under among others. Oz is the nickname for the Oswald State Penetentiary, a fictitious prison in some US states that are never listed (although accents, crime scenes and racial distribution NY are assumed). The main prison unit on the show is Emerald City, an apparently ideal prison unit with more privilege than others believed by a liberal unit manager named Tim McManus. All in all, this show shows us how it really is if you want to survive in prison. There are about 10 bands displayed on Oz. First, we have the Muslims, a group of blacks who want to destroy the injustices in the criminal justice system and help improve the living conditions of blacks everywhere. They are led by Kareem Said a black militant minister who wants to destroy everything racist about the justice system. As a group, they are not so much anti-white, but rather anti-injustice. Our second group of blacks is the Homeboys, which are essentially street gates who want to keep all the bad ghetto behavior up and running drug trafficking. Their leadership varies mainly because they always lose members because of violence. In this group, Simon Adebisi is a character who is terribly listed. Adebisi is an African effort that is essentially the most frightening evil character alive. This gang as a whole gets side help from the Irish at times and is always in conflict with the Latins and Sicilians for drug dissemination purposes. Being Oz is mostly black, Homeboys have most soldiers in every gang inside. <br /> <br /> The Latin and Sicilians, like Homeboys, have varying leadership due to violent deaths that occur during the show. The Sicilians have basically the most significant expression of how illegal activity is carried out in Oz. The Latinians make their presence known so they can at least throw well if they are not in control. However, unlike Homeboys, these gangs do not have much internal struggle for power and are usually more stable when it comes to drug use. The Irish mentioned above are a minor gang led by a manipulative and sneaky Ryan O'Reily. O'Reily always manages to remain in good grace with all the physicians and manages to manipulate things in his own way whenever he wants. They have no illegal control, but they are at least in good standing with all those who are. Among the whiter inmates we have the cyclists and the Aryans. The bikers are just a bunch of tattooed drug users who help the arias most of the time. The Aryans are the most hated and hateful gang to most viewers of Oz. They are led by Vern Schillinger, who is one of the most racist, sick and sadistic characters you will ever see. Both gangs do not control anything illegally, they just let the darker shining inmates see that they pose a significant threat to anyone who believes that all white prisoners are soft. We also have the others. The others are a gang outside prisoners who are not necessarily a problem for any other prisoner. In this group, we see Tobias Beecher, a lawyer who accidentally killed a young girl whose life has always been changed by prison. We also see Augustus Hill, a black man tied to a wheelchair to kill a police officer telling the show and introducing the audience to all inmates. The character's crimes appear as they are introduced, and Augustus lets us know how long they will be in prison. Finally among the gangs are the Christians and gays. The Christians just remain religious to stay away from being mental, and homosexuals are a bunch of cross-traders who are often raped by other inmates. <br /> <br /> This show goes deep into a lot of issues dealing with the criminal justice system and is more explicit than any movie on prison. Since languages ​​are unedited, we here more racial epithets and cuss words than we would on any other TV show. Augustus Hills comment provides a great way for us to truly understand every single problem involved in Oz. This show as good as it is not at all for light to middle heart. It explicitly shows drug abuse and distribution in every way possible, imprisoned violence, murder, deadly stabbings and generally doing anything else seen by others. In my opinion, it is the most influential and greatest show ever created, but at the same time I can see why other people will be disturbed by this show. If you're even interested in shows and movies about prison, Oz is a must see.
