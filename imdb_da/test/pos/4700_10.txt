"Sister Helen" is an excellent documentary about a rigid, intolerant, grim-mouthed, bitter, obscure (civil) non that runs a house of queens and dopers in a very worn neighborhood in the southern Bronx. All but one of the 21 residents are boys / kills. Robert, the only middle class representative ?? he had a real job, house and even a BMW ?? sorry she died before he could tell her. Why? <br /> <br /> Robert, as six residents, was on parole. He complained that Helen had a big stick over him and constantly threatened to knock him in if he didn't bullet her. In an interview with "extras", did he say that Helen ran the center to compensate for the death of the three men in her life? her husband and her two boys. The man was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack of 55 years. A boy died of a heroin overdose, and the other was stabbed to death at. 15. Helen was back with a daughter whom she surrendered to the run center. The daughter was not happy. She wanted her mother <br /> <br /> What is fascinating is how little Helen changed. Externally, it seems that she made a big change in the sea. But after watching this exact and disruptive video a few times - once with the directors telling it - it became clear that Helen replaced 21 male abusers around the boss to replace her three dead men. <br /> <br /> Helen admits she ignored her children and spent every day in bars. But her bossiness, intolerance and sharp tongue did not occur at the age of 56. Living with her must have been extremely difficult. Even Robert says he was clean despite Helen. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with Helen, who abusively breaks down a man who wants to live on the shelter. Probably she shows her street scientist. Once again, she publicly condemns Mel, her "assistant" for not bathing for a year. Then she bends her dirty pillowcase in the air. The film is viscous with Helen's threatening and degrading people. Her signature song is "My Way". Her favorite phrase is, "I want to be honest with you." Often, people who use such sentences turn out to be the opposite. <br /> <br /> The residents are really down and out. Only Robert has some negotiable skills in addition to pushing a diet. They all desperately need a roof over their heads, and Helen, as she runs the place alone, has the power to admit or postpone it, she pleases. She has no board to answer and receives no public funding. It's her show. <br /> <br /> Helen believes in the cookie approach to mercy. She stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else can. She accuses drug abuse on drugs or splashes, and not the underlying issues that drove the men to drink and drugs. She's not a therapist, just a landlady who's dying her hair, has a habit and uses full strength over her tenants and stopped drinking. <br /> <br /> Also, Helen oversees her inmates by requiring urine (the urine she calls it) test on requests. Twice Major, a very solid and respected long-term elderly resident - whom she believed - failed her tests. Helen was furious and exposed him. Major stood up and said the results were wrong because he never did heroin. Helen did not give up and failed to consider a mistake could have been made. This was particularly worrying when she knew Major for a long time. But she discounted his relationship with him, assuming he was a liar and totally trusted the results. Major eventually discovered the codin in his cough syrup appeared as an opiate. Helen never apologize publicly, but apparently it was made up for big private. <br /> <br /> Helen also had a very damaged reputation in her old neighborhood. She implicitly admitted Robert, she once stayed up very late one night to cut a person's deck. The person wronged her and certainly deserved to get their tires slashed. She was not a lovely woman. So at last she decided the only way to keep the Travis name (her last name) alive ?? since the three male Travises died ?? was to start the Travis Center. <br /> <br /> For some residents it was a great deal. They adhered to Helen and in exchange received a cheap, safe, sober and structured place to live. One said, however, that he preferred prison. Obesity and drunkenness do not all need to be treated as children. Helen hired "old school" techniques that have been discredited. But no one was forced to remain in the center, and for some it was definitely a positive experience. Travis Center is not a treatment center. It is a home for alcoholics and dopers, what should they do out of their lives. <br /> <br /> To receive the full sister Helen experience, see all the extra interviews plus the audio version, where the two directors share their experiences with Sister Helen and her guests.
