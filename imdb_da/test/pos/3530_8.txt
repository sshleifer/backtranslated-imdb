September 29, 1990 marked a small but important milestone in my appreciation of horror flicks. This was the date BBC1 posted (for the only time I'm aware of) Jeff Lieberman's super-awesome 1981 shocker Just Before Dawn, and that made a big impression on me. Almost twenty years later, I am very happy to report that I have finally got my hands on the specialty Shrike Show / Media Blasters, and it is as scary and disturbing as I remember it, if not more. <plot as usual for genre flicks (and this was Lieberman's first movie as a "director of rental", although at least he removed all the religious cult snake band mumbo jumbo from the manuscript), is a little thin - five sympathetic twenty somethings ( Including Chris Lemmon, Jack's son, in a couple of uncomfortably tight white steps) venture into the dense Oregon forests to make a spot of camping and to check a spot it has been rated as one of their number. But just before Dawn stands out from a crowd of imitators, because Lieberman does not waste time showing us how horrible things are on this particular patch on the mountain, with a completely innocent skewered and a drunk preaching truck pushing down a hill and engulfed in flames within minutes of the movie beginning. The youngsters roll into the picture in a creepy Winnebago, Blondie's "Heart of Glass" throwing on the soundtrack, and before you can say "Texas Chainsaw Massacre!" They have clobbered an innocent deer with the front bumper and had their first taste of aggro from the heavy maniac responsible for opening disasters. Forest ranger Roy (George Kennedy) warns them that it will probably go wrong if they move on, but they go anyway in the trip and refuse to give the buried preacher a ride even though he is understandably afraid of fuzzy and final pitching camp miles from anywhere. Although this movie is not short on bloody horror and well-acted action scenes, the standing moments for me are those where Lieberman lets his camera zoom out, long and slowly, from seemingly harmless shots of the fun-loving children who sit around in the desert. Or just let it settle for a while in the dense and impressive woodlands. He makes Oregon exterior as threatening and just as vicious as Kubrick made Overlook Hotel's spacious interior in Shining, and Brad Fiedel's score (discounting the horrible distorted racket running over the titles) remains the right side of the intrusive underscores the slowly escalating threat of subtlety and flair. There are lots of surprises along the way, nodding to Dismissal with the discovery of a back child and her freaky disruptive family, and a truly bizarre kill technique that was exploited shortly before the end of the movie. I don't want to spoil it for you. I've said enough. Why, this underrated horror gem fell through the cracks and became a cult object rather than a breakout hit is difficult to determine, but hopefully it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years to come - it deserves to be.
