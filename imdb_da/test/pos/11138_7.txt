I was surprised to catch this on Friday and I enjoyed it. Between the presence of Bobbie Phillips and the many references to everything that could be considered "cyberpunk", it was a fun movie to watch. I enjoyed the story, which reminded me of a book I read ("Earth", David Brin), and was fun watching TV. Bobbie looks good, but I also enjoyed her performance as a Kam because she seemed different to everyone else. But the biggest thing about this movie was the atmosphere described in books by Gibson, Sterling and others. It was just fun to watch it on TV.
