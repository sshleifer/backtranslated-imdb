Simply the best and most realistic movie about World War II I've ever seen. Not only because the German soldiers speak German and Russian soldiers speak Russian (no English in a German or Russian dialect) also because of the realistic arrangement where the film was shot. The action is excellent. No Hollywood mood at all, no love story ... Stalingrad should be one of the most horrible battles during the war, and in that context there is no room for emotions or romantic scenes. What you get is a movie that will make you excited about the bone and have one of the best unhappy endings a movie could have.
