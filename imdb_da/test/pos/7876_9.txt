My 2nd favorite movie from 1970 (after five simple pieces) was completely dismissed by many idiots who phoned into an audience-worn piece of waste. Peter Boyle, a well-known liberal, is unbelievable as the hardcore that works stiff, having few problems with the younger generation. He is a scary guy but has a fantastic imagination and is very funny. I was a teenage liberal when this was released, but just as horrific as Joe seemed to me, he also tore me up! Susan Sarandon, in her first role, is perfect and a mixed rock-rich fox. The dinner scene in Queens is hilarious and insightful for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This was NOT an exercise movie and the script (which was Oscar nominated) should have won that year. The director just didn't waste enough money to give it enough credibility in Hollywood. Whatever your political pursuit, so and now, you will like someone in this movie. One particular 9 out of 10. It is on DVD and video. Check it out!
