Susan Sarandon. She made this movie for me. I have never appreciated her acting more than I did in this movie. She really seemed like she was Adele August. I appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character that is truly credible. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman as Ann August helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie. The film was about them, so the other characters were peripheral. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie an eight rating, but Susan got a ten from me because of her performance. As far as the footage went, Beaches and Endearment Terms had a greater influence on me than this movie, but I strongly recommend it.
