Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is the old familiar feeling of the 70s blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb threw the title role doing a good job, but I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a great job of presenting Karen and Richard's professional career, but also the personal struggles Karen treated and her illness. The recordings in Herp Albert's study are very well done. But Karen Carpenter turned out there was a time when she was very special and brought great joy to her fans and music lovers. Even if you were not a carpenter's fan, it is a good story that shows how a great talent can be the victim of community pressure.
