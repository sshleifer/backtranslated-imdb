In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other, both of foreigners. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing. Of the two, ET was the one that won human hearts worldwide, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feel good alien fable, they got away from The Thing in droves. It's not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposite. One is an optimistic tale designed to warm cockles in the ever-striking heart. The other is a hard, uncompromising movie that paints alien life as something destined to destroy us. I think the audience felt ET was a much better view than Thing's tentacles and slime-made saliva! <br /> <br /> It has taken some time, but The Thing is about to win a great cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is the rare example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic and revives them in sensational and imaginative ways. In fact, Carpenter does his job so well that he actually manages to make a movie that is in every inch of the genre's showrunner, Alien. And it's even rarer! Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than Thing From Another World did. It keeps Antiget's free waste as a setting because it is the perfect backdrop when trying to establish an increased sense of isolation. But even though it is a bit thin on characterization, the recovery gets right within the actors' thinking, and reinforces the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them. <br /> <br /> The frequent Carpenter partner Kurt Russell returns, raises the success of Escape from New York, is thrown again as one of Carpenter's eternal heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they are investigating is someone's guess). The problem begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to shoot down a Siberian Husky from the air. <br /> <br /> They end up dying for their troubles and while the camp is trying to solve the mystery of what happened they take in Husky and add it to their own. Except that this Husky is not at all a Husky. But a form-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it, it struck their crew member. It is possible to absorb its victims in will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion go through the 12-man crew until no one is sure who is human and who is not. <br /> <br /> The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest movies. In fact, I'm tempted to say it's the best movie he's ever made. Even better than classics like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of the Carpenter's list is that it feels like his last movie that could really be called a classic. All the others then felt that Carpenter was slumming it. Movies that do not flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity are so prevalent in his earlier works. <br /> <br /> But Thing had John Carpenter at the top of his strength. Never has he generated excitement in such an unbearable degree. Not even in the vicious attack on area 13. From the other, the alienated alienates his presence, Carpenter's excitement level resounds relentlessly. And when he delivers his strokes, they come with a disturbing shock. <br /> <br /> The movie is a blend of pure atmospheric and visceral horror. An approach that can often be illegal with each other, but in Carpenter's hands is reported together beautifully. He brings in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame to carry some of the most astonishing transformation effects you will ever see in a horror movie. Amorphous forms. Semi-shaped human traits are strongly contrasted with yawning jaws, spiders and fully flexible tentacles. In fact, the effects of the movie are so amazing and crooked-inducing, The Thing came under fire to be too realistic! <br /> <br /> This kind of thinking misses the point completely. It only reduces the film's values. And there are many. The carpenter draws only one mode of operation when he is to. Its in the quieter moments of the film, where he seems to be especially tuned to the story. The thing is an often confusing tale of shadows, whispers and implications. Characterization has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it does work to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the current situation much more confusing. We are never safe, from one moment to the next, who is who. And because of this, The Thing keeps up very well and maintains its mystery at subsequent views. <br /> <br /> A special mention should go to the excellent movie score of Ennio Morricone. A pulsating toad every two seconds. It creates a creepy, creepy feeling that is very difficult to shake. The whole movie is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they blood test each other to see who is human is done with such dexterity by Carpenter, you can find yourself biting your nails without realizing yourself. <br /> <br /> The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the end leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated movie, worth reconsidering it received. And so much better than ET!
