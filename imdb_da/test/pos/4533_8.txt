I think all critics who panned "Tommy Boy" when released in 1995 should go back and see it and learn that it's not a bad movie at all. Each critic strung Chris Farley and David Spade's film. Yes "Coneheads" was fun, but kind of had a joke perspective and "Black Sheep" I agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever made. But "Tommy Boy" does not fall into the category "Coneheads", which could have been a little more fun and "Black Sheep", which is a piece of tripe. It is very fun and entertaining. I agree with the critics that Chris Farley was not John Belushi or John Candy as he claimed to have fooled these guys, and these guys had a genius for comedy, but Chris Farley was very funny and I wish he was around longer time to prove critics yes he was not John Belushi or John Candy, but he was very funny. The scenes between Farley and Spade as nemesis are side-splitting fun and the premise is also laughing hilariously. It is very sad that Chris Farley is no longer here to make us laugh, but we have movies like "Tommy Boy" to remember how much fun he was. "Tommy Boy" is one of the best comedies of the 1990s.
