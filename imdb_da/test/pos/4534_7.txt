I don't think I have too much to add. I found the comedy still fun after more than ten years since it came out. The only thing I noticed was that the music during the dialogue became distracting and often made the movie very hooky than it should have been. The use of songs is fine under the film, but the orchestra background is too busy, too constructed, and if the movie ever had to be edited to DVD, I would seriously recommend that the background music be tinted down to an almost inaudible level. It has cheapened the overall feel for the whole movie, and I can see unconsciously why many people have passed it. <br /> <br /> The movie had a lot of levels working for it on the script, plot and comedy level. It's too bad that the producer and director felt they needed the musical schlock to improve the mood. Now I know this, I find it difficult to see, and I am surprisingly quieting the one who was involved in the musical editing in the movie. It had all the subtleties of a jackhammer.
