Okay. You saw the movie and I saw the movie. Right? If not, there are plenty of plot views out there and there is absolutely no reason for us to waste time on my weak attempts to create another. <br /> <br /> The most amazing aspect of the movie is undoubtedly the performances of the two young men and the young lady in the leaders. Their emotional honesty was so compelling, if not more, than any notions I have seen in recent months. I found that I laughed and cried with them, and that says a lot because I often called a jaded and cynical jerk. As one might expect, the story is abundant with clich√©s. and I suppose it is the Achilles heel in the picture. It's a story we've all seen many times before; We all know how it will end from the moment they introduce Rory. Although you may not know exact mechanics, you know that there will be a transformative friendship, a bittersweet romance, and a gutsy conclusion. If it wasn't for the strong cast and directing, this movie would be no more than the soporific swill that includes 80% of the Hallmark Channel's schedule.
