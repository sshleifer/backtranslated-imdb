"Murder over New York" is fun, but not as good as most of the other Fox chances. This movie would have been better named, "Charlie Chan in New York", the movie's working title. This is Toler's chance to play Chan in the Big Apple. There is much to do here, but also the star star Shemp Howard of the three stooges. <br /> <br /> This has one of my favorite Chan sayings, "Coincidence like old egg - leave unpleasant smell." Tolerance and Yung are good in this one, and it is also the supporting spirit. But there is little or no mysterious atmosphere that I look for in these movies. Still it is good to see.
