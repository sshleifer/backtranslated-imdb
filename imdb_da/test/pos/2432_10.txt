This film is a very entertaining tribute to Bogart and other detective films from old. Robert Sacchi nails it as Bogie and Michelle Phillips are a truly timeless beauty like Gena Anastas. <br /> <br /> But the most notable part of this movie is the longest belly dance scene ever produced in a Hollywood movie. A well-known professional instructor commented that nothing else in the cinema comes close to dance tension. <br /> <br /> The scene, which ends up being an important part of the plot, takes place in a lushly beautiful Middle Eastern nightclub and is fascinating in every respect. The vibrant music, the swirling veil and the ring finger bars, free floating angles and beautiful costumes - and a surprising twist with the seductive Sybil Danning - create excitement and excitement to the very end. <br /> <br /> The three talented and beautiful professional nightclub dancers are led by exotic brunette beauty Kamala Almanzar, one of the leading belly dancers in the United States since the mid-1970s. She was handpicked by the famous Armenian musician Guy Chookoorian to travel with her orchestra on the road. Guy's ensemble is the live band that the dancers perform in the scene. If you see the trailer on this site, you'll see a glimpse of Kamala (playing the fingerbeams behind Sybil Danning). <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a fan of belly dancing, you will be looking to watch this movie and if you are an aficionado, it stays very well when you have repetitive viewing.
