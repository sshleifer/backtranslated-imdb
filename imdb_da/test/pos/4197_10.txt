"Head" is one of the movies you have difficulty convincing your friends to see, but when they do, they will fall in love with it. I do not know how many times this has happened to me. This movie is just as fun and bizarre, really a deconstruction of everything the monks had been at this time in their careers. Much credit goes to Bob Rafelson, who almost ended up with Monkee's career with this movie. My guess is that he wanted to get out of control of the TV show and get into features, which he did in a big way after that. Micky Dolenz is absolutely fun. I can't believe he didn't have another life as a comic actor after this movie. This movie has a lot of good cameos and a lot of wonderful psychedelic jokes. I feel that the reputation of this movie continues to build, and it would not surprise me if it eventually becomes a full on cult classic
