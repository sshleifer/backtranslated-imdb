Very good 1939 movie where John Garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he's committed a murder. The problem is that the killer and Garfield's girl, Ann Sheridan, are killed in a short but good performance while trying to escape the police. A curly lawyer persuades Garfield to flee NY He lands in Arizona and meets up with Dead End Kids. They have been sent there with a funding program to keep them out of further trouble. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garfield finds a new love but has to hide his identity as everyone thinks he's not just the killer, but was the victim of the car accident. <br /> <br /> May Robson is fabulous as the grandmother type runs the place of friendly youth. Claude Rains is also effective in the role of detective who suspects that Garfield is still alive and persecuting him when a picture is broken by him in Arizona. <br /> <br /> The movie really deals with Garfield's relationship with the boys. While the end is good you will see Garfield go back to N.Y. to proclaim his innocence.
