Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget the fact that it's one of the few movies with Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story was impossible to believe and much of the dialogue works, the only important thing to remember when considering watching the movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing images ever put on film. It's as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama. A must see for anyone who is seriously interested in filmography and the use of the film cell as a canvas to show true works of art. I would have to give this movie a 9/10 because it's great visual display.
