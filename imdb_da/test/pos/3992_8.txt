It is true. Ohwon (the painter and protagonist) is a unique person. What strikes me most is the message this movie can address to you people there. And the message is sad. It says it is very difficult to do everything that is great or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs in this world. And even if you try, you may not be able to carry it. It's about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie by this wonderful Korean instructor. Please see it if you have an option.
