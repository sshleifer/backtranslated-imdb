Now I'm a little biased, since I'm a big fan of sennat tv. I've been a loyal fan of Jay Leno for about 6 or 7 years, and think he's one of the funniest and most talented comedians out there. And David Letterman is also a hell of a comedian, although I only see his show (unless Jay is a repeat) during advertising or when he has a better guest than Jay on the show. Daniel Roebuck and John Michael Higgins are both fine actors, and they look very much like Jay and Dave, but did they disappear into the characters? Nix. Roebuck hardly ignores Jay's voice and expression that mumbles on a loud note that resembles a castrati Marlon Brando. Higgins nails down David's facial expression (for example, his trademark is skewed), but he doesn't play down David's voice. Those who are not big fans of sennat tv can be much less biased. There are a few comedians who can do dead on the imitations of Jay. Why couldn't they have chosen one of them? And the same goes for Dave. I'd rather have Norm McDonald play that part. Norm doesn't look like hell much like Dave, but he made a big imitation of him on SNL. "Hey ... do you have any gum?" It was so funny! <br /> <br /> But I learned a lot about the late night wars that I had very little knowledge at first. I have never seen the "Tonight Show" before Jay Leno was hosted, so I didn't know about the fight to finally replace Johnny Carson and the countless talks that finally convinced Dave to move to CBS. I knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and found the film very enlightening. And Kathy Bates gives a knockout performance as the pampered former executive of "The Tonight Show." She basically steals the movie. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10) <br /> <br />
