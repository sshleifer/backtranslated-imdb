I just found a whole 3 DVD sets at Wal-Mart in Copenhagen for $ 5.50 so I thought I would take a new look. A total of 13 hours to see it all (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and saw most of them on television in the sixties. Many independent stations repeated them for many years. Better than I had actually expected, the time has been friendly with its author's obvious sincerity and the apparent gratitude and respect they give to all the Allied fighters and women. More abstract and artificial than a straight forward documentary, but very truthful in the depiction of the causes and final results of World War II. This war was heavily dependent on maritime transport, and the final victory depended on who achieved the final command of the world's oceans. The Allies were the ones who were able to do so. <br /> <br /> Interesting to see how they are trying to strike a balance between big events and the individual soldiers and sailors who made them happen. The result is impressive if it is a little too much of today's standards. I read somewhere that Robert Russell Bennett contributed as much as Richard Rodgers to the end result. I imagine Rodgers giving all the big themes and it was up to Bennett to take care of the pictures. Great job! <br /> <br /> To be seen by every ruler or potential ruler. A warning to the tyrants that wars are eventually won by ideals, determination and supplies to back them up. Logistics: their quality and delivery determine the final victories. The Allies overproduced and surpassed the material quality of the ax, attacking their very source in the process, and assuring their possible defeat. <br /> <br /> Sorry to see the producer, Henry Salomon, lived a very short life. IMDb's facts were pretty skimpy, I have to find out more about him. He made a few excellent documentaries before his early death. May have more to say at a later date <br /> <br /> Trivia: I had all 3 LPs made from the background music, pretty well assembled. Unfortunately, the producers decided to add sound effects to the last one who immediately stretched to news status, rather than to serious music listening. Too bad too, because it contained some interesting but smaller themes in the series. Stupid things like 16 inch weapons shoots, torpedoes are fired, bulldozers, planes ... just for kids primarily. <br /> <br /> RSGRE
