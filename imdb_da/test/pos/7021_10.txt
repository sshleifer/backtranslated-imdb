Dirty Dancing one of my most popular movies. I've only seen it twice on ABC because I haven't had the chance to buy it or rent it from Blockbuster. I didn't know Jennifer Gray was 27 when she made the movie because she was very convincing as a teenager. Compared to some women in Hollywood, she has a very flat coffin, so I was so fooled about her age. So both physically and emotionally Gray pulls out to play a teenager very well. I also loved the dance - who wouldn't? Both times I've seen Dirty Dancing, I stop looking up at dance courses. I also love the soundtrack, and I recognize some of the songs from when I was eight or nine. I would LOVE to see this in my drama class, and at some point I will ask my teacher if there is any part of the film he can use for educational purposes. It's much better than the things he made us see last year. And the end was amazing. It's one of the best moments in the movie. <br /> <br /> I can't believe I'm looking forward to the first day back to school because of Dirty Dancing! Who could ask for a better influence from a movie with that kind of title?
