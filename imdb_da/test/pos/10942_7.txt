Fun mix of vampires and martial arts is a bit of a mess plot-wise and the action of those who doubled their voices is almost universally bad, but the premise is engaging, the battle scenes are fast and flashy, and the movie is often quite entertaining. It's a shame, history is such a wreck. There are a few places where I didn't know what happened right, it was almost like five minutes had just been cut out, and you were suddenly on the next scene without knowing how you got there. The movie is bad at explaining things, and some things don't make much sense, but the film moves along breezily so its shortcomings are barely detecting. Not a good movie in any way, but definitely a fun.
