I watched this movie for the first time last night. I've been thinking about it all night and this morning. I can't say it was my favorite movie, at least not yet. I'll see it again. <br /> <br /> The camera is amazing. Every shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a movie that has Wim Wender's name attached to it. <br /> <br /> It is always tempting to see the Chirico disappear in any gloom of any order of order, but in this case the analogy is appropriate. In many ways, the figure of Malkovich draws through the fog and wind of the Ferarra shadow of the non-canvas statue that leans Milan's Italo-Greek painter's great works. He is a little threatening, a presence that looks and in his capacity as film director exerts influence on the whole story. <br /> <br /> The dedicated Wenders fan can't help but think of Damiel and Cassiel wandering through the streets of Berlin and seeing everything but not directly interacting with the residents. And after the Sky Uber Berlin metaphor, the angel (or in this case the Malkovich director) interacts with one of the stories. <br /> <br /> At this point I have to bend to take this line of criticism too far. I'll see the movie again. I'm pretty sure this is the thread that will bring Malkovit's monologue together. <br /> <br /> Maybe his musings and pontifications are pretentious, empty dialogue that sounds good, but may not be analyzed in real communication. Maybe it's the whole meaning of it. No one can do the judgment with any degree of security or authority until he has done his homework. <br /> <br /> We should be careful when throwing the word "pretentious". It is easy to write off something that tastes the intellect as a pretension, but it leads to a frightening mental state where the only conversation seen as genuine, earthly or authentic is the most banal. When we remove all discussions about philosophy, God, existence, meaning, and all that brain candy, we set up our culture to die a slow, stupid and ugly death. Maybe it's the warning that Wenders and Antonioni give us. It's certainly not the only theme in the movie, but I think it can't be ignored. <br /> <br /> The second (and most obvious) leitmotif is for satisfaction. There is a lot here and a thorough review of all the features and consequences of the development of this search engine would well exceed the 1000 word limit for this review. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch the movie. But I give a warning: it's not an independent movie (at least I don't think so). Some movies interact with their intellectual and artistic thinking so much that the viewer must have a background in the Zeitgeist before approaching the film. Par-dela les nuages ​​is one of those films.
