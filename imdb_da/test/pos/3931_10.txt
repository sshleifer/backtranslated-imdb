I don't think I'm alone when I say that 2005 hasn't been particularly friendly to the horror genre. While "Cursed", "Hide and Seek", "The Ring Two" and "The Amityville Horror" all showed glimpses of interest and potential, there have been more misses than hits. For evidence, see: "White Noise", "Boogeyman", "The Jacket", "Mindhunters" and "Alone in the Dark". Imagine my surprise when "House of Wax", tightly written by siblings Chad and Carey Hayes, turned out to be ... well, a surprise. <br /> <br /> Carly Jones (Elisa Cuthbert) is a young woman traveling with her cumbersome brother, Nick (Chad Michael Murray) and boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki). They are with Paige (Paris Hilton), Blake (Robert Ri'chard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams) hoping to score tickets for the season's last football game. Along the way, they run into some car problems, and they are forced to enter a deserted city where nothing is what it seems to be. <br /> <br /> Having heard this is a remake of the classic Vincent Price B movie, I rolled my eyes. I would not even think about which disaster freshman director Jaume Serra had cooked up to his audience. At a time when most high-profile horror films are disappointments, latent with poor writing, static and amateur effects, I consider myself lucky that the Serra and the Hayes brothers took it upon themselves to make a good old-fashioned ghost party. Unlike the disappointments I mentioned earlier, this flick does not pull and uses every movie trick in the book to give everyone exactly what they came to. I am glad that the Hayes actually took care of and efforts to create equal and credible signs, making the events much more urgent. It also gives the young actors portray them some grip on. As she did in "The Girl Next Door", Elisha Cuthbert shows the audience what a talented actress she really is. In the 2003 remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", Jessica Biel silenced naysayers by delivering a raw and emotional performance, one who put the viewer right there with her. Here Cuthbert does the same. Chad Michael Murray ("A Cinderella Story"), in one of his first more mature roles, is not blunt like Nick. Murray exudes charisma and a hard edge, as well as some impressive athleticism on top of it. Murray and Cuthbert gels perfectly and have tangible, family-like chemistry. More than anything else, the press and the US publicly made a bad day about Paris Hilton's main debut. As I expected, Hilton didn't scare itself. In fact, she is as good as anyone else in the movie (do what you want). Like Cuthbert and Murray, the Hilton has screen presence. She is sexy and legend. I can't think of a reason she's got the worst of the movie's harsh reception, except they just choose her. Jared Padalecki (TV's 'Gilmore Girls') manages to overcome his underwriting role. Robert Ri'chard (TV's 'Cousin Skeeter') and Jon Abrahams ("Meet the Parents") do not have much to work with, but get the job done. With only one scene, Damon Herriman ("Soar") makes an unforgettable impression and his presence hangs over the rest of the movie. Finally, Brian Van Holt ("Basic") is fantastic and threatening in a dual role. <br /> <br /> Once again, kudos go to the actors to avoid clich√©s whenever possible. Despite the popular belief, the "House of Wax" is quite unpredictable for a majority of its time. Take this for example: It looks like the killer is down for the count, and Carly bends down to get something from her pockets. What do you expect to happen? Watch the movie and you will understand what I mean. It is also refreshing to see a horror movie, where the characters even show a good sense of modicum. <br /> <br /> Unlike most horror scores, John Ottman's exciting work never distracts. But as with Dark Castle's other releases, the visual aspects of "Wax" are commendable and lift the film over its genres. Filmographers Stephen F. Windon's talents, production designer Graham Walker, art director Nicholas McCallum and editor Joel Negron highlight the ghoulish imagery. Considering imagery, I think gorehounds will be thrilled with the many makeup effects and tricks in the store here. Each death scene is more gastric acid than the last one. Given his past in music videos and advertising, it is obvious that Jaume Serra has a good eye for style. His "in-your-face" approach is a great asset to the success of this movie. When you think the camera turns away, it does not. He is also particularly good at building a thick layer of fear and atmosphere. A standby shot is our introduction to the killer as he slowly comes out of a trap door. In a case like this I will usually admit when I am in the minority (Shut up, okay? I liked "House of 1000 Corpses"!). In this case, I am certain that the details have got it wrong. I'm not sure why people are so hard on this movie, as it's much better than the latest genre entries. Maybe they're afraid to admit that a horror flick with Paris Hilton might be worth seeing ... Who knows? This is a horror movie, and a strikingly stylish and effective one. As a lifelong horror fan, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed the "House of Wax" in all its lurid and sadistic glory. I certainly regard it as a great success in modern horror, and (together with Sin City) the first completely satisfactory release of 2005.
