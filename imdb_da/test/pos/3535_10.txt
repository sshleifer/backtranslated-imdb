I saw the Messiah: - The first killed and I thought it was definitely one of the best programs I've ever seen. It was one of the programs you think oh no, I can't see the rest of this, but you feel compelled to see it just to see who's done it. Jamie Draven was an amazing actor in it, in order to switch between two completely different characters, one of which is the evil, ugly person who did it, and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the policeman. In order to do so, yes, I certainly would not be able to do it, but not without breaking anyway. I love and care for Jamie Draven with all my heart, and I always want to think that Jamie is the sweetest, sweetest, sexiest guy in the world. I absolutely love Jamie in Ultimate Force also because he sees god damn sexy in the blacks he had. I love Jamie Love Paula Draven <br /> <br /> -X-
