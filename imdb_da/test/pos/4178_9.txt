For a long time I refused a fan of "The Monkeys" TV series to watch "Head" because it was not about the TV series characters that were warm and wonderful. "Head", instead, was said to be a cynical, dark film. Finally, curiosity got me grilling. Of course, I didn't find a new episode for the TV show, but a fascinating movie that appeals to my dark side. <br /> <br /> I have always been fascinated with dreams, and "Head" was much like seeing others' dream with incomplete hints of stories and a little detail at the end of a scene that makes the movie prevail in a new direction, much in a dreamlike stream of consciousness. The unfinished stories really make my imagination run wild, time and time again! <br /> <br /> The movie also features very striking, beautiful filmography where the symbol is the black-and-white, white and black look of "Daddy's Song". The music is in demand, especially the lush arrangement of "The Porpoise Song". ("The Porpoise Song" is the favorite song on my dark side, while my bright side prefers "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.") <br /> <br /> Finally, I think the TV series could have used some of "Head "'s drama, intrigue and intensity. But "Head" could have used some of the TV show's warmth, humor and friendship.
