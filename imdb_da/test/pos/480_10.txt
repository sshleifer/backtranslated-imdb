If you are tired of the same repetitive, unintelligible material that the regular movie industry publishes, you will enjoy "You Are Alone". It is thoughtful, well shot and nineteen. <br /> <br /> Without revealing anything that you won't find out in the first few minutes of the movie, it's the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment working as an escort and discovered by his neighbor. The vast majority of the film occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to come. <br /> <br /> Throughout their discussion, you explore two changing views on prostitution, depression, loneliness. But the film is not depressing. It speaks of dark things without being depressing. As a viewer, your feelings and preconceived notions are moved, but cautiously. You come out of it with much to think about. I like it in a movie.
