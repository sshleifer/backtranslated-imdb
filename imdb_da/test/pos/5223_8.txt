044: The Big Trail (1930) - released 10/24/1930; set 4/5/06. BIRTHS: Richard Harris, Harold Pinter, Robert Atkins. <br /> <br /> DOUG: In Hollywood, Raoul Walsh revealed his latest movie The Big Trail, a western trek across the border, starring up-and-coming 23-year-old actor John Wayne. In 1930 we see many "firsts" but few "bests". In addition to the first John Wayne movie, here we have the first widescreen movie (although we only look at the full frame version). Interestingly, the decision to widescreen movies was essentially the same reason that widescreen became popular later: to compete with televisions that had not yet emerged commercially but were still a new curiosity. Still, this movie was extremely good, giving us a terrible look at the trek to Oklahoma. Initial title cards let us know that this is a western of the most traditional kinds, about America, about the country, who must live on it, etc., and that is an excellent demonstration of it. Walsh gives us some amazing pictures of the carriage company into the desert (when they reach a cliff, they have to carpet each wagon down one by one) and we also get a vicious subplot involving Wayne who is pursuing the man who killed one by his friends (I seem to remember something similar in Stagecoach). Wayne's hard cowboy routine is at least partially there and would surely develop further in subsequent films. As this movie represents the whole of Wayne's early 30-year work for the Odyssey, we will not see his face again to Stagecoach, but when we do, we will continue to see him at the end of the Odyssey and beyond. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Ah, our first sound western, and John Wayne's first lead. It's Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail. This review will be brief as it has been weeks since I saw it. I enjoyed this movie, but it was far from a masterpiece. The most predictable adventure had some surprises that killed the brain of the evil Red Flack (Tyrone Power Sr. in its last role) halfway I thought he would be the boss at the end, but it ended up being Bill Thorpe ( Ian Keith). I remember I didn't like the way Breck (Wayne) kills Thorpe and exaggerates revenge at the end. I understood that was what he was supposed to do in the story, but I really didn't like his thinking when he tells Ruth why he should. I think he had a much greater responsibility for the hundreds of colonists he was looking through the hard west. Latest movie set: Animal Crackers (1930). Latest films chronologically: Soup to Nuts (1930). Next film: L'Age D'or (1930).
