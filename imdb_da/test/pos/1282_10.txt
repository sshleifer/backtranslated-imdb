Even with only 6,000 bucks and a cast of part-time players, Christopher Nolan was a champion. Nolan is, in my opinion, the next big one and our first taste of Nolan is not contrary to it. None of the problems that constantly stain and discredit the low-budget independent image haunt Nolan and the crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young, but they deliver and engage in this story. Honestly, I think the following is Nolan's best manuscript, because it is the one he had the most control over. It's a beautifully imagined movie. It takes us into a world where we do not feel limited by budget constraints. The dialogue and atmosphere are bold and intelligent. <br /> <br /> Nolan's trademark method of telling the story out of continuity is being used for the first time here, and here it is done in a way that throws the story right on you. With Memento and Prestige, think a little to really get a complete grip on the brilliance, but Nolan is not trying to confuse people with his prototype film. We can distinguish time by the emergence of our protagonist. This method of telling a story is both creative and engaging. I am glad that Nolan has been so successful with it, because his film is more than what they could be with this method. The remuneration in the Prestige and Memento would not have been exciting at all if the film was told in a conventional format. This idea has been done with moderate success before, but Nolan has really made it his own. <br /> <br /> The scripture here is Nolan's finest. I had some doubts about his writing abilities, I imagined in all respects that his brother Jonathon was writing talent, but he wrongly proves to me the following. It is a thought-provoking story that makes interesting observations of people and how they work. Cobb's burglary reviews and how it can lead you to discover what makes people ticker sound actually plausible. My only real complaint is that the camera's work is shaken at times, but it doesn't take anything away from history or acting. <br /> <br /> The following is the first film by the man who will personalize the 21st century film production at its finest.
