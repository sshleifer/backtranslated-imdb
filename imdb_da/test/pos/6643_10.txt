Shame is quite unique as a war movie (or rather the anti-war movie), focusing not only on the soldiers or politics involved (there is politics but not how you think it would be shown), it's about its two main topics as the only two creatures that may possibly be broken into this brutal, dilapidated community they inhabit. Ingmar Bergman, in the middle of his prime, and after two other highly psychological films, Wolfgang's Wolf and Hour, is much more interested in seeing what the influence of war has on ordinary civilized beings, that it brings the worst into them, and also on a cathartic way is a reminder of what is really crucial to living. His two key players are frequent business partners and friends Max von Sydow and Liv Ullman (as Rosenberg's strangely enough), who are musicians living on a farm on an island (not so different from 'Wolf' when you think about it). /> <br /> They see the mind rolling, and a couple of old friends are already worn down, but they are not trying to put it too much to the heart; there is a cute scene where the couple just speaks, quite honestly but with heart (all one shot that is repeated through the movie is perhaps creating a feeling of being provoked) ... Then comes the problems, including a fake movie of propaganda made in rifle with Rosenbergs, the psychological turmoil of being prisoners of war and the terror involved in a "friend" in the military (one of Gunnar Bjornstand's most subtle works with Bergman). Needless to say, this is not one of the easier films that go through with Bergman's filmography, but for some it is perhaps one of his more accessible works. His religious themes this time kept very low key, although the idea of ​​keeping a kind of faith permeates the film's atmosphere. When there are acts of war, it is shot in unconventional, fast ways (via great amigo Sven Nykvist). <br /> <br /> And the deconstruction of the relationship between Jan and Eva is successfully matched in the background of a chaotic kind of war-ground where the lines are never over-drawn. That way, this movie, shot just at the height of the worst times in Vietnam, is even more relevant to today; I couldn't help but see chilling, uncompromising coincidences between Iraq and elsewhere with some of Jan and Eves scenes with the warriors or the 'responsible'. By the way, the very first scene is one of Bergman's very best, all around (acting, steering, lighting). It's not the kind of war picture (or again, anti-war I find a bit of the John Wayne spirit in this Swedish production) that I would recommend from bats to my friends all to save private Ryan - it has a little more in relationship with the paths of honesty, and looks at the effects of war hypocrisy. But in reality it is as if any of Bergman's "genre" films alone, but one that packs a wallop to the art house's crowd.
