A while back, I bought the Chinese box set Nist of the North Star, which came with the whole nut of the North Star, Nist of the North Star 2, New Nist of the North Star, and the sparkle of the North Star film. While there is an American version and a few European versions, they halfway through the North Star fist that is about as far as film goes. <br /> <br /> The series is about the sequel to an ancient martial art called Hokuto Shin Ken (Fist of the North Star) named Kenshiro, or Ken for short. There is only one successor every generation. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic future, where martial arts is the most powerful weapon. The two most powerful art is Hokuto Shin Ken and Nanto Divine Ken as my version calls it. Nanto is really more styles, but they are all the same as they allow a person to cut someone to pieces. There are six Nanto masters and each has their own star. Hokuto is an art that allows anyone to hurt / kill or heal someone by hitting a point on their body. Each art has its own constellation. Hokuto - Big Dipper, Nanto - Twin. Kenshiro walks around and saves the world from evil, consisting of following his two brothers and three of the Nanto masters and their armies. Each army captain has their own way of fighting, making each episode different and the number of soldiers bloody. Kenshiro is also looking for his girlfriend Yuria, who was stolen by Nanto master Shin. Along the journey, Kenshiro is associated with his brother Toki after saving him from his brother Rao, who calls himself Kenou or Boxing King. He is also with two Nanto masters Rei, who is looking for his sister, who was taken by Ken's brother Jagi and Shu. Both and Toki die along the way. Other characters participating in Ken are two children Rin and Batto who do not do much. It's about as much as I can tell the story, as it is so long and full of detail. The series is also divided into four parts. <br /> <br /> What makes this show good is the fighting. Ken usually goes against a group of people who think they are tough and then killed in a hit. Which is fun and badass, but allows for fast fighting. Another big part is comedy / badassness. Ken hits someone and they think it's nothing. Ken says they have already died. Then they die. Other parts are when he strikes them and tells them that they have a few seconds to live. Then a counter comes up. Or when he tells them, they are not worthy to know his name. Then there is when he does a quick fire kick or blow and then goes then then then etc. Finally you may find that you do it with him. A great deal was when a bad guy thought he knew Hokuto. He went up to Ken and beat him. Ken stood there saying he was dead within seconds. The bad guy counted and died. It's not limited to Ken, everyone else kills just as fast. There has never been a character as amazing as Ken and their probably never will. <br /> <br /> However, there are some issues. One is the repetitive nature. Some backlinks, mostly those with Yuria being taken, are played too much, and there are also many recap episodes, especially in part four of the series. In fact, the last episode is an overview of the whole case. Another problem is the end. The final battle with Rao wasn't that impressive. Ken and Rao then fought talking etc until Rao came to some realization and kills himself instead of Ken killing him. But it's better than the American and European versions that just cut off halfway. <br /> <br /> Who would I recommend this to? This applies to older teenagers and adults who like action. As the styles cause people to explode or be broken, the violence is very graphic and there is much of it, but they do not show much blood because they usually make death just a silhouette still resembling the person, but less colorful. This was probably done to avoid censorship. If you don't like action hire the US version. If you like action, then I say go to the import because you can see the whole series, but they do not have the best English translation as it is the subtitle of the Chinese. Note: My import came with everything I said at the beginning, some imported versions don't, but you still need to get an import to see the whole series and fist of the North Star 2. If you don't think you can handle the subtitles of for some reason you get the US version. Another note: In the version, I did not get any subtitles on the last disk for the New Fist of the North Star; Although the New Star of the North Star is not very good to begin with. <br /> <br /> I give the show an 8/10 for its vast amount of action, a good story and Kenshiro's awesomeness. <br /> <br /> **** UPDATE **** <br /> <br /> Toei Animation released an English subtitle version. You can download the episodes as well as Hokuto no Ken 2 from IGN's Direct2Drive or view it for free on the FUNIMATION website.
