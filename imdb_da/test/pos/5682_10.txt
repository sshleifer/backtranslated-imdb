I have read many incredible comments on this film, and the only things I have seen, as they all have in common, are: "boring" and "unrealistic". First of all, they used the right frickin 'crocs! How much more realistic can you get? No CGI, no animatronics, no thumbnails. Just a croc and a piece of meat. Have fun, fellas! <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this movie is coming out for a slow start. Character development, how little they had, still takes some time, and I think it is primarily where this film is missing. <br /> <br /> But when the film goes, I found the action picked up dramatically. I don't mean to say that there are a lot of actions. If anything, there are several moments when the hook cannot be seen at all and people are just waiting. We know, however, that there is no relief, and that the hook just bites its time. This had a similar eerie feeling to other films that attain their horror through non-action, such as Open Water (another movie that has been criticized by some viewers as "boring"). Personally, I think viewers who are unable to feel the excitement have had their attention surgically removed at birth, but it is just me. Finally, the characters feel right, and the situation is such that it could really happen to anyone under the right circumstances. Furthermore, the deaths are just right and sometimes it is a little difficult to see. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a winner.
