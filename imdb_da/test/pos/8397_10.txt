Gone with the wind is one of the most popular books ever printed. It's a long movie of all movies. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett made people dream all over the world and turned leading actors into cinematic icons. One might ask, is it really necessary to make a sequel? And ... there are some big shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> Now there was the book first. 'Scarlett' by Alexandra Ripley is, we must admit, well-written and fully respect the world created by Margaret Mitchell. She picks up exactly where we previously left our heroine and gently leads us from Mitchell's legacy to his own imagination. In the book Scarlett, defeated after Melanie's death and Rhett's journey, he travels to Charleston to live with his mother-in-law, hoping to regain Rhett's love. Her typical manipulative behavior once again evokes a great criticism from Rhett and drives them farther apart ... until a certain voyage that will change everything. Scarlett now carries a secret. The series follows the book exactly until Scarlett's arrival in Ireland. From then on, the book and series share slowly roads. The actual end differs, but of course both have Scarlett and Rhett together. <br /> <br /> The production of the series was announced with a worldwide search for the next Scarlett O'Hara. Many countries made their own TV shows with young actresses auditioning for that part. Eventually, about twelve girls were selected to attend the last screen tests and interviews in Atlanta, Georgia. Unfortunately, the producer did not find Scarlett among these actresses. Sad for the girls, more advertising for the show (it was already sold to many television stations around the world before the recording itself was started). Robert Halmi, the producer who bought the rights to 'Scarlett', said he discovered the right actress while watching television, calling her and two days later signed the deal. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer (who played in 'Willow' and 'Scandal', the latest as the movie Robert Halmi saw the faithful evening) is not Vivien Leigh, but she's definitely Scarlett! Her performance is not a copy of Leigh's, she does the sign to her own. The biggest difference between GWTW and 'Scarlett' is the fact that the protagonist develops and grows as a person. This is the series of prerogatives, why copy something that has been done before? Given that there is a gap of nearly seventy years between first and second story, it is natural that both authors emphasize different aspects of the characters. While Mitchell is working around Scarlett, dealing with the effects of the civil war and fighting for Tara, Ripley Scarlett lets his demons meet. This for me is the most interesting aspect of the series, we learn to learn Scarlett in another way, as she learns that not everything can always go as she wants. I totally agree with the choice of Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler. He portrays him with charm and irony and is less of a cardboard figure than Clark Gables performance. The rest of the throw was well chosen. Julie Harris is endearing as Rhett's mother, John Gielgud gives a very entertaining performance as grandfather Robillard and Sean Bean are always at their best to play a dirty character, his Lord Fenton makes no exception. Bad choices, however, with Stephen Collins as Ashley and Ann-Margret's adaptation of Belle Watling were a waste of money. Costumes, sets and locations are elaborate and compelling. The newly built Tara set exactly the same, and it is a moving sequence in the series when the house is first shown. Is there a point in making a sequel ... Well, six hours of romance is for me. One to see!
