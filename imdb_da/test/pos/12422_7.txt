Two city guys drive through Hicksville USA when a rusty monster truck suddenly appears and repeatedly tries to drive them off the road. Retrieving picked up a mysterious blonde hitchhiker, they pull up on a truck stop full of redneck amputes, one of which warns them of 'demon out there'. But they do not hear. Big mistake! "Monster Man" by Michael Davis blends comedy with horror surprisingly well. The movie borrows heavily from "Duel", "The Blair Witch Project", "Jeepers Creepers" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". The story is pretty stupid, but there are probably gore and violence to keep splatterfreaks happy. I especially enjoyed the performance of Justin Urich, which gives the film its comedy relief.Still the complete lack of excitement is hard to forgive. Give this a try if you have time to waste.7 out of 10.Did I mention that Aimee Brooks is sexy?
