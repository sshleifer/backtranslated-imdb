Just a fantastic bittersweet movie depicting one side of life often jumps into feeling good movies. I saw this as a child and came back to it recently and fell in love again. As a child, it was my interest solely for the construction of an aircraft, as an adult caught it in the dark world and a young man escaped from that world. <br /> <br /> The king's decoration was great, the style of the camera chosen with low shots and shots focusing on actions and gestures, I was thought to be well done, I can't remember anything quite done in that style and adding to the character and portraying as a force that is almost not human (which may not be far from reality) it gives interesting developments <br /> <br /> Worth seeing any day
