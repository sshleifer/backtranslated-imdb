I think a person would be well-advised to read or see (I favor reading) "Twelfth Night" before he sees or regains "She's The Man". The movie is good on its own, but compares the two, and it is fun to look into the jokes. Shakespeare was inspired by others. I think he would give thumbs up. <br /> <br /> In "Shakespeare, The Invention of the Human", Harld Bloom said that most people in "Twelfth Night" should be closed. Malvolio, the person on whom Malcolm is based, is-without good reason. People in "She's The Man" are sane in contrast. For example, Duke Orsino is far more leval than the Duke of Orsino. He also shows that a man can have emotions without being gay. He shows a lot of self-control. <br /> <br /> It's a teenage comedy (a pure one) so it doesn't have the dark edges of the game. For example, Olivia is in the play of the sad brother's death. In the film she has been dumped. <br /> <br /> If you like Sir Andrew and Sir Toby in the play, they don't have the same attention in the movie. <br /> <br /> in jokes is quite often fast. Hairdresser Pauls' surname is given once. It's Antonio. Many people who have read the game say that Antonio has more love for a man than just friendship. The deep love between men was noticed these days. Some see a sexual side to it - homosexuality was illegal. <br /> <br /> The only line from the game I caught is where Duke Orsino quotes the coach on greatness during the soccar game. In the play it is said by Malvolio, Maria quotes).
