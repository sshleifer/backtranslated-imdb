I was a guest on September 30 screening by Eddie Monroe and was pleasantly surprised by the story, the great actor and the talented directing. I found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film. Powerful performances by Vario, (Uncle Benny), Sara (Jessica Tsunis) and Morris (Eddie Monroe). The support molding had come across colorful and fun characters. This movie reminds me of one of those movies that you will look back on in 20 years and discover that it launched many actors in the star. Much like "The Outsiders" where Tom Cruise, Emilio Estavez, Patrick Swazey, Ralph Macchio and others can be found. Look out Hollywood, there are new stars out on the horizon and they can be discovered on a small Long Island, independent movie called "Eddie Monroe." Good work!
