Piper, Prue and Phoebe bring Dr. Griffiths to the manor to try to save him from The Source's personal assassin Shax. While Phoebe looks in the shadow book to get a spell to overcome Shax, Prue and Piper are attacked by Shax and chasing him into the street. Unknown to Prue and Piper, they were filmed by a news reporter and her cameraman using their powers and broadcast live on national television. With Phoebe in the underworld, Prue, Piper and Leo must find a way to reverse the damage. Leo goes down to Phoebe and tells her that the Charmed Ones have been exposed as witches. On the surface, Piper is shot by a manic witch-water lap, and Prue has to take her to the hospital. The problem here is that the crowds are blocking the driveway. So Prue must use his magic on the crowd and they go to the hospital. Piper is pronounced dead, and a SWAT team moves in. Leo learns about Piper's death and goes down to tell Phoebe. Cole is asked to ask The Source to reset the time and The Source agrees; only if Phoebe turns to the dark side. Phoebe agrees, but the deal will destroy them. Up on the surface, Prue and Piper fight Shax. Prue shouts out to Phoebe, who is not familiar with them, is in the underworld. Shax throws Piper and Prue through a wall, and Dr. Griffiths out of a window. Prue is not pronounced dead until the Season 4 Premiere episode "Charmed Again, Part One". "All Hell Breaks Loose" is a poignant episode, which made me sit on the edge of my seat. Sad that Prue is dead but glad there will be five seasons for Charmed. My voice; 10 out of 10. EXCELLENT
