This was a fantastic written script when it comes to perceiving things from a different perspective. Comedy was timely and not overdone, the play was generally amazing, and the plot line served a greater purpose to create misunderstandings when we think of people based solely on their external appearance. The reason twists as Amanda Bynes brother / sister character tries to play football on the boys team instead find a new love interest along the way. Tatum Channing is where the real misunderstanding lies, and he does a fine job of acting uninterested at first, later realizing the most important thing in life is friendship, not attitude.
