I saw this movie for the first time ever on the Sci Fi channel and I have to say .. it was simply amazing. For those of you who love 'The Never Ending Story', one who would remind you of that movie back. Though it is a 1996 movie, it has a fuzzy attitude and looks that makes it feel like a fantasy. The action was brilliant, and the music was great, especially the first song and end song. To those of you who have not yet seen it, see it! I totally recommended!
