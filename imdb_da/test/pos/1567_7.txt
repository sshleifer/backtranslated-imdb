There's not much to the story. A young woman steals some money from the boring Vermont supermarket where she works, decides to run away to Florida, where he dreams of attending school with his friend Julie, and meets a weird couple on the highway. If you remember the older couple from "Rosemary's Baby", you have an idea of ​​how these two are. Bill has a comic face and is retired from the army. Sandra is an ex stripper now being a truckstop whore, though we didn't find it here at once. They are loving, helpful and full of common sense. They adopt more or less the girl Alice and promise to give her a ride in their elaborate RV, even though they are not "direct" to Florida. <br /> <br /> That's where the movie could have gone a hundred percent All the filmmakers had to do was turn the older couple into the personification of evil, they would take the virgin Alice (handcuff to bed or whatever) and sell her body to any Greaseball driver who has a lot of money and likes hard sex. (Alice would have had a lot of time to escape, with many interrupted attempts before the final shootout.) But No. The couple is really beautiful and Alice is far from virgin. Alice overhears Sandra with a customer, asks the company and trying to beat a trick alone, Bill prevents anything from happening and insists that she does the job right if she's going to do it at all. They don't talk her into it. They control her. <br /> Alice makes several hundred dollars, h which is several hundred dollars more than she had when she met the couple. Bill and Sandra keep her money in the safe, where customers will not find it. Alice misunderstands. She finds no very pleasant work, and she thinks she is never paid because every time she asks to be knocked off, Sandra answers: "What? Not here, honey. Not in the middle of heaven." But after being talked about handing over her gun to Sandra, the couple gives her the money she wants and frees herself lovingly to continue her journey to Florida. <br /> <br /> You know what I found most tragic moment in the movie? It had nothing to do with prostitution or theft. Alice has been waiting to accommodate her friend Julie after arriving in Miami. Julie is after all a legitimate student. But when Alice calls her friend from somewhere in Alabama to assure her that she is going but will be delayed, Julie hesitates and says, "Well - my mother doesn't think you have to be with us. And to tell The truth, my roommate is also not cool on it either. I certainly invited you, but I thought it was like a week or something visit. Going back to Milford, Alice "There is a long silence before Alice hangs up . br /> <br /> Only one shot is fired (a pair of white film frames) and no one is hit. Tears appear only once. Nobody swallows anyone else. No car explodes in a fireball. No policeman is chasing them down Interstate. <br /> <br /> The direction is occasionally clumsy. Too much transversal between Sandra trying to disarm Alice and Alice's hand with the wobbling gun. There is hardly any musical score. There are short male and female nudity and it is awkward as it probably should be. Alice is not uninteresting, but she is not babalicious either. She sports Asian eyes, a kind of robust version of Molly Parker. The cinematography looks cheap and the colors are washed out. The direction is a fair tale with a few bright flashbacks. Nothing is wasted. And it was apparently shot around Danbury, Connecticut. The city sticks in my heart because I ran through it after one of its floods and remembers the cars that are dressed with a film of mud right up to the door handles. <br /> <br /> I don't know exactly what Alice found. (I myself fear that the answer to the riddle is that "she found herself.") The action is not bad at all. Judith Ivey is better than that. It is definitely worth seeing, a quiet, orderly movie that treats the audience as adults.
