The viewer who said he was disappointed seems to have been wildly missing the point here. This is a great movie, excellent and realistic portraits of a middle class Jewish family in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, long ago. The nuances are perfect and I felt that the casting of all was superior. I especially found the play performed by Judith Ivey perfectly, especially the talk she has with her daughter when the daughter comes home late one night. That scene was worthy of Oscar. But really, all the play was fine. I recommend this movie. It's a fun, family movie and great to see how a lovely middle-class family lived in Brooklyn long ago. See it and you'll be glad you did. Have some very fun lines and the Eugene character is a real comedian - very fun.
