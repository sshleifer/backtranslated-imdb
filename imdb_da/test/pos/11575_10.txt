"I have fought with death. It is the most unpleasant competition you can imagine. It takes place in an opaque grin with nothing subverted with nothing around without spectators without clinging without glory without the great desire for victory without the great fear of defeat in one Sick atmosphere of weak skepticism without much faith in your own right and ever less in your mother's resistance. If it is a form of ultimate wisdom, then life is a greater mystery than some of us think it is. "Marlow in Joseph Conrads' Heart of Darkness "<br /> <br /> It is difficult to make the lyrical issue of death in any work of art. But films have recently made brave attempts to humanize it to the extent that it is embraced as part of all living things, and it can be chosen rather than legally. "Featured" is the operative word for Alejandro Amenabar's Sea Inside, based solely on the true story of Galician sailor Ramon Sampedro. It is a drama about euthanasia without prejudice covered in love, poetry and friendship. If it sounds like Barbarian Invasions (2003), where a cancer professor farewell to friends and love before taking his life, you're right. In fact, the sea is better because it spends more intimate time with the protagonist before he goes, a remarkable feat with not one of those moments at least boring or uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem as Ramon has expressive eyes and commanding voice for the romantic quadriplegic, a combination of hard realist and poetic sufferer. Belen Rueda plays the disabled lawyer Julia, who becomes an imaginary lover of Ramon, who rises in radiation as her life degenerates with disease. Lola Duenas as Rosa, a blue collar visitor who initially tries to deter Ramon from seeking death but quickly falls in love with him, is added to the almost almost opaque circumstance. Talk about romantic disability? This guy has incredible luck attracting significant women and he can't move a finger. But talk he can, prove the ultimate argument about what women want: love that speaks, not just does. <br /> <br /> I will refrain from mentioning the big movie now for an Oscar containing euthanasia as its climax so as not to spoil the experience of first timers. Suffice it to say that both films are successful in opening both sides of a contentious subject without forcing a specific point of view. The religious court has the right to complain that the former film and barbaric invasions celebrate suicide; it has no right to accuse the beautifully balanced sea content at the same time. <br /> <br /> "A life in this state has no dignity," Ramon says. The irony is that he leads himself with the highest dignity, which causes someone to ask his will to end his life. "The Sea Inside" is a formidable recording in the 2004 Oscar nominations for best foreign language film.
