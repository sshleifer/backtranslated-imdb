Black Scorpion is Roger Cormen's Batman. Which is cool and there are many great things in this movie. Like Breathtaker is a cross between Doctor Doom and Darth Vader, it's a bit hungry. The mind control gas in the inhalers was worthy of the Mad Hatter. The Cormen B movie style is this whole puppy, which is not always a good thing. There are lots of stunts and hot babes to make any action fan happy. This movie, the good looking, weighs the bad. But if you are not a comic film, then I would recommend not seeing Black Scorpion, but if you like cartoon as a movie and don't care if it ever was a comic book before. Then check out BLACK SCORPION, which I give it 8 STARS.
