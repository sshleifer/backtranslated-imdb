This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie even though there were some bugs, but I enjoyed it. This time, Charles fights not just one or two pitchers, but an entire army of them. Death Wish 3 has many good action scenes, and I enjoyed it every second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to lead a good action movie like this, and Jimmy Page delivers the music where producers Golan and Globus still do things, and Charles Bronson still works well for Paul Kersey. This movie also made it look like Michael is trying to finish the Death Wish series and I can't blame him, and I love the Gun that Charles uses. Death Wish 3 is one of the fantastic films from 1985 and cannot be better than this. <br /> <br /> I give this 9/10
