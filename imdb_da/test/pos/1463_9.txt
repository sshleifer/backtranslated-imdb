After the heights of darkness, it was never imaginable that Holness and Adobye could create something half as good as garth marengi. But I think that man to man in himself is just as good a show (on the good episodes) as darkplace. I can't argue that 2 of the episodes really aren't that good, but the other 4 certainly do. If I had to pick 2 major episodes id go to Formula 4, Steve Pising (pronounced Pissing) and the great Garth Marengi will run. Having a little understanding of the program is a real plus as Dean Learner does many jokes, but even though you haven't seen much Dean id recommend this as some of the rants he launches are genius ie. His argument with Def Lepord over their name. All in all, a good show that just misses full characters because of the few less fun episodes.
