To speak relatively if you could only see Hector Babenco's "Pixote" (1981, Brazil, pronounced "pi-shot"), after seeing a lot of movies dealing with street children, youth criminals, children in trouble (Truffauts) "The 400 Blows", Bunuel's "Los Olvidados", De Sica's "Shoeshine", Nair's "Salaam, Bombay!", Bresson's "Mouchette", Nugrohos "Leaf on a Pillow", etc.) Can be afraid of the situation of the child which is portrayed in the film cannot affect one more, as it has already been "de-synthesized" already after undergoing the emotional slide that was set in motion by the previously cited films. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, that won't be the case. For Babenco, he tells his film in such an actual way ("artless" as a movie reviewer put it in a positive light) and that his core child performance Fernando Ramos da Silva (13 years old at that time and a street child himself) gives such a frenzy , the wounded performance, raw in its simplicity (the hard face, the lonely and longing eyes) that you are hard must not be pierced in any way. (Such a feeling can achieve such increased realism when one learns that the child only lived but a short life, has been involved in street crime after the movie and then murdered.) In about the first half of the film, Pixote and his cousin children and criminals use theirs time in a repressive state-run reforming school, where brutalization and humiliation, rape and murder are the norm and culture where they are forced to confess their "crimes", wisely, that under the Brazilian law, underground crimes are not "punishable" for their offenses. For these children, the dubious freedom offered by the streets is more preferred than the hard rehabilitation that these supposed well-meaning authorities provide. Within the walls of this supposed protection business, these young souls quickly discover that the love and care of parents' figures also does not exist in any way, if at all, to some extent. <br /> <br /> (For Pixote Only form of escape comes from breathable grass and sniffing glue, thrown in secret inside the Reformation.) When the kids burst into a little "rebellion" to finally express and then fulfill their collective desire to get back to the outside world - their "home" intensity and form is such that one cannot avoid thinking about schoolboys uprising in Jean Vigo's influential "Zero for Conduct". It is only in "Pixote" that the "uprising" is made to appear on a boy. <br /> <br /> When Pixote and his little group are back on the streets (second half of the movie), they engage in robbery, pimping and drug trafficking to defend themselves as they come to meet Sueli, a battered man friendly prostitute. Sueli voluntarily accommodates the four lost souls in such a way that she allows her customers to be robbed of them and that she gives more than maternal care (at least to one of the children). <br /> <br /> One would have thought that street children have finally found the one person who can give them the love and warmth that has been very deficient in their lives. But as doubtful as the freedom these children believe in the streets, this newfound "mother figure" cannot be forever. <br /> <br /> Jealousy, bias, differences and murders have put the children apart - and for good. And during the defining scene, where the Pixote, due to the circumstances, shoots not only Sueli's arrogant American customer, but also his companion chicken Ditto (more than one son of Sueli), he literally goes back to "childhood" as he sucks from the right breast by the disoriented woman, right there and then materializing his longing desire for the parents' love, the picture itself is both sad and disturbing. <br /> <br /> Sueli is likely to come back to her "senses" pushing back Pixote from his "nourishing" position and rejecting him for good. So, in a quiet, scary moment, the Pixote with the young older face and the stupid eyes (not quite odd, even if it is in a different context, becomes the young boy's mime in Elem Klimov's scary "Come and See") on his coat and takes his gun (yes, a gun!) and sits down nowhere, walks along the train tracks and with the morning light just starting to appear. With that scene, Babenco can just make a tribute (among many other homages found in different movies!) To the iconoclastic final scene in Truffaut's "The 400 Blows". But while we were told what has become Antoine Doinel three years later in the short film "Antoine et Colette" (as well as in three other feature films in the years thereafter), we are back in the dark about what lies ahead of Pixote after he finally disappearing from the last frame, this is the last time we see this real street child (whatever fate eventually found him). "Pixote" may not be as nearly as moody as "The 400 Blows" or as hallucinating as "Los Olvidados", but it still stands out among films of similar theme and texture because of its simple, raw power.
