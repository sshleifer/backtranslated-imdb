This is easily my favorite movie. A tragic romance intertwined with a complex mystery whose threads are all but invisible until they all rage at the end in a fantastic rush. Absolute shine. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more of Gilles Mimouni's work, but at least, according to imdb, he has not made any other features. Has the high quality of this work done produce another too scary a task? Has he moved (back) into another form of creative effort? I certainly hope this will not be his last move, but I can't really blame him if he decides to stop this gem as his only contribution to the film world.
