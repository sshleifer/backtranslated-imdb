I finally watched this on video after many years of hearing about it. It is by no means a perfect movie, but it is strangely hypnotic - one of the rare, special films that create its own world. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** First, the bad things. The scenes in Burkewaite's class are monstrous. Although the topic is community studies, this guy is WAY over the top. His speeches are so overwhelmed, they are ridiculous. And no teachers I've ever had would grill their students like that and tell those who protest against "Shut up!" These scenes are short, but they break the mood and pull the viewer out of the story. Next, how does Layne just go out of the police station near the end? What happened to Samson's car after the first scene of him riding into town? He uses the rest of the movie to be cut around by Layne or Feck. *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Ahhh, Feck ... this guy is amazing. Dennis Hopper steals the movie effortlessly. "Check in the mail", "I love company", "you are my friend" - every line is a classic. He gives Feck an internal logic that makes the story a reality. Amazingly, he actually makes the audience feel empathy for this guy, especially when Samson talks about his (Samson) future. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Crispin Glover is difficult to take sometimes. But his scenes running around in the Beetle are perfect - kids with cars in high school always have something to do and buds to do it with. Matt's key setting makes a good film for Layne - their friendship is credible. Glover's mannerisms are a bit much, but he is consistent throughout. He drives the plot and shows a sense of urgency that no one else does - just try to imagine this flick if Layne was as much of a zombie as Matt or Samson - snoozefest! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** What makes "River's Edge" disturbing is that Samson is not really evil, in the usual sense. He is a kind of boring guy who got sick for being taken for granted - in other words, he is like thousands of other boring guys. After killing Jamie, he begins to rave, creating excitement as we wait to see when he will snatch again. *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Part of the film's appeal is the way in which action is centered around teenagers and their point of view. The parents are comical relief - Clarissa's mother, Tony's father - or overwhelmed - Matt's mother. This emphasizes how the children are linked to the attention no one else gives them. It keeps the story focused on the relationships within the clique, and emphasizes that the only adult they can relate to is Feck. "River's Edge" is a textbook on alienation. It conveys how awkward, mysterious and disturbing youth is like no other movie.
