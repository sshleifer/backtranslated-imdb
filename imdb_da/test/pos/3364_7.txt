The 1970s are often considered a golden age of British television comedy, a period where so many classic sitcoms as well as sketches like "Monty Python's Flying Circus". However, the period was emphatically not a golden age of British film comedy, and what worked well on television was rarely transmitted to the big screen. The most triumphant exceptions to this rule were provided by the pythons, but their best films ("Monty Python and Holy Grail" and "Life to Brian") were very different in the perception of their television show. <br /> <br /> The main problem with customizing sitcoms to the cinema is the concepts designed to fit the BBC's 30 minute slots (25 minutes on ITV to accommodate advertising), doesn't always work as well when extended to a feature film three or four times as long. Few people will remember the movie versions, "Up Pompeii!" or "Steptoe and Son" with the same love as the TV versions. In the case of many classic TV comedy shows ("Some Mothers Do 'Ave' Em", "Yes, Minister", "Fawlty Towers", "The Goodies"), no attempt was made to film them at all as we can be grateful. Signs like Michael Crawford's Frank Spencer or John Cleese's Basil Fawlty can be fun in half-hour doses, but I doubt if they will remain so fun within two hours. A comedy program (albeit a dramatization of a comic rather than a sitcom in the normal sense), which could have worked in the cinema, was "The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin", but any hope of a movie was blown up by the tragic early death of his star Leonard Rossiter. <br /> <br /> "Father's Army" was one of the few television sitcoms in the period that turned into a decent movie. (About the only other thing I can think of was "Porridge"). This was possibly because it had an unusually large number of well-developed characters and derived most of its humor from the interactions between them. The original sitcom ran between 1968 and 1977 and told about an amusement of a homeward plow in the small seaside resort of Walmington-on-Sea. (The Home Guard, originally known as the local defense volunteers, was an auxiliary military during World War II, mostly composed of men too old to serve in the regular forces). The movie version is a drama with three actions. Law I deal with the formation of platon and recruitment of members. In Law II, they cause chaos during an army exercise. In Law III, a group of Nazi pilots are being captured, whose aircraft have been shot down. <br /> <br /> The three key players in this drama are the platoon commander, Captain George Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) and his two subordinate sergeant Arthur Wilson (John Le Mesurier) and corporal Jack Jones (Clive Dunn). Mainwaring, which in civil life is the local bank manager, is a pushy little man looking at the world through a pair of thick glasses. It is he who takes the initiative to form the Home Guard unit and who designates his commander. He is pompous, vicious with an exaggerated sense of his own importance and of his own leadership powers, the kind of man who does not suffer suffering with joy. (And in the world view of George Mainware, the term "fool" covers most of the rest of humanity). However, he has his good qualities. He is motivated by a genuine patriotic idealism and is capable of great physical courage, shown in his encounter with the Germans. <br /> <br /> Wilson is Mainwar's substitute at the bank. The two men are very different in character, somewhat emphasized by a difference in appearance, Wilson is tall and thin, while Mainwaring is short and stiff. He comes across being both more intelligent and better educated than his boss. (His accent suggests he can be a former public schoolgirl). Nevertheless, he ended up playing second enemy in both civilian and military life, probably because he has the kind of passive personality that leads to pessimism and defeat and the inability to take everything seriously. Jones is an old soldier now running the local butcher's shop. (His promotion to corporal is primarily due to his ability to bribe Mainwaring with black market sausages). His enthusiasm for his new role is only matched by his incompetence and ability to cause chaos. Although his catch phrase is "don't panic!" He tends to panic at every opportunity. <br /> <br /> Several other members of platon are presented. Private Fraser, the Scottish undertaker, is even more pessimistic than Wilson. (Catchphrase: "We are doomed, man, doomed!"). Private Godfrey is a gentle old man whose main concern is where to find the nearest toilet. Private Walker is a sharp Cockney Spiv and Private Pike (another bank employee) a spoiled mommy's boy. (Pike's mother is Wilson's mistress, though Wilson is trying to keep this connection secret from the frown Mainwaring). Two important outsiders are the gentle Vicar and the ARP supporter, Mainwaring's accused and quite pompousness and officiousness. There are occasionally bawdy doubles entenders ("Keep Your Hands by My Individuals" Mainwaring apparently refers to the soldiers holding that rank), more than in the TV show, which was surprisingly free of insinuation. (Its creators, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, would later continue to create comedy shows such as "Are you Served?" And "Hi-de-hi" who were notorious for suggestive humor). The film, however, retains much of the blend of gentle humor, nostalgia and sharp characterization, which made the television series so successful. 10.7
