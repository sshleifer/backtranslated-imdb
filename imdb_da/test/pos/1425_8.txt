This movie was never thought of as a big budget movie, but was a cute little picture that almost everyone could enjoy. It probably won't change your life, but it's definitely charming and engaging. <br /> <br /> Clifton Webb plays a curmudgeon (it's definitely not new) that has a TV. But his reviews fail and he is concerned about cancellation. So he may decide that he is out of touch with the children - since he and his wife have none of their own. So volunteer as a scoutmaster and sorry to do it almost immediately! Remember, he is a curmudgeon and not particularly children. To make matters worse, one of the children can really like him and follow him as a lost puppy. No matter how he acts against the child, the child will just spend time with him! The child is sweet and steals almost the whole show! <br /> <br /> What is happening now and the movie's twists are something you just need to find out for yourself. Understand that this is a light, sweet and yet non-cloying movie you will enjoy.
