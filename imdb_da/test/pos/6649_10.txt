How is it possible to like and do not like the same movie? <br /> <br /> The reason is much like the Jody Foster thing, Sommersby, just not so good. Nicole was fantastic .... Jude was adequate. They didn't give him many lines ... is there a reason for that? In general, he is a really good actor. She is so elegant, his character is so country bumpkin. It makes you wonder what they see in each other. <br /> <br /> Romance between two was only successful in Lady Chatterly's Lover. <br /> <br /> I think the aversion is because the movie is too long. They could have told the story in two hours. <br /> <br /> The story is good. Good places, good movie recording. The characters actors were great.
