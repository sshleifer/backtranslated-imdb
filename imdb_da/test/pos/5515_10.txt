Many people give this movie a lot of shit, and everything is really undeserved. People give this movie a hard time either because it is such a healthy subject or the harps on any technical aspect of the movie that no one else observes when they see it. If you just look at the cover, you think this movie will make you uncomfortable ... DON'T SEE IT! However, you will miss one of the better movie experiences in the late 1990s, despite what others say. Dee Snider is wonderful here as Captain Howdy, the depth of insanity he plumbs to play this character must be without words and is much longer than any of us would be willing to go. The action here is wonderful. The film itself beautifully shot. The subject can be a little too much for many to swallow, but it's still worth your time. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out.
