I loved it. Others have revealed spoilers, but I won't. It was an unusual premise, actually kind of weird, but I totally joined it. Camille was a difficult part to pull off convincingly; Maybe that was why some people hated it. But I think Sienna was excellent and her acting skills made it possible for her to sail the part perfectly - without being muddy or ridiculous. I don't know why she was even interested in a loser like James Franco, but married him anyway. I like him as an actor and also thought he did a great job. He has nothing to be ashamed of. There have been movies with similar setups, eg. "Ghost". I simply love Sienna Miller and joined the situation as written in the script. I feel her amazing actresses are very undervalued and hope it is more widely recognized by the public. I thought that all the actors played their parts very well and hope more people will see the movie. I highly recommend it. I was surprised that my local Block Buster store had about 10 copies available. I'm definitely planning to buy it.
