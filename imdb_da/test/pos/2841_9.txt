Flawless writing and brilliant plays make this exceptionally lovely and witty plot twister one of the best American movies I've seen this year. Neil Labute's amazing casting and cynical direction keeps this movie from being too sentimental, while Ren√©e Zellweger and Morgan Freemans authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney provide all uncomfortable tongue in cheek performance. The biggest spear of soap operas since the film's soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10
