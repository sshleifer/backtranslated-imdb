'In The Fire Of Fire' tells the story of the game between an old presidential bodyguard and a former assassin beaten psycho. The secret service agent / bodyguard (Eastwood) is on defense and the murder (Malkovich) is in insult. Insats are? President's live. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie ... I've seen it many times on TV and recently bought it on DVD. Still, it's not an excellent movie. The reason is too thin, and the attempt to thick it is even ridiculous. The whole love story is not very plausible, and the way they brought an extra character in history is just to be able to kill it some kind of insult to the more or less intelligent seer. Although I feel that these errors cannot be forgiven, I can easily see them past. Malkovich exquisite performance. I've always considered him to be a great actor, but in this movie he's really on fire. There is a reason why he received an Oscar nomination. Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood were okay, but I don't consider their performance to be memorable. They are never the best of their abilities. <br /> <br /> If you don't expect too much, you'll definitely like this movie. It's not a masterpiece, but John Malkovich is really extraordinary and I don't think anyone can enjoy his performance. Really worth the clock ...
