This is a gem of a movie, Slapstick violence a-plenty, Simon Pegg and Green Spew. <br /> <br /> A suspicious looking power plant and an uncontrollable motorcycle add to this stunker. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this, I highly recommend it, maybe not quite as well as the bottom, but not far short. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen a man imposed by the nose on two hooks then what are you waiting for to buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't even see that twist at the end when it turns out that Ritchie and Eddie are both ghosts. <br /> <br /> Feeb - 1 boiled egg.
