What a trip down memory slots. Don't look for great plays, trustworthy plot lines or anything that looks like a quality movie. <br /> <br /> This is pure blaxploitation at its finest. Outrageous outfits, unrepeatable dialogue, objectification of women and the most beautiful policemen you can imagine. <br /> <br /> This "Godfather of Rap" vanity piece, Rudy Ray Moore, who left us well last week, is Standard where all blaxploitation is measured. <br /> <br /> Not only do you see blaxploitation at its finest but get a glimpse of his comedy genius and see why his records were kept under the counter.
