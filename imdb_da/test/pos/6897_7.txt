I sell the dead (2009) ** 1/2 Dominic Monaghan, Larry Fessenden, Ron Perlman, Angus Scrimm, John Speredakos, Eileen Colgan, Brenda Cooney. Uneven mix of horror and comedy that make up a valentine for Roger Corman and Hammer Studios' 60s horror movie, with two cretinous tombs (Monaghan and Fessenden) facing final punishment for the crimes via the guillotine, but not before their stories of occult can be revoked in flashbacks. Entertaining and a couple of well-sprung jolts, but really a mess in a B-movie trying to be a cult classic by virtue of casting genre veterinarians Perlman and Scrimm to no avail; a good rental for Halloween.
