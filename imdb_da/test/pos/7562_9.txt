I haven't seen this movie for over 20 years, but it had such an impact on me that I remember sitting through the credits and for several minutes after utter awe. This is one of the most underrated films of the entire decade when it was originally released. I just ordered a copy of it on DVD and paid for freight shipping and can't wait to arrive. It runs out sometimes, and also very dark and somewhat disturbing. It's a story of a close knit band of solid children growing up in inner city, and making one feel as though they're actually sitting on the sidelines, rather than watching movie screens or TVs. Hard to explain, but it is something to be experienced. The story begins in childhood and tracks the lives of the four protagonists through high school and as they enter into their separate journeys in life. The whole cast did an incredible job, and that is by far the best work in Jodi Thelsen's career. I hope the DVD lives up to my memory and plans to watch it on Friday with a good friend.
