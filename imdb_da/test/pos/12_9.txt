I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie as a sniper in my local theater. We've all seen this plot line before (Top Gun, GI Jane, An Officer and a Gentleman) but a good script still works. This story is basically about training a Coast Guard rescue team with a few side stories. Kevin Costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader, Ben Randall, who is forced to attend the training team after a tough mission. The film takes us through the training process and the personal stories of both the Costner character and Jake Fischer played by Ashton Kutcher. I'm glad to say that Ashton is amazing in this part. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what comes a long time before it comes. But the use of humor, the exploration of fatigue in training and the fun of seeing Ben Randall "do his own thing as a coach" kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained. I really enjoy watching a movie that makes the whole audience laugh out loud, gasping here and there and clapping at the end as a tribute to the movie. <br /> <br /> We all had a good time (despite a couple of hard moments in the movie) and I think you will too.
