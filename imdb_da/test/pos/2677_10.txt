This show is amazing! I love every single episode. Carrie is a spitfire and Doug is a lovable and sometimes a fun. Arthur, Spence, Danny, Deacon and Carrie's Boss just add a nice end touch to the show, tying all the fun, piss in your panty moments. In one of the seasons, Doug tries to get Carrie full because she is nicer when she is full. Nice man right? Carrie is not much better when her boss needs an IPS driver to witness in a small case at her job, Carrie hesitates because she sees Doug as a slob and doesn't want him to scare her so she hires Doug's friend instead. This year's wife. But who I think to be the funniest, is scared of random Arthur. He is drop-dead hilarious, and angry. Hi, you would also be if you were to live in a basement where the shape has a funny smell and makes you dizzy. This show is fun, and if you haven't seen it yet, then you haven't lived!
