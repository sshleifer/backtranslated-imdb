I am thoroughly biased because I look at this movie, but I loved it, and I'm only about seven dispersed minutes and are not nearly the most interesting part of it. The film is an honest and exciting account of a noble independent group of filmmakers trying to make a lovable movie. It is also a statement of inflated expectations and fallen heroes. The interviews are well patched together in the editing. The different people are all interesting and there is never really too much of a person. Also interviews are shot in a rather interesting way that keeps the film visually satisfactory. Definitely a worthy movie. I hope it goes around.
