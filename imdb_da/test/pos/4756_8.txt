A team of tough rogue New York police officers led by the rugged, stubborn Buddy Manucci (excellent play of the always outstanding Roy Scheider) go after a group of nasty mobsters involved in a kidnapping ring after one of their numbers is killed by them. Director Philip D'Antoni, the producer of "Bullet" and "The French Connection" creates a strong, gritty, highly amoral no-nonsense tone, keeps a constant pace and phases the action scenes with great rip-roaring power. Don Ellis' exhilarating string score further boosts the fast and strongest intensity, while the scrappy Big Apple sites and Urs Furrer's coarse, grainy cinematography both reinforce overall grungy realism. In addition, the fine line that distinguishes from criminals becomes chilling in this image: the titular uses harsh, brutal and moral questionable strong arm tactics as a means to end the law, and there is certainly no honor among thugs and thieves who populate the seedy city belly depicted in this movie. Nice accompanying performances by Tony Lo Bianco who wormy sniveling snitch Vito Lucia Undertaker, Richard Lynch as evil psychotic hoodlum Moon, Bill Hickman as Moon's just cold partner Bo, Jerry Leon as funky flatfoot Mingo and Joe Spinell as parking garages. An extremely wild and exciting long-lasting mondo destructo car in the heart of your neck qualifies as a clear highlight. The climatic shootout also delivers the agitators. A real bang-up little winner.
