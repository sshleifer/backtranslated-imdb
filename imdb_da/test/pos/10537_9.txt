I saw this at The Tribeca Film Festival, in the family section. I'm not sure one of my kids really has the movie, but I have to say it was a wonderful short film. 'Nostradamus and Me' is an interesting short film about hope and fear that we all felt growing up in the 1980s, which in turn extends to how my children feel today. Then we had Regan, today we got Bush. Instead of nuclear war, we have terrorism. I really identified myself with the main character, and I even dated a 'Curehead' in high school. We all felt like "nothing insignificant" when we were 16, but it's great to see a movie where they discover everything matters !!! <br /> <br /> Again, I wouldn't have put this in the family section ... there were a few too many curse words for younger kids, but it was a wonderful and fun movie to watch.
