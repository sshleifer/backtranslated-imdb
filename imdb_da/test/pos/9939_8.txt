I finally managed to get a copy of Dario Argento Opera and I tell you ... it was time !! It was the last Argento movie I hadn't seen yet and I'm a fan of most of his work. I reckon that most of his work is extremely important to the scare genre, but some of his films tend to disappoint (like phenomena). But the idea of ​​opera always appealed to me and it turns out I was right !! I enjoyed every shot in Opera and I was fascinated by this movie in the first place. From all Argento movies, Opera went straight to the number one place and I hope I can encourage as many as possible to see this too. <br /> <br /> The script and plot idea for Opera is quite simple. Especially in relation to Argento's previous film phenomena that had too many ideas in it and ended up being a mess. The opera plot is scary and chilling, but at the same time it is an excellent satirical comment - almost a spoof - against opponents of explicit violence. *** SPOILERS *** A young opera singer (the beautiful Cristina Marsillach) gets swollen by a horribly sadistic killer. During each massacre he commits, forcing him to see his actions with his eyes wide open. There are needles attached to her eyelids, and when she closes them, they are torn apart. *** END SPOILERS ***. For this simple yet effective idea, Argento adds many horrible elements such as ravens, the classic piece (and curse) of MacBeth and the entire atmospheric location of the opera house and music. Especially the presence of the creepy ravens is and extra value. Old masters like Edgar Allen Poe already knew that these black birds have a lot of mystery hanging around them, and Dario Argento knows that too. <br /> <br /> Violence and gore are very well presented in Opera, which is what makes this a true Argento image. His best in my opinion with Profondo Rosso as a close second. I hope to recommend this movie to many people among you. Especially for fans of the (Italian) horror business, this is an absolute must! Favorite "Rewind" scene: Argento shows his visual talent the best in the scene where Betty's girlfriend gets shot in the eye while trying to see who is standing in front of the door.
