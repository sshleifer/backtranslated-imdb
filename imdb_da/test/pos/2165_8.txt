Although this is a good, funny cartoon, they later did much better, like Carrotblanca. This is almost like the first Star Trek feature that would have been welcomed with open arms and joy no matter what, just for existing ones. This is really a patchwork of old pieces with some fine touches, but nothing special. Reminds me a little of the hunting trilogy in spots and the end is invaluable. Available and definitely worth seeing just for the news and the good bits. Recommended.
