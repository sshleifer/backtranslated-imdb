Angela (Sandra Bullock) is a computer expert but is crazy and a bit of a recluse, she does all her work from her condo. Just as she is taking a vacation in Mexico, a colleague sends her a computer disk with disruptive information about it. Angela agrees to meet with her employee, but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash. Angela goes to Mexico, but takes the disk with her. While she is sunbathing on the beach, a stunning looking gentleman named Jack (Jeremy Northam) makes overtures to her. She falls for them, and the two end up on a boat to Cozumel. However, Jack works for the people who generated the secret information on the disk and he is out to get it. Even after Angela escapes from her clutches and lands back in the United States, Jack makes it difficult. He changes Angela's identity on all computers across the country, so she loses her condo, bank account, everything. Can Angela, a computer whiz, beat Jack in his own game? This very exciting movie has many assets. First, Bullock and Northam are two very beautiful, interesting actors, and their presence adds immediate imprisonment. Scripture is very clever and safe in its knowledge of the computer's capabilities and their relevance in today's world. The costumes, sets, production and direction of the film are also quite wonderful. And despite how it sounds, there is a great exciting action when Angela goes on the road to defeat her enemy. If you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, this is a good choice. It delivers high frequency twists, allowing the viewer to "net" a very good evening of entertainment.
