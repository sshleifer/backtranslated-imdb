22. JOE (drama, 1970) Joe (Peter Boyle) is a racist factory worker known to hate "hippies and nine". He meets Bill, a businessman who has just murdered his addict, his daughter Jill (Susan Sarandon). Jill runs away and joins a hippie municipality on the outskirts of town. Bill turns to Joe for help. Their search leads them through the coolest parts of the city, where both men's inner hatred and hardness are further tested. <br /> <br /> Criticism: This was director John G. Avildsen's first sleeper-beaten smash hit (a fantastic race that included: 'Rocky', 'The Karate Kid', 'Split-Image', 'Weekend at Bernie's'). Movies are interesting enough because it served to encapsulate the themes and ideas of the turbulent 60s (Vietnam war, black power, women's lib, etc.). It also has a good performance from Peter Boyle as Joe, one of the cinema's first anti-hero. He has always been good at playing creepy, bossy heavies whose abstract ideas are enforced by his frightening presence (he wanted to play the Frankenstein monster in Mel Brook's spoof Young Frankenstein). He reminds me of a little child trapped in a big, stupid, awkward body. Film has a weak script (for example, Joe and Bill's meeting is a bit random), but it has a particularly cruel, after-taxi driver ending. <br /> <br /> QUOTE: Title Sang: "I saw a fella selling junk to children. He gets nervous every time I pass by because he knows that if I catch him I will kick his head and kick his fat and $$. "
