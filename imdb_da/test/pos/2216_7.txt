This movie was a great surprise to me as I watched it at Cinequest in the great California Theater in San Jose. It's a musical that I usually don't like, but I have to say that this one was different. Robert Peters, who directed the movie and stared at it, did a wonderful job. During his Q&A he told the audience that he only had two other people for his crew member! Most of the dialougen was made in the air, and he actually made the movie while attending another film festival in Germany! I can't say enough good things about this movie, the only bad thing is that you really tend to notice the camera's work and it shakes a little. If you come across this movie, check it out!
