If you want to see what could be classified as the "scene" version of GYPSY, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy (ed) listing for the MERMAN recording of GYPSY, then you really enjoy watching FAMILIES like the gypsy's mother, ROSE. It is my opinion that the Means has the volume, vibrato and gifts that Merman once had. <br /> <br /> It is not often these days when listening to musical updates that I get the thinned sensation that makes the hair tingle my neck, but Bette Midler certainly shows his talents in this movie - See how you like them apples ..... I know you may not like it, but for me, Mrs Midler is the final "gypsy".
