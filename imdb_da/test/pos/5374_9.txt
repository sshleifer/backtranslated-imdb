The 70s were a good time for horror movies. Satan's Brotherhood is yet another overlooked gem. It's full of the brim with great surreal, disturbing scenes. It is also great to see Stother Martin and L.Q. Jones (who also produced) in decent roles. <br /> <br /> Some of it is a bit dated and cheesy, but Satan's Brotherhood kicks ass over Race the Devil and many other 70's Satanism flicks.
