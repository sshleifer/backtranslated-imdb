I really chose this movie for my husband - working in radio broadcast. I thought it would be more of a movie that he would enjoy and relate to, even though it was from the eighties - so it was a little dated. This movie really pulls you in. At times you just want to choke the host, Barry. At times, you will just send some of the bigots who call in to a real concentration camp. At times, you feel really upset by Barry, because he's really too big for his jeans if you know what I mean. It was on the drama channel on Encore-so I'm thinking this is a true story. If you really love dramas, you'll love this even if you don't know all the invitations in the broadcast business. If you are an Alec Baldwin fan and see it to see him, you shouldn't. His part is really part of this movie.
