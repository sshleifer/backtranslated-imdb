Babs Johnson (Divine) lives in a trailer with her son Crackers, her daughter Cotton and her mother Edie (Edie Massey). She is in competition with a couple named Connie and Raymond Marbles (Mink Chairs, David Lochary) to be named as the most beautiful person alive. The film shows their attempts to exaggerate each other. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. It is in your face that there is no blockage in bad taste. Crackers have sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister looks; Marbles picks up female hitchhikers, impregnates them, keeps them in the basement and sells the babies to lesbian couples; Divine and family have a party that includes cannibalism, etc. It's disgusting, but in a way, not uatches. It's so over the top and is so inappropriate that it's a little fascinating. As director John Waters can say, it's bad taste done well. It's also fun to watch - the play is so miserable (especially by Massey) that you just see it in disbelief. A friend laughed aloud at how badly Massey was (she improved in later pictures). <br /> <br /> This is NOT for people who are easily offended. Although it's over 30 years old, it's still shocking. But if you have an open mind and can take very extreme behavior it is a must-see. The only part that really was too much is what Divine does in the end.
