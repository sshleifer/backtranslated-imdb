The pace of the movie is slightly slower in parts, but if you can tune into its warm speed and long postures then it is a satisfying piece of legal intrigue. The story of the first emperor in China, his childhood sweetheart and the personal costs of power. The film is very atmospheric, the extremely mature and courteous court ceremony and ritual as opposed to sudden brutal violence. Filmed in a way that evokes shadows and cold spaces. The battle scenes are rare and short, the focus is on the struggle of the individual on what is right to do and whether the ends justify the means. The Emperor's journey from idealistic pacemakers to ruthless tyrant aims to be subtle, but gives little background or convincing insight into emperor's motivation, and his actions and goals do not change all the time. Only Gong Li's attitude toward him changes. The most interesting performances are Gong Li's and the titular Assassin, as they rethink when to fight when to retire when to kill. The most expensive film ever made in China does not rely on emperor and assassin on hysterical feelings or great struggles, but rather a violent atmosphere of threat and inevitability. Gong Li fans will not be surprised to hear that she is as amazingly beautiful as ever, giving an underestimated performance.
