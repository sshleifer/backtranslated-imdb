Jimmy Wang Yu, an authentic Asian superstar, instructed and wrote this movie, which I have only seen in a dubbed video tape version. Widescreen (Shaw Scope!) The figure was lost and the original actor is not absent, but it is still good to see. The story is the usual martial arts battle that fights for bad guys from Japan, with our young hero who wins out eventually by beating lots of assorted gay men. The battle is getting better when the film is unravels. Early in the film, it seems stiff and boring, but later there is a big scene where Wang Yu fights hordes in a gambling joint, then goes out into a snow-covered scene and takes on several crooks with knives, swords and fists. That part is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Well, it would be interesting to see a non-duplicate widescreen version if there is one.
