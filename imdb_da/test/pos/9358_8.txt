"Crossfire" is a justified famous 1947 noir, a murder mystery with a strong message. It's stars Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sam Levene, and Gloria Grahame, and is heavily governed by Edward Dmytryk. We are witnessing the murder in the shadow at first, and for the rest of the film, Young as a detective, Finlay, is in charge of the matter, to find out which of the three soldiers is responsible for death and just as important , Why. The victim, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene) is one whom the soldiers meet in a bar; They go to their apartment to continue their visit, and Samuels are dead. <br /> <br /> I don't know about 1947, but seeing "Crossfire" today you know who did it and why the moment we see the suspects. I do not assume that it was so clear when these actors just started. Nevertheless, the film packs a big blow with its powerful action, good direction, violence and unsparing anti-Semitic language. The characteristics are alive, including the role of Gloria Graham in a small role - she is a woman who meets Mitchell (George Cooper), one of the suspected soldiers, in a bar and can give him an alibi. The big show in the movie belongs to Robert Ryan, but all are excellent. Robert Young is especially effective as a tough, yet intelligent, policeman. Mitchum is very sympathetic as a soldier trying to help his confused friend Mitchell, a lonely man uncertain whether he still has feelings for his wife. <br /> <br /> Really excellent and one should see.
