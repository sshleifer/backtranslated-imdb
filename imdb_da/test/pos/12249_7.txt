In fact, I haven't seen many movies with Holly Hunter, but seeing her in Broadcast News was a pleasant surprise. She is a stubborn journalist, Jane Craig, who has been devoted to television news all the time. Her colleague Aaron Altman has long had his torch without saying anything. The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnick. He is the little devoted ex-sportscaster who is the new reporter. To Jane he symbolizes everything she doesn't like about news reporting - make it edutainment, not serious business. Much to her surprise, Jane finds herself attracted to Tom. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter performs well as the perky journalist. But I can't quite see what she finds so charming about her new colleague, Tom. It is something with those who prevent us from getting close and personal with him. Almost as impressive is Albert Brooks, who gives everything in the role of a professional who gives more than 100 percent to his job, but does not get much in return. In fact, I thought for a while he was Steve Guttenberg from the Police Academy (1984). He has some fun lines, and if this was a Meg Ryan picture, they would call it a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Throughout two hours, a few scenes could have been edited or omitted entirely, such as Jane and Aaron's trip to Central America. I am also a sucker for happy conclusions and would have preferred a different ending than just a reunion between the three of them seven years later.
