Hitchcock's remake of his 1934 film relates to the well-known story of the McKenna marriage (James Stewart, Doris Day, in the first version, Leslie Banks, Edna Best) along with their 11-year-old son traveling through Morocco for holidays. In a bus they know a sympathetic French person (Daniel Gelin, in the old version Pierre Fresnay). While in Marrakech, they also know a couple (Bernard Miles and Brenda De Banzie) and are suddenly in a place of death if they die whispering a political message. Then, the child is abducted to ensure their silence, and McKenna gets help for Morocco's Inspector Buchanan (Ralph Truman). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie about a family stumbling upon an unclear international conspiracy and then forced to act by James Stewart and Doris Day. This exciting movie shows excitement, intrigue, excitement and interesting drama, written by John Michael Hayes and Charles Bennett. Packs a regular theme for the thriller: innocent people are caught up in a spider's web and spooky, intelligent villains. Colorless and brilliant screenplay shot in Morocco and London Studios by cameraman Robert Burks, but with excessive transparency for Marrakech scenes. Lavish sets off by Henry Bunstead, Hitchcock's usual, and works until his recent death. Of course, the highlights are the events of the famous Royal Albert Hall of London murder, where an insidious killer, Reggie Nalder, tries to perform while composer Bernard Herrmann conducts orchestra. Besides the climax Doris Day singing ¨Que sera, Que sera¨ while her son is suffering in the meantime, the song won Oscar to Ray Evans, Jay Livingstone. The story was wildly reviewed for its dual characters, but today is considered a classic movie and rather entertaining. Rating: Better than average, Hitchcock's enthusiastic will no doubt enjoy it.
