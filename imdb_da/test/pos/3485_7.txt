Because of its predictable second rate title (one was distributed under in Italy, at least) I didn't expect much from this movie. Thought it would be another cheap blow to a haunted house ("LA CASA MALEDETTA" means "The Cursed House"). Well, I had to change my mind right after the very first brilliant scene! The priests' constant presence and the eerie atmospheres reminded me of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian rip-offs, but it was something quite different ... This is more like Hitchcock meets Italian thriller! Very well written and directed, good actors, interesting plot ... OK, I have tried not to spoil the view of "7 Hyden Park" to you, which I would recommend to everyone. <br /> <br /> P.S. Am I wrong or when Joanna crawls or tries hard to stand (she is paralyzed from the waist down), do the feet and legs go a little too much? (... And I'm not talking about the "bad dream" sequence.)
