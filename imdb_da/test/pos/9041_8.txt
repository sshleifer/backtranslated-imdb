No movie could ever do justice to Faulkner's command of the English language. but they did a good job here. Lucas Beauchamp is exactly the way I depict him in the book, as it is Chick. What the movie didn't really go into was how Beauchamp wasn't even the negro people, for he was just as stubborn. Not that it's a bad thing, but from my take the book that was his attitude to the world (yet I got the feeling that it was the racism of the white society that started it and it spilled over into the negro community until it became his attitude towards everyone). The best part of the movie is that you get to see Yoknapatawpha County (actually Oxford, Mississippi) exactly as Faulkner wrote about it (the movie was made when Faulkner lived and wrote). It doesn't look that much different today. Because of this alone, the film is worth watching as it is filmed in Faulkner's backyard. A true must see for Faulkner fans.
