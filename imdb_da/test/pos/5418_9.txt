Man I am stoked I can leave feedback for this 10 minute romp. I love it. <br /> <br /> After not seeing it this year, I happened to do it during the day and saw it again and again. <br /> <br /> 'Stop shaking your eyes' and 'shake a rock and roll band' and 'stop the sowing table' are freaking classic lines. <br /> <br /> The art is wonderfully raw. And wonderful. Just find it and love it. Can't recommend it enough. <br /> <br /> Thanks college art teaches Mrs Kogan to show us this over and over again. Thank you NFB for letting it be done. Thank you MTS for to show it (at least for the moment at least). <br /> <br /> I want a Big Snit t-shirt now, I want to love an animation cell but at 440.00 a pop that won't happen <br /> <br /> Find this flick and see it.
