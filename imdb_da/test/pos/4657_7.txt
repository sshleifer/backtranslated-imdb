I had completely forgotten "Midnight Madness" until right now when I found it while browsing IMDB. Now it's all come back to me .... It was one of Naughton's first movie (as well as Fox's) and sharp eyes will also choose Kaplan (Henry from the TV's "Alice"), Fiedler (he makes Piglet's voice in "Winnie the Pooh" comics) and Blocker (son of Dan "Hoss" Blocker from TV's "Bonanza"). <br /> <br /> But the two that stand out in my mind are Furst (from "Animal House") and superdude themselves - Eddie Deezen. Furst plays a baddie this time and has one of the best scenes when he asks his father: "Why can't you just accept me for who I am?" His father looks over his overweight, dull frame and gives a simple word response - "Yuck!" <br /> <br /> And Deezen ... well, he's a show in itself. As one last day Jerry Lewis stumbles around, ventures through mini-golf ponds, puts melon halves on his ears and ends up having Maggie Roswell fall for him. My hero. <br /> <br /> With regard to the movie, it is typically the early 80's stupidity with college children staying after the curfew and embarking on a city-wide scavenger hunt to prove which division of students is best on campus: Jocks, nerds, rich children, feminists or the group consist of a little of each. <br /> <br /> Who wins? Who cares, you will have fun watching Disney Pictures' first foray in the PG territory before creating Touchstone Pictures. <br /> <br /> Seven stars. Catch "Midnight Madness" as you can! <br /> <br /> Long live Leon!
