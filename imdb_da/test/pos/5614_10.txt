As you can tell from the few comments posted here - mine may well be the last thing you want to see unless there is a great DVD release or TCM playing it again! - This is a kind of "Our Gang" movie with a bunch of different children. MGM was certainly the musical studio - if the musicians, dancers and singers were not under contract, they were in print. Heifetz was one of the most expensive ..... it makes it a small charity work !!! The fee he received in that era was unheard of. Another musical film by Jose Iturbi (Mexican pianist) played about 100 children playing some simple tunes of 100 pianos ...... so the skeptics who think small children are not musical fail: I was one. <br /> <br /> As everyone writes, "Frankie Smith" - good-American name - (Gene Reynolds) was the bad, but good-looking, kid concerned about the streets of music school owners. Can you believe that Walter Brennan ("Prof. Lawson") of all Western films was the man who drove in school? Joel McCrea ("Peter McCarthy") and Andrea Leeds ("Ann Lawson") were the larger stars in "They Must Have Music" with a wealth of well-known extras (many of which went on to become stars in their own rights). As others have commented, almost all the children in the orchestra (actually The Meremblum Symphony from Los Angeles) made great successes in their lives, either as musicians (for the studios) and other businesses. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are not so many youth orchestras today - a sad mistake. Parents with children in school are usually so busy trying to keep their heads over water, and many do not even know what is happening to the children at school. Music lessons can be expensive, and almost everyone would prefer a soccer team ..... <br /> <br /> This is the cheapest concert by Jascha Heifetz you will ever hear contained in this movie. .... these days a quarter. His game is brilliant even though he looks as though he'd rather be somewhere else ..... numb. By appointment, every concert from Yo-Yo Ma is so happy, that you want to run straight out and buy a cello ..... this guy is well .... like the kids in the "street" concert when they hoodwink Heifetz plays at their school. <br /> <br /> All the orchestra figures were played by the "kids" and they do it happily. I love this type of movie - their plot is so simple, it doesn't take you two days to find out if you've enjoyed - or understood - the movie at all. We need some new movies like this - can't help but inspire younger kids to play instruments other than guitars ....... Bravo!
