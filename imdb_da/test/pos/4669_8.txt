Here's another pleasant surprise. When I hear a movie being restored, I crawl. Films like Gone in Sixty Seconds, and Jackal Day, are being restored, and the results are less than stellar. So when I heard that "the Italian job" was recreated, I expected it to be bad. I had the opportunity to calm down, read some reviews and finally watch the movie, and was proven wrong. Granted, it's not original and predictable, but it's probably fun. From start to finish you are taken on a very fun trip. The scenes with Minis are great, and the characters actually enjoy themselves. <br /> <br /> So while there are some mistakes, who cares as long as it's fun? <br /> <br /> All in all, 8 out of 10. The only lost points are maybe the few details and a little lack of realism. But you want so much fun that you don't even have the opportunity to stop and notice.
