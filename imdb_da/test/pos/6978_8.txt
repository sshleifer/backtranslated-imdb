Early Coppola with sublime molding that most people never saw (a shame). There are some wonderful things going on in this - Shirley Knight's best performance (an underrated actress), a late 1960s road trip, James Caan very reluctant and moving, Robert Duvall in a part he was born to play (edgy, lonely, motorcycle politician) and a touching script with the F. Coppola rear wheel. <br /> <br /> If this had been done five years later by some no one would have been a smash (so much for timing). Anyway, I recommend it to all people who do not need outer space explosions and bad mother-in-law or a million dollar budget to sit for a few hours and see a story unfold. Give this one a try if you can find it!
