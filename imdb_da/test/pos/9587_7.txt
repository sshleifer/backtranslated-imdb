Tiny Tweet and Sly sneak are locked up in cages for a train ride to who knows where. Swinging Tweety starts belting out a delayed song as soon as the train leaves the station, so we hope Puddy Tad gets him this time. Sly tries out a few funny hand tricks, but destroys the sports man's man puts the bird in a safer place among the luggage. The cat's next attempt has him in the steam engine's coal furnace. And the hunt is on. Of course, there is also a bulldog, and stupid Sly just can't keep his big mouth closed. <br /> <br /> Next up, the persistent pussy tries the old stacking-of-the suitcases-bit (twice) that produce a payoff Tex Avery would be proud of. Unfortunately, Sylvester seems to be everywhere. He even shows a talent for shifts and produces huge clubs from his back pocket. Not even Sylvester's ability to run from a speed drive can save him when he is thrown away, Silver Streak style, several times in a row. Arriving at Granny's new place, (Gower Gulch, population 86), the cat's last attempt involves cross-dressing. But you know what happens to men in dresses, they always get more attention than they negotiated. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
