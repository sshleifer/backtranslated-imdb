This show was incredible !!! I've seen all three and this is the best. This movie has excitement, a bit of romance, stunts that will blow your mind (GO BOBBIE), great characters and amazing places. Where was this filmed? Will there be more? I really liked the story with his brother. Looking forward to Chameleon 4 and see how the world is rescued once again.
