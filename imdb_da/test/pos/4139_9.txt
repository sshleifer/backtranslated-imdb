What a great movie! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950s. Although I never cared about Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the movie is, but at least mostly assume it's accurate, making the movie more interesting. The music in the whole movie just adds pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change anything in this movie, it was all good! What a difference in the stars from the 50s to today's music stars. How can you compare a person like Buddy Holly to Justin Timberlake? or any of the other popular singers of this generation?
