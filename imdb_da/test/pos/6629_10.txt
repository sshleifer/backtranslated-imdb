Being a big fan of Bergman, I had to search literally years to find this movie (at a price less than $ 60 I mean) and finally bought it a few weeks ago. The basic principle of Bergman's film is the relationship between the characters and how they handle experimental situations. This movie is therefore the same, but it is different because the setting is very different from most Bergman movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> It's set in wartime, and the heroines are trapped in the middle. <br /> <br /> It nitrates from start to finish, and it shows once again that Liv Ullman is one of the best actresses of the 20th century. One should see.
