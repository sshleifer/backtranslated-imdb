This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our modern world. The social criticism of our low commercially oriented values ​​is what makes this movie an extraordinary vision of the "war is hell" cliché, underlined by a mythical journey that is higher than Cambodia, by a special force captain whose mission is to remove (with extreme prejudices) a rogue colonel who has left the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw the Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a deeply mistaken masterpiece. In particular, I found the last segment of the journey with Brando, which encapsulates Conrad's Heart of Darkness, to be quite boring. I finally came to see Apocalypse Now Redux and the errors have been taken care of. Redux makes the film an entire masterpiece, certainly among the top 100 films ever made. Brando's performance now seems to be full and complete, perhaps rather less mysterious, but far more profound. Martin Sheen is brilliant in the heart of one of the best performing ensembles ever assembled. It's great to spot a young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc. In early screen performances suggesting what fine actors they eventually become recognized as. Robert Duvall's work, Fred Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms are greatly enhanced by further footage. If you've never seen this movie, skip the original and go straight to Redux. I wish we could get a Gangs of New York Redux from Scorcese to fill all the gaps in the deeply mistaken potential masterpiece.
