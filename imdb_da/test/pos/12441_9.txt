This film is undoubtedly the clearest example of British humor that the Germans cannot understand. One-liners run violently in a movie spawned one of the greatest series of movies in British cinema history (St.Trinians). The story of bureaucratic incompetence in post-war attempts allows Frank Launder to make the highest talent of all the casting. It's probably the only movie where Margaret Rutherford meets her fight in the Alastair Sim for strong characterization (she still wins). Joyce Grenfell (bless her) and Richard Wattis deserve both names in Dighton's masterpiece of English etiquette and stiff upper lip under pressure. <br /> <br /> No Rutherford / Sim / Grenfell fan would be without this in their collection. Absolutely brilliant. Why 9/10? Only 83 minutes long.
