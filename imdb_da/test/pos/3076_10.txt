"Robin Hood: But in Tights" has not received any respect at all. It was fun! Cary Elwes was excellent as "Prince of Thieves" and David Chappelle, Amy Yasbeck, Patrick Stewart, Richard Lewis and Mark Blankfield as Blinkin all did great jobs. I will never understand the animation against "Robin Hood: Men in Tights", but I know a great comedy when I see one. "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" receives *** out of ****.
