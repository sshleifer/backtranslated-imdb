Seeing both of these films at the same time is not a bad idea to get a sense of early film production and act for the camera's styles. I give the key to Garbo (but not too much) about her naturalness. Robeson is majestic. But his performance is aimed at a large proscenium theater. Something else that struck me was the film's themes of empowerment for women and minorities. There was no movie coming out of Hollywood yet, but it allowed the voice of marginal characters like Anna and Brutus to take the foreground. These were very progressive films for their time. It is quite likely that O'Neill saw the writing on the wall before everyone else did about the future of the United States.
