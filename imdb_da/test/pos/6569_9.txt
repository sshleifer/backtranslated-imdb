"Uzumaki" takes place in a small Japanese rural area where people go crazy. They go nuts over swirls and spirals. The crisis gets worse because people turn into snails and swirls appear everywhere. "Uzumaki" must be one of the most bizarre and original horror movies I've seen. The reason is really smart, and the making scenes are really fun, as the film doesn't take itself seriously. "Uzumaki" is wonderfully photographed and the use of colors is top-notch. The characters are sympathetic and there are probably shocking surprises to satisfy Japanese horror fans. Despite some hilarious scenes, the overall tone of this movie is pretty dark. "Uzumaki" is not as good as "Ringu", "Ju-on" or "Audition", but if you like Japanese horror movies, you will not be disappointed.7 out of 10.
