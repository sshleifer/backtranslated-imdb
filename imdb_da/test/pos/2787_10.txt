This film deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true that I do not know that Klapisch did to reach such a masterpiece ... Absolutely one of my top 5 films. It reminds me of the famous song "This is my life, my life, life is life ..." 10/10
