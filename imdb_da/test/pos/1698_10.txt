Is it full moon tonight? OH! It doesn't matter that they can change when they want cuz of that substance! What did I think about his full moon tonight? Geez <br /> I really like this movie, which is romance, excitement, horror and hot stuff;) I like the first half of the movie when the guy rescues the girl from killing himself by bungee jump and catch her. It was really cool. The setting of this movie is in the city of love, which is Paris in France. The cemetery scenes are nice, it gives you chills without knowing what will happen there or who is behind the walls. The scenes that make you jump out of your room are really cool. Even they got me on those scenes. His friend who died and the girl he killed in the cemetery, but still turns to the protagonist (sorry I forgot his name), was really fun. The actors did a good job plus the makeup crew. That part, when they all celebrate in an abandoned church, I cannot believe that people would, because even though it is an abandoned church, it is still the house of God. I bought this movie a long time ago and I don't regret buying it. I'm a horror movie lover. I give this movie 5 stars out of 6. For those people who are open and love movies like this, try it, you like it.
