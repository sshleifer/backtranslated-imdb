Tim Robbins did a masterful job in managing this movie. I say this because he avoided convention and clich√©. He also watched amazing performances by Susan Sarandon (who won an Oscar for her role) and Sean Penn. Even more amazing, Robbins does not patronize. He just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewers' mind. This is so effective because it allows viewers to form their own opinions on the death penalty, one of the most controversial issues of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in either direction. I can't recommend this movie enough, 9/10.
