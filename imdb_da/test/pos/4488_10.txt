It seems that there are two kinds of people in the world: those who believe that "Five characters" is one of the best episodes in the series and those so cool that they know it sucked because they were so clever and already anticipated "lame" twist at the end (which apparently in their little mind is the only reason why Twilight Zone exists: coming up with twists). There are lots of lame episodes in the series and I am not one to evaluate all TZ episodes ten. But this one is definitely one of those who deserves such a rating. It is claustrophobic and colorful. The excitement is built up and we cannot wait for the revelation of the secret at the end. But whatever is secret, what these people are, it's not really something. Most of the beauty of the episode is to lead it up. It would be just as powerful if we never found out what these strangers really are in a strange place.
