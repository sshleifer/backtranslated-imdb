This is the best TV series for kids (and adults) ever. John Hurt is a great actor, with many excellent performances for many years, but he was born to play the narrator. The scripts for almost all episodes are great craftsmanship, and the productions run the emotional fields, which are alternately fun, sad, happy, exciting and always exciting beautiful. It's hard to pick a best episode from so many good contenders, but the "Soldier and Death" with its timeless patos is invincible. It's a series to see with your kids over and over again.
