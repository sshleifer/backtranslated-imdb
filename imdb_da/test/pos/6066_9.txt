We have just seen the last series shown on the SBS network and will miss our weekly dose of Danish Delight. My wife and I accepted the show after the Swedish show "The Eagle" was finished, and it seemed to be a very bad replacement for our then favorite show on TV. The week of the week the show grew on me, and although it was not as shiny as the Swedish show and clearly gritier with regard to their investigations of everyday crimes, it certainly provided a very satisfactory weekly serving meal. <br /> <br /> Before these 2 shows I had not really been a fan of the cop genre and can not say I am now, but the 2 Scandinavian shows really gave us an insight into life in the northern euphoric countries through the eyes of their special police units.
