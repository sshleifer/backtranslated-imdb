.... but at the same time some of you think about "Am I ready for what I should see?" <br /> <br /> In the end, you're glad you saw it. At least I was. Jackass number two has twice the laugh and twice the action. Some stunts will leave you breathless. Besides Little Miss Sunshine, I think it was the best movie I saw this summer. Maybe even this year. <br /> <br /> In addition to a few such as Chris Raab and Rake Yohn, the whole cast returns. I don't think any of the cast members had a dull moment. Each stunt was either fun or dangerous or a combination of both; Stupid. The beginning was just as fun as the first, and the end was interesting fun; the cast performs a track. <br /> <br /> Jacket number two is the perfect movie to watch with your friends. Stay under the credits, there are some beautiful fun moments. One involves Luke Wilson.
