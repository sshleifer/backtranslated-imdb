The basic premise for Flatliners is quite simple. Several medical students sat down at the deathplace to find out what the brain is doing under the facts. It sounds like something a mob of bored students would do for a joke, but it forms the basis of some scary substances. In today's world, where Hollywood has to remind foreign markets of the ideas of making a horror movie, Flatliners is one of the rare gems that shows Hollywood can do something different when trying hard enough. <br /> <br /> What differentiates Flatliners from a lot of movies based on this premise that would come out today is that it doesn't bend to be discouraging or arrogant. Flatliners recognize that people go to movies to be entertained, not moralized to. In this form of supernatural thriller, the difference in this limitation is truly incredible. What's even more amazing is that Julia Roberts appears without being annoying or demonstrating that she can only play Julia Roberts. The theory of obscurity that performing artists do their best work with the smallest audience applies here. <br /> <br /> The subgroups on what the characters find under their losses on virtually everything that makes them alive and how it comes back to intrusion at their present time are surprisingly well done. The moments when William Baldwin's character finds his personal videotape collection coming back to haunt him are especially exciting. That William Baldwin seems so perfectly cast in the role says a lot either about the manuscript or the direction. I'm not sure which one. <br /> <br /> By contrast, Kiefer Sutherland really shines like the lead. You really feel to him as the mystery of what past experiences go into the present and why unfold. When Kevin Bacon's character goes to find an old school pier whose life he made hell and tell her how sad it is, it becomes clearer what the movie is about. We can try to change the past as much as we like, but that is what we do with the present that matters most. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of Flatliners is how it achieves an atmosphere without the use of expensive, elaborate visual effects. Quite unusual for what is really a horror movie, Flatliners didn't use his budget in places where it didn't need it. Much of what we see under the more surrealistic sequences is a case of professional pretense, simple trick photography or stock footage. Sometimes the simplest things are the best. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the movie, it feels like ten minutes short. The end seems more perfunctory than decisive, as if someone in the studio asked the instructor to unpack the film so that they can bring it out at a particular market's time. Of course, many films have been left behind by sore spots for this reason, so Flatliners should not really be different. The hundred and fifteen minutes we get are very satisfying, but not too brilliant. <br /> <br /> I gave Flatliners a seven out of ten. It works well as a date flick or a kind of late-night popcorn movie. Apart from that, it makes a good reminder that low budget horror shows were not always sad sources.
