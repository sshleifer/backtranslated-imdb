I would like to emphasize these excellent points in favor of this movie: <br /> <br /> # 1 Angelina Jolie sex scene <br /> <br /> # 2 Foley artist extinct <br /> <br /> # 3 plot was pretty thick <br /> <br /> # 4 DVD contains trailers and chapter stops <br /> <br /> # 5 no animals were damaged in the film <br /> # 6 tribute to leaf runner through out the movie <br /> <br /> # 7 Burning Rubbish Bin <br /> <br /> # 8 Fun Guy Without Leg <br /> <br /> # 9 Voice overs by Jack Palance added a true dynamic element for the movie. <br /> <br /> # 10 Sage Advisor, for example, "When you eat with the devil, bring a long spoon". <br /> <br /> # 11 Angelina Jolie was just 18! <br /> <br /> To sum up: An evening of entertainment was provided.
