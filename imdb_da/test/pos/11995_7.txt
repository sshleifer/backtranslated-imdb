Seriously. If this had been the first Shack movie, it would have been acceptable as fun, silly and greasy. Light satire comments on the class system would make this an enjoyable overnight stay. <br /> <br /> But everyone wants to compare it to the first movie, and maybe it's not fair. The first movie is a cult classic; what could it possibly follow? Nothing. So take this other movie as an independent, and it certainly has its moments. Jackie Mason is entertaining, making his best Rodney wannabe imitation. Is he as good as Rodney? No. Are his lines so good? No. But he's funny. The rest of the throw falls into the queue as being decent, but not outstanding. You recognize faces among the cast and wonder how they came to where they are today. <br /> <br /> The movie is predictable, but not the most in this genre? Again, it's not the best comedy you want to see, but if you like Cannonball Run-type fun, you'll enjoy it.
