PRICE OF HONOR aka PRIS OF POWER is an ambitious western melodrama that is easy on the action, seeking to tell an Old West version of the JFK murder. In 1881, the president travels to Dallas and is shot from a window while he is parading through the city in his cart. Corrupt officials have done the murder and get a humble slave take rap. Our hero, the serious but bland Giuliano Gemma, aims to upgrade the conspiracy. An engaging story, scary for its subject, but entertaining despite the fact that it is fatal with shoot-up action. The movie is a 7 out of 10, despite the poor presentation of the DVD, which is too dark with poor sound. Look for a good copy.
