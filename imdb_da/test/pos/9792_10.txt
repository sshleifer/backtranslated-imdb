Ever I was a kid, I have loved this movie. I've always been a fan of Joseph Mazzello. the child had pure talent in both this film and Jurassic Park. I've looked for the DVD or VHS to buy in a store near me, I can't seem to find it, I hope it goes on DVD! good anyway good movie. If anyone knows where to find this, please contact me at wrp24@adelphia.net. Also, anyone can really explain what happened to the bobby. Was she real or was he false, and was he a fantasy friend and his escape? lol i am clueless. My favorite part was to be sure where they made the monster night and wasted it all in the kitchen, it was fun, but also a sad part also because of what happens to the bobby because of the mess. I wanted to have seen the lovers face because he played his part quite well. I think her mother was a great actress, I think she is called Lorraine Bracco or some kind of name like that .. yes that's all, please contact me <br /> <br /> wrp24
