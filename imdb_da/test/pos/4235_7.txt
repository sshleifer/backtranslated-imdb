The movie does not take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead, you need to have fun (as long as you don't mind your murders really bloody and your scarecrows were topped with extra cheese)! <br /> <br /> This movie looks at all the horror fan and then gives them the finger. It knows it sucks, and because of that, it's by far the best of the "Child's Play" series. <br /> <br /> The "angled humor" angle plays so well, you find yourself more than just laughing at it, but with it. And trust me all the time you laugh, it laughs back atcha. <br /> <br />
