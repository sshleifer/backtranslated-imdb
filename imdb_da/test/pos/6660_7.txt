I have not managed to block this movie from memory, even though it has been two years since I saw it. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong - I've long forgotten the main story - the relationship between Kidman and Law that didn't give me an impression on me, but it was torture scenes in the movie that really hit me. I cried for about two hours right after the wards. <br /> <br /> It never happened to me how people in wartime could take advantage of something as pure as a mother's love. We see several examples of this - in both scenes with Natalie Portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence to keep her son hidden at home. I was shocked by these scenes and will probably never see the movie again as a consequence because the scenes themselves are clearly in my mind. However, I am glad that I saw the movie simply because it has made me more aware of the war gravel and the terrible cruelty that mankind can inflict on itself. <br /> <br /> The blonde albino character has been at the top of my list of most evil bad guys ever since I watched the movie. His terrible snow and lack of any human feelings for the people he tortured really hit a nerve. At some point I wanted to get up to the cinema and kill him (see the film pushing me over the edge of the plot, it only happened after me that I would only hit a big screen - showing the power and intensity of the film at least ). <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie to its pure experience, not to the rooted love story, but to the way it shows war without the need for a battlefield.
