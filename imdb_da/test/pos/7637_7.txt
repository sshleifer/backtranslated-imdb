"Cherry" tells of a naive, unmarried virgin who decides to have a baby, but is not quite sure how to go about it. This easy little sleeper is full of quirky characters and heavy-in-kind situational humor. Fresh, fun, mold breaking stuff, I happened to really enjoy this flick ... for what's worth it. Recommended for lovers of romantic comedy who want something else.
