* May contain Spoilers * <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was about 8 years old. Now I'm 17 and still look at it when I get the chance for it. "The Aristocats" was a sweet heart warming movie that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs on it, especially the one the kittens sang at the piano. In fact, I even sang in a talent show with my sister and friend when I loved it so much. All three kittens are so cute, and their mother is one of the most beautiful cartoon cats I've ever seen. The Ally cat had a good voice! <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when the kittens play the piano. That part is adorable. I also enjoy their journey home. It's incredible. This is one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen and one of my favorites. Everyone should see it. I give this movie 10/10 stars.
