I was fortunate enough to recently see Ingrid Bergman's name associated with a movie I had never seen (or even heard of) at the AMC. What succeeded. <br /> <br /> To marvel at her flawless and hassle-free performance is not the only reason to quit late and watch this movie. The script is wonderfully comical and the performance is excellent. Walter Mathau (not my favorite) was almost perfect and Goldie Hawn (surprisingly) was fantastic. Tender at times, demanding, so just plain slut. There are times in the movie that even the most hardened movie viewer will be caught up in the story and forget that it is a movie. <br /> <br /> It was great to see Bergman stealing a dance scene from a 20-year-old population. She is effortless in her return to the screen (aged 54 years). The molding was great and the lines ... the lines are exquisite. <br /> <br /> A top 5 romantic comedy of all time.
