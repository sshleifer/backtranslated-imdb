"Nagisa no Shindobaddo" or "Like Grains of Sand" is an amazingly beautiful story of teenage boys and girls who are concerned with becoming one with whom they are. This movie is not about homosexuality, but it is about sexuality. <br /> <br /> Aihara, a secluded girl, will surely make viewers consider who is behind the maid. Does she love yoshida Or does she love Ito? Or did she somehow become a lesbian because of the "incident"? (I doubt it). <br /> <br /> And what about Yoshida? Is he aware that he loves Ito in the end? Now we all know that he loves him as a friend. But you will never know when you watch this movie ... haha ​​:) Finally, Aihara (along with Ito) gives an excellent message to the audience: which means nothing if you love a boy or a girl. And I have to tell you, I'm so close that I didn't get it first. ^^ ;; It's because of all the talking scenes ... You have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and NOT of what they say (especially the last part ... whew, boy, it was confusing!) It's a confusing story, but it's still beautiful. :) This movie is definitely one of the best Japanese movies I've ever seen (and trust me, I've seen lots).
