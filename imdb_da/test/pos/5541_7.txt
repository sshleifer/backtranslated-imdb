I'm not a fan of this brand of comedy - stereotypical signs over-acting their way through a policeman and robber farce. But there are probably nice signs to maintain interest. Michelle Pfeiffer is cute, but the person who really carries the movie is Dean Stockwell, who steals every scene as the main champion (called Tony, not less). <br /> <br /> In fact, Stockwell's performance is why I am writing this review (and the only reason I would recommend it). You become the source of his screen time. He plays the puzzler perfectly, with comical touches in the right places, and avoids becoming an indulgent clich√©. In fact, Stockwell is a complete joy to watch - a master of "double take" and a real "looker" in the classic suits and fedoras. <br /> <br /> Meesa says: A good movie to watch while folding clothes or eating leftovers.
