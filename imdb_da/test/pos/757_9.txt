If you love the drive-in cheeze from the early 70's, you'll just love this one. How could you go wrong with a low budget film about bloodshed in a lunatic asylum? You can not! Crazy people and sharp objects are always an entertaining combination. <br /> <br /> The movie looks like it was shot in a person's house for about $ 320.65. For me, just advertising to see this kind of thing. Gore is a little mild compared to others of this ilk, but there is enough to keep us bloodthirsty sickos (like myself) happy. Some horror movies pull in parts and let you wait for something to happen. This is not the case here. The characters are entertaining enough to make each frame quite entertaining. There is never a dull moment from start to finish. The mind melts climax at the end, which is just incredible. I liked it so much that just after the final credits I saw it again. It is an absolute must for any self-respecting drive-in horror utility. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 on Drive-in Freak-O-Meter ... required viewing <br /> <br /> Yes I love you .. I love you ... now take your Thorazine and put your clothes back ... thank you .... 8)
