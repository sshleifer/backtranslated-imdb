This movie is excellent! On this date of the APR, 8, 2007 it was on the on demand from show time. It's been a while since I've seen it, but Thomas Jane has the first role I saw him in. Initially, you see a normal guy who seems like a kind of henpecked, with a wife who seems to be close to walking his own way. The directors I have just seen have an opening scene that is cool. Paulina Porizkova is dressed as a cheerleader type, looks very fresh and warm. Trying to buy a coffee late at night without small bills getting busy in a hurry, Paulina shows that her name on her letter jacket is the right deal. The meeting with his old roadmate Nick, played by Aaron Eckhart, was cool for the first time, and he even lent him his wife's car to take care of a business. Then he stains a silver portrait, and the day changes for the weird and violent. There is a casting of real characters that parade through the next scenes. But Paulina's Dallas steals the show, I think. Her story of a Casey story to the doctor who is there to get a personal interview in an adoption application is outrageous. As a rule, I have never thought that tall women were so sexy, but as with any rule, there are exceptions. Paulina is never seen before in film. Sexy and mortal, as in one movie with Tom Selleck, but with a never seen before evil. If you're looking for movies to add to your collection, it's worth the price here. Paulina in the key is the price alone, but this story has everything you hope you have. Love, friendship, sex and violence in a wonderful mix. When I first saw it years ago, it ran into my mind, and I know you will feel the same.
