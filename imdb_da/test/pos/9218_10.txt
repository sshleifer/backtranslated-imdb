This was the very first movie I ever saw in the theater by myself. I was 7 years old, and to this day it is one of my favorite movies. It is pure smarmy cheese. The cartoon was marketed to young girls selling dolls with soft bodies and large plastic heads, one for each rainbow color, with their own special animals, "sprites" and even a talking rainbow horse. Typically for the time period, each show was about how hope, coherence and magic can make everything all better. <br /> <br /> The movie is about the coming spring when all the light and color returns to the world, but this time it just hasn't happened to our lovely hero. A spoiled Princess suddenly takes over the soul's light (and implied life-giver) of the universe, which happens to be a giant diamond, for her own eradicated purposes regardless of reality, and now Rainbow and her newly found friends Orin, Onyx and Chris will save the universe. As I said before, it's cheesy, but it's cute, and like all the other cartoons of that period, like the CareBear movies, Strawberry Shortcake, Rose Petal, and Smurfs. All movies created to sell dolls for children. And it works. :)
