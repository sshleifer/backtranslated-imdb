See, we rated this a 10 on entertainment value. It's a comedy safe, not an epic like the Lord of the Rings or Gone with the Wind. Still for comedy, especially these days, it's a 10. <br /> <br /> Not a long movie, moving fast and easy. Kelsey Grammar at home, this role as a loose but brilliant captain of a diesel part against the US Nuclear Navy in a war game, designed to see if terrorists could get a nuclear bomb through our defense. (a little ironic this plot ... before 911) Don't take this issue seriously because most of it laughs from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is the 2nd command (like "Frank Burns") and draws many laughs. All the others are also perfect for their parts. Rip Torn and Bruce Dern. Look easy and simple, you have 90 minutes and need a laugh or pick me up and you are not a prude (their is some language and insinuation) so rent it or buy it (we did) and enjoy! I wish they would do a part 2!
