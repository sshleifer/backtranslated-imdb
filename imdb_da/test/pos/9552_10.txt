This movie is my favorite comedy all the time, and I've seen many comedies. First of all, I shouldn't have this movie had a script. Just a storyboard. The dialogue is almost entirely written by the actors. What makes this movie absolutely everykical.The cast is one of the best comic ensembles you will ever see. The story is about the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia and some of the participants in it. Parker Posey shines and is absolutely amazing! This is one of the movies that most of all comes from the absolute pathetic character of the characters. ***** / *****
