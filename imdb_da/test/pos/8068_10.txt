While it may seem a bit bizarre to see a 32-year-old woman playing part of a 12-year-old, Mary Pickford soon gets you to forget about the imperfections and just enjoy the fun. <br /> <br /> Mary is a street kid in New York City, with her own beloved gang of evildoers whose attention is engaged by Elder William Haines (he was 25 at that time and right after his own screenplay). <br /> <br /> To give away too much of the plot would not be fair. It is probably that Mary is fun to watch and shows well why she was Hollywood's first and most beloved superstar. The production values ​​are very good, with lots of extras that make the NYC street scene completely credible.
