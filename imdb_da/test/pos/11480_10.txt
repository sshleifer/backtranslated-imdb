I consider this movie as a complete masterpiece - in fact, I consider it to be Fernando Fragata's best work and no doubt the best of all Portuguese films. I don't think you can come across such a "zero budget" kind of movie as impressive and amazing as this one. <br /> <br /> The direction is done with perfection at an incredibly fast pace, and the music also composed by Fragata is mostly excellent. The story is scary and humorous at the same time, and it is certainly an advanced study of the old saying "Misery loves company" kind of situations intertwined with a mindless mystery. A more than perfect recipe for gluing the viewer's eyes to the screen from frame to last. <br /> <br /> It's been called Neo-Hitchcock and I agree. Like the best Hitchcocks, it kept me guessing throughout the movie, and most of my assumptions were far for what ends up being revealed smartly.
