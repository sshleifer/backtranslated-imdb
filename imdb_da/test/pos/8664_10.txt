The Crispy Man is one of the best movies all the time and is about a man trapped in a world where there are no senses, no emotions, no love, no truth, and absolutely no freedom. A world where people are scared when someone speaks their minds, expresses themselves or shows love, a world where no one is free, and no one has any idea what the meaning of any of these is. Just as the world we live in, the world of the Crispy Man is a world of lost souls trying to be fulfilled, but focusing on the complete opposite of what fulfills them, materialism, social acceptance and mediocre satisfaction. <br /> <br /> The Frantic Man deserves the full attention of any human soul, because we could all use a new Wake Up call.
