As Muppet movies go, it's easy and clear the best. It features lots of cameos of great named comic stars, a solid script and some amazing Disneyesque songs and blends them into the culmination of the best viewing of Henson's talent. The story is basic, and the jokes are many levels to entertain both the adults and the children on which they were marketed, without exposing them to ideologies that their parents might not find desirable. <br /> <br /> This is simply fun, but it is also a well-made, well-written, beautifully inviting classic. It ranks an 8.9 / 10 from ... <br /> <br />.
