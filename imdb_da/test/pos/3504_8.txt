As a person who normally despises Ali G, Ali G Indahouse was absolutely brilliant. When I saw it, I was in a hysterical fit. Yes it is sexist, rude and extremely raw, and I loved it. Since some comedies only have one or two comic scenes, this movie was grin-a-thon. I've never seen a comedy as an original like Ali G Indahouse. For a comedy with Ali G, it would be worth an 8 out of 10. Absolutely Brilliant.
