Having read more than my fair share of reviews for a large number of different movies, I have noticed a certain trend, people are hard at judging what they are expected to see. I expect you to go into a movie that is not open and you do not expect anything safe, but you will have better feelings about it, so if you try to see but have preset standards, you will reach it. <br /> <br /> Since I'm not trying to be hypocritical, I saw this movie with a very clean slate and open mind and was very happy about it. Since it's not a mainstream title or award winning for that matter, I didn't quite know what to expect, but in truth I enjoyed it much more than Ninja Scroll. Lovely animation, deep story and the always happy ninja hack-n-slashing combined very well with one of my personal favorite animations ever made. I do not promise that you will enjoy it but just give it a try and you can come out with a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> - "Before you speak, be sure what you want to say, will be more beautiful than the silence" - Chinese proverb
