"Showtime" falls somewhere north of what some critics have said, and a little south of what I had expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro coming together for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As "real life" crimes or police go - and plot, for that matter - it's pretty illogical, but duh --- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial photography and skyscrapers spray up were present, but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiring and exaggerated. 9/11 sensibilities aside for myself, all the pyro-techno hyper-effect things had become really old the last few years. It seemed like a substitute for characterization, history and engaging emotions. I hope the smaller amount of it in "Showtime" is an indicator of a trend in Hollywood. A downward trend, with less use of the silly, lesser use of the exploding building. <br /> <br /> Di Niro and Murphy are two of my favorites. Their screen presence and charisma - and even their depth of character - have been "a joy to see" for many years. It cannot be dismissed here --- they are engaging actors and entertaining and appealing in this movie. I can't put my finger on it, but maybe the explosions, the exaggerated FX, and it all diminished the final product ??? Perhaps, or perhaps it was something else, or a combination of factors that gives the feeling that the film did not reach its highest potential. Whatever it was, "Showtime" was entertaining - I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out - but I had a vibe that nonetheless wasn't all it could have been. At least not everything I had hoped for. <br /> <br /> Very good movie, but not a good movie. I gave it an 8 out of 10.
