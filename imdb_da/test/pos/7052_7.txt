As a young teenager when this came out, I was totally related to it. As an adult in the current sex-occupied American culture, it does not have enough nudity to be called pretty. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for American Pie-type infinity, vulgarity, or speed and feces jokes, Meatball's buzz will be with impunity and a guarantee. <br /> <br /> If you like Bill Murray and you like good fun, you will probably like and enjoy this movie a lot. Also with Stripes, Ghostbusters, Caddy Shack, etc. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say, just go see it and stop intellectualizing it. It's meatballs to cry aloud! Why read a review? Just enjoy it and have fun. And ignore the trash from others. Movies, like so many other things in life, are subjective. To each their own. <br /> <br /> Always beware of the 'expert' who reduces the taste of others.
