I watched this movie for the first time recently. If you ask me, it doesn't get the credit it deserves. It's a bit like American Pie meets Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but with more depth. It handles the same problems as both movies, but in a way that contains some grain of truth. The end is sad, but such is life. I think everyone should see it. I have it on DVD and it took so long to find it too. It has to say something, heh and another thing I want to add is that it is quite difficult to find the soundtrack. I think they stopped it, but the soundtrack to this movie is amazing. It has songs by artists like The Commodores, U2, Devo, REO Speedwagon, The Cars, KC and Sunshine Band, and many more.
