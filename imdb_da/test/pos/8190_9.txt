Based on the actual event, this epic is set in the year 221 B.C and tells the true story of uniting China. Actionful and full of intrigue, passion, betrayal and unforgettable battle sequences, it was my attention all the time despite its 160 minute length. King, Ying Zeng, played by Li Xuejian is obsessed with the seven kingdoms of China and becomes his first emperor. His girlfriend, Lady Zhao, played by the beautiful actor Gong Li, devises a plot where she will travel to the nearby kingdom of Yan to set up a false murder trial, which will give the king an excuse to invade Yan. But she falls in love with the murder, as the king becomes increasingly ruthless. There are subplots and tragedies and constantly loud drama. There are scenes of great beauty and abundance of cruelty. There is great filmography and brilliant use of physical space. <br /> <br /> The deep characterization made me think of Shakespeare. And tragic events that remind Greek drama. And yet it is quite Chinese, as it is about old questions about whether the ends justify the funds. And raise the questions of life and death and good and evil and all the blurred edges. It is the story of individuals against the background of history, a story that has shaped China for the past two thousand years. I was swept up in history as well as the moral issues raised. There is no easy answer, and this was one of the strong points of the film. <br /> <br /> Recommended. But be prepared for violence and doings. <br /> <br />
