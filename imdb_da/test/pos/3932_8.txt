I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! Having seen sneak tops for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (bumpy 6/10) I enjoyed this much more! As seen in the trailer, a knock I had thought was that a whole city could be "forgotten", but it is a cheesy popcorn horror movie, so I accept it for what it is. <br /> <br /> My only major complaint is I assumed that Paris Hilton would touch wax or be dipped, etc. and moan "it's hot" but they didn't (how could they resist ???) . There is no nudity from 2 girls even though Paris looks great in underwear! I'm surprised they didn't put a third "hot token victim" in the movie for some superfluous nudity, which is the norm for this type of flick! I will not list any death or plot spoilers, but I will say that Paris and Eliza both get cleaned up well! The characters are developed decent and are similar (not like Cabin Fever where you wanted them to die), and the movie has a decent pace, though nothing happens in the first 30 minutes like most horror movies. <br /> <br /> I give it an 8/10 as it delivered good scares and gore and I had low expectations to go into it. If you go with some friends who look like a cheesy horror movie, you're fine. <br /> <br /> Noah
