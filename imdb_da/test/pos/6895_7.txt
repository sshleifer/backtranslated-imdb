I sell the dead is a big, sloppy horror comedy that refuses to take care of seriously. This has advantages and disadvantages. The 85 minutes of the movie breeze know and the movie is full of bits, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes gory, occasionally all three at once, but the individual bits are much better than the sum of the movie's parts. The story, as it is, follows professional tomb robber Arthur Blake (played by Dominic Monaghan). Arthur's criminal Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden) has just had his head cut to murder, and Arthur has one night left before his own head is lost for the same crime. Arthur insists he is innocent of murder, but there are plenty of other crimes he is willing to confess when he was coded with Irish whiskey by a Catholic priest (played by Ron Perlman). Since the film is a series of grave anecdotes confessed by Arthur, it becomes a kind of horror anthology - a series of heterogeneous narratives, all linked by a similar cast (Arthur and Willie) and a similar theme (burial). Like most horror antologies, there is no coherent mythology, because all mythologies are true and occur simultaneously, even when they are in conflict with each other. It probably didn't help me see this movie the same night as Trick 'r Treat, a horror anthology that avoids all the traps I sell the dead fall into. In fact, Trick' r Treat, designed as an anthology, tells a more comprehensive, coherent story than I sell the dead, which is meant to be a unified tale. The second problem with the movie (and I acknowledge this is crazy picking) is the way the movie plays fast and loose with the story. Grimes is killed with a guillotine. We might stretch a point and say he's killed by a Scottish maiden, a precursor to the French guillotine, but the Scottish maiden was abandoned in 1709, and this film is set well over a hundred years later, since Burke and Hare are mentioned and they were executed for murder in 1829. Tombs that robbed as an industry became obsolete with the Anatomy Act (1832), so that the film must take place before then. <br /> <br /> I know that this brings with it the ultimate in historical geek, and we have managed to deal with a universe where every possible dead, undead, and legendary death is possible, but the easiest way to Anchoring a fantasy to convince the public to suspend their disbelief is to use something real and authentic to spot the imagination out. And it's not like the story of digging robbers or body fishermen or rebels (calling it like you like) is a dull story. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating thing is that writer.director Glenn McQuaid clearly knows the story, especially the good bits. As an example, when Grimes first takes Arthur as his apprentice, he correctly explains to Arthur that those resurrectionists do not steal the clothes from the dead because stealing corpses is a misdemeanor punished with a small fine while stealing clothes is a crime. punishable by expulsion or possibly even death. So you'd expect Wille and Arthur to strip the body at this time (and for the rest of the movie), but of course they don't. You can blame the director for ignoring his author's script but not when the author and director are the same person. My point is not that there should have been many bucknecks in the movie, my point is that if you are going to bring this ghost up into the law and make it clear that Willie and Arthur will follow the law no matter how stupid it is than you have to pursue the mindset of its logical conclusion, even if it means that Willie and Arthur turn up chasing a zombie through a cemetery trying to tear out their clothes and fill them back in the empty coffin so they don't being deported to steal the clothes of the running otherwise not overhearing the case. <br /> <br /> Historical nerd aside, I sell the dead, is worth renting as a small but fun scary movie that could have been much more.
