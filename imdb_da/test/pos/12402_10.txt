I just saw the DVD version of BORN BAD and found it to be tense, gritty and near the end of the graphic for the faint of heart. Justin Walker (Clueless) and Corey Feldman are in superior performances. For a low budget film, this image delivers. The depth of character and clever dialogue are two things that are not normally seen in a Roger Corman image. Check it out on DVD!
