Having seen only once and at dawn, I can't forget this haunting movie. A mixture of mystery, excitement and heartbreaking romance reminds me of Vertigo. The actors, but not so well known, are good especially Joan Hackett in one of her best performances. You believe in her in her love in her new beginnings of freedom brought by her love, and finally in her overwhelming pain. The ground is brilliant and convincing and does not extend credibility. The direction and technical things could probably be better, but they do not compromise the overall effect. And it has a message: don't let revenge blind you, you can become his last victim. A real shame it has not been restored, but perhaps it is a period piece better alone.
