Very violent and nicely filmed movie. Paulina is a poorly sexy girl who wants to show that men can also be raped. This movie has lots of black humor. This guy will kill someone just to forget he used to be a gangster. There will be times when you would not know if you should shake or smile and think, "Should I laugh at someone who kills people?"
