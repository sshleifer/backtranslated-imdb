Trilogies are very interesting. Some go out with a button, some become gradually weaker (The Matrix), some are lost in blur (Blade, Back to the Future), but some maintain genius, the seemingly ever-growing bright light that flows over the surface of its flawless exterior. Case and point: "Three Colors Trilogy". This chapter of the trilogy, which is the last, is the most philosophical and thought-provoking. In "Blue" we had a more visually stunning, more character-driven plot. In "White" it was more a light hearted story-driven story, where we listen more to what the characters say than anything else. "Red", however, is focused on "what if" and "how come". It questions our own destiny and focuses primarily on the past and the future than the present. <br /> <br /> This chapter is about a young model running over a dog and bringing him back to his owner. She quickly finds out that the dog's owner is actually a cynically retired judge who spies on his neighbors phone calls through advanced spy equipment. All three films in the trilogies have very basic plot lines, but bring much more to the story. Consider in "Blue" the story of a woman who deals with the loss of her loved ones. We constantly get ideas about modern French society and how it reflects the character of the character. "Red" is not just about a young woman who finds shelter in the life of an elderly person, but it is also about chance, hope and destiny. Irene Jacob stars as Valentine Dussaut, who initially finds the old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant), whom we never find the name of, extremely self-centered and disgusting. Even through self-reflective analysis and her voyeuristic intentions, she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her if he was only 40 years younger. Irene lives with another, younger judge who looks a lot like the old man. This is "what if" that stays in the movie. What if Irene was born 40 years ago? The old one would have been her perfect match. But what if the younger judge is actually her perfect match as he looks so close to the older one. Valentine does not know, we only do that, and Krzysztof Kieslowski subtly suggests this in almost every framework that Irene is in. We are constantly tasted in the face with his presence, almost a proposal for Ireses fate. <br /> <br /> I mention that the old man doesn't have a name for a reason. This is because it is very symbolic of the overall theme of history. We have to compare the old judge with Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit), the younger judge, in more than one way. We learn that the old man once had a person he loved, but she got away. In another scene we see Auguste heartless as the love of his life comes away with another man. There are constant reminders about whether Valentine will ever meet this man. Although they pass each other without noticing every single day. There is also the motive in the phone, for Valentine it is a way to keep fit and update his life, to Auguste that is what leads to his heartache, and to the old it is the only thing he has left. These three elements serve to shadow the signs of one's own psychology. It's a kind of statement about what they are and who they are. <br /> <br /> All three "Colors" films represent a particular principle, most common in France. "Blue" stands for Liberty (the personal being), "White" stands for equality (accepted by more than one), and "Red" is fraternity (to socialize, learn). And although this last chapter is a clear focus on the principle of brotherhood, Kieslowski chooses to bring the two others together to connect all three stories. For example, we see the old man trying to reach Valentine and inform her of his spy equipment, reflecting the principle of equality. In the end, we also see that Valentine makes some soul searches, and that she is more concerned about herself than others (not picking the phone when Michel calls), a clear example of Liberty. And with all three principles established, Kieslowski neatly connects all the characters in the final and most heartfelt scene. <br /> <br /> "Red" is about where you could have been if you were older or younger. It is about whether someone is perfect for everyone and whether a person can change your life or not. The last chapter of the most awe-inspiring trilogy ever made, breaks this movie barrier into both directing and storytelling. It's not just about our modern life, but about where life could and should be in our modern times. And even though the film is more subtle than both "Blue" and "White", it deeply challenges a statement of love and compassion. It is hard to imagine that "Red" was Kieslowski's last film and that he died at such a young age. Nevertheless, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece, and we will always remember him for his work, which goes all the way with Bergman, Fellini and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who has never been awarded an Oscar. Kieslowski, you've been missed!
