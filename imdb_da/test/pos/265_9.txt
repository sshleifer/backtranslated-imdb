A vg Brit rom-com, one to see if you can get your hands on a copy. Quirky and often surprising, this is not the best of Brady's movie (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest), though it has a unique charm. Well written, the story goes into a couple of dead ends, but mostly surfaces with a new plot high. You know from the start how it is going to end, but when it comes it is honest and very open ended, a realistic and credible ending, seemed the end as a beginning, enjoyable and left me to have more.
