I was pretty shocked to see the low rating this movie received here, personally considering the fun family fare. It's about a young teenager, Sandy Ricks, sent by her mother to Coral Key to spend the summer with her uncle's gates. While turning to a dolphin named Flipper. Lots of experiences take place among the predictable nephew / uncle bonding as well as a little romance to Sandy with a local girl. I am a great Crocodile Dundee fan myself so absolutely loved Paul Hogan in his role as crusty and comical uncle gates. Initially, he holds an endless stock of Spaghetti's in his house to serve as his usual meal, heated with a blowtorch! Elija Wood, Frodo of the Lord of the Rings, seemed quite competent to play the young Sandy, a boy initially not too fond of his forced summer vacation locale. <br /> <br /> Of course, the dolphin is magnificent and there are some wonderful underwater scenes. Seen in the Florida Keys, it was apparently taken up in the Bahamas. This adaptation of Flipper makes great family entertainment, a sweet, sentimental and fun movie that is infinitely better than many of the cinematic offers for young people today.
