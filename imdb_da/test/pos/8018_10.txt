While "The Jackal" [remake of the excellent "Jackal Day"] has better aesthetics [and a boatload budget], this film nails the actual persona of "Carlos" down ... <br /> <br /> Quinn excels As Naval Officer admitted to imitating Wiley Jackal to pull him out of hiding and in Kingsley and Sutherland's hands turns out to do so. He takes up the risk of his family, his career and everything he believes in, albeit totally unwilling. <br /> <br /> To say more would spoil it ... this is an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 Niro ~ Stars [of 4]
