Accepted is a 2006 teen girl who stars the guy from Mac and PC ads. The film is about Bartelby .B. Going a guy who has rejected all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who didn't, the problem is hundreds of people joining their school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $ 5.00 on a sale and I have always seen it since. Overall, this movie is a must see for fans of all comedies, as it is fun, witty and just a good movie all the way up. I rate this movie a very fair 78%. GO THE MEASURE MAKE A FOLLOWING GUYS BUT MAKE IT SURE THAT IS NOT CRAFT.
