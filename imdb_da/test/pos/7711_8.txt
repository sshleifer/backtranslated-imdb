This is the fifth part of 'The Animatrix', a collection of animated short films that tells us a little more about 'The Matrix' world. This time, they introduce Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) into a story of a detective employed to find her. With great black and white animation and an interesting story, this is again a great animated card from 'The Animatrix'.
