If you love Japanese monster movies, you'll love this action-packed battle pitting an alien invader who intends to conquer Earth and a "Giant Robot" with a super weapon weapon. The alien, "Emporer Guillotine", from the planet Gargoyle, has an army of fines called (of course) the "gargoyle band" as well as an infinite supply of huge hostile creatures that are routinely resolved on the ground to smash buildings low noise, panic population, etc. Little child named Johnny Sokko has the Giant Robot on his wine call and sends the robot as needed to look up and then blow up those creatures. Johnny joins a group of "good spies" called Unicorn and strives to save the world. <br /> <br /> Despite the campy nature, unintentional humorous dialogue and the fact that the target audience was of course children, this movie has non-stop action, colorful characters, decent special effects, and it just happens to be fun to see. The battle scenes are well done and frequent as the story requires. The good guys and the bad boys both made sure they had an inexhaustible supply of bombs, lasers, ammunition and assault mechanisms. In fact, despite the fact that the film was built from edited episodes of a television series, the plot actually develops and reaches a final conclusion. The film has a positive vision and appeals to everyone's (especially the children's) desire to destroy evil in its many forms. The kids may be the target audience, but it is fun for everyone to laugh at his comical pity; but at the same time, the root of the good guys to rule and "save the world." The action is cheesy in places, but it's the charm: there are several lines of corny dialogue (possibly translation errors or possibly intentional jokes of the filmmakers) and you will find yourself quoting these absurd lines later. <br /> <br /> Clearly, this movie is not high in production quality or budget. But for what it is, campy sci-fi, it's fun for some laughs. I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor for that kind of thing.
