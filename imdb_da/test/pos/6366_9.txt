I agree with the comments already posted on this site by the previous installment. <br /> <br /> I stumbled across this movie back in the 80s when I was employed at a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately, many of the barbs targeted at the psychiatric profession are hit home. I especially enjoyed the end, where the psychiatrist would speak through the door to the hospitalized Grodin. Believe it, it's pretty accurate. <br /> <br /> Of course, the doors of most psychiatric hospitals are not locked, nor have the straightjackets been used these days, and any hospital must be licensed to have a "padded room". But a wonderful underestimated movie, and certainly one that's quite funny. <br /> <br /> Jeff
