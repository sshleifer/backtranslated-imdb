I found this movie to be one of the best for this time and era. The cast was very unusual and most enjoyable for anyone who saw it. I want my younger generation seen this movie, but I haven't been able to find or watch the movie before. My first impression was back in the beginning of the sixties, and I've looked for the whole page. The film showed me the potential for how far we come, go to become a gifted craftsmanship, where we could only have meaningless roles to act as buffoons and servants. <br /> <br /> Porky and Bess showed some of my city's urban life that I saw in the time when I needed good solid male role models. The song and the play made me jump in days and play that part of different characters in this excellent movie.
