This is the follow-up creation for the Better Off Dead. In a competition, the Better Off Dead would win hands-down. But for star power, One Crazy Summer Savage exudes Steve's better script. Problems with a crazy summer (OCS): casting. Better Off Dead (BOD) was thrown so much better. Friendship: OCS shows Cusack, giving hateful appearance to Bill Murray's little bridge. Error on set ?? More outrageous friends in OCS, but more real friends in BOD. The reason was good. You predict some of it, but even the predictable parts go further than you think they could. So even though this is Better Off Dead's ugly stepson, it's worth seeing. See Demi Moore before plastic surgery if there is no other reason. John Cusack fans, you have to see it just to say you have. If you don't like Bobcat Golthwaite, I'm sorry. I don't like him either, but you can't escape him in this. In any case, he does a good job in the film and celebrates another movie monster. Editing needed help on the beach, but for the most part, not much to complain about. Overall, it's good and fun. But try not to compare it with BOD or you will discover it is missing. * Sigh *
