Madonna has rocked the boat for over 20 years, and with that comes great experience - obviously - and much knowledge. She was never the one who thought about yesterday, even though she seemed to know what will be popular tomorrow. She courageously takes all the new trends, technologies and incorporates them into her own actions. Her world tours have never been 'average'. When Madonna performs, she gives 120% - everything is bigger, better, theatrical and meaningful. She takes inspiration from the east, west and makes so unique. Everything is given a deeper meaning, and the Confessions Tour is no different. From the beginning you find yourself sitting on the edge of the chair. She starts with bang, so she makes brave circus make up a horse high in the sky, she does everything she can to entertain you. She recovers her own songs and gives them a modern feel. She sings on a disco cross, she comes almost in the middle of the stage, and with her amazing dance crew who doesn't know any dimensions of fear, the show is more than you bargain for. It's a play, an audiovisual orgasm that can't be put into words. Fortunately, those who actually saw seeing Madonna on stage. Pushing fifty, she's still in an incredible shape. Recently Sticky and Sweet Tour are even more groundbreaking, which shows nothing else that Madonna was, is and ever the only and only queen of pop.
