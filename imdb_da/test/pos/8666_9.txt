Where the hell is Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Sky? Hell? A parallel universe? When the troublesome man comes out of the subway platform and meets a shaking train, his next conscious moment comes on a bus; riding solo, the latest arrival, in a dead netherworld where all suicides go. Dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the bodily biosphere, Andreas was greeted by an official man who treats and transports the cumbersome man from the harsh fluttering to a city whose eyeballs work, a dead ring of city landscapes, which he once inhabited if the memory serves him properly. Andreas retains the appearance of a sleepmaker in a trance, a man who is alienated from people and objects, struggles to find his rents; at home or rather his assigned apartment or at work where the unpleasant man is randomly appointed as the auditor of an independent contractor. Havard (John Joner), his boss, tells him: "You get used to it" covering more than just crushing numbers we suspect in this world, like the old world. <br /> <br /> If life is meaningless, French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre said the same can be said for death. The subculture of the office life can be heaven for a man, but it looks like a hell to us, in the context of "The Brutal Man" operates. Working in the afterlife is essentially working for the rest of your life. The consensus of Andreas' comrades can pass as usual in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates alienation in the viewer as he / she now recognizes the fierceness of white claims made by white claim workers who kill the hours with their inconsistent talk and Designated jobs they perform in a day as automotons, every day seem irrational in their self-evident absurdity. In order to see the daily life rebuilt in a speculative light, "The Crispy Man" makes the normal human interaction as a dead-born comedy, as the quota life becomes a notion that transforms Karl Marx's meaning of the word "alienation", because here are the men and the women In the office, "do" identify with their work, as actors in a game that conspires to make their fictitious self work right. But the troublesome man never fully participates in the facade. He is always aware of the cracks. <br /> <br /> From a wooden bench, Andreas witnesses the succession of a jumper that scares himself on an iron, while people on their lunch break move on, indifferent to his fleeing intestine, creating red splatters on the clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same impassivity from his own co-workers after he deliberately knocked his finger down, hoping he would feel the pain of a paper slice. He doesn't. It's just another sensation, in addition to being able to taste and smell lost to the troublesome man. This inability to take comfort in the simple pleasures reinforces the cumbersome man's need for love, where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner party hosting her boss, Andreas Anne Britt (Petonella Barker) meets. They knocked it off. He goes home. She invites him in. They become a couple. He moves in. When they have sex, however, it is good for neither Andreas nor Anne who seems to get more enjoyment from the decor. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that is unattainable in this world, but love matters to the troublesome man, so he tries again with Ingeborg (Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. "The Busty Man" deconstructs love by presenting its foundations as a series of movements that demand both man and woman beliefs. When Ingeborg does not evoke the same tender feelings for Andreas after her hyper-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but odd city with an openness that is detachable and gives up more interpretations. <br /> <br /> The wound of Ingeborg's apathy against her love for her, the cumbersome man walks into the same subway station, stands on the same platform, learns the same couple aggressively and jumps. This time he can't die. How can you die when you are already dead? Hit repeatedly by train after train, Andrew's face turns into meat; his body performances in angles previously seen only seen in art. When the troublesome man realizes that love and death are incapable, he seeks the man from the club who was willing to say what goes invisible in this city in the dead. It is: death, not life, has no meaning. <br /> <br /> Getting to the bottom of the mystery behind Andreas's residence drives the story, and to the filmmakers' credit, this riddle is satisfactorily addressed in a scene reminiscent of Spike Jonze's "Being John Malkovich" when Andreas crawls through a tunnel to cross over to another world, like a newborn baby, resembling the portal to Malkovich's brain, which Craig Schwartz charges people to crawl through. Andreas' attempt to cross the large division gives a terrific paradox. As heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable border acts as a perfect enclosure of the atheistic belief that "heaven is a place on earth". But at the same time, the sky is proved by the reality of hell; the place that Andreas sent to after being banished from the city by his destination.
