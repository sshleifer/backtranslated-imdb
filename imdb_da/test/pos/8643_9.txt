Originally filmed in 1999 as a television pilot, "Mulholland Dr." got rejected. Next year, David Lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie fit to appear in theaters. He did it - and created one of the greatest, most bizarre and nightmarish films ever made. The movie really doesn't have protagonists, but if there were main characters, they would be Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a perky blonde living in her aunt's apartment while she auditions for movies. She finds Rita in her aunt's apartment and decides to help her. You see, Rita has lost her memory. She has no idea who she is. She takes her name, Rita, from a "Gilda" poster in the bathroom. Saw the two out to discover who Rita really is. <br /> <br /> David Lynch has been known for making some strange films, but this film is the definition of weird. It is bizarre, nightmare and absolutely indescribable. It's like a dream caught on film. In 100 minutes, the movie has become very confusing - but if you have watched it carefully, it will make perfect sense. After watching the movie and then reading an article on the Internet that points to things in the movie, I fully understand the movie. <br /> <br /> It appears to be very good. Watts are amazing. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood director with problems with the local mob. The music is excellent. Angelo Badalamenti delivers one of his finest scores. And the director - hah! David Lynch is as masterful as a filmmaker who ever was there. <br /> <br /> Is this your type of movie? Well it depends. You should probably see more of Lynch's work before watching this movie. You have to be patient with the movie and surely watch it again to download the many tracks Lynch has left throughout the movie. For Lynch fans, this is a dream come true. <br /> <br /> "Mulholland Dr." is a masterpiece. It is brilliant, enigmatic and masterfully busy. I love it.
