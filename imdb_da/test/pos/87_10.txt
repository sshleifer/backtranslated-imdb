It's been years since I've been privileged to watch this movie on TV. I only wish I could contact someone to see it again. I married a man with three children and two had fetal alcohol syndrome. I didn't understand it, but when I watched this movie, I helped to understand more about their problems and more about how to love them and help them overcome their difficulties. My stepson is now 35 and thanks the Lord, he has flourished wonderfully, but still has many repercussions of being born of an alcoholic mother. Every month we talk to Rehab patients with alcohol and drug addiction and this sharing has really made monumental changes in their behavior and strives to start a new life that is not drug and alcohol dependent. Please let me know how to get a copy of VHS or DVD of this movie or when they want to show the movie again on TV. If you haven't been in these shoes, you probably never understand its value. Thank you.
