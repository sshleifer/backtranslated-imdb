I just watched this movie this morning, and I found it to be a great show of the wealth of faith. Babette gave them another way of looking at life; not a replacement but an improvement. She shared everything she had with those who gave the little they had to her. I see the story of God in here. He sent his only son to man. The man could not give anything that would match it. So for our little victim, we get an ultimate treasure and are transformed because of it. In this movie, the bickering townspeople have so consumed with a little interpretation of God. Babette showed them that life and God can really be beautiful in its full sense. The love that the Son of God showed to man is the love we must show each other and our life will be the richer for it. Even the film is a metaphor. It seems slow at first, but investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end. It was really a party.
