Late in the evening on BBC1 I was on my way to bed, but curiosity piqued on a modern set of Irish movies, so I kept looking for a few minutes and then stayed at the end. I must admit that the main attraction was the only English actress, Kelly Reilly, who is great to watch. <br /> <br /> This is billed as a black comedy, which is one of the hardest things to draw. It must be the perfect mix of horror and horrible laughs, so in the end you don't know why you are laughing - for me, Martin Scorsese's After Hours (1985) is the best example. Dead bodies are more black than comedies, but the plot collapses and spirals down toward further darkness. I didn't find the last words in the story that some other posters here did, I was appropriately surprised. <br /> <br /> As a snapshot of the Irish film industry in 2003, it all seems quite worthy; It doesn't look like they used too much to do it, so it had a chance to get the money back. The script could have been much sharper, but the play was pretty good. I'm glad I saw it, mistakes and everyone, I don't think I've learned much about Ireland today, especially their police methods!
