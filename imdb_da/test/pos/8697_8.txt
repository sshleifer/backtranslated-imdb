Absolutely grabs of a movie, and given its age, years ahead of its time. I saw the first of the week my father came home with the neighbor's TV that the guy had thrown on the scrap pile. A tinker with all things electric, father had it for two days. It was July 1955 ... and then it's probably just the third house on the street to have TV! Almost the first thing we have ever seen on the grainy and shimmering old 12-inch screen was THIS movie. "It's pretty OLD dear," I remember my mother telling me! <br /> <br /> Nearly 50 years, and it doesn't seem like older ones - rather like World War I in that respect! Amazing little fantasy of a London omnibus carrying thirteen passengers crashing and killing one of their number. So in flashback we get to the lives of these people and what led them to be on that bus that day. <br /> <br /> Back to the crisis at the end of the movie, the victim's identity is revealed, perhaps the inspiration behind the 1960 movie ADRIAN MESSENGER LIST. <br /> <br /> If you ever come across this little gem, I suggest you see it!
