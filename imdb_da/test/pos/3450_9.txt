Too bad the bad reviewer who did not like this wonderful movie. What a boring life he must lead! <br /> <br /> This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, but it's not dark or predictive as "ordinary people" type movies. It's mostly humorous, but not technically a comedy. <br /> <br /> It all seems a bit like a fantasy, maybe Shakespeare's "Midsummer's Dream". Beautiful, intelligent women are teeming with wonderful filmography and a non-abusive manuscript that doesn't miss a beat. I look forward to seeing it every time this movie resumes on cable. It's like reloading a favorite book.
