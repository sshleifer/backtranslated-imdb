I was extraordinarily impressed with this movie. It's one of the best sports movies I've ever seen. The pictures in this movie are excellent. I love the sequences where the camera jumps the ball as it flies through the air or in the cup. The film moves well and offers both excitement and drama. The kinematics were amazing. <br /> <br /> The performances are great. I was surprised by young Shia LaBeouf. He is good at this role. Stephen Dillane is also good as the exciting Harry Vardon. Peter Firth, Justin Ashforth, and Elias Koteas offer support. The film is gripping and entertaining and for the first time in my life I have actually wanted to see a golf tournament.
