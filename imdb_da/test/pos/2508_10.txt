Director Peter Chan, Manuscript Maria Maggenti. <br /> <br /> Based on the novel "The Love Letter" by Cathleen Schine, director Peter Chans film release, released in 1999, was not a great box office drawing, not even for a romantic movie with some comedy elements. While not so popular in theaters, it soon became a beloved movie on cable TV and on VHS / DVD. Seen in a port city in the good old United States (I forget the exact location), this is the story of a mysterious, passionately written love letter that sparks emotions and confusion among the protagonists, anyone who thinks the letter is personally addressed to them. At the end of the movie, we do not know who the lover or the beloved is, but the letter has changed the lives of almost everyone in the small town. The game is made up of amazing actors who have done well on television and movies, among them Kate Capshaw starring between medieval beauty Helen, a bookstore owner, comedian Ellen DeGeneres as her friend / employee Janet Hall, young hottie Tom Everett Scott as Johnny, the young 20 any guy who falls to the older Hellen and an older Tom Selleck as firefighter George Matthias, who will compete with Johnny for Helen's feelings. There are comoros by the old Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart, best known for contemporary audiences like the older Rose in "Titanic" (1997) and a como by Kate Capshaw's own daughter (with husband Steven Spielberg) Jessica Capshaw. The love triangle is between a medieval woman, an elderly man and a young man, each of whom feels passionate about Helen as the author of the mysterious letter. The conflict lies in Helen's indecision. Will she choose the right person? Which man has the most to offer her? Johnny is in a relationship with a girl, his age, who loves him with a passion all his own, and is actually a kind of reminder of what Helen was like in his age. George is separating his wife and has lived a worldly and eventful life. A cultured intellectual, he takes Helen on an opera date, where the tragic death of Puccini's ultra-Italian heroine Tosca moves Helen to explosive tears. There are lots of beautiful views in the charming coastal town, beautifully reproduced by film photographer Tami Reiker. The result is a paradise of romantic and lovely songs - "I have never been in love before", "I am in the mood for love" and "Only the lonely". Ellen DeGeneres as Janet Hall, who is consistently late in her job at Helen's bookstore, who kills infinitely men without being able to find the right guy, is simply wonderful. She has not lost her comical flair, although at this time in her career she did not perform much on television or film because only about two years before her hit the mid 90s TV show "Ellen" was canceled because of her "get out" as a lesbian and the new lesbian subject of the show. Here you will even find comedian Jack Black, long before he made it big, in a part of a fisherman. This is a moving film about human emotions and decisions that are important, about the human need for a passionate consuming love, and the general love of escapism not only through books, letters and music, but through a genuine loving and secure relationship. This is a fantastic movie with amazing moments and a contagious romantic spirit.
