I surfed through IMDb one day when I stumbled upon "Mr. Wonderbird's curious adventures". Notice how unclear it was, I decided to look for it. Thanks to Digiview, it didn't take me long, so I bought it for a dollar, and when I got home I looked at it, though I have to say I was totally impressed. <br /> <br /> Three of the paintings in a king's apartment, a shepherd, a chimney sweep, and a self-portrait of the king (who are as selfish and sadistic as the king himself) come to life one night while the king sleeps. The shepherd and the chimney sweep escaped while the king's painting calls the police to catch the couple. Fortunately for the couple, Mr. Wonderbird to help them, often with regard to police and the king. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD case describes this movie as "a surreal visual delight and an underestimated entry into the story of classic animation." I couldn't agree more with many backgrounds looking a little bizarre, and many of the characters are weird, including the oppressed citizens of an underground city and hungry lions calmed down by a blind man's music (what kind of looks like Andy Warhol), not to mention Mr. Wonderbird itself is somewhat eccentric. The film is very creative and mostly fun to watch, and the only mistake is that it can go slow. But overall, this movie was very good and it is recommended by your real. <br /> <br /> Degree: B + (Awesome)
