While the songs and dancing numbers are generally not as strong as many would have them, the history and message of the movie is still there and ringed loudly over the simple 70's music tracks. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that this movie was made after the Hollywood musical was almost dead (with few exceptions to rock music), so the audience who went to see the new did not realize the fact that It was a brave attempt at something that had not been done to date. The audience who sees it today will tend to judge it against today's movies and musicals, and perhaps the huge stars of musicals that have passed. But it is an injustice for the film itself to make it into this movie or something. <br /> <br /> There are some good musical moments in the movie. The first one is that of Bobby Van. Mr. Van took his role as Harry Lovett just after closing a 2-year-old Tony nominee (for best actor) ran off the Broadway revival, "No, no, Nanette." He is a song-and-dance man back and forth, honestly, the only one in the cast who was truly talented and experienced for musicals. He never misses a step in his "Question Me An Answer" and rightly so ... he was at home like Harry. Other pleasing numbers are made by Olivia Hussey when she welcomes the new visitors, and while the lyrics are weak, James Shigeta shows his strong voice in the "Family" song, as well as a nicely finished breakdown of the whole piece. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie for what it is ... a fantasy about a place where you never get old, hidden in the ice and snow-covered mountains in Tibet, found by a group of unsuspecting modern people wrapped in battle for any modern culture. Take this and compare it to reality and you get a movie that lacks a goal. But ... take this film to the message of love and peace and quiet and fraternal love, and you get a warm and refreshing message and a positive to it. <br /> <br /> For some, this movie may seem corny to others is a welcome release from the hectic pace of reality. First, you are not trying to judge and just enjoy the message. For the second, you have discovered Shangri-La's secret!
