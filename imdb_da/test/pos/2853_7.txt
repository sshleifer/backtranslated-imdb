Renee Zellweger is a wife wife in Kansas whose dominant husband is mixed in drug trafficking. Two professional hit men - Morgan Freeman and his son, Chris Rock, murder the man in his dining room. Zellweger, observed by the murderers, testifies to this and undergoes a dissociative reaction, assuming the personality of a nurse - the eponymous Betty - which is a sign in her favorite soap opera. Thinking yourself to be the TV character, Zellweger takes out in her husband's car, which has a lot of dope in the trunk and travels to LA, where she hopes to connect with another character in this thoughtless afternoon drama, "Dr. David Ravell", Greg Kinnear. Not aware that she is being persecuted by the two hit men she drives to LA where she manages to link up with Kinnear and is actually entered into the show as a nurse named Betty. A handful of men in the knowledge, including the local sheriff, get hold of what is happening and also seek Zellweger in LA. The ending is trustworthy and exciting. <br /> <br /> If it sounds crazy, it's because it is. And that's the author's responsibility, John C. Richards. The curious thing is that Richards and the director, Neil Labute, with great help from the artists, just about to pull it all out. This is not a plot molded in a familiar shape. Nix. I give it bonus points for pure originality. Someone went on a limb. Someone took a chance on a movie that was not a copy or remake of something that had made money ten years or fifty years ago. I imagine the people involved, down on their knees every night and praying wildly. I do not know if the film was paid, but it is most successful on its own aesthetic terms. That's what can be called an "initial premise" movie. You start with a single transformative event, in this case the murder of Zellweger's husband and her adoption of a whole new personality and realistically follow the resulting logical paths. "Groundhog Day" is another, better and more intricate drawing example. "Nurse Betty" has its logical cracks, where the events give their plausibility. Eg. At a party in LA, Zellweger finally runs into Kinnear, the guy who plays her fianc√© on television. She is anesthetized (after all, she thinks she is Betty who lost her fiance long ago). She approaches Kinnear and a couple of her colleagues and introduces herself as "Nurse Betty", the character. She addresses Kinnear with the name of his television character, "David Ravell." The group is astonished at first and then convinces that she is an aspiring actress who insists on staying "in character" during the conversation - and later, after Kinnear has been fascinated by her and the others bored. Kinnear drives her home, and even when she kisses him well, she's still in character, leaving Kinnear viduning with astonishment in the relentless way she captures the character of Betty. On the next day, Kinnear returns his love. That development, the relationship between Zellweger and Kinnear at this time is a crack in logic, the kind that is absent from "Groundhog Day". At the end of the Night One, Kinnear, like any other, would realize that Zellweger is a few clowns that are not a circus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie, which includes many prints, succeeds beyond expectations. The relationship between Morgan Freeman and his outrageous, nihilistic son is wonderfully spelled out. Morgan is flawless in his exasperation. He manages to fall in love with the image of Zellweger as he picks up traces of her whereabouts and activities, and eventually he cannot bring himself to shoot her. She's too cute to shoot. After her conversion to Betty, she left a note behind in Kansas. "I want to help all life, whether animal, plant or mineral." Who can harm the author of such a confusing connative statement? His admiration of her comes as an epiphany when he is close to one of the floodlights on the edge of the Grand Canyon. Zellweger, dressed as Dorothy, or perhaps the good witch in the east - yes, signs that, like Zellweger, come from Kansas anyway - look to Freeman, and he embraces her and kisses her met. It is a scene that is immediately creepy, romantic and a little scary. I once stood on one of these lights and threw some toasted paper from the dark canyon and found myself surrounded by a thousand swirling bats that had misperceded the fluttering tiles as mills. <br /> <br /> Right. Where was I? Okay. I didn't try to run out of space. Zellweger's performance deserves plaudits. Everything she does, every move, every expression, is naive and preliminary. She is really a nice character - and despite the fact that she is not a glamor girl of Hollywood standards. But what an actress. Compare her performance as the hectic 19th century hiccup in "Cold Mountain". Just the opposite. But then everyone is able to sniff this funny movie. Allyson Jannings does a fine job in a smaller role. Look at her as she tells Greg Kinnear that she is considering killing her character in the soap opera in a drowning accident. Kinnear is one of the narcissists who carry the kind of $ 10,000 thin black leather jackets that were popular at the time. He chuckles and says, "Oh, one of those castaway deals, okay? How am I going to come back?" Jannings doesn't answer. She just smiles at him with the huge blue eyes and increases her head mockingly. <br /> <br /> Not a masterpiece of filmmaking, but a good, original, professional job of all concerned.
