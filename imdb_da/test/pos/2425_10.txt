This movie requires a lot of patience. Because it focuses on mood and character development, the plot is very simple, and many of the scenes take place on the same set - in Frances Austen's (Sandy Dennis character) occasion. But the film is based on a disturbing climax. People create an atmosphere of sexual excitement and psychological trickery. It is very interesting that Robert Altman addressed this, considering the style and structure of his other films. Still, the Altman brand is sound style clear here and there. I think what really makes this movie work is the brilliant performance of Sandy Dennis. It's certainly one of her darker characters, but she plays it so perfectly and convincingly that it's scary. Michael Burns does a good job as the "dumb" young man. Regular Altman player Michael Murphy has a small portion. The solemn, mood set fits the content of the story very well. In short, this film is a powerful study of loneliness, sexual oppression and desperation. Be patient, enjoy the atmosphere and pay attention to the wonderfully written script. I commend Robert Altman. This is one of his many films dealing with unconventional, fascinating topics. This movie is disturbing, but it is sincere and it is safe to produce a strong emotional response from the viewer. If you want to see an unusual movie - some might even say bizarre - this is worth the time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find in video stores. You may have to buy it from the Internet.
