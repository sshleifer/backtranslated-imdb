A documentary researcher apparently explores unrelated paranormal events associated with the legend of an ancient demon called "kagutaba". From that, the movie looks like one of the camcorders that have been popular these past few months, even one that will be released next week (PARANORMAL ACTIVITY)! But unlike movies like CLOVERFIELD, REC and BLAIR WITCH, where most of these movies are in complete chaos and chaos with all shakiness, it is basically seen in a traditional documentary style. It has TV excerpts and interviews, and the scares are very subtle, good, except for the last 20 minutes when we go into the chaos effect, and where the fear factor is raised enormously. <br /> <br /> And it works. The film is very exciting and it makes you think. Yes, you heard me right: It makes you think. You need to pay attention to the unrelated details throughout the movie, and the payout is good when these things begin to mix each other during the movie. The film is also very slow moving, which in this case is a good thing. We as the audience get to absorb the details that appear on the screen, however subtle or blatant. Above all, they are a scary little movie. I am a person who is afraid of ghosts and the paranormal more than killed who beat away teenage fathers so yes, the movie gave me some nightmares. There are some pictures in here that are really disturbing to see, including a closer to the end where it makes you go "What am I looking at?" Well, it's better, left unanswered. There are about ten repeated characters in here, all of which gave authentic performances in their roles. The only thing I don't like about the movie is the end because most questions are unanswered. The question "That's it?" however, my mind went. It left a bad taste in my mouth. However, the rest of the movie is just exciting and really scary. Do not see this alone in the dark, because you will regret this choice. Also, I can see in a couple of years that Hollywood would recreate this movie. It will be interesting.
