Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) has just been transferred to a hospital in Italy during World War II. He is terribly burned by an ambush. His nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) tends to him, body and mind, for she is rightly afraid that he can be a very troubled soul. During his care, the count begins to tell Hana about his recent past. It seems he was working in a government capacity in Africa, where he met a beautiful married lady named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a brief affair, Katherine called it and he left the Grev desert. Still, the two would meet again under heartbreaking circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana herself falls for a Sihk man in the British bombers. But the war raged mercilessly. Can love exist when the world is in turmoil? This is a fantastic movie based on an equally fine but complex novel. The reason has many story lines that are intertwined beautifully, each of them exciting beyond the description. The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is magnificent, both as the burning victim and as the man who believed to love was a myth. Scott Thomas is also pretty nice as the woman fighting her passions. With regard to Binoche, she deservedly deserved the Oscar she was presented as her nurse is a shining example of hope in a hopeless situation. The landscape is quite beautiful, like costumes, direction and production. If you've missed out on watching this movie, fix it soon, very soon. The English patient will remain one of the greatest achievements in films for centuries to come.
