And true comedy. The dialogue is quick and very witty.Eleanor Parker at her physical top .Flynn as only Flynn can be "the charming rogue" ... even though now past his prime .. Most scenes between schools are short so they movie is moving well. If you haven't seen this movie, please look. You'll be surprised by Flynn's comedy timing. The scenes between him Tucker, Parker and "Cudddles" Sakal are hilarious. Just because of the clothes worn by the most attractive parks, this movie is worth seeing. The romance of this 40's movie will not be lost on those who are inclined to watch movies from Hollywood's golden past. My bet is that Never Say Goodbye will not disappoint.
