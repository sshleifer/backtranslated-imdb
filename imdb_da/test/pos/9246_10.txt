There is a limited number of fans for movies in the world who would love a particular genre to go to the depths that this crew member has done to bring to life something that the original film's author really had up to this point never reached. This is a wonderful exploration of the real dedication and love required to reach a potentially highly successful cult movie. <br /> <br /> Originally with the blessings of Alex Cox, this crew began producing the sequel to one of his movie in absolute true punk fashion. Their goal is simply to complete the atmosphere as it should be a whole tribute to the original "Repo Man" film. <br /> <br /> This is a great story of dedication and betrayal that can occur along the path of wonderful filmmaking. A truly entertaining story and a guaranteed learning experience for the viewer.
