Garlin outdoes himself as a writer-instructor in his indie production about a great guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. It laughs continues almost every minute. It is a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedic writing and action. The support rolls are also very well finished and very fun and really make the film rich. <br /> <br /> Rose Abdoo is hysterical in his reception role that takes you directly into the mood of the rest of the movie. Sara Silverman is great with some of the amazing things she does with Jeff. Bonnie Hunt is classically great in its role. I only wish there were more of her in the movie, as I think most would agree. It is quite refreshing to see her in a tight leather outfit. <br /> <br /> David Pasquesi was the secluded detached sidekick and voice of the grounds. My Kolb plays Jeff's mother, he lives with. There were many other comos, everyone did really well. <br /> <br /> At Prime Minister Jeff mentioned his inability to do more with Bonnie because of production problems. Still, it's good to let yourself have more. I think it's the indie thing to keep some things ambiguous to let the audience think for themselves to fill the topics. The wordy title must tie you into this. <br /> <br /> Jeff said some of the basic characters were based on his past affairs. This explains why they work so well. Real people are always exceptionally colorful and make great signs. He leaves little to what one might expect after seeing Curb Your Enthusiasm and some of his other work. It is one of those who breaks out things where an actor takes some risk of doing something they might always do, but couldn't. <br /> <br /> I find it remarkable that Garlin's improv Second City background, and Hunt's for that matter, set the style here to act as the focus of history and governance. It is perhaps a new innovative hybrid of improv that meets indie filmmaking.
