There is this whole theory of horror that some people keep close to the fact that the monsters and violence must be kept off-screen. Park Chan-Wook puts this concept completely out of the window and shows directly what he wants - and what he wants to show is pretty much everything he can think of. Leaves it to the actors and the dialogue to create subtlety, from a stylistic perspective. Park seems to be willing to do almost anything to get its point across. Whether it's a long time involved ensemble scenes with the camera jumping around a mah-boy board or whole weeks limited to a single shot between two other scenes, dialogue from the scenes before and after bleeding over them, Park doesn't hold a specifically structured style but focuses more on telling the whole story of a couple's relationship from virgin removal through complete coherence to complete self-destruction - and using vampireism as a link and preaching as a drama. It's so simple and so complex. At the same time, you must give him credit. Too many people are ready to compare any modern vampire movie to Twilight, with Twilight almost always the lesser of the works, but here the stories are actually comparable, but here are more raw and honest. None of this sparkle comes into the window at night to speak crap, but everything goes from the most beautiful, desperate and virgin sex scene to any spousal abuse that the two leads begin to awaken over each other. It's the same deal - dear and girl meet, girl finds out that guy is a vampire, decides to be with him anyway, but without happy ever, just as limited as they are forced to keep each other closer and Closer to opportunities. The girl's motivations are particularly interesting as you desperately demand power and attention, for a mistake that is the people of the guy who just wants to live a good life that he can best under the circumstances, but is a hypocrite who cannot admit to He just uses his vampireism as an excuse to act against his moral training. The movie is not perfect and it tends to stretch (there are no three actions, five acts or any action design here, just scene after scene of character building and dysfunctional romance), but what is great about is that Park Chan- Wook is willing to show everything honestly and honestly, while looking forward to the excitement of excitement and excitement. He also gives a professionally selected soundtrack to hit the emotional high notes also in a fairly efficient manner. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
