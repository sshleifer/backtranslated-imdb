Asked by the same Monty Berman / Dennis Spooner partnership that produced The Champions and Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased) - the latter revoked my partner Ghost for the US market - Department S is still a classic example of the action-adventure series that Britain produced in bulk in the late 1960s. Like the two shows, the internal dynamics of two guys and a girl may seem to indicate a progressive attitude towards equality (Dept S also has a black superior), but it is mostly facade: The launch section "Six Days" is almost halfway through Before Rosemary Nichols is encouraged to parade around in bra, panties and a (yes one) stocking to rid herself of a risky situation. Still, it is an interesting time capsule, although the horrific sense of fashion of Peter Wyngarde's character (which is surprisingly degenerate even more in the spin-off series Jason King) should surely have been buried.
