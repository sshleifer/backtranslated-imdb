I recall so many things about watching this movie back during the original theatrical release - the posthumous posture of peace and love, along with the pre-Watergate excitement of fear and paranoia. It's hard to believe it's 37 years later, and I still remember the mind through my head while watching the movie with my best friend. As amazed by Peter Boyle's characterization of the ultimate redneck, he has to make sure he writes him the rest of his career (oh, how wrong!), And how the counterculture hit the most sensitive in most of the country. To this day, my friend and I still use Joe Curran's line from my summary above when I face a dilemma; Curious how a simple line it can stay with you for decades. It's curious to read comments about the movie from others on this board, especially those who say the movie has a dated quality and how the top characters were. Still, if you were around at that time, the picture gives a fairly precise portrayal of the polar contradictions that existed since then, rather side by side as the events of history reveal. If you really want to date, when was the last time you heard the words Macy and Gimbel in the same sentence, or a line like Joe's - "Come on, come with the Pepsi generation". In the historical perspective, you have the great Nixon poster that dwells in one of the background scenes - "Do you want to buy a used car from this man?" With less intricacies like them, director John Avildsen is recording many of the subtle but ever-present tips on how life was four decades ago. <br /> <br /> Today's show was only the second time I've seen the movie, and I have to admit I can't remember Susan Sarandon in one of the lead roles, but then again this was her very first picture. The scenes of nudity and free love were something that was actually brand new and bold at that time, shocking indeed, as filmmakers began experimenting with their ability to push the envelope of decency and convention. "Joe" took a big leap in that regard, especially as it was a "mainstream" image. <br /> <br /> Over time, what impressed me most about Peter Boyle was how he overcame the stereotype of Joe Curran to appear in or star in some of my favorite pieces. I mean, how do you go from "Joe" to the hilarious rendition of 'Puttin' on the Ritz in "Young Frankenstein"? And my absolute favorite episode of 'X-Files' has Boyle as Clyde Bruckman, both in a tender and tragic, fun and serious portrayal that changes the tables on Scully and Mulder more than once. And as a career capper, Frank Barone should be one of the funniest characters in the history of television history. Even repeat episodes in syndication are fun as he - when the older Barone lets loose with one of his observations. He is an actor that this viewer misses already.
