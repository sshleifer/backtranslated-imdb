* POSSIBLE SPOILERS WARNING * <br /> <br /> A friend told me to check this series and I'm glad I took her word for it. <br /> <br /> I read synopsis on the DVD cover and I was immediately fascinated. The protagonist is Muslim? No way, this is a first! It's about an FBI agent who is deeply covered to penetrate a possible sleeping cell in LA; and get it - he's a practicing Muslim. I was a little skeptical at first, half expecting a hero or antagonist to endure perhaps stupid, free and thoughtless saints than you fanatic powders ... let's see, a lot of shows have been guilty of this. /> <br /> But then I saw the first three episodes, and I thought: Okay, that's good. It wasn't before episode four ("Scholar") when I was really impressed. I would like to praise the great writing and also fantastic performances from the actors. I just love how complicated each of these characters is - they are not just two-dimensional paper clip good guys / bad guys. Michael Ealy gives a wonderful and credible performance as the Muslim FBI agent Darwyn Al-Sayeed, who treads the fine line between being a good Muslim and a man of error. Oded Fehr gives his character Farik an interesting depth - Farik is not the typical oily stereotype in the Middle East, but simply one who truly believes in his case and does not see himself as a fanatic, but a man willing to do whatever extreme measures to justify his beliefs. He is very charismatic and authoritative. But I would say that it was Alex Nesic's performance that clearly left an impression on me in "Scholar". His portrayal of his character's emotional struggle was amazing - the reef between a Muslim learned soft word that encouraged him to return to the non-aggressive way, because it is the only acceptable way in the eye of God and Pharaoh's belief to believe otherwise. <Br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to seeing more shows like this, and not some ridiculously high octane one-man shows. It is wise and open.
