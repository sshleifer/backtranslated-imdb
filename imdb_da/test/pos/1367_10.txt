History involves the old demon being released on a small town on Halloween night. Throughout my life I have never seen such a cheesy movie, but it is so entertaining that you can forgive its bad action, effects, direction and script. This is the best movie created for the Halloween season since the original Halloween. And when they introduce Linnea Quigley's character for the first time, she is blunt-naked in the shower as if in 5 minutes. Goodness, they just don't get any better than this. Rush and buy this tape immediately. 5.10
