Kon Ichikawa had lived through World War II and saw what its effects had on his people in Japan. But so did the author Shohei Ooka, whose book was the inspiration for Ichikawa's film, Brande on the plain. It is a film about the men of this war, or perhaps more universally in wars generally, who lose their humanity. The soldiers pulling through these fields and jungles of the philippines in this story are almost complete without hope, if not already. It makes Stone's Platoon look like a picnic: at least they had certain things, like food. They do not have any reserves or supplies or ammunition, no backup, no meaning for anything goes in the way of this fight that they have been pushed into. They can't even get proper hospital care unless they can no longer walk or have lost limbs (for example, if you have TB, you're on your way). But it is really through a soldier's prism, a private Tamura, that we get a full sense of the war process, both in its gloomy scenes of nothingness and boredom and decay, and they flash of intense and brutal violence. <Br /> <br /> In the movie Tamura just wants to get medical attention. It is right at the start, and he told by his superior officer - he is already eyes that are staring and an expression drained of years of struggle - that he will die if he does not find a hospital. He does not do it right, but ends with some soldiers: initially with a platon that seems like a kind, has their act together, but is really led by a power-hungry brute who just wants Tamura's salt shock, and then later with two other missing soldiers who are part of a group that has previously been behind while crossing a road at night. <br /> <br /> The story isn't quite a straight line, but it doesn't have to be. Tamura Road in Brande at Plain is told in vignettes, small stories like when he comes to a seemingly deserted enemy village. Two of the peoples come back to get some supplies, and Tamura sneaks at them. It's a scary scene, since Tamura hasn't yet seen him do anything right * wrong *, but he does in this scene, not even so much out of evil, but out of fear and desperation (it's also without destroying it, how he gets a stash of salt). Small scenes are built so brilliantly and with destruction as a simple task to find a few common shoes that no one seems to be. Or, when Tamura later in the movie discovers that his teeth are apart and fall out of total hygiene. So much for food, so it goes. It should also be mentioned that this is a ghost film from Ichikawa, shot in a sharp black and white view of the fields and forest, the cinematography fills everything we see in black and white and white-hot white. Ichikawa also ensures that everything is authentic from his actors, not only emotionally but with their own appearance and appearance of desperation right on them. It's as if Ichikawa has to make them all survive the movie as well as characters that survive in the wild; by wild, by the way, I also mean cannibalism. The shock is twice; First, the way a soldier says half-heartedly early is to eat other soldiers to Tamaura asking if it was true and only in response to getting a "do not ask" word with caution, and the other with the depiction of Cannibalism in itself from the crazy starving man on the ground, pulling his mouth out of his lap and saying with a pretty face to our hero that you can eat me when I die. <br /> <br /> This makes things more brutal when it comes to the director who plays the short "action" scenes. These are, I would argue for, more brutal than 'Private Ryan' in their depictions of violence in battle, the carnage that is totally random. A scene that I want to point out that contains only a shot that is scary to look at is when we look from a high angle that we see a group of about 20 soldiers walking slowly, a hail of gunfire comes that only kills four or five, but it just happens so fast, and the soldiers just hold the same creep. This is not the only shot of horrible carnage shown - when it is necessary to be bloody there, but sprayed over the screen as something completely of the macabre - but it runs the point altogether. <br /> <br /> All the plays are staggering (Funakoshi special, who seems to be both at peace and most horrified at what he sees in the most exquisite look), giving all the big sets something different for the cruel experience, and everything is the ultimate question with an anti-war film: how can or why people fight in wars like these? It is almost too depressing to put on words, so Ichikawa pushes our nose all the way into muck and dirt and blood and demands that we take it in, so maybe it will never happen again one day. Or you can hope for this, at the end of such a gloomy and great movie like this.
