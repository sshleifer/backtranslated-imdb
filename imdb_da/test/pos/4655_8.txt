A pretty silly little movie you just love. Although it is quite corny and clich√© sometimes it does work and does well, just fun. Five teams are engaged in a scavenger hunt and beat each other and their habits to win the whole night competition - just for the sheer joy "knowing you're the best team." <br /> <br /> Can be seen for more screen cuts including David Naughton's first movie role after his Dr. Pepper "Be a Pepper" advertising and before his big 1981 hit "American Werewolf in London". Paul Ruebens also features in what I think is his first Pee Wee Herman-esquire rolls a year before he became known for it. And last but not least, Mr. Spin City and Alex Keaton themselves, Michael J. Fox get their first movie role here. Fans will remember Stephen Furst as Flounder in Animal House. Outside it, no names, but all funny characters. Doubt it ever made it to DVD, but there are still probably some VHS copies floating around and you can even catch up on a late, late show for a while. If you do, it's worth seeing your watch. You can hate it, but it can also be a quirky little movie you will love.
