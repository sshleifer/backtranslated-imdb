This is a well run Columbo episode, also with some good character, but the story just doesn't really know enough to interest enough and doesn't seem as layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also applies to the murderer's plot of killing his uncle. It is quite simple and does not seem so well thought out. Perhaps the film did not really take seriously enough, as the film's atmosphere is mostly light. At least compared to various Columbo films. <br /> <br /> The film has a rather large comical relief, which mostly comes from the Columbo character itself. It makes the movie a pleasure to watch, but it also gives you the feeling that it kind of oversizes it times, even for the most part, as it doesn't match most other Columbo movies. The people are good and it helps to give Martin Landau a double role. It is always fun to see how much different he still looked like a young man, while, for example, a person like Peter Falk hardly changed anything over the years, he was only graded. The film also includes Julie Newmar among others best known for playing Catwoman in the '60s' Batman's Life Activity Series. It's funny how she still moves like Catwoman in this movie. Intentional or is this just her way of acting? It is an enjoyable and good to see Columbo movie, but it also gives you the feeling that everything could have been much better with a better thought-out script. <br /> <br /> 7/10
