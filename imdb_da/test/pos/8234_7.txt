Note the broad release date of August 8, 1945 - approx. a week before Japan surrendered in World War II, so there will probably be a message to us in "Over 21". Irene Dunne (It happened one night, the 1939 version of Love Affair) is Paula Wharton, who goes to live on an army-based base while her newspaper editor man is in training school. Alexander Knox (the longest day) is her hubby Max. Look for Charles Coburn (Monkey Business, gentleman prefers Blondes) as the heavy, commanding, avian. Also look for Cora Witherspoon as Mrs. Gates, from The Women, Bank Dick, Libeled Lady. War history written for the women's point of view, which was not too common these days. fun commentator on the shabby state of "married housing"; Irene's wardrobe in this movie was definitely not shabby. Since they never had to leave their small cabin, it seems that the entire movie budget was spent on his always exquisite dresses and hats.
