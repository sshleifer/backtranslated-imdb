People need to learn to see what's up there on the screen. This is a fantastic movie based on a slow and careful collection of details that serve to establish the personalities of these two men. The inaction of Yusuf (Emin Toprak), the country's cousin, is well described by his fear of talking to women. He has at least three chances of starting a conversation with a young woman and losing them all. He has many decades of undergraduate studies in front of him, and maybe even unemployment. <br /> <br /> Mahmut is another case. He came out of the small town by working very hard (we imagine) and his anger of slackers like Yusuf is palpable (he leaves crumbs on the expensive carpet - slob!). Among other things, we are shown a group of friends talking about Tarkovsky, and we note that Mahmut feels regret - but only a little regret - that his work has become commercial over the years. The gulf between the cousins ​​just gets wider and wider. The mousetrap theme is wonderfully alive, it brings out Yusuf's compassion and confusion and the cold-blooded problem solving of Mahmut. <br /> <br /> I was reminded of two classic movies of men running each other nuts: Read cousins ​​of Chabrol (the rich boy with Hitlerian pretensions played by Brialy's always in my mind) and Kiss of the Spider Woman ( William Hurt can't figure out why everyone is so meant). Nuri Bilge Ceylan takes his place among the dozens of important directors who are now active. I just hope he will rely on business partners in the future, instead of steering, writing, and shooting his movies himself.
