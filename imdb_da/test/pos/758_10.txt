I was unsure what to expect from "driving lessons" - unsure whether Rupert Grint could play such a role, but within the first few minutes I was completely hooked. Throughout the way, the music, the play and the stage were absolutely fantastic. Julie Walters, as always, gave a fantastic performance as the eccentric old actress Evie, and Rupert Grint, just as good, gave a great performance as the romantic Ben. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I was forced into involuntary crumbs, shots of laughter and the head of joy as Ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend, Evie. A very controversial story, probably rather exaggerated, but nevertheless one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Recommended to anyone looking for a good British movie and an evening to kick-back and just enjoy yourself.
