Once again we are fortunate to see a beautiful opening scene where the artist's work has been completely restored, and we see this old-fashioned grocery store in a street corner with the snow gently falling. Inside, there are rich colors of all goods, from the production to the can and boxes for medicine to candy, etc. In essence, this is a story about these goods "coming to life", such as. the animals on the labels on items or a pie or even a pack of cigarettes. <br /> <br /> The whole "show" is told by "Jack Bunny," a Jack Benny impersonator, with music by leader Leopold Stokowski, who was in so many Looney Tunisian animated shorts I've lost count. A lot of humor is relevant so it's important to know who "Little Egypt" and other characters. Busby Berkeley-type "aqua" number with bath-suitable sardines coming out of the can, and the tomato can-can dance were both clever! <br /> <br /> All of the above and more were in the first half of this slightly longer than normal length cartoon. The other half was about a King Kong type coming out of the "Animal Crackers" box and terrorizing everyone. That part wasn't much, and ended up with a somewhat stupid note. Then ..... a "A" for the first half, a "D" for the other, making it a total C-plus or B-minus.
