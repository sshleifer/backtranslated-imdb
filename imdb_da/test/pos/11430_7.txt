Based on the short story The Dismissal by Ermanno Rea, the story is essentially the story of the slow friendship that evolves between an Italian maintenance engineer Vincenzo Buonavolonta (Sergio Castellitto, which can be seen as the scurvy king of Prince Caspian and was a leader in Bella Martha) and a Chinese translator Liu Hua (Ling Tai). They actually sat down on the wrong foot, with the previous chastening the latter for her inaccurate and slow translations of what he wanted to tell a Chinese delegate who had bought equipment that was defective. Vincenzo wants to do the right thing, which is rare these days, and it is to tell potential buyers in advance the mistake as well as the complications that their purchase would bring and when he is disturbed by the fact that the deal was still going in the future he takes time to make a component that will put things right. <br /> <br /> But it also means traveling to China in search of the unpleasant machine that turns out to be well hidden and apparently disappeared without trace. With Liu Hua's original reluctant help, they put themselves in this treasure hunt from town to city, which brings us to lesser-seen attractions in China, away from Beijing and Shanghai, to cities like Wuhan with industrial as scenery such as. steelworks and nuclear power plants with their smoke stacks that doped the landscape. The mighty Yangtze River also shows appearance. Along the way, the usual prisoners of such travelogue-styled films come to play, such as Learning of culture, ideals, food and basically the understanding that the world is without strangers, if only one tries to connect. Although there are hints of some romance between the two leaders, it seldom suggested that it was a moot point until it was perhaps late in the movie (hello, contradictions attracts, no?) In addition to the large industrial plants and factories we come to to see different cottages, such as nail strings working in sweat trades as environments, and I also believe cotton along with noodle production. As a movie, I gave the travel opportunity without leaving my seat to observe, and credit it for not persuading judgment from a morally high reason for exploitation and the like. And also for the film to engage in dialogue based on the characters' native language, rather than (and I can't mention names here) some other films / intercultural collaborations where the dialogue is forced to become dubbed and came out unnatural and truly irksome. Some may think that the supporting characters are too friendly and always open their arms and doors to a foreigner, but I would imagine that perhaps in the more rural areas, people generally tend to be more sincere, kind and in principle do not get caught in the rat race to tramp on or be trampled on. <br /> <br /> If there is a message to move away from the movie, except that I mentioned that the world is without strangers, a reminder of myself is that some of the things I consider important may not be is so for others. Importance is something you place on something else, and its foundation really depends on how we define the boundaries we set. So, in view of our final lifetime, I think I should enlighten a little more, live and let live, and sometimes bask in the illusion that ignorance could be bliss.
