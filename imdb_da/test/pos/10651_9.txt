SPOILERS Every large regime uses its media for its own purposes. About the Nazi ban on certain brochures or the TV-Chinese alternative to Tianamen Square, governments have tried to influence the population through various media since the beginning of time. However, in 1925, the Russian Communist government supported the creation of this film, Battle Ship Potempkin, in celebration of the failed mutiny of 1905. A large piece of film history, it remains power and beautiful to this day. <br /> <br /> Seen aboard the battleship Potempkin, the crew is unhappy. In miserable living conditions and with stomach infected food, they are angry with their subclass suppressors. Now it is probably after the rotten food. Led by Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), the crew occupy their masters and fight for their freedom. <br /> <br /> In terms of propaganda, the "Battleship Potempkin" goes perfectly. The presentation of a positive light on the first, failed, communist myth was the film a useful Soviet tool. Eighty years after the films have already been released and the Soviet Union has disappeared completely away from the map. The amazing thing about this movie, however, is that while the country where that message was intended has disappeared, the movie remains a strong and worthy piece of cinema. Written and directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the film is surprisingly a joy to watch. It is true that it is far from what we would consider 'entertainment' today, but the film is a beautiful work of art. <br /> <br /> Whether it's the scenes on board the boat or it often talked about the scene On the stairs in Odessa, everything about this movie is perfectly made. The music is powerful and dramatic, the lighting is flawless, even the actor, while slightly exaggerated, is perfect for the piece. Basically, there is no way to film the film. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to know how the Russian people received this movie on its release. Promising a country that has not existed for fifteen years, it is hard for us to know the full spirit that the film inspires. However, as a work of art, it is magnificent. Beautiful from start to finish, it's far from an easy see, but it's worth the effort.
