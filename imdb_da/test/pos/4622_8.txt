Many other viewers say this is not a good movie to see as they feel that it is not "realistic". How can it not be considered realistic? They feel that the incest part is not easy to relate to, that it is not common. I can guarantee you have met more people than you think an incest action has occurred. Many of them will not come out and say so, and mostly these are victims. Also, many people are gay, and are still closest, because no matter how much they want it to be, they know they will be ridiculed and possibly even abandoned. And tell me how many children have you gone to high school with what ended up being pregnant or having an eating disorder? I bet a lot, and even though pregnancy is not the majority of incest, it is still easy to relate to. Who can't relate to being excluded or bullied? it happens all the time. And many viewers are probably worried about there education like Marcus. Being a stoner seems to be quite common these days for. So there are many things to relate to. More than the rest itself, no matter how popular you can get, sometimes you feel invisible or alone, not noticed or overlooked as suicide victims, how can you not feel that you can relate to the movie? I find that the movie may have been meaningless to others, but I would like to think of it as important. It is an interesting way to show that suicide is happening and to pay attention. It comes from the people who do not show their unhappy thoughts, it is very surprising. The people who show trouble commit suicide at times, but when you hear about suicide who would have guessed, it usually runs through the minds of most people. The end surprised me, I didn't expect it to be the girl who until the end was mostly an extra in the scenes, not even introduced. The story, even in its description, says it's about 6 teenage lives, as it actually was 7. My only real disappointment was that it wasn't one of the characters we got to learn about. It first looks like the movie was meaningless to see if the real victim is just some random chick. until I thought more. It made perfect sense to be a big surprise, as that is what suicide is like. Plus, who was choosing who one of the other students had more of a reason than the other. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has some bad points, most have few but I would recommend this movie as long as you can handle seeing the tragic moments of seeing the suicide and violence and profanity shown in this movie.
