Valley Girl is the final 1980's movie with catch phrases filtered through this wonderfully acted movie. The characters are so convincing that you forget it's a movie and not a video of an actual "day of life" in any high school, USA. This flick is for the 1980s, what the Brady Bunch TV series is for the 1970s. If you don't like it, then "Gag me with a spoon".
