This is a lovely and charming epic fantasy with lots of heart. I lost in this sweet movie and watched Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. It's really romantic with a touching message. The works of art and the effects are visually striking, and the fact that the director is a fantastic artist is so clear. The frames are like watching moving art. It also has a strong and talented cast of actors. What a wonderful surprise to see Joss Ackland, he's just an amazingly perfect king. Sarah Douglas is great as the villain and Christine Taylor and Tom Schultz make a lovely romantic couple. The fact that the film was made on a ridiculously small indie movie budget just beats me away. It may not be the smart Hollywood stuff we are flooded with, but it's a really nice movie to rent and enjoy the curly up on your sofa on a rainy day. Don't forget about microwave popcorn. That's my advice. Just enjoy it.
