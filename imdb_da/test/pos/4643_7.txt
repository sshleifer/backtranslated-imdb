I lost this as a teenager in the mid 80's based on synopsis in the cable guide (scavenger hunting aspect appealed to me), without knowledge or expectations of the movie. what a pleasant surprise when I saw it! This was such a fun movie and I remember watching it repeatedly. I thought the concept was well done, I enjoyed the harmless competition between the different groups, and I thought the scavenger hunt itself was quite smart. Sometimes it seems that people have far too high expectations for movies. Not all movies will have a weighty "message" or star play, production values ​​or special effects. Sometimes, movies are only meant to entertain and be fun, and one succeeds on both levels. It was so nice to read the comments of the actors who played the twins. I haven't seen this movie this year, but if I thought I would be as hot and enthusiastic about what I did as a teenager. Even as I write this, excerpts from the cheese-shaped but appropriate theme song run through my head: "When the midnight madness starts coming to you ... it doesn't matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do ...! "
