Okay so this episode makes it fun with Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. The thing is South Park makes fun of everyone, like the Simpsons did. If you are offended that a politician you like is fun, then maybe you need a better sense of humor and take the show too seriously. That being said, this episode is fun and one of the best. Al Gore's portrayal is fun, Cartman's scheme goes horribly wrong, and the results make you roll on the floor and laugh. It's pretty much everything you'll ever have out of a South Park episode, and it's easily one of my favorites. I won't comment too much longer on the plot because I don't want to give anything away.
