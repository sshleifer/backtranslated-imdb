Last night I saw Turner Classic Movies (TCM). I had never heard of it before and was quite surprised to find it so exciting. <br /> <br /> Bogart becomes a star as a city-wise cynical editor who reluctantly joins his greedy radio network manager in this sharp "B" programmer. About 12 years before he played similar city-wise cynics to perfection in films such as Deadline USA, Knock On Any Door, Barefoot Contessa, and The Harder They Fall, Bogie already had star ratings down pat. <br /> <br /> To increase ratings, and bring their somewhat noisy programming to a more popular level, WUBC, "The Voice of America" ​​presses a narrative-all radio mini-series about a woman acquitted 20 years ago by a plea for self-defense to kill his husband. Not willing to be discreet to save the woman's and her husband's reputation, the station uses underhanded methods to reveal everything to all listeners, and as luridly as possible. <br /> <br /> As a time capsule, I also found it was very luminous for male women's pain at work in the mid-1930s. Although I am not witnessing Henry O'Neill, I am not familiar with the supportive cast, the players were uniformly excellent and the direction was tight. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of movie at all (eg A Face In The Audience, An Inspector Calls, etc.), don't miss the opportunity to see this. <br /> <br />
