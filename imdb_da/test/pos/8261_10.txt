Let me know about versions of Precious Bane or Gone to Earth on video that people might be aware of. I love Mary Webb's books wholeheartedly and would be very grateful for getting information on either VHS or DVD. <br /> <br /> I've read Precious Bane and Gone to Earth, my favorites of Mary Webb, many times, and have also collected other novels of her. I was fortunate to have found her "Springs of Joy" poetry and essays, but I have never been able to see the Precious Bane version that was at the Masterpiece Theater, or the full version of Gone to Earth, even though there was one American movie Classic aeration of The Wild Heart, which was a chopped version of Gone to Earth's original film. <br /> <br /> If anyone can help me get copies of one or both of these movies (full versions), I would be so grateful!
