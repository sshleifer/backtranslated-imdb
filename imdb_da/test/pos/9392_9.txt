George Barry is a genius. "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is a prototype for much of 'slipstream' fiction and camp surrealism that is so clever now. Really innovative, maverick, and just effing brilliant. Hyper-strange play, subtle nightmare atmosphere. I recommend reading Stephen Thrower's book "Nightmare USA" (there is a chapter dedicated to Barry and "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats"). Available from FAB Press. On a related note, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" and "Beyond Dream's Door" make a perfect double-bill. Moreover, it is tired and tired - and ultimately stupidly ironic - to criticize a low-budget culture film for being 'poorly crafted' or 'technically unlucky'. B-movie aesthetics are part of these films' charm. No amount of CGI could duplicate the cumulative effect "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" has on the viewer with an advanced palate.
