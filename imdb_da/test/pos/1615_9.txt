Brett Piper again makes a very good movie, which is rubbish by the so-called movie "experts". It's low budget, but fun, and the leading lady is very sexy. I wish I could see more of Irene Joseph. Good viewing fun. I bought the DVD and enjoyed it. The special effects are stop motion animation, and much better than the computer generated crap they call effects today. I always enjoy Brett Piper movies, and if you liked, I recommend Bite Me, Screaming Dead and everything else he has done. I look forward to seeing more of his work and more like Mrs Joseph. I simply can't see why this woman has not been in several movies, as her acting is excellent.
