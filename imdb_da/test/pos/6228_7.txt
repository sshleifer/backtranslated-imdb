A group of friends breaks down in the middle of the sky (one had a flat deck, the other is the Jeep mysterious will not start). One of them takes the deck to a run down service station, and that's the last to see him. When the remaining foursome are looking for their friend, they come across cozy Mr Slaussen, who offers to help solve the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat of his just-worn, hermit-like house, Be obsessed with very realistic-looking mannequins. He goes with one guy in the deck to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house. Before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his cabin; He warns them of "Davy", his brother who is wondering and not there all. Of course, one of them decides to venture out for a working phone and is never seen again. Is it Slaussen? Is it Davy? Mannequins ?? Tourist Trap has the usual jiggly big boobed girl, goody two shoes girl, curiosity gets better of people and never coaches! But it stands apart from the rest of the 70's genre in it's end of an end. I started to be sorry Slaussen (Chuck Conners is a fantastic, eerie, over-the-top performance) at some point in the movie and you almost see Molly's character doing the same. This is a gem if you can find it; I had lost it by cable when I was younger and went through a used video store, I saw a VHS copy that was totally overpriced but it was worth it. Fans of Tanya Roberts will not be disappointed either. The best part of the movie for me was the stage with the soup (and crackers !!) <br /> <br /> I gave it a 7 because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain.
