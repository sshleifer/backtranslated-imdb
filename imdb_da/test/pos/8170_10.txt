I can be a sentimentalist. But I found this movie really moving. It was the first movie that reduced me to tears. And it made it more than once !! I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8. Religious or not! Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one line. Naked scenes were also beautifully crafted and everything was good taste. The most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation conversion programming introduced by the Mormon Church to the protagonist. It shocked me that this is still happening in the world. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this movie enormously. This is definitely the best gay movie since the Torch Song Trilogy. And much better than the other gay movie that year - The Fluffer.
