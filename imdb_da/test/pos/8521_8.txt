As the 70s came up, rumors began to fly in the entertainment industry about Sean Connery's possible return to the role he had celebrated again in 1962 - James Bond. <br /> <br /> Cubby Broccoli was asked on site in Brazil during the production of 'Moonraker' by the BBC's Barry Norman, how he considered the prospect. Understandably, the producer was reluctant to commit to an opinion. <br /> <br /> When 'Moonraker' was opened, Bond fans were overwhelmed by what they perceived as a cheaper character and jumped on the 'Star Wars' bandwagon much like 'Live & Let Die' with blaxploitation a few years earlier. Many publicly stamped their hopes that Connery would return if only to show Eon how a true Bond movie would look. <br /> <br /> Years of legal battles followed. The original script, called James Bond of The Secret Service, was later written by Kevin McClory, Len Deighton, and Connery, never filmed and remains one of the great unnoticed movie busts. <br /> <br /> A new script closer to the Thunderball story was commissioned. It was written by Lorenzo Semple Junior, best known as the man who camped in 'Batman'. He had also written 'The Parallax View', one of the finest conspiracy players of the decade. The feel of the script needed a British touch, Connery brought in Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, authors of hit British sitcom's 'The Likely Lads' and 'Porridge'. The witty title was suggested by Connery's wife Micheline. <br /> <br /> Never say never again opened just before Christmas 1983 for a shower of critical praise; Normally sensible critics were so ecstatic at Connery's return they ignored all other aspects of the movie. Many used it maliciously to attack the Roger Moore series, especially this year's "Octopussy". In fact, 'Octopussy' is superior in every respect. 'Never' lacks the excitement and play you associate with Bond, sometimes it looks like a made-for-T.V. movie. The story had been done before and better in 1965's 'Thunderball', therefore 'Never' should always come out second best. It was also hampered by not being part of the official series, meaning that Monty Norman's James Bond Theme and Maurice Binder's gun barrel logo could not be used. <br /> <br /> As Bond, Connery is magnificent and effortless to step back to his most famous role. Playing Bond as an older, wiser agent worked. Barbara Carrera landed her best movie role as the villainous 'Fatima Blush', a lady whose love of murder is such that she dances after (so she believes) to kill Bond. Kim Basinger smolders as 'Domino'. As S.P.E.C.T.R.E. agent 'Maximillian Largo', Klaus Maria Brandauer gives a chilling performance. A big disappointment though is Max Von Sydow as 'Blofeld'. The posters gave the impression that he would be a great character; With a stronger script he could have been one of the all-time big Bond villains. <br /> <br /> 'Never' promised to be a return to the early Eon bonds as 'From Russia with Love' but did not deliver. The gadgets were there but were used almost apologetically. Bond's rocket-firing motorcycle was a tired gimmick even in the 60's. The film tried to compete with Eons Bonds in humor. Bond saves himself by throwing his own urine sample on an assassin's face, is a farcical moment as something you find in 'Moonraker'. But the nadir comes with the introduction of Rowan Atkinson as a bumbling Foreign Minister, Nigel Small-Fawcett. He gives a performance so terribly awful you wonder if he thought he was in a footlight's revue. <br /> <br /> Michel Legrand's music is horrible, the man never seems to have seen a Bond movie in his life. <br /> <br /> Although the film was a financial success, six years later, it is the weakest Bond of the 80s. Connery himself was disappointed with it and did nothing in a movie again for some years. 1983 was a good year for 007 maniacs, in addition to Connery and Moore films, George Lazenby made a nice cameo in the made-for-TV 'Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E: The Fifteen Years Later'.
