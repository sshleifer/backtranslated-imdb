This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not the elaborate Renny Harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups. It's the Shane Black script and its cautious delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson. The chemistry between the two principles deserves a successor. Thank goodness it was never made. Too much danger of marching the original. <br /> <br /> 'The Long Kiss' checkerboards from quotable scene to action scene to quotable scene and back again. Never a dull moment. <br /> <br /> This should be Jackson's funniest role ever and the great thing is that he plays one of the most normal career characters. No quirky Tarantino hit-man, super-cool Shaft or borderline psycho. In TLKG, Jackson is the one we identify with. The poor schmuck is dragged together on this crazy woman's odyssey to uncover her dangerous secret. <br /> <br /> Although the story claims that Davis's character, Samantha Caine suffers from amnesia, the author and director treat his condition as if it were a multiple personality disorder. Samantha Caine is not just a new identity taken by amnesiac Charly Baltimore - she is a separate, fully developed personality. The trauma that Samantha suffered in the first half hour of the movie helps Charly's immersed dissociative personality reappear. The materials of her past life excavated by Jackson's detective Mitch Henessey facilitate Charly's revival. Good timing, also considering the Samantha goal does by itself. <br /> <br /> But Charly has to fight to remain the dominant personality. You collect from bits of dialogue that the warrior's personality (Charly) evolved after her father died, and she was recruited by the "Chapter". For the eight years, Charly was buried in the psyche, but her Samantha identity evolved into the dominant personality. (She is even more fun at Charly.) It is probably due to become a mother, because it is the reunion with her daughter who breaks Charly's struggle to suppress Samantha, leading to their apparent integration at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's It is impossible to choose a "best quote" from this movie: <br /> <br /> "Now you are a sharpshooter?" <br /> <br /> "I saved your ass. It was amazing!" <br /> <br /> "Continue dying out." <br /> <br /> "I sock them in the jaw and yell 'Pop goes loom'". <br /> <br /> And a couple of dozens, many for breaks to quote here. <br /> <br /> Geena Davis looks good and comes out as an action hero without slipping over forty. (Listen to Charley's story, do the math). <br /> <br /> Amazing soundtrack too. Santana, Muddy Waters, Elvis, LaBelle, Marvin Gaye. <br /> <br /> I give 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' a 9, just because I don't believe in a perfect 10. Seen it a dozen times and it still remains fresh. Beautiful twisted holiday girl to place on your shelf next to 'It's a wonderful life.'
