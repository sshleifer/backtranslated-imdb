The sequel is exactly what you want to expect. And it is good enough that anyone who would have wanted to see this should give it happiness. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that will win an Oscar. But it takes what made the Jackass TV show and the original movie a success and that makes it a notch. It is more fun, more brutal and more disgusting than the original. And I loved every minute of it. <br /> <br /> The original had a few notorious stunts and there is at least one stunt that this movie is remembered for. You will get used to, cringe, look away and laugh a lot, very hard. <br /> <br /> In any case, you probably don't need to read this review or anyone else to know if you would like this movie unless you have never heard of Jackass.
