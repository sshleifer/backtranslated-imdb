Just got back from seeing Black Snake Moan. I had spent time reading reviews ... most seemed to focus on the obvious ... "skinny white girl chained to a black man's radiator" ... I hate when "critics" miss a movie point. Now I assume it helps that I live in Memphis ... and have lived in Mississippi a few times too. It can also help me to be the former director of the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale ... but I get this movie. The brewer's simple "redemption story" is easy to follow and could have had different themes to tell the story ... but I think it is very effective as a "blues". It would be my hope that people will not read all the hype ... and / or different reviews ... and miss a really good movie. Go past the various things like thin girls in white panties ... get past Justin Timberlake, accept his character Ronnis (as he plays very well) ... pass "Snakes on a Plane" and see how mercuricul Samuel L. Jackson is ... as he has turned into a very credible Mid-South blues man. If you know a little about the Mid-South culture, much of what is going on can beat some as cartoon-like ... but accept the fact that Craig Brewer KNOWS to paint the canvas and let the actors tell the story and you will enjoy this movie. Not one to tell conclusions ... so go see this movie ... and yes, I agree with one thing the critics got right ... the music is wonderful!
