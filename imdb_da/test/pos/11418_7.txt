After seeing the original when I was 13 (and yes, I was stupid enough to see it while you were baby!), I was thrilled to see this remake. <br /> <br /> Camilla Bell did a good job as Jill Johnson. And the fact that a teenage fear could be made in 2006 without enormous vulgarity and doing, even made it much stronger by a movie. I had a great time trying not to chew my nails! <br /> <br /> This movie won't win anyone an Oscar but it's entertaining and worth the matin√©e price ticket I bought to see it. I think girls around the world should see the original and remake ... and then decide they should never babysit again. <br /> <br /> All I can say is, I'm glad I'm too old for babysitting! There's just something about being in a dark, crooked house with sleeping children, making this movie classic. No blood, no one doing ... just good psychological fun! WINNER!
