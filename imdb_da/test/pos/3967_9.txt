Diora Baird is quite hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are incredibly fun to see. <br /> <br /> (MINOR SPOILERS) As usual, the protagonist B is the wise one of the pile. B has this crazy idea of ​​making his own college when he is rejected from all the colleges he uses. He is known for making false IDs. So an acceptance letter is no problem. Because B's father is a hard @ $$ and suspicious of this university, he has never heard of B getting his friend Sherman to design a website for the university. Sherman has been accepted to a large college and is in fear of being arrested for fraud. He is very quick with witty lines, but his mistake is that he will be accepted socially too much. <br /> <br /> Glen, Hands and Rory are the three stooges that follow B together. Glen got a zero on his SATs and has no thought process. He suggests constant royal combat, but he is very good at making smoothies, giving him a lot of hot girls somehow. Hands were a great football player who did not receive the scholarship he counted on and turned to craft to cover his lack of athletics. Rory was preparing to go to Yale since 1st class and was not accepted. She spends her time meditating. <br /> <br /> Uncle Ben was my favorite character. Picture Lewis Black plays himself. If you have no reason to watch this movie, watch it for Lewis Black and Jonah Hill. They are fantastic. <br /> <br /> Monica is a B's love interest. As most of these stories go, she is more popular than him and doesn't even discover him until halfway through the movie. In contrast to many other stories, B actually gets her and holds her to the end. Monica is actually a good character alone, but of course she is primarily B to love. <br /> <br /> There are several supportive students at the compound college who are fun to watch. A.D.D.'s name is self-explanatory, and probably enough in the class of meditation. Kiki is a hot ex-stripper who falls over his heels for a chance to go to school and finally gets a crush on Glen. Maurice is a former military idiot who got his G.I. bill and want to study rock n 'roll in college. The final guy is only known as the Freaky Student, who thinks he can blow up his mind. Those who have little faith in him are waiting for the film to end. Of course, the villain's dean is for an opposite university, his college student president, the president's boyfriend and their circle of friends. . <br /> <br /> Each character is lovable. I think this movie has a good plot and is well done, despite what many people say. Even thought the overall story is predictable, the characters keep you guessing and making the movie great. Go see this movie. I give it 9 out of 10.
