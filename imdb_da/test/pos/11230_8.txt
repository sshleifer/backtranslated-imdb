"It all depends on how you look at it? We are either halfway to heaven or halfway to hell," says Rev. Harlan in "Northfork." The Polish brothers' film is an ambitious one that will make any intelligent seer sit up, provided he or she has patience and basic knowledge of Christianity. The layers of entertainment provided by the film take a viewer beyond the surreal and absurd imagery that is evident in a less obvious socio-political and theological commentary that should provoke a backward American to reflect on today's social values. The movie's adoption of the surreal (coffins that come from the depths of man-made lakes to float and disturb the living homesteaders who almost "cross" their feet to wooden floors in their homes, angels who need more glasses to read, etc. .) and absurd images (of half-animals, half-toys that live, door-bells that make the most sensitive with musical outputs of a harp, a blind angel who continues to write unreadable channels, etc.) could make a viewer unaware of the surreal and absurd traditions of literature and the art of speculating on what the film is un-spooling as entertainment. Although European film has better credentials in this area, Hollywood has actually made such films in "Cat Ballou", Lee Marvin and his horse leaned toward the wall to take a nap, decades ago. "Northfork" in a scene of the citizens who left the city in cars seemed to pay tribute to the range of cars in "Citizen Kane" who took Kane and his wife out of Xanadu for a picnic. <br /> <br /> The movie is difficult for the uninitiated or impatient movie goer? The most interesting epilogue (one of the finest I can remember) can be heard as a voice towards the end of the credits. The directors seem to leave the finest moments to those who can join the movies to the end. If you have the patience, will you enjoy the film? If you smuggle or extinguish what the Polish is plaguing the dish, you will miss its many tastes. What is the film about ? At the most obvious layer, a city is abandoned to make room for a dam and hydropower project. Even cemeteries are being dug up so that deadly death places can be moved to higher burial sites. Property-promoting companies are shedding the characteristics of the lake for 6 people who can expose the urban population. Of the 6, only seem to have a conscience and therefore can order chicken broth soup while others cannot get anything served to them. <br /> <br /> On the next layer you have Christianity and its interaction in the cities. Most are holy Christians, but in many, the instinct lurks to survive at the expense of true Christian principles, as exemplified in the priest. Many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions. <br /> <br /> On the next layer you have a world of angels interacting with near English people and with each other. You realize that the world of the unknown angel holding a cartoon of Hercules and dreaming of a mother finds one in an androgynous angel called "Flower Hercules". While the filmmaker indicates that flower is an extension of the young angel's frightening imagination, subsequent actions of Flower believe this possibility. You are truly in the world of angels - not gods, but pure in spirit and therefore not in living. In another layer, Ireland's toy plane is a true plane carrying him and his angels to heaven, 1,000 miles away from Norfolk. <br /> <br /> The last layer is the social comment ?? "The country is divided into two types of people. Benefits people and chevy people." Is there a difference? They think they are different, but both are consumers. <br /> <br /> For the religious, the film says "Prayer and You Must Receive" (words from Fr Harlan, quoted by Angel Flower Hercules). To the consumer, the film says, "That's what we do with the wings that separate us" (each of the 6 prospects also has wings - a duck / geese hidden in their hat bands, but their actions are different, often far from the English who suggested of the different reactions to a scratch on a car). The movie is definitely not the finest American movie, but it is certainly a remarkably groundbreaking work - amazing images, striking performances (especially Nick Nolte), and a loaded script offering several levels of entertainment for mature audiences.
