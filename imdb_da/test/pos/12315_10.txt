In print, this is one of the greatest short stories ever written, brilliant and poetically brought on the screen by this father-sister team working together for the first and last time. It is appropriate that John Huston finish his career on a high note by bringing one of his favorite author's work to the screen, in what is easily the best Joyce screen customization. Huston made a career in adapting large literature work to movies, usually quite successful. It's sad, and somewhat creepy, that Tony Huston basically started and ended his career in film by adapting what would be his father's final project and recording a well-deserved Oscar nomination in the process. <br /> <br /> I once had the right to be in the company of the great writer / actor Horton Foote, who quoted this movie as one of his favorites in recent years (at that time, it was still a relative new version). As a quite productive screenwriter himself (and a brilliant screen adapter of his own works, as well as good writers like Faulkner, Steinbeck and Harper Lee), he was, of course, impressed by Tony Huston's first-time effort and possibly as confused by his lack of output since then . If anyone has insight into sharing the topic, I would be interested in hearing more.
