For those who remember this video's initial influence, it will never be forgotten, and a view of Thriller is all that is needed to feel twelve years again. But while it's a great video, it's not perfect, even though it looked like it at that time. When this video first came out, no one had ever seen anything like it. Now the music video medium has grown with leaps and bounds, and a new view of Thriller will reveal its faults. Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song? When Michael Jackson goes next to the girl after leaving the cinema, he sings all the song's verse and skips the crusts. After he becomes a zombie when it comes time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup disappears inexplicably, and he sings the chorus again and again and again as if to make up for his previous absence. This could have been the first time a song had ever been deconstructed to fit the pictures in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time. It has still been a problem in MTV's age. The best videos that Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It have used to serve the music, not the other way around. Still, Thriller is fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
