If you expect this movie to be full of action and take you from the start, don't see it. But if you like the kind of meditative movies that hold your mind for a while until you get the details, then you will love it. Do not make me wrong now, there is action, and there are things that just don't happen in the usual way. <br /> <br /> The reason is in a post-apocalyptic world where everyone is struggling in his (or their) way of survival. In this match, they lost the ability to speak ... I don't want to write more to not spoil the movie for you, but believe me if you like SF writers like Lem or Capec or even some from the Orson Scott Card, you will love this movie.
