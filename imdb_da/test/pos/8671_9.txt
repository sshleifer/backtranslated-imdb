Andreas arrives at a strange inhuman place where everything seems perfect. He's got a good job, everyone is friendly to him and to everyone, and he doesn't really do it too much, even by finding a beautiful girlfriend. But in this unnamed city, Andreas soon finds that a perfect advertising-type world really is not a paradise. Really one of the better movies I've seen this year. The attractive plot is perfectly supported by a smart direction, where each component (cool desatured photography, cold symmetrical design, unemotional action, slow-motion camera movements) helps build a unique, strange atmosphere that keeps the audience suspended to the end. A sarcastic, ironic, bitter comedy that made me laugh suspicion that only the best movies are capable of doing. Nothing new, probably in the analysis of the modern de-humanizer civilization, but really a clever work with amazing surprising ideas that will hardly be forgotten from who had the luck to see it. Simply beautiful the amazing scene in the subway underground.
