Movie historians have said a lot about ancient epics that have been the interest of many directors from the beginning of the cinema. The pioneers of such epics, especially Biblical, were D.W. Griffith with his "mother of all epics" INTOLERANCE (1916) and Cecil B DeMille with his flair for magnificent glasses, costumes and lavish scenes. Who can forget their TEN COMMENTS (1923, 1956) or SIGN OF THE CROSS (1932)? Nevertheless, here comes another epic, made in the 1950s, directed by Michael Curtiz, and based on the short story by Mika Waltari, "The Egyptian." Michael Curtiz, already famous for his great classic CASABLANCA (1941), manages to wonderfully adjust his film to the audience at that time, to include the key ideas and facts of the thick novel and restore the Egyptians who lived in the lifestyle one of The most amazing periods in the government unit of Akhnaton. <br /> <br /> The first and most important fact for me in this movie is the psychological development of the protagonist Edmund Purdom plays. Sinuhe, who has been brought up in a simple family of her paternal parents, becomes a doctor. Throughout his life he never stops asking a question "why?" and searching for the answer. Attractive love, which he finds in a Nefer's hip (Bella Darvi), leads him to economic and spiritual disaster. He has to repair the mistakes of hard work in the House of Death and start building his reputation from nothing. First, he thinks that the only cure is revenge. But in the long run, he realizes that "eye to eye" is not a solution. Finally, what stands for him under very strange circumstances is the deadline for being a pharaoh. Nevertheless, for a moment he finds the answer to his question that affected him throughout his life ... The protagonist's story, though based on the book, is so interesting psychologically that any open-minded person should consider this aspect in movie. The main character's psychological struggle is intensified by the times he lived in, the times when probably for the first time to the extent that the power of the sword collided with the power of thought. <br /> <br /> Curtiz's film also retains a rule that all movies in his era were: large cast and lavish sets. There are mainly British actors and actresses who give very good performances. How is it possible to not mention the head restraints of the ancient epic, Victor Mature. This time he is not Demetrius, Hannibal or Samson, but Horemheb - a fighter, a lover, eventually a pharaoh. Jean Simmons appears in a very delicate role as Merit, a woman who loved Sinuhe all her life, but it was too late when he realized it. Peter Ustinov, probably most famous for his beautiful performance as Nero in QUO VADIS? Three years earlier, doing a good job as Kaptah, Sinuhe's friend. The royal of the film is also played by two great casts, Gene Tierney and Michael Wilding. Tierney is excellent as cold, wanting power Baketamon, Pharaoh's sister. Wilding gives a fantastic performance as "crazy" Akhnaton. When I was in the Louvre in Paris and saw Akhnaton's original face carved in stone, he looked pretty much the same as the actor in the movie. Bella Darvi, an actress born in Poland, is quite memorable as a vicious Nefer hips. And there's another actress who only appears on a scene, but who's hard to forget, Judith Evelyn as Taia, Mother of Pharaoh. This voice, those eyes! <br /> <br /> The sets are magnificent. The director recreated the most likely picture of Aaton's outdoor temple, the god the Egyptians worshiped in the regime of Amenhotep IV. I also loved the place of Pharaoh's first entrance. What a wonderful image that lasts forever in its memory !!! But there is also one aspect that I would like to draw attention to for everyone interested to watch the movie. Egypt is similar to other epics in many respects, but it also stands out as a unique film. There are very few films that make a wonderful use of various curiosities as for ancient times. Iron is mentioned, which is first used by the Hittites. It is also the only film about ancient Egypt that speaks openly about Egypt's magnificent hardening ability. It greatly emphasizes the contrasts in lifestyle, especially the time of a slave's death for whom no one cares followed by the message and thus the widespread grief after Pharaoh's death. Finally, "the Egyptian" shows a historical fact: there were other nations except Jews (before Christ) where the spirit of God shone in some human hearts. Yet, the only difference was that it did not survive as long as Jews, because it did not have a strong foundation. Akhnaton's death scene provides you with so many biblical and Christian values ​​that you may think you are seeing a religious movie. All in all, I highly recommend Michael Curtiz's movie. It is a fantastic multi-level production: an entertainment for epic fans, an admiration of amazing performances for biographies, a soul celebration for spiritual people. Finally, it is a beautiful story of extraordinary things that happened thirteen centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ.
