Oh man, this movie is amazing. It is very good, it is a story of a man who does not accept black people, he sits on a bar of drinks on his evening and he cheats on anti-war hippies and how black and hippies do not deserve to Get some welfare checks. This movie is very realistic because it portrays a guy "Joe" who represented many guys since then and now too. The story goes like this .... Joe is in a bar and he rubs shoulders with a rich guy who just accidentally killed his daughter hippie girlfriend. And this kingdom goes to the bar to rethink what he just did, and while he does, "Joe" in the bar is ranting about the hippies and people who are against the war. The rich guy regularly tells Joe that he killed a hippie; and of course joe joins the rich guy because Joe hates hippies, Amazing movie watch it to see what's happening next time. I liked this movie because it recalls the days of the early 70s, I liked the way movies were shot back in those days, very good things, it's not like today's movie. Basically, the film gives you an inside look into the mindset of the protagonist "Joe". I like the theme of the movie ....... about the working man who busting his ass trying to live
