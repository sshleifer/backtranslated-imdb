Just got out of an advance screening, and wow this movie was hilarious. Maybe better than the first, but at least its equal. If you don't like jackass or really unnecessary amounts of male nudity (way more than in the first one), stay far away. But if you dig the whole Jackass case, then this movie won't disappoint. Toro Totter is the greatest invention ever. OKAY. so my review was not long enough ... All else i have to say is poor, poor Dunn, they really kick the crap out of him in this. So, if you enjoy masochistic humor and good-looking male nudity and by far the most obnoxious female nudity ever (John Waters is involved, I have to say more?) Then this movie will keep you in the lead. I never stopped laughing and actually came out of the sweaty sweat.
