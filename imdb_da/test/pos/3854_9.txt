This movie is amazing, I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a cat mother named Dutchess and her 3 cats. Dutchess and kittens love music. They must practice piano every day. But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutch and his kittens, he tries to get them to sleep. But he fails. Them Dutchess meets a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats break into the song. With the song everyone wants to be a cat. Thomas will have to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really love each other. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and I like cats!
