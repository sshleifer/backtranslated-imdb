This drama apparently caused a bit of shaking six years ago when it debuted on television - not accepting many television news itself, it passed under the radar; But after seeing it, I am not surprised that it caused touch. Not particularly because of the content (though slightly more "offbeat" than the usual TV foot) - it has more to do with the reactionary media in that country. Nevertheless, this three series series is based on a book by Sarah Waters and focuses on lesbians - although the plot also has room to explore some other "dark" sides of sexuality. Our protagonist is an oyster girl named Nan (short of Nancy) from Winchester. She is thrilled by female to male drummer Kitty Butler after seeing her at a theater performance and soon joins in all her shows - eventually catching the practitioner's eye and becoming her dresser. It is not long before Kitty is offered a chance to play at major stages in London and become good friends with Nan, she invites her together for the trip. The action gets bigger when Nan goes to the stage too, and the couple becomes a scenedo ... but Kitty breaks Nan's heart and leads her into an odyssey in London's seedy underbelly. I have to admit that my DVD collection does not contain a lack of sleazy and sordid movies, so there was nothing in it that was enough to shock me. Despite being pretty much left to it, I have to say that I'm still surprised by anyone who says this movie went too far; Of course, there is some lesbian sex and other things, but it is never exploitative or overused, and the movie really could not have been made without it. The main focus is always on the story; And the story is really well done. The movie is almost three hours in total, but if something is not far enough to get everything across. Sarah Waters is, of course, an inventive writer, and the film remains interesting for the duration. The action is solid as you would expect, but I have to admit that I found leading actress Rachael Stirling awkward and difficult to move forward with in the beginning; although she grows into her role as the film progresses. The implementation is a bit of a problem and Director Geoffrey Sax is a little too gimmicky to my liking. The story gets a bit juicy towards the end too, which is a shame because this movie is the strongest in the dark moments (episode 2 is the height of three for me). There is not really a defined point on the movie - or at least not one I could see. It's not important as far as I'm concerned; But as Tipping the Velvet tells a good story and more than exceeded my expectations. Worth checking out for people who like this kind of thing.
