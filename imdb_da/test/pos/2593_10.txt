In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting and Daffy is trying to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has its own agenda. In addition, "Rabbit Season" makes interesting use of word words and pronouns (warning: it can just hilariously and royally disturb your speech). I think probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by bugs and daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqu√© in 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it out completely as they always did. All in all, it just goes to show which geniuses the people behind these cartoons were.
