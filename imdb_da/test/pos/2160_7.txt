Night Hunter starts in 1968 when a young Jack Cutter (Chris Aguilar) unexpectedly handed the family tradition to become a vampire hunter when a fellow vampire hunter Sid O'Mack (Sid Haim) betrays his family and leaves them to the Vampire to help Jack with his search, he gets a book containing the name of every vampire alive, or death no matter how you look at it ... Jump to 'June 1995' and Los Angeles where it now grows (Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, also credited as co-producer) have only four names left in the book, including, Argento (Vince Murdocco) & Carmella (Sophia Crawford) together they are the last of the American vampires. As they all eat in a restaurant Cutter breaks down the party and kills them, worked right? Wrong as the Vampire King Bruno Fischer (Nicholas Guest) calls the last four remaining vampires from all over the world, the French Tournier (Maria Ford), the Asian Hashimoto (Ron Yuan), Ulmer (David 'Shark Fralick) & Sister Vincent Klyn) Cut down and kill him. Meanwhile, Detective's Hooper (Marcus Aurelius) and Browning (Cash Casey) have no idea, and a nosy reporter named Raimy Baker (Melanie Smith) gets involved in the battle between Cutter & the Vampire, where the very fate of the Earth rests! Directed by Rick Jacobson I thought Night Hunter was quite a fun way to pass 85 odd minutes. The manuscript of William C. Martell blends martial arts and horror with a fair degree of success; it moves at a good pace and is at least never boring and fortunately does not seem to care too seriously. However, the sign name that refers to other horror film director / actors is a little sticky. Some may be surprised at how close Night Hunter resembles Blade (1998), but was made a few years before, lone moody long coat wearing a vampire hunter, who happens to be a martial arts expert, a nightclub scene, and the innocent woman pulled in in the Vampire world. Night Hunter doesn't really hold on to traditional Vampire movie law, for example, sunlight only irritates their eye, they can only breed on a solar eclipse (why?), Stakes through the heart and garlic are not good as the way to kill a vampire in Night Hunter is to break that neck. I could have done with a little more horror and a little more blood, as it leans more towards the martial arts side of things. The dialogue is appropriate cheesy, and the sign is almost as good as possible. <br /> <br /> Director Jacobson does his best to destroy the movie, the scenes of the action are OK, but lacks a certain thing and for some bizarre cause when an action sequence takes place, he shakes his camera constantly, as if The camera is located on a full cycle in the washing machine! Hi Rick, buddy, it's not smart or stylish, it's annoying and annoying. Gore is disappointing with a few shady shots and a few bloodshots, and breaking the vampire's neck doesn't involve much blood unfortunately. With a budget that probably did not amount to much Night Hunter, is competently made through. The action was bad most of the time, and what about 'The Dragon' things in Don 'The Dragon' Wilson's name? Has he legally changed his name? Signs he signs Don 'The Dragon' Wilson?! Does he get email addressed to him in that name? I think I can do something like this, from now on I will be known as Paul 'The Killer Klown' Andrews ... Night Hunter is one of the crap movies that transcends its limitations and awful to become pure golden entertainment. If you like your movies fun, Night Hunter can be for you if you're looking for big budget tensions in a similar vein (Vampire, blood vessels and blood get it?) Then the Blade & it's successors will be a better choice. What the hell, I liked it so sue me.
