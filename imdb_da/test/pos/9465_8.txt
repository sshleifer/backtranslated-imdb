I must be honest, I really enjoyed seeing that she is the man. Although it's a typical teenage comedy, or if you want to change the sex movie, it had some pretty decent laughs that I think someone could get. Adults and teenagers will enjoy this movie at all. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is your typical rebellious teenager who dresses and acts like a guy, and when she is knocked down to try out the boy's football team, she decides to take over her brother's appearance to prove himself worth the boy's soccer team. Of course, love shows itself when she meets another guy who thinks she is her brother. She also has a girl who is hunting for her. Now the roofline says everything. <br /> <br /> This is a fun little tee drama that I think will be remembered for a while. Amanda Bynes showed something in the movie, it's really hard to really act like a guy. : D That's true! <br /> <br /> 8/10
