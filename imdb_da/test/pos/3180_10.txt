I remember coming home from school to look up and coming, it was the story of a black family moving out of gheto into a class society, the family was the name Wilson Frank Wilson man with his own construction industry his wife Joyce was the bank manager had 3 teenage children Kevin Valerie and Marcus. This was a very good show. It was educational without being a preacher. the show was well written. This show gave us a look at a successful African American before the Cosby Show. Much a black actor appeared on this show from Esther Role to David Hubberd to 227 Stonnie Jackson to name a few. If you can find this show on DVD, get it for your whole family
