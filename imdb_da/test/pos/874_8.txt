I have slowly downloaded the available movies on DVD from both Catherine Deneuve and Francois Truffaut. Both actress and instructor have made some stinkers in their time - fortunately, the Mississipi Mermaid is not one of them. <br /> <br /> In addition to "The Soft Skin", randomly staring at Deneuve's sister (the late Francoise Dorleac), this would be my favorite Truffaut movie. <br/> <br /> In addition to steering, Truffaut also wrote the manuscript. Something that always strikes me about Truffaut is his almost childish innocence when he presents a story - you could almost call it naivety. <br /> <br /> There is a scene at the end of the movie, where Belmondo returns to the apartment in Lyon with the remains of the foliage. He calls the doorbell and Deneuve responds to wearing a negligee. In the time it takes Belmondo to reach their room from the street, Deneuve changes into her dress, puts her best pair of stockings and shoes, then lies on the bed and pretends to sleep. It's a scene that almost comes from a child's mind - but it's Truffaut for you. <br /> <br /> Watching Catherine Deneuve in her late 60s movie is actually a sensual pleasure. She is so extraordinarily beautiful, it is almost painful for us to see. Incidentally, for the fans there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this movie - actually a sinful pleasure. <br /> <br /> I disagree with previous posters. I can't see any 'Hitchcockian' about the movie at all. Regarding the "look" of it - I love the look of the older movie store that was used in the 60s. It gives particular movie of this period a unique look. Recommended for both Deneuve and Truffaut fans ......
