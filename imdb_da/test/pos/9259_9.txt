My favorite political series is constantly becoming a television movie. Does it work? Yes. Gee runs to the mayor and gets shot. The murder "fame hall" appears. Pembleton and almost all the cops who have ever played in this series. Many flashbacks help you who haven't seen the TV series, but it also kills the fans. The last five minutes solve another murder, and in the end two of the dead police are also standing up. And a short look from my favorite choirs Juliana Cox. This is a good movie.
