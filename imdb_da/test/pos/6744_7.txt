In this Crackerjack Noir thriller from Columbia, a combination of Panic In the Streets and The Naked City, Evelyn Keyes is incredibly the killer stalking New York. Evelyn, who smuggled some stolen jewels into the country from Cuba, also smuggled into cups. It is misdiagnosed by Dr. William Bishop, and when they find out what it is, the hunt is for her. <br /> <br /> For most of the movie, the tax authorities are also hunting Keyes, but for the smuggled jewels. It is only at the end of the film that the health department and law enforcement realize that they are looking for the same woman. Evelyn is also on a mission. Her husband, Charles Korvin, has left his apartment, the eerie cut of all that he was fooling around with his sister while she was in Cuba, gathering the jewels and contracting cups. When Lola Albright as his sister commits suicide all over, Evelyn gets a mission, gets Corvine or tries to die. And it's not an inactive threat given the situation. <br /> <br /> The movie was mostly shot in New York as The Naked City, and its cast is littered liberally with many well-known names and faces. Watch out for good performances by Connie Gilchrist as Evelyn's unsympathetic hostess, Jim Backus as a cloudless club owner and Art Smith as Corvine's fence. <br /> <br /> A real noir sleeping sleeper, don't miss it.
