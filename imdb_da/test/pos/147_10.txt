Of the Korean films I have seen, only three had really got stuck with me. The first is the excellent scare A Tale of Two Sisters. The second and third - and now also the fourth - have all been Park Chan Wook's films, Oldboy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, and now Thirst. <br /> <br /> Park kinda reminds me of Quentin Tarantino with his irreverence against the convention. All his films are shocking, but not in gratuitous sense. It is more that he shows us what we do not expect to see - typically situations radically opposed to society's morals, such as incest or a libido's blood-sucking, yet devoted priest. He is also quite artistically inclined to filmography, and his films are among the more beautiful I've seen. <br /> <br /> Thirst is all that is about the priest and the oppressed, unscrupulous woman he falls for - and more. It's horror, drama and even comedy, as Park disarms its audience with many inappropriate but humorous situations. As such, this may be his best work for me yet, as his other two films, as I have seen, lacked the humor element that would have made them more palatable for repetition.
