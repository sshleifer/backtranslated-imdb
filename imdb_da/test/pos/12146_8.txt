"Classes tous risques" is one of the best "gangsters" films that Noirs France has ever produced. Perfect cast: Lino Ventura, a young Jean-Paul Belmondo (who made "A bout de souffle", Godard's thing the same year) Marcel Dalio and a fine support cast, brilliant script by José Giovanni - who also wrote "le trou" Becker's masterpiece same year! What a year for him! wonderful black and white filmography by Ghislain Cloquet. And tight action, first-class led by Claude Sautet, surpassing Jean-Pierre Melville. Where is the latter's gangster movie with metaphysical performance, sometimes lasting more than two hours, Claude Sautet leads men of flesh and blood, and the presence of the two children adds extraordinary moments of poignancy that Melville has never been able to generate . And Sautet avoids pathos, excessive sentimentality: the last time Ventura sees his children coming down into the subway (subway) is a tip of detained emotions. <br /> <br /> Ventura depicts a gangster whos he dies that he can rely on his previous acquaintances, but they are all cowards. We are far from male friendships for Jacques Becker ("touchez pas au grisbi"), which Melville should continue all the time in the 60s - sometimes rooted in medieval women (film noir misogyny par excellence) living in a rat microcosm, clear to inform about - we are far from Jean Seberg's simplistic behavior in Godard's "opus" -. <br /> <br /> Cloquet does wonders with the picture: the scene on the beach in a starless night, when the two children see their mother die after shooting with the customs, is quite sensational. <br /> <br /> There is a good use of voice-over, which Sautet only uses when needed, so the last lines make the end even stronger than if we participated in the scenes. Claude Sautet had found a good niche, and he followed the "classes tous risques" rules quite well with his follow-up "l'arme à gauche" (1965), which highlighted friend turn and made good use of an island island and ship. As he continued in that vein, France would have had a Howard Hawks. In his subsequent works, only "Max et les ferrailleurs" (1971) showed some of the brilliance he was shown in the first half of the sixties. He had been from "les choses de la vie" and up to cinema de qualité director, who used to focus on sore civilians in such works as "Cesar et Rosalie" (1972), "Vincent François, Paul et les autres" (1974 ) or "Mado" (1976)
