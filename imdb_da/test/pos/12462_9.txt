Where this movie is true to Burrough's vision, it is excellent; where it departs from Burroughs, it's great. It is a story of family that a father is sought by a genuine and emotional orphan. Lambert talks about one of the most horrible lines in the whole cinema "He was my father!" is enough to bring tears to the eyes of the most cynical critic. Not a perfect movie picture - the infamous exaggeration of McDowell's voice by Glenn Close is inexorable and only explicitly in the form of a very British mistake - but a fine if it is a flawed masterpiece and a goodbye to Sir Ralph Richardson.
