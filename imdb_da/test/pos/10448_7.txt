Ahhh ... the 80s. 1982 makes me think back to the really crazy time we were facing in America. Fresh from the "Do What Feels Good" 70s, "The Last American Virgin" comes as a wolf in sheepskin as yet another teenage sex comedy from honorable days. Oh, it's sex, but I can't think of another movie - OK, this and the "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" - that really didn't hit time between topless teenage scenes - there were some beautiful things here among the cleavage. <br /> <br /> The movie follows three hormonal friends. Gary (who wants to lose his virginity), Rick (stud incarnate) and David (overweight, but not inexperienced), trying desperately to secure Gary in the world of humanity. But there is a fun thing on the way to the cuckoo - Gary falls to Karen (beautiful brunette who loves the bad boys) and cannot seem to follow any sexual conquest that David and Rick can ease. Only problems are, Rick and Karen get hot and heavy and Karen runs a period. It's Gary who's on her side when she goes to get her abortion, and it's Gary who really cares. But who is Karen dancing with at the end of the movie ... Rick. Uncheck "R" and add a "D" where necessary. <br /> <br /> What differentiates this movie from the 80s we think of is that by God they try a real drama here and not of the "my parents just pulled in the driveway variety." And you know what? I bought it. <br /> <br /> It wasn't sloppy. It was not removed. And when Gary sees Rick dancing with Karen at the house party at the end of the movie, I actually felt sorry for the guy. Our teenager Romeo actually believed in untouched love - and when his heart was broken at the end, it all affected me. <br /> <br /> So all T & A aside there is an actually quite credible and engaging story here. Oscar worthy? Not by a mile, but I don't know that I clump it in the "Let's lie" category. In fact, like the "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" they actually tried to make a real movie here, and let the hi-jinx lie between harvesting wherever it might.
