"Saturday afternoon" is one of Harry Langdon's best known short subjects, and with good reason. It's one of his funniest and best movies. The reason - as it is - is an old staple: A hen chopped man sneaks away for an evening with a companion and a couple of other girls. It's a solid and well-used comedy plot, but the difference here is Harry Langdon himself. His slow, ineffective, populated, innocent character has somehow floundered in a marriage with a woman who feels he must be ruled by all people with an iron fist, and he only strives to cheat on her because he can't say "no" to the admonitions of the chummy Vernon Dent and the cute eyelash flutter of the girl. <br /> <br /> Being imprinted on such a helpless, childish character is a very adult issue. Harry won't cheat, but he can't do anything about it. In a wonderful part of comic books, he can't bring himself to blow the new boyfriend's kissing farewell: he beats the pushed kiss on her underhand and ashamed shamefully out of hand as if to tamper it. The movie is a three-reel comedy, ten minutes longer than the two-reel's Harry Langdon had previously starred in for Mack Sennett, with no more plot. Maybe it was even designed to be a two-reel. It seems beautiful as it gives him as much time as he has to inject the slow reactions and confused glimpses and half-actions where so much of his comedy lives. <br /> <br /> Here he is best here, and the show is really Harry Langdon's curious magic and the ability to spread comedy out of almost nothing. His little half smile, his appearance while handling the money he has hidden under the rug, childish attempts to enter the fight at the end. I think his comedy enables us to recognize something fundamentally innocent and confused in ourselves that makes us feel that the whole world is too much for us but at the same time to allow us to understand what Harry does not (like the fact that women he gives cordially to his friend to cheer him up after he thinks the date has been blown is actually whore), forcing him to realize with a little grief that we are not are so innocent more. His comedy is just as capable of making us listen to say "Awwww" as it makes us laugh, often at once. <br /> <br /> Here, Harry will refuse to cheat on his wife, he will tell his wife whose boss and take some power back in his relationship, he wants to fight back against the two violent men at the end of the movie, but he just can't influence his surroundings so much, and sometimes we all feel like we are. <br /> <br /> The movie is perfectly directed by frequent Langdon director Harry Edwards; It moves at a fast pace and never stops while taking time and presenting for best effect Harry Langdon's ever-reactive comedy. Vernon Dent, a frequent foil for Langdon, plays one of the roles here where he becomes almost a comedy partner in his highly effective pairing with Harry. The gags are distributed in a way that gives maximum effect, and Harry gets his own version of a Lloyd or Keaton style stunt at the end. Here, the comedy is not in Harry's great reactions to the danger of sitting suspended between two moving cars, but in his slowness to take it in. <br /> <br /> This is a hilarious movie and a perfect example of the comedy of one of the most unique talented humorists I have ever known existed.
