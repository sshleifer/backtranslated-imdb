This working girl goes to full-water soap is a time capsule candidate, thanks to her immaculate physical production, the 50's costs (look at all these bows and beads), the creamy Johnny Mathis theme song and oh so bold (for his time) sexual attitudes. Rona Jaffe's novel, on which the film was based, continues to be re-released, and a few years ago Vanity Fair actually dedicated an article to this glorious bonbon of a movie. Take a look at the new DVD transfer and you know why. <br /> <br /> The three leaders - Hope Lange, Diane Baker and Suzy Parker - echo the girls from "How to Marry A Millonaire" or Carrie Bradshaw and her friends from "Sex and the City." "Gentlewomen singers out on a spree ..." Their romantic adventures and sexual disturbances are the things associated with paperback passion: empty caramel corn calories, without nutrition, impossible to resist snacking on. Lange reacts to his neo-Grace Kelly way, Baker is properly dim and idealistic as a jerky virgin who gets (gasp) turned up by a (lift) cad. It helps that the cad be played by Robert Evans, the cold-tempered, cola snorting film mogul, who has probably led many innocent young lambs to the slaughter in his bedroom in Beverly Hills. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker is fascinating in the first half of the movie, all blithe assertiveness and wide-ranging comments. She stiffens her stuff with panache on the fashion icon she was in her 50s. Alas, she's not up to where the movie sends her: to madness and obsession. But she radiates glamor and saviors, and her plays are at least sufficient. One wonders why the critics mocked her, almost drove her out of film a few years later. Perhaps a relaxed attitude from a looking woman is just too much to bear. It sank Ali McGraw's career a generation later, and when you think of it, Ali McGraw and Suzy Parker were pretty much the same actress. <br /> <br /> The only major flaw in the movie is a weak end. It coincides largely in a romantic swim at the end, rather than rising to a melodramatic finish like the other famous soap opera producer Jerry Wald, "Peyton Place", which had Lana Turner crying and rubbing teeth during rape trials. Here Hope Lange walks out on the New York sidewalk, stains burly, forever hung over (but of course soberly) Stephen Boyd and they simply go away ... into the sunset one assumes. Otherwise, it is basically the definition of a guilty pleasure. Oh yes ... there is also Joan Crawford, breathing fire on all the young girls and smoking cigarettes as she shouts at her poisonous lover over the phone. And the titles are made in hot pink, with tape letters reminiscent of the department store advertisements from the late 50s. Do not miss!
