Being a retired medical / health field "toiler in the vineyard" never gets tired of watching this movie. Paddy Chayefsky was a friend of my college comp teacher and visited him and us in several clusters back in 1958. His writing ability has been the time test and "Hospital" is as fresh as it was in 1971. I can see it all week & Still find something new. So many of the supporting cast members went to bigger and better roles in both TV and movie. George Scott made only a couple of comedies, but his timing & tits are just as good as Jackie Gleason & Steve Msrtin. Mental humor rather than physical / slapstick wins in my book every time. And still a family movie with only 1, 4 letter words throughout the movie
