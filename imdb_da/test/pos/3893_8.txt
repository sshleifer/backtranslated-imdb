Not a stunning but a good movie to watch once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act; his letter was pretty darn good. Great supportive cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as the private eye. <br /> <br /> The movie's greatest strength is Macy's work, reminiscent of his Jerry Lundergaard role from Fargo. He has many scenes where he is extremely fun as a slim, manipulative and deceptive character. It is fun to see him being a weasel, and for a while I was glad it was good for him. *** out of four.
