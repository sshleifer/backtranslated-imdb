When I first watched the movie, I thought it would be another Disney movie that almost goes straight to video. I finally got around and rented it. I thought it was bad because I couldn't see Shia in any other role than his recently canceled show "Even Stevens". When I turned it on, I was ready to turn off boredom for about ten minutes. It started a little slow and I couldn't understand the beginning because the years didn't make sense when they explained it later in the show so I was relieved to think about it. All in all I thought it was a good movie and I would recommend it. The cast was top notch, and although I'm not a fan of golf, it kept my attention for a good reason.
