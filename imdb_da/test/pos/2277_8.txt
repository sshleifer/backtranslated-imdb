"Japan takes the best from all over the world and makes it their own" while it can be true, it applies to everyone except one thing, that is ..... Major League baseball .... but don't worry "Mr Baseball" is there to try to change everything. But just who will change who is the part of the movie that really makes it rock! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines in his comic roles. The story can be true to life, but the subplot is dead. The Japanese people are a gentle and respectful people with ways and traditions that are very different from Western societies. All these elements and obstacles combine to create a truly fun, fun movie. It is definitely worth a look!
