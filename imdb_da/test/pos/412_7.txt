Look, this movie is fuzzy, brilliant and a classic that should look for all necessary means. I suppose the powers that have been decided that it will forever be referred to the bargin bin; Nevertheless, we could only ask for the chance to watch this on DVD. I would say that it even beats the big phasma. If you like a dark movie, with lots of scary pictures, look for this and see how an 80's horror movie is supposed to be.
