As a physically challenged person (God, how I hate this sentence), I just happened to catch this on cable where there was nothing else to see - generally it was a great movie. yes, i was a bit disappointed to find out that neither actor is handicapped and yes, i was a little disappointed that more of the movie was not filmed from the true point of view for the disabled (can you imagine what it is like Always be the tallest person in the room and then have to live the rest of your life with the prospect of anything but others' donkeys and steps? Always waiting for the idiot to stop reading the newspaper in the only handicapped stall rude bodily expulsions while you wait?). and the scene with him driving the car was completely me! Been there, done it, literally. but the film was true enough to do something - while I never lived in a home or helped reside, there were plenty of times throughout the movie where I found myself nodding and saying to myself "yes it is true ... "It happened to me ...." What impressed me is that some of the commentators on this forum expressed the fact that the movie made them see life a little different and with a little more insight as life in a quiet "minority" - Can't ask more than that from a movie that it makes you think and see life differently, so by virtue of that alone the movies were extremely successful. should be required viewing each child in junior high school. <br /> <br /> For every person who is severely physically handicapped, independence is one of, if not the most important, focus of our daily lives, from work to socialization to recreating. For those of you who felt the movie was "cliché", try to live our lives for a single day - you will see that the movie was "cliché" because ..... it's true. The challenges faced by the actors only foam the surface of what happens to us every day - if we are lucky, we experience the same emotional and personal growth that the three figures (including the girl) did. every day presents obstacles for us to overcome - it's just that there is no swelling, dramatic music to accompany our lives unless it is in our ipods .... lol!
