The Powerhouse cast pulls the crowd in the theater, despite the scary title. Jake Gyllenhaal visited Conan O'Brien to promote the film and explained that 'Rendition' was a euphemism for information through torture. Since 9/11, "extraordinary transfers" have provided the government's intelligence agency with the opportunity to unleash people undoubtedly without due process and use any means necessary in exchange for information. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaal plays beginner CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (note irony) torn over his job, making him a mere observer of unorthodox interrogation procedures at an underground US detention facility. <br /> <br /> Omar Metwally plays the suspected terrorist Anwar El-Ibrahimi, Egyptian citizen and green card-bearing hubby of American Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi (Reese Witherspoon). Isabella and her son are waiting for Anwar to come home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the plane's passenger manifesto. She seeks help from her college friend who works in the government and learns that the head of intelligence, Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) is behind it all. <br /> <br /> Rendition is directed by Hollywood novice Gavin Hood (who is set to make X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and the question of whether such an extraordinary transfer is practiced in real life. The movie was released locally in the wake of the Glorietta explosion (bombing / mishap?), And a crucial scene in the movie is when a bomb explodes in a public plaza, so it must have shaken up on each movie's spine. Seeing the exploding tableau with a single red and yellow sign Aajala (Ayala?) At the top right of the screen plus the effect of silence and slow pictures enlarged the effect of the scene's real coincidence. <br /> <br /> There are lessons to be learned from this movie and it all boils down to personal decisions we make daily. We have all the choices we can exercise on will, and we often do not always (will) see how these affect others who may end up as unfortunate victims of circumstances. What 'the greater good' is does not have to be a forced choice that our leaders must take if we both already decide right on the source. Now it's a utopia worth building.
