Wow. I have never seen or heard about this movie. It just came on TV (2:00), and I'm completely awe. Setup: A bunch of rich fat cats are out of golf. You hit a ball into the rough. It lands off a NINJA !!!! A tuxedo man goes over to pick up the ball. The ninja takes hold of it. Crush it by hand. Man pulling gun. Ninja pulls blowgun. Ninja blows darts into gun barrel. GUN EXPLODES !!!! This is just the beginning of the greatness, people. Everyone should watch this movie. 10 great ol fat stars from trustworthy.
