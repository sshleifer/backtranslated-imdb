I give this movie 8/10 overall. Visually, it is a large part of that stunning: an art director's dream mix of Hieryonomous Bosch, Salvador Dali, Frieda Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe - and a valid testament to the film's power as a serious art form. Beautiful use of color, shape, image quality, environment and fabulous set of decor, combined with the latest computer graphics. So 10/10 for that! Wow! Well, the plot line is more predictable. You know they want to save the girl and eventually get the killer, but the story is still interesting and pacific enough to pull you in and keep you there. 6/10 for that. <br /> <br /> Squirm factor ... I don't want to give this a rating, but the movie made me doubt and I watched it on video on a TV screen. It would of course have much more influence on a large screen. Graphic violence of a twisted, erotic nature in a surrealistic landscape - although beautiful - is very unpredictable. The world inside the killer's head is not - thank goodness! - my world. Because I watched this movie on video, I could play a couple of sequences and found a lot to admire the second time when I wasn't so nervous about where the scene could go, and I think the whole movie would be worth seeing another Once, just for "visual art". General Suggestions: Do not take the children or conservative grandparents to this, but if you are keen on the visual appearance of movies such as surreal art, do not mind a bit of kinky gore and just want to take a bit of a "mind trip", one is a winner. Oh, and if you're anxious about babies, Jennifer Lopez is pretty hot. <br /> <br />
