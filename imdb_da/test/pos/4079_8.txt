This dramatic drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African citizens who decide to temporarily leave their families by bowing to an outgoing ship. They believe that if they make the journey successfully, they can improve their lives by making money in New York to send to their families. Unfortunately, for them, the ship they choose is a rundown Russian cargo ship, which is already severely fined at an earlier stowage port. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line. The group of blacks begin their frightening journey into the hold and are eventually discovered, forced to hide and murdered by the ruthless buddy (an excellent achievement by Sean Pertwee.) A couple (convincingly terrible leader Omar Epps among them) are temporarily escaping and are relentlessly pursued through the ship with their lives lost if they are caught. All in all, a ripping film that will make the audience bite their nails and rub their teeth and wonder how such serious events could take place in modern civilization.
