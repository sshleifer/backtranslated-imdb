This is a wonderful family sitcom. Rowan Atkinson has appeared in other good sitcoms, The Thin Blue Line (Better Than This) and Blackadder (Not Better Than This). <br /> <br /> Mr Bean is a no-talking human disaster. He goes to places and gets himself in absolute chaos. The complaint includes: Climbing up to the top diving board and is too scared to jump off and take approx. 20 minutes until some children eventually throw him off and end up in a washing machine and drive his car while sitting on a roof. Bean runs a Mini and has a teddy. It was very similar to Baldy Man, a series of staring Gregor Fisher who says very little, but gets himself into mayhem. Best Episode: Do It Yourself Mr Bean, Episode 9: Bean hosts a New Year's Eve, so get some things to decorate his apartment but has too many things and needs to drive the car on the roof.
