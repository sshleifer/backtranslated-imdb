I love these young people trapped in a horror movie house. Not only because I'm a great Linnea Quigley-Jill Terashita fan, but because it's very fun and actually scary at times. <br /> <br /> The special effects are awesome, especially Linnea's stage with lipstick and towards the end, when almost everyone is dead and possessed. Lots of nudity provided by Linnea and Jill, lots of humor, cool soundtrack, high body counting etc. By the way, if you have never seen this, try and buy / see the Unrated version, which has several gore and some scenes, the rated version is missing.
