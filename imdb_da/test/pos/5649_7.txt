I saw this in 1993 on a VHS tape but have not been able to find that any source page. This is a very bleak and uncompromising look at the last days of the Japanese army in the Philippines. Anyone interested in the Pacific War would do well to watch this movie and see what conditions the other side struggled with. From what I can tell, this is historically accurate and shows how easy men can get into complete barbarism. I understand that the Japanese army was completely cut off from a re-supply in the Philippines before 1945, so there is no doubt that many of the horrible events depicted here have happened. I may not have been able to identify with the movie's characters, but I appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive. If I were to compile a list of the ten greatest war movies, this movie would be on it. See it if you can get it.
