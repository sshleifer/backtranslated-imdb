This concert is the type of concert that only comes around every 20 years or so, Madonna's Confessions on a dance-yellow era will surely be remembered as one of the highest points of his career. She is 48, and she simply looks divine, she stops the dancers, who are nearly twenty years old her junior. I'm also very happy to report that all the songs were sung live, which is good because she actually sounds better live. Each song was so unique, the visuals where stunning. The performance of 'Live to tell' was amazing and amazed me, 'Isaac' was exotic and beautiful and was rich in political symbolism, the Arab horn, the American eagle was free. I especially liked the rockin performance of 'I Love New York', I was almost in my living room and cheered when she told her critics to suck George Bushes ****. And then again I was impressed by 70's inspired music (inferno remix). This spectacular decedent concert made a fan out of me. <br /> <br /> Rating: Highly recommended with H.
