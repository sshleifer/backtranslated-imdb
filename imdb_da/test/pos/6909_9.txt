I watched this movie as part of Midnite Madness at Sitges. Seen in the 18th century England plotted Arthur Blake's life from his first outing as an apprentice's tombs to his final announcement on the eve of his execution. The plot moves through a series of misadventures involving Arthur and his partner encountering various creepy characters and bizarre situations. <br /> <br /> The first thing that strikes you about this movie is how precisely they managed to capture the look of the Hammer period horrors, the atmosphere is set with lots of train-covered cemeteries, rowdy taverna scenes and excellent sets / costumes design. <br /> <br /> For a movie titled "I Sell the Dead", I expected the weight to be mainly horror? Don't make me wrong, there are some jumping moments and moves, but the tone is very comical, driven by the situations in which the characters enter and their dialogue. The closest comparison of the scenes between the two leads (Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan) is the character interaction seen in the classic English comedies Only Fools and Horses, Two Ronnies and Morecambe and Wise. is strong, and the casting of very familiar faces in Ron Perlman and Angus Scrimm lifts the film over many of the others seen in Sitges. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie gives something quite different from the current crop of mainstream horror and will leave a smile on your face.
