I recently attended Sundance, which I have often done in years past and was treated to the small pleasures of the small, small indies, the glut of dark comedies and the now predictable portraits of dysfunction. But then I saw Mark and Michael Polish 'Northfork', and I remembered why I fell in love with the movies in the first place. 'Northfork' sweeps across the screen with visionary bold and harkens back to Terence Malick's early early work and Antonioni's existential landscapes. It is an impossible movie that can easily explain what is one of its many strengths. Suffice it to say that it is an adult adventure with many carefully crafted levels of importance. It reawakened my imagination and cast an impressive shadow over all the other movies I saw this year. It's a work of careful craftsmanship and a sophisticated writing not seen in most American films. I plan to revisit this movie several times when it comes to my neighberhood theater. For it is an abusive piece of magic and mystery, a ghost work where you can move across Montana because of angels and the nature of heaven and earth. The cast performs this luminous piece of striking conviction, especially James Woods and Nick Nolte, who remind us of the nervous and daring look of their career. Perhaps 'Northfork' will help us find a new wave of American cinema, where excellence in craftsmanship and writing becomes more the norm than the exception. See it when it comes your way and take your friends to the questions will be many, and the thoughts and feelings that are spurred by seeing 'Northfork' will awaken large-scale memories that are once seen in your past and hopefully can return with the emergence of Polish brothers.
