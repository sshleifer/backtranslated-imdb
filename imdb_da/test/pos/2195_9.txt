The pleasure that is Stephen Sondheim was never shown more prominently as it was in his 1979 "Musical Thriller" SWEENEY TODD, a gothic, gory, grisly, yet delicious musical concoction about a demented hairdresser returning to London to settle Vengeance on the evil judge who not only had him permanently banished from London but who also raises his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to "protect her from all the evil of the world." The hairdresser finds love, sympathy and help from a lonely pie shop owner who has his own agenda where Todd is concerned. This musical rocked Broadway and won nine Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Actress in a Musical (Angela Lansbury). The production was filmed in its entirety in 1982 with Angela Lansbury recreating her Broadway role as Mrs. Lovett, the daffy pie shop owner who finds a practical use for the heads Todd makes meat meat out of. George Hearn, who replaced Len Cariou on Broadway, is electrifying in the title role, so much so you have to wonder why he didn't originally cast the role. Lansbury and Hearn rivals from start to finish and commit 100% to their ghoulish characters helped, with Sondaheim's first score, probably the closest one Sondheim has written to an opera. Lansbury shines on "The Worst Pies in London" and "The Sea". George Hearn stops the show with "Epiphany" and is also convincing under "Pretty Women", a duet he sings with Judge Turpin, the man he has vowed vengeance. Cris Groendahl is vocal impressive as Antony, the young sailor who saves Todd and falls for his daughter Johanna. Betsy Joselyn is a little over the top as Johanna and really pushes vocally to the point that under "Green Funch and Linen Bird" she actually drives her voice off-pitch in a moment. The rest of the cast is, first and foremost, especially Edmund Lyndeck as judge Turpin, who gets to perform "Johanna" in this production, which was cut from the original production and Ken Jennings as Toby, whose beautiful tenor fills up on the auditorium at "Not While I am around. "But it's a breathtaking musical score by Stephen Sondheim and the fascinating performance of Lansbury and especially George Hearn who makes this night in the Gothic musical theater an experience that stays with you long after curtain calls. Not for everyone, but if you are a game and have a strong heart, SWEENEY TODD is a joy to all music theaters and a must for fans of Stephen Sondheim and Angela Lansbury.
