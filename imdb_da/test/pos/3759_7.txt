"All I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ..." scene was a rebellion. I also guffawed on stage at the bar, where Hyde sniffed the horse's radish and turned the bird to the Japanese guy and said "Pearl Harbor buddy". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure I can't count it high. <br /> <br /> Fun, this 10 line requirement. Seems like they would bash you to make your comments too long, not too short. I hope I don't make it 1,000 words before I get to line 10. <br /> <br /> I'm still two lines short. Excuse me while I think and drink, or drink and think. It depends on whether my hands are faster than my mind. Well, I think I've made it to the 10-limit. Thanks for reading!
