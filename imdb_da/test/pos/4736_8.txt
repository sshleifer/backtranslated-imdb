The movie someone had to do. <br /> <br /> Waco: The rules of engagement dissect the evidence behind the stoppage in Waco, Texas, which led to the destruction of the British Davidian home and the alleged government grant. br /> <br /> The first thing to know about this movie: You will see short but disturbing photos of victim bodies. This is not done for shock value, but to illustrate points about how they died, as if you were present at the forerunner's investigation. <br /> <br /> The second thing you should know about this movie: at two and a quarter hours, it's pretty staggering - especially if you've already followed the events close to time. If you are not aware of any of the events other than that reported in the mass media, or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report, you may need to see it. If, on the other hand, you want a more concise (albeit unapologetically one-sided) version of the events, see "Waco: The Big Lie". In summary, this is basically the final documentary about this tragic event, and is very sober, but as a work of film making could test your patience, especially if you have a short attention. And it is sometimes superfluous for those who watched the CSPAN hearings and 60-minute reports. <br /> <br /> Perhaps someday somebody will make a documentary covering some of the alien aspects of this story, such as the bizarre chain of events that led to the ATF raid or the psychological war tactics, the FBI used rock music on the sect, and their charismatic leaders (all rock musicians themselves) pick up their instruments and turn their massive amplifiers outward to blow their own music right back on them.
