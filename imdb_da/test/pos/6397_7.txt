This show was crap when it first came. The first actress who played the daughter did not fit the role, the writing was hit or miss, and Damon Wayans CLEARLY was not so comfortable doing such a cornball family-friendly show. The chemistry between himself and Tisha Cambell (they are friends for a long time, just as all the Wayans clan with Tisha's husband and Will Smith and Jada Pinkett) have worked so they switched the show. When they returned, they changed their daughter, made the son much dumber (a la Eric from "Boy Meets World") and made the youngest daughter a genius ... (later they gave her a little genius girlfriend to make comic guest shots) ). The show, while it is often, if runways from the top buffoonery to corny go the line enough to keep it as a show that you can see Damon Wayans be comfortable in their own skin on the set (especially since the main writers, directors and consultants were all members of the Wayans family) and in his character. When everyone had been on the show for a while, they worked for everyone in the strengths of the forces and could make a consistent fun show in the air. But there are too many buffoons, too many over the top antics, and often there is too much chaos in the Kyle family. They made juniors too early, they also made the oldest daughter an attractive, clumsy idiot from time to time, and the youngest daughter was not even spared by the authors. I feel like they jumped over the shark and signed the show death order when Junior got her boyfriend pregnant, she moved in, and he married her and the parents were introduced. (Junior's wife's father's character makes me WINCE just thinking about him). The show remained fun ... but it was a UPN show on ABC if it makes sense to the reader. <br /> <br /> Reruns are funny enough, but I'm relieved it's past ... there was nowhere to go with it. When it's bad it's really bad. It tends to be cornball at times, but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom making it a syndicate on a large network. Who can say it for himself now? (In view of the CW merger and "brownout" on TV networks lately). One.
