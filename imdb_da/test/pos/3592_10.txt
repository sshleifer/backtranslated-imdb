The BBC's Blue Planet is simply jaw-dropping. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say it contains some of the most beautiful scenes ever recorded on film. From well-known beings on and near the sea's surface to some more irreversible and just simple bizarre in the dark depths, nothing is over. With a weight of 8 hours, some people might check out the edited highlights brought to you by the movie "Deep Blue", but I would highly recommend giving the series a try. I don't think it will disappoint, and if your kids enjoy the aquatic world brought to them by Pixar's Finding Nemo, I'm sure they'll love this too. I just wish everyone tv was this entertaining.
