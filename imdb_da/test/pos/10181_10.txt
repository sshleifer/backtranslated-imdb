While all Fleischer / Famous Studios' "Superman" comics are excellent, "Billion Dollar Limited", the third in the series, is probably the best of the party in terms of overall animation, plot and pacing. Why was it not even nominated for an Oscar as the best animated card for 1942 (Amazingly only the first one was unexplained). Here, Lois Lane is awarded for the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the United States Coins. Masked gangsters in their super-powered (before 1942) car leave after the train, determined to get it gold. Without giving too much away, which ensues is a thrill ride for both characters and audiences, with truth, justice and Superman triumphing at the end. As they did in all Fleischer / Famous Superman cartoons, Clayton "Bud" Collyer and Joan Alexander, who played Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane on radio, voting here has sleeves here, and Fleischer's perennial Jack Mercer also gets a bit to do as a of the evil ones.
