The first time I saw the poster, I was stunned by its calm and beauty. Then the city of Istanbul has been reluctant in my mind ever since. <br /> <br /> Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole movie was shot as extensively and aesthetically as a sculpture. It is in itself a landscape. In fact, there are many things going on in the movie, but the director deliberately omitted the most dramatic parts and left them to our imagination, creating a really flat life. ** (mild spoiler) One can see Mahmut's women's dress crying in the toilet and then go out without a word but not their fight; one can see Mahmut accompanying his mother in the hospital, but not her fight from disease. The most dramatic scene in the movie for me, yusuf laughs out loud for the toy soldier he bought for his niece ** and that was when it almost broke my heart to see this boring, lonely life eruption in such a way. /> <br /> With all the trivialities of life vieded, the story tells us with the pure inner world of all the signs, their sadness, anxiety, loneliness, regret ... And as history unfolded, I finally finally found their desperate situation where their emotions really were no way out, if no outer thing went into each other, which every single person tries to keep at all costs, especially for an irresponsible artist like Mahmut. <br /> <br /> I just finished my second look. Yesterday evening I was in my quilt, had some Vodka next to my bed and went through the whole movie in trance. I felt two real life going on, one outside the screen, one inside the screen. I felt free from all the loneliness and fear because the people inside saw it. I had just removed from all those things. We cannot deny the universal communication problem, and loneliness even puts us far in the direction of it, and it becomes a vicious spiral. I bet Mahmut still didn't find a way to live in the end. Therefore he went out of his room to find the answers from the outer world, cold and landscape.
