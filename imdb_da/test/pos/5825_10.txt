Oz is the TV show, which is intensive non-stop adrenaline. Its a show that is not aimed at a large audience but one particular as its themes is highly adult oriented. Of course, it did not achieve general success, as this was impossible, but had great fame with the audience and many famous actors, either guest stars or became part of the show. Oz is a series of fictional stories based on a prison located somewhere in New York state. There are many different ethnic groups that play a somewhat equal role in being represented. These groups are Muslims, homeboys, Aryan, cyclists, Italians, Latino, Irish, Christian, gay, and others. Some have some form of connection to each other, such as the cyclists and the scars, while the scars are the numerous groups of the enemy, such as Muslims and homeboys. <br /> <br /> In Oswald Penitentary (Its official name) there is a policy that must not be too many members from any ethnic group. It is the maximum security prison and the permanent prison where sometimes prisoners are sent to or from the show, called "general population" or "gen pop". The main character of the show is Augustus Hill, who also tells the story before and after the main segments, crossed between a documentary type and a biographical. Hill is tied to wheelchair use due to his unknown past. He is part of the group "others" that contains people who do not fit into the other prison bands. Of the many groups, the smaller ones are able to stay away from most problems. of the times the larger ones are in conflict with each other. Are few of the most notable signs as follows: 1) Ryan O'Reilly is responsible for his fellow human beings, and somehow he is voluntarily involved in fatal activity for the weakest connection. 2) Miguel Alvarez is the watched Latino who constantly struggles to handle his popularity within his own gang and with others. 3) Simon Adebesi is the Nigerian who was the former leader of the Homeboys band. Hes also very physically quite big and solid. These two reasons are why he is one of the most powerful prisoners inside Oz. 4) Karim Said is the Muslim and black nationalist who is very defined in his opinions and desires. He fights for his people's rights at many levels throughout the show, from his own Muslim group to his wider black group, and even fights for all the groups against the unwarranted rules of authority. He characterizes in some ways identical to Malcom X, the famous Black Rights Fighter, who was also a Muslim. All in all, Oz may be the largest (fictitious prison show or ethnic relations show). If it does not sound like your own type of series, it probably should not be tried, but if it does interest, then it is definitely worth seeing. The biggest problem with the show is how it is addictive, some may feel wrong by seeing much of this kind of material. Scientists argue whether it is harmful or not, but ultimately it is only a reflection of society in the world we live in today. This means that it is like an informant and an indicator of the world than an aggressor.
