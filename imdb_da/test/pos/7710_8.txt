Detective history is not typical of the Matrix Universe. It is a film-noir-esque private eye story with a strong narrator and a very rich feeling. Rich in the visual appeal. The snow scenes, grainyiness, bump into the whole eye. <br /> <br /> But what about the story? It's interesting, even if it feels a little out of place. The agents hire a private detective to track Trinity. He finds out that they tried the entrance before, but with dangerous consequences for the rented detectives. Still, he tries to find her and eventually succeed through Alice in Wonderland references and hackers and chat rooms. Then things start to get interesting ... All in all, this is a perfectly satisfying short animated movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
