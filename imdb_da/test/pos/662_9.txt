OK, so the following review is more of a synopsis more than actually containing any spoilers, but better safe than sorry to avoid being blacklisted, right? Right! Consider officially warned and read on ... In this parody / tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history - the 1980s - a group of stupid teenagers are gathered to host a session of House of the Notorious Murder McGee his whole family a few years back and buried them in the backyard. As I'm sure you can guess, things go from bad to worse faster than you can say "Where's the beef ??" And in typical 80's horror movie fashion, the deaths are bloody, the dialogue is cheesy, and beautiful women take their clothes out of every chance they get. Good times ... No clicks or 80's horrorfilmklich√©d characterizations are not represented here. In fact, no stone was left at all ?? we have the cool heroes, his innocent girlfriend, Goth chicken, the hard chew (think John Bender), the hot blonde who continues to lose her shirt, the shy dork in love with the blonde who keeps the loss on her shirt, one couple of beautiful half-naked lesbians and two big nerds. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the molding is quite large. Usually, larger moldings where things can be quickly separated are with one or two acidic apples that bend up the entire barrel. Not in this case, however. Not a single cast member left me disappointed. The action was very well done. Everyone from the cool heroes of his Thriller jacket played by Jovan Meredith to the great Goth Chick played by Renee Dorian to Geeks One & Two, played by Cory Assink & Jonathan Brett ?? they all played straight, brought their A games and knocked it out of the park. If you are a fan of Gary & Wyatt in Weird Science, you will immediately fall in love with the geeks. <br /> <br /> CEO / co-author Jeff C. Smith is a guy looking for in the future, trust me this. If this is what he can do with a low budget, there is nothing but good things ahead of him when he gets more money for future projects. The signs were dead; the atmosphere was perfect; the laughs were great; blood flowed and sprayed and beautifully sprayed ?? It was like watching a horror movie from the 1980s. Call this "THE BREAKFAST CLUB MEET THE DEMONES NIGHT" !!! The roofline says it all and says it honestly - "EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE, GRATUITOUS NUDITY, ZERO BUDGET" - no false advertising here, people! As fans of this genre, we must look to the Indians and support these hard-working people who break their humps out there and bring us original tales so that we will never get stuck in a world filled with large studio watered down PG-13 'horror' or meaningless remakes like The Hitcher. No, thanks - no more for me. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must honestly say that STUPID TEENAGERS MUST DIE! is by far one of the best indie flicks I've had the pleasure of seeing this year. It's a bloody good time and stops repetitive prospects. From the dialogue to the signs of the wardrobe ... even the final love theme of the final credits (as if it does not bring back the ridicule reminiscent of mid 80's power balloons of REO Speedwagon - over-pronounced Rs on each word starting with the letter "R "- then I eat my DVD right now) ... the bottom line is if you are a fan of 80's horror or horror in general, no more hesitation - it deserves to be in your collection !!
