My college theater just had a special screening last night in this movie. I have to say that I think everyone was impressed by how good this movie was. Although my roommate did not like it, but he is not in horror movies and just went to see if Paris Hilton could act. By the way, if you're worried about it, don't be it. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I have to be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actors were very good. I'm not going into details for the plot, since I'm sure you know it. Surpirsisngly, the characters are pretty engaging and you usually care for them, especially Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray's characters. We meet them as rival siblings and end with them having to work together. Another plus is that it does not have the slim look of the Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre and feels almost documentary-like rather than a music video. (Don't forget me, I loved Texas Chainsaw and enjoyed Amityville). <br /> <br /> Now to death scenes. In most slasher films, when a character is stung or killed, the scene immediately cuts to another scene, but not in it. When a character is dying, they die pretty horribly. But the filmmakers do not stop there and add a little extra each time for each victim. I won't say anything about death scenes and let you see them yourself. <br /> <br /> Though this is a fantastic slasher movie, it has the flaws of almost every slasher film (exploring a creepy house when you don't have to be, driving a suspicious character, splitting and screaming so the killer can hear you). There is also a kind of stupid plot twist that was unnecessary and did not add the movie at all. You could tell it was just added at the last minute, and if you took it out, it wouldn't have affected the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Basically, if you're a horror movie fan, watch this movie. You will not be disappointed. It has everything needed to make it a great slasher movie, possibly the best of the year, even though it's a little early. The thrill is felt and it is sometimes a fun movie. If you hate horror movies, chances are that you like this and if you are shared, I urge you to give it a shot.
