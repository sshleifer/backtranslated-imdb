This is the best comedy season. It is so undervalued! Clever witty humor, Great casting! Jerry Stiller is the jewel in the show, he is so incredibly fun and quirky, just a comic genius! Doug and Carrie have good chemistry! I can't see what the hype is about when it comes to Everyone loves Raymond, it's so overrated with lame jokes that are forced most, and just not the witty show, I can't remember laughing for more than 1 episode. King of Queens is a rare comedy that has all the right ingredients to give you severe stomach grin which is usually caused by Arthur Spooner, I think over time this comedy comes to the hype it deserves and not the lame Raymond & CO.
