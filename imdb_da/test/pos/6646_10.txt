Bergmans Skammen is one of the most realistic depictions of war ever set for film. This is not an action movie in any way, although pacing is faster and there is more action than most other Bergman movies. Nor is it a romanticization of war or patriotism, unlike most war films. In fact, the gritty realism and the conscious ambiguity of the character's loyalty are a very modern feeling. Shame is a darkly lit movie that should be seen at night to let it work it's magical. Many of the effects are transmitted indirectly, but so effectively that some scenes compete in intensity for a contemporary, grim big movie like Saving Private Ryan. Of course, the action in the Shame is on a much smaller scale, but it is impressive, but it is nonetheless. <br /> <br /> While the film-making style feels modern, the movie's feel feels timeless and plaque. The war-torn landscape, and even the still intact provincial cabin can be anywhere, anytime. And this film is not so much about specific historical events with specific names and dates, but about universal human reactions to adversity and chaos. The spectacle in the Shame, but typically impressive from Ullman and Sydow, is not of the greatest importance in this film, unlike most other Bergman films. Through much of the movie they are spectators, much as we are. Bergman has war on them and through them in the audience, and their reaction is perhaps what any of our reactions may be. <br /> <br /> Recommended. 10.10
