When the episode was made and aired, Eisenhower was president. Kennedy was presidential. <br /> <br /> Regarding the episode, it was an acceptable episode, if not a little serious. The "professor" does not show much scope here, and it all seems to be a little hasty (many episodes of TZ do not seem to fit the time slot, some think they are wrapped up and hurried, some with little or nothing to the scattered over half an hour, and some, of course fit). I think you just expect a little more excitement than being taken back to some rooms and drug. But generally a decent episode. In fact, "what if" the motive for time travel is a nugget in itself and sets off the table with basic interest. 7 out of 10, considering that there were many TZ episodes that were not as good and some much better.
