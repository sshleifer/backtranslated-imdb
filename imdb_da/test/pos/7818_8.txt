A charming film enhanced by musical and vocal background, especially during the competition. My understanding is that there was never a soundtrack, but using your sources, could you advise me on where to get information about the singer and the likelihood of getting a copy of the song he sang. Your help would be appreciated. The song touched me and my wife and we would like to make a copy where possible so we can play it as background music when we have our family and friends over to our "Italian evenings". If you are able to get this information to us, we would be forever grateful. Although you can advise on the study contact, so we might go directly. Regards, <br /> <br /> John Payling
