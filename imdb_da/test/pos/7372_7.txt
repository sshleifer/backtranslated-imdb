"Campfire Tales" basically consists of three creepy stories that a group of friends say after they enter a car accident in the woods after a concert. The film begins with the classic "Hook" story, and then we are introduced to the group of friends who drive home from the concert. They collide their car, put some flares out and start a fire in a small abandoned chapel and wait for someone to come up with help as they warm up at the fire. To pass the time, they decide to start telling classic horror stories, about terrorized honeymooners, a girl in exchange for an internet computer and a motorist taking refuge in a haunted house. As they tell the creepy stories, each story is becoming increasingly scary, but the real shock that awaits them has yet to come. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the last story they tell is probably the scary and had some real, scary effects. The first story was okay, and the caravan sequence at the end was a bit scary. The other story built a lot of excitement, more than any of the others did, but it is unoriginal plot where it is downfall. I remember watching the movie a long time ago when I was eight years old at HBO, and the third story scared me out of crap, even though it's not scary for me now. You will probably recognize some of the casters here, especially Amy Smart from the opening "hook" interlude story and Christine Taylor as one of the greatest actresses in the movie. The twist ending was also interesting, I know I didn't, so I thought it was quite wise. <br /> <br /> To sum up, if you're looking for a horror movie worth while renting this, you should be happy. It is a great anthology of some classic urban legends, and the whole movie was tied together nicely. It is much better than you would expect. 10.7.
