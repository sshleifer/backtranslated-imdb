One of the best, Lackawanna Blues <br /> <br /> Great movie, great cast, good music, this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over, you would wish it would continue For another 90 minutes, I will w3atch this one many times. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that takes you from the start and twists and turns you emotionally throughout the function. The casting is extraordinary without the weakest hint that someone is uncomfortable in their role. You get the sense that you really are there and take all of this. Great care was taken in the set sets, costumes and music. The relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the film continues, but Mrs Merkerson's stable performance is so powerful that the film ends before we have had our fill of the wonderful misfits. Exhibiting other than "Nanny" is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors, including: <br /> <br /> Jeffery Wright, Jimmy Smits, Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo. But it is Marcus Franklin, Macy Gray and Ms. Merchant who makes this a wonderful experience. The movie is moving fast and is short of today's standards, but it is undoubtedly one of the best movies you see this year. If you like good pieces that will challenge you emotionally, pull in your heart, lift you joyfully, and make you tap your feet at the same time, then that's the movie for you. I've shown it to more friends and they'll all have my copy, it all says the movie is so good. Check it out yourself. <br /> <br /> danceability-1, Amsterdam Holland
