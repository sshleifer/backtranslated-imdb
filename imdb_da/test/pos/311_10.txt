This film changed the art of making movies and tells a complex story in a powerful new way. The film blends brutal realism with imagination, linking a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolor smoke. The film does not use music as a score later, but as a practical part of the scene played from speakers, radios, etc. Coppola uses a classical literature as inspiration, takes scenes and characters and sets them in completely different environments. It's a difficult and brave thing to do. Then he takes a superstar, Brando, pays him a fortune and film him so you can hardly see his face. The pure courage that such a move requires is amazing, and it works beautifully. This movie belongs to the top ten.
