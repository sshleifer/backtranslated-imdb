Imaginary Heroes is clearly the best movie of the year. It was a complete and complete joy to see. I was riveted. The whole audience up at Sunset Five was riveted when the movie ended no one moved, talked, nothing. I think this movie is a perfect example of the power of drama. Especially as much as it sets an example of the quality of drama / work in this younger generation. <br /> <br /> There were moments in your movie, many like at least seven, where I was hit by such great beauty, emotional beauty that I couldn't actually breathe for a while. And for a catharsis junkie like me, it's about the best censorship I could ask for. It is the result of powerful, masterful storytelling and direction. Like heavy stuff, like Burtolucci and the guys. <br /> <br /> Each element of the movie fits closely together. There was no mistake at all. The molding was fantastic. I've been a big fan of Emile and Ryan for a long time, and I thought they've never been better. I was / will be / will be continuously stunned by this movie. And I promise I will pull any person I know to see it. It should be seen. It must win prizes.
