I managed to get an original BBC broadcast of this movie on video and loved it so much I had to try to find the original video in its original box; Thanks, go to Ebay. <br /> <br /> Deleted in any format since 1990, this extraordinary wildlife movie is nicely designed and well-acted. Stewart Raffil (MAC & Me) directs the scenes of jumping tigers running through the Alaskan desert, nothing less than stunning, and its timeless tale of stairs trying to survive alone in the frozen waste of two young tiger cubs is moving further each view. <br /> <br /> Why no major company has downloaded this movie to distribute on DVD is a great wonder; But make it so special to know it is also difficult to find. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie by chance or eventually track it to add to your collection, be sure to never let it disappear from your understanding. Films of this caliber, as shown, do not come often. <br /> <br /> A true masterpiece in every sense of the word and greatly appreciated by its acclaimed comments, "WHEN NORTHWIND BLOWS" will sink deep into your heart as soon as you see it.
