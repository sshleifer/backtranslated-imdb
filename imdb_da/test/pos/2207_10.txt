Dark and gloomy sets, exciting music that cuts through your spin as aknife (or razor) a perfect cast lead by Broadway greats Hearn and Lansbury. This is exciting theater that is mistakenly transferred to the small screen. Sondheim is the most talented songwriter of our age, and Todd is his masterpiece, from the British opening ball to the dark humorous law I finale - "A Little Priest" where Lovett and Todd fantasize about the victims who will win in their meat pies, this games never cease with excitement, excitement and satisfaction. Betsy Joslyn also distinguishes herself as Johanna, even she, since the games restore a little crazy. Edmund Lyndeck becomes a bravado priest as the corrupt judge who lusts for Joslyn and is the subject of Todd's vendetta. Lansbury and Hearn order the show as only two good actors / stars can do. Other musical highlights include Todd's "John" Lovett's "Worst Pies in London" and Act II opens "GOOD THAT'S GOOD" and it's a title to describe this production!
