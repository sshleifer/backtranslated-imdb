The Late Shift is a great book I read the book several years ago, and I was transfixed to cutthroat debauchery that happened when Johnny Carson retired, and Jay Leno and Johnny Carson tried to get their place. When the movie came out, I snagged a VHS copy of the movie, and after reading the book recently, it's hard to say what I enjoy more because they are right in the amount of information being conveyed. The two main actors, John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, two actors that I have never heard of before, and which I have not heard of since, play Leno and Letterman convincingly, despite the fact that Letterman's dismissal of his depiction is poor. They play the parts quite well, despite many people looking for an imitation of the two. I was not that interested in it. The story is what counts. And that brings me to Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates, playing Helen Kushnick, is this movie. She plays this evil bitch of a character so threatening you realize how on earth this woman can control herself, much less a national television show. Yikes! There must be a successor !!
