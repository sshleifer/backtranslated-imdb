Nothing better than an android that boasts 80's technology and a history of history that draws your thoughts from the depth of your mind-front and center to being captured in captivity by a beautifully gracious cast. Growing up in the 80s gave me the invaluable opportunity to see the overthrow of "not quite human" on many special occasions. Considering that my parents were never present during the shows, I would guess that I would most likely not enjoy it as much as I did as a child. So maybe it's a movie to dig out your VHS collection and the hand of your kids. It can be found on the same tape as "The Apple Dumpling Gang" and an episode of "Tour of Duty", that is, if you record in LP mode of course.
