If you like horror or action, watch this movie ASAP. If the opening scene does not get your adrenaline pump, someone should check your heart rate. Great Action, excellent casting and top one liners. This is the only movie I've seen in a movie theater where the audience applauded every chop, kick and punch cast. Not perfection, but who cares when movies can be so much fun. It's a pure rush of dark cartoon action. 9.10
