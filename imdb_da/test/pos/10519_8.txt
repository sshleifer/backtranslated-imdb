I've been trying to remember the name of this movie for years and years. Finally, read something today, 03/09/2005 that mentioned Stacy Keach's name, and it reminded me that I saw a movie he was in 1974 at the Atlanta Film Festival, so I made a Google search for Keachs movie and found The Gravy Train. We were going to see Duddy Kravitz at the Film Festival, but for some reason they couldn't show it, and instead replaced The Gravy Train. We were very disappointed that we couldn't see the very hyped Duddy Kravitz and hadn't heard anything about The Gravy Train and haven't heard anything about it since. <br /> <br /> But I remember we were pleasantly surprised at how well the movie was, and as I remember it was quite humorous. Would love to find it on tape.
