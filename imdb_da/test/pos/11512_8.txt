Reading the other comments here on IMDB, I had very high expectations before I saw the 'angels of the universe'. I was not disappointed and giving the film an 8, I would say I can justify this character. <br /> <br /> The movie has some incredible actions, especially by the protagonist Pall. The support actors also do a very good job as patients in mental institution, parents and siblings in Pall. The music is also worth mentioning, supports the film all the way through and gives depth and feeling. Although the film is very Scandinavian, it does not go out of humor and has some kind of objective writing about Pall's life. Still, if you want to see a cheesy comedy or some light, it's not for you. It's a story about people with mental problems, about how they are treated in society - but most of all a story about Pall. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to every film expert. It is one of the best films ever to come out of Iceland, if not outside Scandinavia.
