I am NOT one to like these anime cartoons (eg Pokemon, Dragonball Z, Naruto), but Zatch Bell is different in my opinion. Seatch Bell is more exciting, has better characters, and doesn't focus much on a kind of weapon or Mamodo as much as the episodes I've seen, such as the "Big Brother Kanchome", "Zatch vs. Kiyo" episodes. Seatch Bell really focuses on the life of the weird Zatch, The Smart Kiyo, The Clueless Suzy, and WeIrD Ponygon.Zatch Bell is probably my Fav Cartoon for now, but I encourage others to watch 1 episode of what you will most likely like the! <br /> <br /> -Robbie H.
