First of all, this is an art film and a good one. I loved the presentation and the way it was shot. Very cool. Some scenes were some of the more graphic horror sequences I have ever seen. This movie scared me, not because of excitement or shock, but because I was deadly afraid that I would soon see something that was really appalling. It happened in a few places, but mostly in the beginning. This movie also went off and 74 minutes seemed to be long. But if you are into movies, you should see this. So far I haven't seen anything like that. 8.10
