The muppet film is an instant classic. I remember the opening scene with the bird's eye view of the swamp and Kermit, which starts (in my opinion) the most beloved song in the history of the song. At this point my mother will always sing along with Kermit. <br /> <br /> When you see this title as a young adult, it makes me smile. I can still sing with the desire of my heart. Like many Muppet movies, there are jokes for adults who are (in my opinion) still fun today. My favorite line all the time is actually from this movie, it's the last line spoken by my green, goggle eyed hero Kermit "Life is like a movie, Write your own end". That's what I'm going to do!
