No matter how you feel about Michael Jackson himself, you can't deny that this video is the most unique video all the time. There is no other video that is even close to "Thriller" The first time I saw it was when I was 6 years old and it scared me badly. Now I see it with a smile because I can now appreciate the wonder it is. I love this video and it will be around as long as there are music videos. I think everyone should sit down and watch it at once and look back and see how big it was, especially to be 1983.
