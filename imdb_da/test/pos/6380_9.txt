For all purposes and purposes, 'Teen Devian' may seem like another lightweight Bollywood musical. This could to some extent be true, especially because the producers had to be sure that the film was successful with the masses. But somewhere behind the scenes, either Sadashiv Brahmam (who had the idea for this story) or Amerjeet (who directed the film) decided to turn to the usual formula and even succeeded even in their expectations. br /> <br /> It's not just about a beautiful man flirting with 3 women, indecisive about who to choose as his life's partner. Dev Anand's character was really in love with each of the three women at different times, and they with him, despite being aware of the other two. Dev Anand's relationship with Simi and Kalpana is particularly interesting - as each of the women is going to trust him greatly. There are a lot of suggestive teasers in the stars 'body language, which makes imagination dependent on the viewers' maturity. The theme is surprisingly adult and after all it was ashame that the end was pretty much, of course, designed to please the masses and cushion the criticism.
