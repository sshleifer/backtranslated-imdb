"All men are guilty," said the chief. "They are born innocent, but it doesn't." Add this bit of nihilism to Jean-Pierre Melville's fascination with the idea of ​​the crook of honor and you have Le Cercle Rouge. However, this cluster of villains is not just a cliché; It is the imagination of fantasy, although the film moralists - realistic moralists according to their point of view, romantic moralists of most others - began to make films on the subject. Their theme is that it is not what you do, but how to do it. We usually settle stories of experienced men with their own honor, stories where fate, fatalism and the code run things. <br /> <br /> For most of mankind, except screenwriters and film directors, this would seriously interfere with living one's life, raising children, and being a good friend. This fashionable fatalism is something of a self-giving concept. Le Cercle Rouge is, in my opinion, a classic movie for people who can secretly enjoy the adventure that just lacks the last bush home. But where Melvil's Le Samourai - Criterion Collection is, in my opinion, stellar dominance, Le Cercle Rouge handles the great trick of combining style with a strong storyline and with convincing actors. The point in the movie is in my opinion nonsense ... but the film itself is a first-class experience. <br /> <br /> Melvil's hopeless tale of three villains - Cory (Alain Delon), Vogel (Gian-Maria Volonte) and Jansen (Yves Montand) - is based on some wisdom that may be attributed to the Buddha: That all people who are destined to meet, will ... along with their destiny cannot change. Maybe because some think Melville even came up with the wording, if not the thought. In a sense, we know from the outset that this movie does not end with success, will depend on the fate and chance of setting things up for us and letting us remember the nihilistic philosophies we discovered and loved when we were in high school. When Corey and Vogel meet and then gather in the unique talents of Jansen, we are on a one-way trip to steal an exclusive, highly protected jewelry story at Place Vendome. The excitement arises because we not only know that the French police are after Vogel, we also realize that some particular villains are after Corey. <br /> <br /> The great joy of the movie came to me from admiring the work that Delon, Volonte and Montand brought to their characters, and the intelligent recklessness that Andre Bouvril brought to his character, police chief Matthew. Melville hooked me when he developed these characters and their own situations; he built me ​​emotionally and released me when he brought me to appreciate their probable destiny and let me see that it happened. Melville establishes his sets of pieces - escape from the train, escape from the forest, the later shooting in the forest, the meetings with Matti and a man who refuses to inform - with exciting opportunities. He builds tensions in all these cases by taking his time; a rare feature in film making and an even rarer feature now. And Melville takes the time to build Mattei as an individual. Mattei is a rueful, experienced man. He's a lonely. He has a set routine when he returns to his apartment - he lovingly greets his three cats, pulls his bath, and as the tub fills, he lays food to them. I don't know who Matti is going to meet, but I hope someone likes cats. <br /> <br /> Nihilism is always fashionable among some creative people and some critics. In most cases, I think it is a much harder task to put nihilism aside and simply live one's life without harming many people. (And it's even more challenging to show convincingly in a movie.) Le Cercle Rouge is a movie that tells me a little, but it's in its own way, I think, a beautifully composed movie.
