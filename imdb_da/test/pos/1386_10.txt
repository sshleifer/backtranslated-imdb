GZSZ is the longest running daily soap in Germany, and it's cool! I started to see it from the first day on and I was hooked on it right from the start. Over the years, so much has changed, the old characters like Heiko, Elke, Tina, Saskia, etc. Left, and new appearances like Marie, Kai, Cora or John. I have to say that I liked GZSZ better in the years 1995-2000, because today the show focuses too much on the younger characters. My favorite character is Sonja Wiebe, because she is the most disgraceful person who has ever been on soap, and she is also one of the most interesting characters on the show. Tina Bordihn was fantastic as the first Sonja, but when Tokessa was reworking Sonja, the character was even better.
