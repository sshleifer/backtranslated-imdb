Writing about something so wonderful is quite difficult. In fact, it is almost impossible to describe the properties of this film. This is a wonderful story of sex and sex, and it is almost incredible that we are not dealing with obscene scenes of sex. Feeling, this movie was made for people who like to feel and just to feel life in all its complexity in a beautiful simple way. We look at it, and something begins to grow in our minds, even our hearts: it is a pure poem. I've seen some "gay" movies, and I almost always became very dissatisfied with unnecessary scenes of sex, not because I don't like scenes of sex, but generally they are so pornographic that I'm forced to believe that the director or The producers or the author of the script believe that homosexuality means perversion. Nagisa no Shindobaddo is completely different from them. Three are the main characters. We have Ito, Yoshida and Aihara, two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle. Ito likes his best friend Yoshida, Yoshida likes Aihara and Aihara likes Ito. Imagine what this could do in unprepared hands? But on the contrary, Hashiguchi presents a magnificent story that goes deep into the philosophy of life and adds a question to our mind that made me think astonished at the end of the movie: Why? And that is why it has been expanded on several issues inside my brain and the inside of my heart. The scenes, which in fact sometimes tend to be boring, are moments of the most wonderful poem that we can feel, but totally incapable of writing down words. And maybe because of that, we can't understand the issue at the end of the movie. I'm sure this movie wasn't made for us to discuss every piece of it ?? Some people will understand a movie that almost dissects it. Others are so accustomed to regular "American gay" movies that cannot appreciate the real value of this masterpiece. See it, close your eyes in the credits and feel, everything, feel yourself, feel the wonderful song. For all this and much more, I give a nine. And I just don't give ten, for ten out of ten is perfection. But I admit that I almost did.
