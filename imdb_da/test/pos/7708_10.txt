This is one of nine shorts on the anime disc, "The Animatrix." It's my favorite. The artwork is amazing. The black and white, slightly grainy texture perfectly captures the mood that the segment is trying to portray. The story is tight and the end is true to film noir. Overall I gave The Animatrix a "7", but this segment deserves a "10."
