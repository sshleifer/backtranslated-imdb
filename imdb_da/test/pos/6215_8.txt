In the spirit of the Great Rumble, but a few years earlier. Hot Fudge was one of the psychedelic children's shows I grew up on. Seymour was a large, fuzzy, green puppet with a crescent smile with huge teeth that almost split his head, I remember him wearing a variety of Elton John types of shades. He "played" the piano, and had a Jesus watching guy in a white tux sitting next to him. They wanted a moral discussion and then make a song about it. <br /> <br /> Remember not much else except for the opening theme, Seymour and Hippie. <br /> <br /> No one else I know remembers it at all. I grew up in Jersey, so if it was produced in Detroit as a previous post, it wasn't just local. Seymour reminded me of a lot of Sherlock squirrels from Magic Garden (another psychedelic kids show, if ever there was one.) People always talk about LSD's effects of music and movies from the 70's, but it seems that children's show printers also got a dose.
