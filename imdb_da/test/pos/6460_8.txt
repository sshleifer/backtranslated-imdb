The reason why this movie is not better known and appreciated for me seems because of its subject. Because of its controversial issue, this movie never got a proper release and is still a fairly unknown one to this day. Not that it is the subject, it is controversial now more though. Basically, it's a movie about a white man turning to a black man. Friendship does not seem forced or unrealistic, but the way it is portrayed in this film makes it all feel really real. We see that these different ethnic groups interfere with each other, as if it were just normal. Unfortunately, of course, it was not back in those days that it was not really considered normal. Seeing a black man talking to a white girl and just having fun with her as a friend must have been difficult to see for example for some proportions of her 1957 audience. You can really understand why Sidney Poitier has always been and respected so much by the Hollywood community and the black community in general. It is, of course, one of the reasons why he also received an honorary award at the Oscar in 2002. In his films, he often fights discrimination and prejudice, of course "in the heat of the night" as the best example of this. A real role model that has certainly inspired many African American players to this day. But on top of that, he was also a great actor. Yes, he is still alive, but he is quite retired from film now it seems, since his last credited role is from 2001. <br /> <br /> This film was Martin Ritt's direct debut, and he was not given either too much movie to use on his movie. The studies were probably also a little reluctant primarily because of their concept and / or because it was Ritt's first film. Or maybe it's simply because MGM just wasn't that big anymore and it had left its best days behind them. Already since the 50s at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, sort of had the reputation of not making for big and cheap movies, but in the early years it was truly one of the biggest studies with many stars and acclaimed instructors attached to it. who made many award-winning classic films. Fortunately for their reputation, their reputation has begun to change, and when the MGM logo appears on a movie, people no longer expect a smaller movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever, even with the limited budget and limited resources they've managed to make a great movie out of it. The movie is very simple, with only a few characters and a simplified plot in it. However, the film still manages to capture you with its history and subjects without beginning to preach or anything about it. It also makes the film effective with its subjects. <br /> <br /> Really a movie that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10
