This movie felt so real. I have actually felt all the emotions portrayed here in my life at different times - both for Rory and Michael. I have the Duke's muscular dystrophy like Rory, so what you see here is exactly what I actually felt myself. Some will not believe there are disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them. <br /> <br /> The story is amazing. For a drama, character-driven movie, the story goes fast. I was never bored, maybe partly because I saw things close to my heart. But I think most people with intelligence will be glued to the screen and worry about the characters. The action is phenomenal! James McAvoy is perfect as Rory O'Shea, who has the Duke's muscular dystrophy. He Steven Robertson deserves a prize for his depiction as Michael Connolly, who has cerebral palsy. <br /> <br /> Michael's love is not returned by a girl, and Rory helps him get to it. I have felt it many times, and the question is "doesn't she love me because I'm just not it or because my disability has extinguished her?" Whatever the girl says, we will always be skeptical of the truth. It's just natural and it hurts in both ways. <br /> <br /> A few parts made me cry a little because it's sad and I have to face the problems myself. People without a terminal disability just can't begin to understand how it can feel. This is a must-see movie for everyone. Disabled people are everywhere and strongly misunderstood. This film brings a little light to some of the facts of life, which are then taken for granted by the talented. We want to be like you - to live on our own terms, to go out to be full, to be loved. On the outside we can't do much, but on the inside we dance!
