Just before dawn is one of the really good slashers that send chills into your spine every time you see it! This movie has great excitement, great plays, very well done camera work (good work Mr. Lieberman!), Which makes an extremely suitable slasher! Even though it's low during the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it's over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked right! And the fist of mouth death left me stunned! Overall I give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars! If you're looking for a gore party, don't look here. But if you want chills, send your back back, see this. There are 6 deaths and one you can't see, but it gives you thoughts of thinking "how was she killed?" The stranded theme reminded me of 1977's Hills having eyes that came with the same concept, but in the desert with cannin bals. But still fans slasher, give this forgotten gem, I promise you, you will be staisfied!
