Le conseguenze dell'amore (2004) is a beautifully made film that takes small, carefully positioned steps towards the end to be savored in order to be enjoyed. From the contrasting landscape to the tightly closed world in which the hero is located, we are taken by the director and checked right from the moment we enter the hotel. We, as the hero, will never escape the calming intensity and paradoxical monotony of his criminally-driven, mafia world. The fact that the film resists Mafia stereotypes as they revel in them makes it even more successful. The concrete grave, the inevitable brutal executions and overwhelming maleness have been exposed to what they are. Just brutality and business, and no more. Life is about being part of the company's machine, which is organized crime and not about love or living for yourself, family or others. Our hero is actually a hero because he gives his life for the sake of the beautiful barmaid's touch, the decision of the misery, his only neighbors suffering from the hotel and to escape his decorative prison. The consequences of love are actually beautiful and brutal at the same time. See it!!
