The Italian job is a real blast to see. It's a really entertaining movie, something you just see for the pure enjoyment of it. It is not heavy with drama or emotional hand weaving, it has no cosmic statements about life, and it is not violent or prophetic. It's just a funny movie. Between watching the little Mini Coopers fly around the crowded streets of LA and the big bits of stereotypical computer-geek-turned-crook (the game pleasing to Seth Greene), I had a lot of fun watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Special kudos for the background music. They really set a masterful tone for such a movie, so subtle but keeps you on the edge when needed. Apparently, many artists contributed to the music, I found it to be the most classic part of the movie. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Not impressive but a great movie to see at the end of a miserable day at the office. <br /> <br /> Barky
