I think this show was right on the money for me. I saw it over the plane, but there were parts of the movie that made me control me from tearing everywhere. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Richard Re and Diane Lane was very credible (great plays on both)! I loved how Diane Lane's daughter also acted in the show. She showed maturity and how she transformed through the show was easy to believe as a teenager could be as in real life. <br /> <br /> I loved this show from start to finish. Definitely recommended to the romantic people out there!
