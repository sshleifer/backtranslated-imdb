I couldn't disagree more with those who say this is a miserable movie. Me and my friend went to see it during the film festival in Stockholm, and it was actually one of my favorite films during the festival. Dolls used in horror movies are nothing new, but I have not seen that many films were as well done as it is in this movie. The atmosphere, the setting, the actors, the camera. Everything is just beautiful. And they work really well with each other. Now if you expect this movie to be another Grudge or Ring then you probably won't like it. But if your next to a good, stylized scare it is perfect. Although it is pretty predictable and sometimes ridiculous, I still recommend it to anyone who likes horror flicks. Go see it. Now.
