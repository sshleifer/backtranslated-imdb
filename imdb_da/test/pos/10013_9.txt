I watched this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival 2002. This seemed to be one of the less popular films at the festival, as it turned out, the more interesting. <br /> <br /> The story of an actor trying to address herself and his environment after retreating from drug abuse is based on factual facts. Moreover, the people who play in the movie, the real people who live this experience again, this time to the movie, which is partly created as a stage game. Not only are they all random good actors, Jia Hongsheng's parents are also real-life actors. The methods used to highlight their relationship with Jia are very effective. Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some Chinese action movies in the late 80s starting in the 90s. Later you can see him in great movies like frozen and Suzhou River. Between these two careers, Jia becomes a drug addict and loses everything to act or even do something productive, except to do some vain attempts to become a guitar virtuoso. I like the way the author of the scenario chooses to emphasize his behavior after retreating rather than the horror of drugs. We really feel the pain and struggle that Jia is in. At the same time, we hate him for the way he treats them around. <br /> <br /> The movie draws the viewer in a tiring pattern. Jia seems to be trapped in, pulling with him his parents and sister trying to take care of him. Because there are personal interviews with the characters we feel we know Jia not only through himself but also through others. <br /> <br /> The movie has a heavy feel, but scenes from Jia bikes through Bejing and partying with his friends brighten the tone. It also makes the bitter humor in many events throughout the film. The music is beautiful and stayed with me a while later. This is a movie that may not easily appeal to many people, but for those interested in the more serious and modern Chinese films, this is a strong recommendation.
