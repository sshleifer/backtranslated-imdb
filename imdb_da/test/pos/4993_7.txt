Everyone wants Duvall and Jones back, come on! Viewers say things like, Zahn and Urban are not so deep ... Puhlease! Were you so deep when you were young? That's the whole point: They have a lot to learn. Zahn and Urban pull out of the low innocence they were instructed to act, and with excellent commitment to retain the nuances of Duvall and Jones' input to the characters. Zahn is flagrantly perfect as the early Gus, and Urban is subtly perfect as the early Woodrow. What a bold move it would have been for them to take such a position in the entertainment industry. They must have known that they would get everyone down on them not to be the beloved originals, but they obviously put the best effort forward. I gave it a 7 because editing was chopped in places and timelines were sketchy, but the actor was a joy to watch. Val Kilmer was absolutely fantastic. One more thing: I expect the audience would have accepted more of the mystique implicated by the occurrence of a jaguar and blue and gold alma if more effort had been put in the way they appear and so simply accepted of the characters.
