Well, it's about as good as they come. There are arguments as to whether Hitchcock was just a "commercial excitement champion" or perhaps "compulsive technician" - or was he really "deep". No one knows exactly what terms it means, but it is legitimate to ask whether he could not have been all three things at once at best. In this one he appears to be at its peak. Almost anything in it is unintentional. It is bound by doubts, ambiguities and jokes. And the story is spectacular, Patricia Highsmith has apparently complexes similar to Hitchcock's own. I'm sure the plot has been thoroughly outlined elsewhere so I won't bother going into it. I just want to point out five on-screen events that Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible for. <br /> <br /> Bruno Antony (Walker) has followed Miriam (Laura Miller) and her two boyfriends to a carnival at night with the intention of killing her. She has noticed his attention and is innocently flattered by it. <br /> <br /> 1. Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through the Tunnel of Love and then to an island in the middle of the lake. Walker is just behind them, smiling, in his boat - Pluto. "Pluto". It is not a reference to the Walt Disney cartoon character. It is a reference to Pluto, also called Hades, a god of the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology. This little touch cannot be an accident. And the "underworld" that Walker represents is not just a literal hell, but the human mind underworld. I hate to say he's a jungle "shadow," but that's what he is. (Does Carl Jung watch this movie? He lived at the time of the release - but certainly not.) 2. Now it's a deadly serious order, right? Walker is a lunatic who is killing a woman he doesn't even know. Imagine how this would have been put out by most directors. A nighttime stalking through a crowded carnival, stealing from shade to shade, the killer is looking behind the back walls and so on. What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker first comes through the gates, concentrates on his victim, a little boy runs into a cowboy suit and holds up a balloon and shouts: "Bang! Bang! You're dead!" Walker puts his head in surprise and slips down indignantly on the baby. And when the baby starts to walk away, Walker kills his cigarette by the balloon and pops it and then continues his pursuit without a second glance. It's a way Hitchcock deals with impending death. <br /> <br /> 3. The famous stranglehold is reflected in the fallen glasses that have been monkey-counted numerous times. <br /> <br /> 4. Miriam and her friends stop at one of the devices you are pounding with a large fence and pick up a kind of hockey puck to measure the strength of your stroke. One of her boyfriend whams it and the puck does not reach the clock at the top. Under Miriam's joyful and admiring look, Walker smiles and rubs his hands together, then he picks up the moth, knocks it down, and the puck beats the bell. She's excited. He puts the hall down, looks at her, laughs and WAGGLES HANS EYEBROWS on her as a ten-year showoff! 5. After the discovery of Miriam's body while whistling blows and people robbing, Walker leaves the carnival and meets a blind man waiting at the edge. Walker takes the old guy by the arm and leads him across the junction where he roughly holds his hand to stop the traffic. A macabre joke. <br /> <br /> These events and others all take place during the ten or fifteen minutes of carnival visits. (Robert Walker's performance is unusual throughout.) It's essentially a kind of invitation to be noirish. (Cf: "Rid the Pink Horse") But the threat on the scene is undercut by Hitchcock's insistence on irony and distance. None of the well-known noir techniques are used. There is nothing really "scary" about it. And the murder itself is hardly a wild one. I don't think any director other than Hitchcock would have handled it like he did. It would have been all threats and shadows, hiding places, abortive attempts, scowls instead of grin. Not a completely flawless movie. A flawless film is not yet with us. Some of the middle section is a bit slow and Farley Granger, although a good guy is blunt, dull and pretty stupid. His new girl friend is just boring. Hitchcock was treating the misunderstanding of guilt with deadly seriousness in "The Wrong Man." I'm not sure Hitchcock has ever thought about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt. The latter was imposed on him at an early age by his Catholic education. "Original Sin" - You're gone with it - and all that. In filming interviews, he always happily explained his fear of the police and the authorities generally by telling a story that his father took him to the police station to put a scare into him after some peccadillo. We are entitled to ask if it was only what the psychoanalysis calls a "screen memory". I hope you get the pun. I know I know. It is strained and unfortunate, but I have spent a great deal of time thinking about it.
