MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have attached in my head over the years and finally decided to investigate what pleasantly surprised and was also surprised by the people involved in the production. If I remember correctly, we had to look at a UHF station and that meant using a converter these days UHF not part of regular television to tune into the local station to watch the comic big deal in those days that made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects Gerald used to speak. A great memory from 50+ years ago. I have to see what other memories can hide on the web. By the way, I try to do computer animation that's where johnl3d gets into the picture
