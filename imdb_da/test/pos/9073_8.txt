Flatliners left a pretty impressive impression in my head. The story is fast paced and leaves you constantly absorbed and many times quite excited. Its about five notable student physicians (especially Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon) among whom, one of them has devised the mechanism of the remaining dead (or becomes flat) for a few seconds and then comes back to life. <br /> <The procedure is quite complex involving an abundance of medical knick-knack injections, electric blankets, oxygen masks, and a variety of esoteric medical terms. I strongly suspect that the doctors have spoken all these words so they will never have to be beaten. But the fun they follow is KISS (Original version for engineers: Keep it simple, stupid) (Extended version for doctors: Keep it stupid, simple) too. With the risk of being euthanized by some medical doctors, let me continue. <br /> <br /> So the first guy who gets the flat hope hopes to find the answers to life, which philosophy and religion cannot convincingly answer. He hopes to have it answered (and become famous) through applied science. He flat lines for about two minutes and then comes back into our world left completely shaken. During death, he has a vision of an incident when he was young, leaving the strongest impression on his life. He killed another boy when he was accidentally a child and he still feels responsible for it. <br /> <br /> With the success of the first flat line, others follow that each one expands their flat time further and further to test the limits of how long one can remain dead and experience life after death . At the same time, monsters from the past and the future hold back to haunt them after their flat screen experience. The first flat-liner is haunted by a young child who tortures him when he is alone. The other, who camera all the women he took to bed, watches TVs constantly playing his videos. The third is haunted by a young girl he teased in school. The fourth is haunted by her suicide-dead father for whom she feels responsible. Everyone is driven crazy by these haunting and obsessions and believes that the past seems to want to avenge them. The main focus on getting flattened is that your entire life passes through your eyes, currently "dying", whatever stage it is, and you are left with the strongest impressions of life in your mind. Since they did not die, these strong impressions somehow revived and have become the focus of their lives. <br /> <br /> All of them somehow come to terms (and turn off) their former demons. All of them, except the first one who discovers the only way he can move through life, are slipping back. During this flat-line session, he sees himself flat for the first time and also sees the boy he killed and tried to kill him this time. The boy kills him this time for a few minutes and has sought revenge. For a few minutes in the movie, one wonders if he comes back. Fortunately (because most of us like happy endings) the boy removes him from his past and he returns to life again.
