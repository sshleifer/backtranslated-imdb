When the long run 'Happy Ever After' ended, its characters - 'Terry & June Fletcher' were revived to the longer-running and more popular sequel - 'Terry & June', even though their surnames were changed from Fletcher to Medford. <br /> <br /> Terry has received a new job and as a result, he and June move to Purley, where they end up in all sorts of scrapes - unwanted guests lose by visiting at an inconvenient time when the boss asks For dinner and Terry try to chance his arm at DIY, but cocking it up every time. A fellow IMDb user branded this show as "not wise" and "never well written". Quite enough, it wasn't wise, but it was the whole point. As for "never well-written" - some of the episodes were pretty substandard, I would admit, but generally I found it to be extremely well written, very entertaining and very well-acted. <br /> <br /> It was hot heart slapstick, no different from the later BBC sitcom 'Keeping Up Appearances'. Eight different authors contributed to the nine series and gave the show plenty of opportunities. Terry Scott was a comic genius that he proved well in productions such as 'Hugh & I', 'Carry On' film and of course here! June Whitfield was also a comedy legend in itself. <br /> <br /> I enjoy some modern shows, ie 'Still Game', 'The Catherine Tate Show', 'Legit' and 'Empty'. I even enjoyed the 'alternative comedy' - 'Naked Video', 'The Young Ones' and 'The Comic Strip Presents', but I'm more inclined to enjoy vintage comedy like this. Humor that you don't have to think about is great for feeling down and lifting yourself up. To the post was 'Terry & June' wonderful things. Particular note should be made about the captivating theme melody that made the mood of the show very good!
