I watched this movie since I was a little girl and was from New York and remembered how people lived back and left many good memories. This movie is not just about an adventure that ends, but understands the struggles to become a better person, woman and provider that Claudine tried to be. It was about the welfare system putting women in a binding situation. It was about the injustice of a system that invaded and demanded a family to remain transhipped. Diane Carroll was nominated for an Oscar for this role and it was deserved. If you want to experience a strong family with conflicting but amazing bonding moments, you can enjoy Claudine. Your goal as a viewer is to keep an open mind and understand the general frustration.
