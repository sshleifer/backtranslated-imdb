The case with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. <br /> <br /> Humor is a very "like it or love it" brand of completely political, irreverent and self-explanatory type. Personally, I absolutely love this movie, and then everyone I have met who has seen it. You can see it several times and choose new gags every time. The humor is both audio and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humor is probably much English, and especially London, so it is possible that non-English viewers might not get any of humor. Think of yourself as a teenager and you will love it - especially if those like Kevin & Perry Go Large tickled you!
