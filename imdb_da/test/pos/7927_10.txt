Tom Clancy uses "Alesandr Nevsky" in his book "Red Storm Rising". In the book, Nevksy was exhibited in theaters across Russia as a prelude to the Soviet invasion of West Germany. I felt I had to check it out. It was excellant! The cinema was magnificent and the story incredible. I'm not sorry to see this movie and added to my collection.
