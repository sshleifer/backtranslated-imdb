I suppose, when I saw this episode, I had seen enough Twilight Zones to make it work out already. There is this odd composition of figures located at the bottom of a cylinder. They are fine until a supernatural soldier appears in their midst. It is his primary directive to escape, and he encourages the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the cylinder. There is much discussion about purpose and reason and speculation on their past, but no one can remember anything. They represent different jobs: a beeper, a ballerina, a clown, a man in a tattered hat. Why are they there? It leads to an adventure and is resolved in the end, but I think I had a good idea before it all happened.
