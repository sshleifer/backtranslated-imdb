I totally disagree with the person who first commented on this movie. for me, this story is about a man with growth hormone disorder who tries his best to look for the love he longs for. He tried his best to fit in with society, which did not seem to accept him. <br /> <br /> He met a person who treated him with the best of love and was shown the way to receive the love he had always wanted. The man who created all the happiness in return got something important from the giant who is family and spouse love. <br /> <br /> And the comedy is just part of getting the audience to feel some laugh bugs on a particular part of the show. <br /> <br /> I have to admit it made me tear a little.
