This movie surprised me. I make it a habit to find as little as possible about movies before I participate because trailers and reviews give spoiler after spoiler. All I knew about entering the theater was that it was a documentary about a long married couple, and that IMDb readers gave it a 7.8, Rotten Tomato users ranked it at 7.9 and the critics average one amazing 8.2! If not, they undermined this little gem. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker Doug Block decided to record his parents "for posterity" and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the necessary interviews with his parents, incredible mother Mina, and less than future father, Mike. I immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker (Mike & Mina's son Doug) was going to take us. In fact, I doubt Doug himself knew where he was going with it! <br /> <br /> Life takes unexpected turns and this beautifully expressive movie follows the journey. It's hard to verbalize how much I was with this story and the unique way it was told. Absolutely nickel from the beginning to the end, and it's really a must-see even if you're not a fan of the documentary genre. This movie will make you think of your own life and maybe even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten. "51 Birch Street" is one of the rare movie experiences that gives a deep impression and never leaves you. The best news about everything is that HBO had a hand in production, so instead of playing for a limited art house audience, eventually millions of people will have a chance to see this incredible job. BRAVO !!!!!!!!
