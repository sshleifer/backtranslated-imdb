As a former Highland Rugby player (HR), I feel I may be able to answer some of the issues and confusions that have been made. I think I'm also able to give an insight into the club and the back stories. Oh, and it will be a long post, I can already tell. <br /> <br /> First, the people who said the movie doesn't show real rugby have a valid point. The movie is full of bad tackles, people in the wrong places and more. If you want to know what a true rugby game feels like, you won't get the best idea from this movie. But things are, too little to actually sit down and watch a highlighting roll or jump into a game itself, will not be satisfactory. It's Hollywood, not ESPN! Really how many sports films really make you feel like you're in the game? Not many I've seen. I think it's important to remember that the movie is about rugby players, much more than rugby. Haka is so much a part of the Highland Rugby. It's not something they just threw into the movie. To be honest, I don't know how the tradition started, but Highland emulates all blacks in many ways. The uniform is also based on the All Blacks. The film didn't do a good job of explaining Haka's origin, and to be honest, I don't think it's right. But I can tell you that every member of the team knows exactly where it comes from and what it means. As for the person from China (?), Who said that only one Maori can perform a Haka, I suggest they take a look at All Blacks and tell me if they think they are all Maori. Believe it or not, Utah has a very large Polynesian community, and a lot of them like and play rugby for the local teams. I'm even part of Hawaiian. Whenever possible, Haka is led by a Maori. The team doesn't do it because they think they are maori, they do it because of some of the problems shown in the movie. The concept of unity and "those who have gone before" is a large part of the HR culture, and the message behind Haka, for any of those who know it, supports these values. It is a chant of a boss who believed he would die (Ka Mate) and those around him who support him tell him he will live (Ka Ora) and increase him. How appropriate it is for a bunch of white boys to do so is not for me to say, but that is the ideology behind it and why it is done. "Kia Kaha" is also a well-used team motto, even though the actors found it difficult to say so. <br /> <br /> Also, for those people who questioned Highlands Rugby gaming skills, I would just remind you that you didn't really see Highland games in this movie. Many of the extras were former players from Highland and other teams, but the main characters were all actors. Believe it or not, Highland is really pretty good at what they do and quite well respected in the international community. Granted, some years produce better teams than others (that's what one would expect with any sports team), but you don't accumulate HR's win record by just being okay. The year after I graduated (1998), Highland was one of the 12 teams invited to the World Schools Rugby Championship in Zimbabwe. The teams were handpicked from around the world and represented the best of high school rugby talent at that time. Of course, Highland did not win first place (New Zealand did), but they managed to take third place in the tournament and beat the Tongan national masters in their last match. And while American rugby can never reach the talent level that New Zealand or South Africa has, third in the world is also nothing to keep its head on. Highland also has a tradition of traveling New Zealand every few years and usually returns with more winnings than losses. The majority of characters portrayed in this movie are based on real people and real stories. I watched this movie with my brothers, who also played at Highland, and between the four of us we were quite sure we could identify almost every protagonist. No one knew a white Rasta. Of course, as this was not a documentary, Hollywood took some freedoms, but to tell you the truth, not as many as you might think. The film was actually quite accurate in showing the 2 and a half hour daily practice as well as the compulsory personal running and weight training. Sometimes it really ran until you slammed. It also showed service and other team activities (such as the chuck-a-rama buffet), which were very much part of team binding. <br /> <br /> And finally, the movie, in my (of course very biased) opinion, was a pretty good movie. And I think the reason for that is that I saw it as an inspiring sports movie. I didn't think it would be a pure rugby movie or an academically award-winning drama. It was just an uplifting movie about a rugby team, complete with morals, encouragement, and a good dose of jokes thrown in for entertainment. I hope I have dealt with some of the problems people have had with the movie and hope you can enjoy it now. <br /> <br /> Kia Kaha
