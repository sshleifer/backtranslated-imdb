Obviously, my rating for this is not to suggest that it compares to the classic horrors of people like Argento, but with the other 70's low budget, running in fare and in that department it's really a classic. The lack of money shows (Should anyone worry too much?) The action is appropriate rather than professional (Does it make it more realistic?) But unlike so many other movies and not just low budgets, it does not pull for a moment. Crap it may be but not stop crap, in your face crap and although inevitably a little campy at times, this is a must see for anyone who has an idea of ​​what I'm talking about. At times quite scary, this crazy little movie filled with crazy characters is clearly made for fun and fun, it's actually to see.
