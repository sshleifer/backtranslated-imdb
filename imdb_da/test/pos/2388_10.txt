I watched the movie the second time on September 30, 2006 and thought it was even better than the first time I saw it. I thoroughly enjoyed the play, especially "Uncle Benny". I thought Fred Carpenter did an excellent job of writing and managing this movie. The story has certainly kept your interest, and I hope this movie does it all the way to the top. I felt that it was moving very smoothly between scenes and the surprise twist at the end, well, let's just say I didn't. I also thought Craig, the actor who played "Eddie Monroe" did an excellent job and I hope this movie will help him move on in his acting career. From start to finish I thoroughly enjoyed it.
