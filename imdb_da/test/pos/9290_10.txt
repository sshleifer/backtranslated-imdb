This show is not Stop hilarity. the first joke will make you wet with the pants. And that's probably the weakest joke of them all. I started to see it as the second half of Season 2 began to escape. and immediately. I'm hooked. only 2 weeks after I started to see. I downloaded episodes and bought the DVDs. Reoccurring Clips As "Ad Road Test" and "Current Affairs" are quiet hilarious. Then there is the ad they take out "Use Emo. Use your own tears for more efficient use" Also fun in politics. Nothing is wrong with those who do this. it is fun. Any Australians who do not find this fun. Don't complain and don't see it. ALL Australian tones on Wednesday at 9 am on ABC
