This movie is extremely fun - Momma's character keeps me back to the movie time after time! I can't get enough of her dry lines ... as when she tells her son Owen to bury his friend in the backyard before he smells the place ... and her suspicion that Owen is trying to kill her by giving her unsalted nuts ! It is fun! <br /> <br /> If you like movies like National Lampoon's Vacation, Uncle Buck or Planes, Trains & Automobiles, this has similar humor. It's a good and healthy laugh ... a must see!
