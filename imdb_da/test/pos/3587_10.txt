The Blue Planet series is undoubtedly one of the greatest documentaries ever made at sea. For five years, filmmakers have worked tirelessly on the series, getting recordings that have never been seen by anyone (ie in the title The Deep.) I strongly recommend that you watch this series. To see the angler outside the small pictures shown in the textbooks, it is really a treat, but only a needle in the large haystack of the sea covered by Blue Planet. From the open sea to the tidal basins, the coral sea to the deepest darkest part of the sea itself, the BBC takes the viewer on an almost magical journey through the ocean. <br /> <br /> I must admit that one of my earliest dreams in life was to be a marine biologist, and after seeing this series, the dream was revived. I have been studying the oceans of this world for years and have seen countless documentaries on coral reefs and dolphins, whales and crustaceans. But on the whole, no one has managed to capture life under the waves as well as this group of people. See the series "Blue Planet" on the whole, I promise you won't regret it.
