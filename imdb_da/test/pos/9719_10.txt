I remember my dad recruiting these episodes on video. My whole family loved them, and now that I have moved from home and have my own life, I try to share those amazing Jim Henson creations with my husband and stepon, but as I begin to find out, not everyone is a Henson -fan. It's a shame as it means they just have to start searching for this series. But even if they do not find these interesting, I strongly recommend anyone to get the narrator. You will be lost in a world of tales from a time when people could only talk about inexplicable situations through stories and how people should take care if they were ever faced with these situations.
