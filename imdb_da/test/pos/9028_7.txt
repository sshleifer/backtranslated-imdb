This is not a serious movie and does not pretend to be, but it is not as bad as some of its reviews, it is the title and the first ten minutes lead you to expect. <br /> <br /> The reason is very stupid, but it adds to the jolly fun and enthusiasm that runs through the movie. The characters are played sympathetically, and although they do make a typical teenage fear, they generally avoid the sick sentimentality usually found in this movie genre. <br /> <br /> Unusually placed in London, sympathetic to geeks, this is well worth seeing if it happens to be on; If you want something heavy-in-kind silliness and don't mind suspending your disbelief.
