Most of us children growing up in the 40s or 50s were western buffs, but it was someone who fled me until I watched Movies for Men Channel today. I loved the film's history, filmography and the amazing casting of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. starring alongside the always reliable Ward Bond. Apparently, this film was the inspiration for the later television series 'Wagon Train', which again showed Bond as the wagon's chief went west. Johnson steals the movie with his horse racing, and it's nice to see an actor make his own stunts as Ben does in this movie. Other notes include the lovely Joanne Dru as Denver and an early non-speaking role for James Arness, who later became famous for his Marshal Matt Dillon's role in 'Gunsmoke.' If you like movies of this genre, you don't like this one.
