Naked City: JWAB does a great job balancing its two A-B stories, even though I'm not happy about more plot movies. And Scott Glen and Courtney B. Vance make a big screen double. However, I'm not sure what kind of message a movie sends when two flat maids can get rid of scott free with murder, theft, and to get it to win a free flight home (in first class no less - in anyway from the look of their attire anyway). Gee, I suppose the blue style of silence still thinks! <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
