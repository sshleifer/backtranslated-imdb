This movie is definitely the best movie in the Fund. The plot is amazing, the play is amazing and the steering is amazing. An all time classic, this should have won best picture not kramer Vs. Kramer. Although not even nominated. Jack Lemmon and Micheal Douglas are also their best. One of the best conclusions ever. If you haven't seen this movie run, don't go to rent it. Would have been on afi's top 100. See it not only for Fonda but for everything. <br /> <br /> **** out of **** 4 out of 4
