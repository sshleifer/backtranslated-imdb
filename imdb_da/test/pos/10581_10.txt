Haggard: The Movie is the real life story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend who also cheated him with the help of his two friend, 1. A skateboarder who lives for nothing and 2. A trying fun scientist (who doesn't really work) played by Bam Margera and Brandom Dicamillo. <br /> <br /> The movie Haggard The Movie also has many characters from Jackass etc., but to say it was written by Bam Margera and Co. This is a very weak attempt, seems to me to be written when he was bored, or as a project where they were not very aware of. <br /> <br /> Also the movies stars Bam's boyfriend Jennifer Rivell, who plays the Glauren, Ryan's girlfriend, who basically cheated on him, again very badly acting by Jennifer, another actor that some people may be interested in is Steve aka Hellboy, played by RakeYohn, as his character does not seem to be with the story, again bad acting, also this character does not have many lines in this movie, which basically makes it very boring. But worst of all is the character of Raab, the voice sounds like a smoker who has almost neck cancer, I also think he could have been improved! All in all, I think the characters in this movie are not with the story, as in a scene it would be on a particular character, a moment later, another scene, different character. <br /> <br /> Saying this to be a movie, a kind of documentary that is not played by the characters as a documentary, the play makes you believe it is a cheap attempt to make a movie with your free time . <br /> <br /> Towards the middle of the movie, we begin to lose focus on the protagonist Ryan Dunn, although there is a lot of attention on Bam and Brandon. In conclusion, this movie is ok if you laugh at things it's not much fun, stupid stunts, horrible plays and the occasional nude scene! Also I think there are too many scenes of just no speaker and just music! 10.7
