"Crossfire" feels like an underdeveloped masterpiece - it is well-acted and beautifully recorded, but sparsely written and too short. Like that, it's just a decent police procedure with hints of film noir (in its style in 1947) and social comments (also trendy at the time) thrown in for good. It is remembered today as one of the first two Hollywood films to deal with anti-Semitism, and being much better than the corresponding theme "Gentleman's Agreement" (no middle fever). But its real issue is the difficulties that WWII soldiers, such as trained killers, had when making the transition to civilian life. (For a more careful tag on this topic, try "The Best Years in Our Life.") A man is killed in the first few frames of the film. We can't see his attacker. The film is about the investigation of this murder, which is actually quite straightforward, but it takes some unnecessary detours that reach the main, a depressed soldier, in the occasion of Gloria Grahame, a dance hall with a really nice pimp game of Paul Kelly. There is also a civilian talk halfway through the film, which delays the case to a crib, and the end is clear enough for a police officer. But otherwise it's a pretty decent mystery. Still, what a great noir it could have been. Director Edward Dmytryk drops a few hints on the subject of the original novel - homosexuality, not anti-Semitism - which when sadist creep Monty looks at the picture of his friend Mitch talking to a strange man in a bar. And the casting is excellent. Robert Ryan makes for a very credible cretin, and even becomes a little sympathetic in his final scenes, not unlike Peter Lorre as a child killer in "M." He deserved an Oscar, but lost Edmund Gwenn that year (you can't beat Santa). Robert Mitchum is on hand as a soldier of the accused murderer. Was Mitchum an amazing actor or a big star? Someone else can figure it out, but his sleepy eyes and confused half smile work very well here, as they mean that his character knows something that everyone else doesn't do. (And he does.) And Robert Young, as the detective assigned to the murder, is surprisingly ugly and discards his usual afuncular affinity, even when he has to surrender the sermon in the middle of the picture. There is no doubt that Bogart or Tracy would have been brilliant in the role, but none of them were with RKO in 1947, so just treat Dr. Welby. Nevertheless, Young is good enough to make you wish someone had thrown him into a detective drama instead of "Far Knows Best", which he hated, leading him to alcoholism and suicide attempts. The man deserved better than smarm and Sanka.
