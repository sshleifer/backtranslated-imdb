surprisingly enjoyable movie <br /> <br /> A group of twenty led by Mark Wahlberg robs a gold safe in Italy and fortunately for them, the hoist is successful and they get away with it without much trouble. Before the group can celebrate where Steve played by Ed Norton, he decides to bring the gold to himself and draws a Cout De 'take on the group and shoots one of the members. He and his accomplices leave believing the group is dead, but fortunately the group is not dead. A year later we come back to the story, where the group has tracked Norton and decides to steal the gold back and spend the rest of the film coming up with plans to steal their gold and score a score. <br /> <br /> - It was a surprise to me that it had every opportunity to be a typical forgettable summer movie, but it was actually memorable and fun to watch. What I like is how smart and well thought out the plans in the movie are and how the film feels realistic. Seeing the trailer would make you think it was a thoughtless action movie, but actually there are only two action scenes in the movie and they are all really well done. The latter action scene is a very long 20 min. scene that has one of the best car chases ever made. I like how real the hunt is and how everything is done in old school style without the help of CGI. I personally enjoyed this car chase more than CGI filled hunting in "Matrix 2". I remember watching music videos by director F. Gary Gray and always noticed how good they were and thought he would make a great filmmaker, it turns out I was right as always and he proves this. Can't wait to see what he's doing with the sequel. <br /> <br /> The actors do a decent job even with Seth Green being my favorite in the group. The other thing I loved was John Powell's excellent score, ever since I heard his score for "Robots" this year, I've been a fan of him and aware of his music and the man is really good. He does a good job of avoiding all the typical summer action movie musical clich√©s and gives a very well done score. I haven't seen the original that this is based on, so I can't really say how well it stacks up for it. <br /> <br /> So yes it's a great popcorn movie that actually has a brain unlike most of the summer movie crap that comes out. Has great characters, is fun as hell and has a great score by John Powell. If you love heist movies then you will love this <br /> <br /> - you know if I was in the group, they would call me beautiful mike
