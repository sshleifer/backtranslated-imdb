The Child's Play series is not my favorite, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former boyfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy hit by the truck and explicitly exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the end, allowing another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a kind of fake of the horror genre. This made the movie better as comedy does with many horror movies. All, even if you are not a Child's Play fan, give this a tour.
