Probably grossly underestimated by anyone who never experienced the hell of living under communist regime. Although it seems hard to believe it all happened, in fact, the reality was even worse than the movie. It looks like Orwellian fiction, only this is no fiction. John Hurt is excellent as always. Yes, the manuscript is not full of action, but life is not. The reason is breathtaking. Yes, people were shot, even thousands of them. Their 'crime' was that they wanted to leave the communist 'paradise' without government permission. At times, the movie runs tears in your eyes. We need more movies like this to really appreciate what America gives us. Excellent movie, highly recommended! God bless our country, USA!
