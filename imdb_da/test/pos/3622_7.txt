Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated filmmakers over the years and unfortunately, 2002's 'Puckoon' is no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the division of Ireland, in particular its effects on a lonely society (the title 'Puckoon'). Because of a colossal blunder, half of the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Locals walk to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their way. Drinks quarrel like sardines in a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint. A dead man must have a passport made in his name before villagers can reach the cemetery to bury him. <br /> <br /> 'Puckoon' is a kind of Irish 'Under Milk Wood' with comics and surreal events galore. The main character Dan Milligan (renamed 'Madigan' in the film) is outrageously played by Sean Hughes and has talks with the narrator (Richard Attenborough). Also in the movie are Milo O'Shea, Griff Rhys Jones, David Kelly (from 'Robins Nest'), Freddie Jones, Joe McGann and Elliott Gould. The interview for 'Making of' Puckoon 'documentary, author / director Terence Ryan, expressed honorable admiration for the book. It shows on the screen. But anyway, like the vicious film of The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a good book doesn't necessarily make a good movie. The problem with 'Puckoon' is that those like Milligan's other books simply do not work on the big screen. 'Puckoon' is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot. <br /> <br /> No way can the film be compared to training wrecks such as 'Sex Lives Of The Potato Men', 'Fat Battles' and 'Lesbian Vampire Killers', but then it is not as good as it should have been. The last half hour involves a lot of running around by the police, the British army, some locals who have stopped explosives in a coffin and are very boring to sit through. Ryan's decision to stay close to the book is the main reason for the lack of work as a movie. The second problem is the total lack of charm. 'Waking Ned' had this in spades, while the television series 'Father Ted' was far more fun. Spike lived long enough to watch the movie and apparently it seemed. His daughter, Jane, has a como like Madigan's bride. <br /> <br /> However, the highlight for me was the quote at the beginning: "I don't mind dying!" said Spike: "I just don't want to be there when it does!".
