When the fifty-year-old hit, I was in Hershey, PA and part of the Middletown Skate Team. We didn't do anything except skate around trying to learn what we read on the pages of Skateboarder Magazine. A few local hills gave all the fast wobbles you could handle. At that time, Mike Weed was the hot stuff along with Russ Whats-his-name, with Z-boys warm on their tail. I had a GT (GrenTech) plastic card with Power Paw urethane wheels (loose bearings). My parents told me that we moved to California later that year and that they took a trip to go home hunting. I was a very good son that summer and asked if I might not be rewarded with a real skateboard from California. They delivered. It was a fiberglass deck with the Surfer Magazine logo screened on it. Big trucks and big red wheels (precision bearings, you don't know). They got it on Oak Street, a surf shop in Laguna Beach. <br /> <br /> When I arrived in California (all 13), Anaheim Concrete Wave and Carlsbad also had a large park. Soon Skateboard Odyssey arrived in Mission Viejo. An indoor park with every scenario imaginable. All the time I was reading about Stacy, Shogu, Tony and Jay. This flick was right on the money and a wonderful experience to see.
