Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy what a team. While Rene Russo, William Shanter, and the Everyday video guy are with the trip. This is a fun and great movie. It's not just that, but it's a good friend. <br /> <br /> Tom Dey (Shanghai Noon) is leading this hell of a movie. From start to finish it was a masterpiece. No slapstick humor here. But good old time laughs. Make fun with all other police officers (to name a few deadly weapons, Beverly Hills Cop, Fifteen Minutes, and so on ...) <br /> <br /> To watch a movie, see this. You will love it. It has a wonderful cast and crew. Then get out of your a ** from seeing "COPS" and see "Showtime" to a policeman. And remember, they'll protest your neighbor at about ... um ... oh! Friday night at 8:00 am (man says everyone is a bad author).
