"The Queen of the Damned" is one of the best vampire movies I had ever seen! The film had excitement, action and action. The combination of the queen's tough demanding attitude and rock's mood in our star, very well-liked by Stuart Townsend, makes a wonderfully made movie that only this combination can create. I am always the one who gives advice to my friends and family members where movies are worth renting, and when they ask me "Queen of the Queen" is worthy, I tell them it's worth buying. This movie is most certainly a must-have in all horror movie lovers' homes!
