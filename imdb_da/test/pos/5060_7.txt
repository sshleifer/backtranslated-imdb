An Arab American man was kidnapped from an American airport and flown to "somewhere in North Africa" ​​where he was tortured. The reason? His mobile phone received a call from a known terrorist. The CIA decides to avoid legal means to determine whether the phone call is due to fault or just a mistake. After watching this movie we can only, but ask some terrorists not accidentally hit a wrong number! <br /> <br /> In addition to the reproduction, there are several related side stories. One involves the daughter of the chief of intel (secret police?), Who tortures the suspect, and her involvement with her boyfriend, who happens to be in the night school for suicide bombers. This story is far too constructed, yet exciting, especially when we see it is the result. The director uses a nice timeline switcheroo to link the audience. <br /> <br /> The other side story is the suspect's wife's attempt to find out what happened to her missing husband. She gets an old love to help. He (a subdued Saarsgard) is aide camp to a senator (Alda) and soon gets cold feet when he realizes that his job is not worth uncovering the truth. Witherspoon is wasted in this role. All she has to do is look abandoned and pregnant, with a short rage attack. Streep is good and cold and stereotyped as governor. (CIA? NSA? Homeland Sec?) Official who seems to be a Cheney clone. <br /> <br /> Gylenhall is also wasted as a small analyst pushed into the area, he is in the head even though he is going to do the "right" in the end. <br /> <br /> I found the movie sparkling, if somewhat blunt, but thought it added a little to the subject. It is certainly not to be considered final, and it certainly has an ax to paint. As the "Kingdom", it scratches the surface of a very complicated subject. The movie tries hard to give us an idea of ​​rendering, but can only end up being a "warning" of a botched one. The whole point of extradition is not to "torture", but to get "terrorists" to intel by avoiding legal (therefore obstructive) obstacles. Torture can certainly be employed, especially if the reproduction is out of our hands - although of course we are not guilty of this matter - but intel who can save lives is crucial to this "shadow war".
