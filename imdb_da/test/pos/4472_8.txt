I love this movie, although I don't like how they see the Egyptians, Egyptian citizens themselves! That's why it earns an eight out of 10. The relationship between Augustine and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in the cave for quite a while, he is developing some sort of insanity and passion for that leopard. <br /> <br /> A very touching scene when the leopard dies, see Augustine's reaction. All in all, I find it comfortable, and I look forward to reading the short story from Balzac.
