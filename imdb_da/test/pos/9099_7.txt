For those who loved "Wayne's World" ... "The Blues Brothers" ... and hell, even "Raiders of the Lost Ark", you'll find a lot to suffer (but probably not love) in "Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny ", a fictional epic about the formation of the JB (Jack Black) / KG (Kyle Gass) band. Two missing losers with love for rock n'roll meet with a dilemma when KG's long-standing mother stops sending him rental controls; JB and KG make tracks for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after a sage music dealer (an inspired Ben Stiller) tells them about the titular pick (a fun animated wallpaper sequence providing the backstory). Along the way, our zero bumps into a snagged alien (a game of Tim Robbins), Sasquatch, Stoner security guards, Sorority chicks and Satan himself (an ironic-cast Dave Grohl) in a climatic sequence to be seen (and played mostly at high volume). Rarely do I see comedies in the theater, but "Pick" is an extremely nice pace change ... it may not go up to 11, but it gives a tune both raw and clever in a good 90 minutes. And the songs are inspired by low-brows. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10
