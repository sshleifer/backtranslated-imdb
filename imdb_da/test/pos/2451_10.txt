I agree with the previous author's comments on the excellent performances and plot. Started watching this movie by accident ... (lazy Sunday afternoon clicks channels to see if anything was good) ... and was fascinated by Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Wow! Gut wrenching! Kudos to everyone (has always admired Martin Sheen) but was especially impressed with Emilio! Excellent job of shopping and managing ... simply amazing! So why have I never heard of this movie before? I have to spread the news.
