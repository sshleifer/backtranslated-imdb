This is a great movie! The characters seemed so realistic to me, it was hard to believe they were not real people. Being from the south, I thought Judith Ivey's characters seemed particularly real, and as everyone else has mentioned, she makes an excellent play. The characters are not beautiful and look nothing like the average Hollywood stars - their imperfect bodies and personalities seem so much more natural and real. <br /> <br /> One reviewer mentioned that the protagonist, Alice, had no good reason to leave home, which is true - she had no moral or excited reason to run away, such as fleeing child abuse etc. . I thought she was just busy with final jobs in a working class life and wanted to escape to Florida, where her friend lived an attractive and privileged life at a college student in Miami. The actor shows Alice's confusion, insecurity, and questioning becoming decisive and willing to take control of her life with impressive naturalness. The film also shows how Alice is trapped in situations with seemingly no options, causing her to panic, act and get help. <br /> <br /> Initially, the grainy film style set me off and made me think it was a very low budget or homemade movie, but in reality it is very well done. The home-grown quality makes you feel like you're there with the characters, part of their RV trip across the country. This is certainly a movie worth seeing, though I do not quite understand all the descriptions of it as a heartwarming comes from the language of the age. It is rather vulgar and disturbing at times, although it is not completely sad in the end.
