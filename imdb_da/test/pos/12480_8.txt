Henri-Georges Clouzot's film is an example of the French transition cinema. A film between the realism of the post-war film and full-of-magic and symbolism nouvelle vague. With some stains in the American classic movies (but not imitating it), the director tells us a story of love, crime and the importance of views. We can also find good actors (Suzy Delair is impeccable). <br /> <br /> Also interesting is how we can find aspects of this movie today. Quai des Orf√®vres heritage can be seen in the Woody Allen tradition. Casts a crime situation in a picturesque environment. The naive end is also typical of Steven Spielberg's compelling movie. And finally, I would like to point out that deja sensation in the shooting session between Jenny Lamour (Suzy Delair) and Dora Monier (Simone Renant), where the first announces that she believes her husband is unfaithful and exactly with the woman who is photographing her This The scene is exactly one between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in Closer (Mike Nichols, 2004).
