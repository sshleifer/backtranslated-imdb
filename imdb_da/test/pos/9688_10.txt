These movies should be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life. I laughed so hard I almost puked. After the movie was finished, I laughed about an hour and thought about the very first set in the movie. Its definitely 100 times better than the first Jackass movie. I loved seeing them all again. If you're squeam or don't like raunchy childish humor, you don't like this movie. If you can go in with an open mind and not take it so seriously, you will laugh at your ass. Its amazing nobody was killed in this movie. Each seen in this movie is so original and so different from the next, so you don't know what to expect. <br /> <br /> Mike Webber
