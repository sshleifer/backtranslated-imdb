Okay, it was just brilliant. I wish the rest of season 1 had been so strong. It really needed more episodes like this. <br /> <br /> The molding worked perfectly even though they were all nobody back in the day. Writing was amazing and so was the editing. Good work on all accounts. <br /> <br /> The section was exciting, exciting and just kept guessing until the end. That's what most MOTW episodes tried, but celebrated so far. <br /> <br /> The first five star episode for me. Really good, almost like a movie. I didn't even remember that it was so good. I think it's even better than the big horror movie called 'The Thing'.
