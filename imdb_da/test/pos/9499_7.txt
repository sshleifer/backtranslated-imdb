Gloria Swanson (like Leila Porter) is an understandably boring wife. Workaholic man Elliott Dexter (as James Denby Porter) has "lost his romance" along with his waist; He also smokes cigars in bed, eats onion and cords. He can hardly remember his own anniversary - as a participant of caddish Lew Cody (as Schuyler Van Sutphen); the younger man sees Ms. Swanson's great figure and flirting unnoticed. Soon Swanson will be drawn to Mr. Cody. Then Mr. Dexter trying to get her back. Who's winning? <br /> <br /> The three principles are fine, with Swanson most impressive in the decisive role that the woman tore. Julia Faye grabs with honor as Cody's other interest, "Toodles"; off-screen, she tempted director Cecil B. DeMille. DeMille touch is clear; especially in an imaginary order, where Cody promises Swanson ... "Pleasure ?? Rich ?? Love ??" <br /> <br /> ******* Don't change your husband (1/26/19) Cecil B. DeMille ~ Gloria Swanson, Elliott Dexter, Lew Cody
