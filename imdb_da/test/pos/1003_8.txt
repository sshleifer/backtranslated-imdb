So Keira Knightly is in it ... So automatically we compare this movie to reconciliation. Apart from rum, the fact that this film is also time of war and her appearance is carefree. These films are completely different. The actors work well, I think a good thing is that there is not a memorable person they are a team. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie where things happen, then advise id another, as the story of this movie is about human interaction and their physics is damaged by their experience and how their lives are intertwined. <br /> <br /> This movie has real interaction, perfect break moments that make you breathe. No, it's not exciting, but it's poignant if you can empathize with these characters. At the moment, I wondered if this movie might have been better as a theater game rather than a movie. We expect a lot of movies as everything is possible, and yet with theater we allow interaction and trust in faith. <br /> <br /> There are things wrong with it if you are looking for a blockbuster, if you are looking for nothing and let the movie take you in, move you, allow yourself to forget these stars, and not judge them as actors, but let them become people you really want to get into yourself. <br /> <br /> GO ON! ! give it a ride!
