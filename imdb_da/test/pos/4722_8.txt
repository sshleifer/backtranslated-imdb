While the film has its faults, it highlights some of the problems that come with living in a country without democracy. It gives you empathy with the people under such a government and makes you learn more about their lives, their struggles and a potential leader Aung San Suu Kyi. It makes you wonder why our government will mix places we don't want, but ignore those who ask our help.
