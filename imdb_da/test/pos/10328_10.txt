For those of you who have no idea what Bugs Juice is or was, it was a children's reality show about real children living in the summer camp. Bug Juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp. It was full of romance, friendships, struggles, overcoming your fears and dealing with the struggles to stay away from home for 2 months. It was a fantastic show that no longer appears on t.v. regularly, but is amazingly non-smaller. The view was never boring and always attracted my attention. It is really great for children who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it is like before they go. Plus Disney did a really good job of picking camps to showcase, because who wants to see a show that is in a camp, like for a week. The length of the camp where perfect for this show and the environment they were in was amazing. They where camps everywhere in the US, each giving unique activities to the campers. It was a truly amazing, non-scripted show.
