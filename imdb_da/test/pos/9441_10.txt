Oooooh man I was glad I didn't miss this. I wanted to post this review, as this episode especially does what some new movie didn't do. It pays real tribute to the DOOM game. Its plot is different yes, and the characters are obviously set in a completely different universe (of course the doctor as a universe) but the feeling, the pace, the references and the location are perfect. And for all the original Doom fans listening to the doorway and closing the sound effect, it was the icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Please visit all doctors and Doom fans so check this out. it is a gem!
