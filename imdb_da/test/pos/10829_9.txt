Director and author Jean-Pierre Rappenau was 8 years old in the spring of 1940, when France's Third Republic was disintegrated in a few weeks. It was a time, he says, "all adults were a little crazy." He and the production staff have lovingly and carefully recreated that world in a movie where all the characters are essentially fictional. The structure, a classic farce, is ideal for the period as several plot lines zip and cuts only to get together in a logical, satisfactory conclusion. The staple to this plot is Frederic, played by the glorious newcomer Gregory Derangere, who is completely up to playing opposite Adjani, Depardieu and Ledoyen. The real strength of the movie is in its supporting beliefs. M. Rappeneau has cast the film exquisitely with actors who volunteer ideas for both action and dialogue and who know and prove that it is possible to fully realize a character with only two short sentences of dialogue. Although it is not yet as influential as Renoir's Game Rules, "Bon Voyage" deserves to be a companion to that classic. Although it requires a lot from the audience, it leaves much to be desired. One of its demands is tolerance for some mystery and misdirection about the exact genre we see: a crime melodrama, no, a spy thriller, ah, a romantic comedy. Recommend it to cinemaphile friends. Just be sure to let them discover for themselves that it is a romantic comedy.
