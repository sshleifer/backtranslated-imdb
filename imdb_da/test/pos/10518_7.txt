Nothing good here, but a nicely traded story of a battered deaf wife (Fonda) of a little villain (Bochner) who gets involved in one of her husband's plans and his mistress. Sutherland and Weber are drawn into what turns out to be a mysterious murder investigation, and the story just flows together.
