Pepe Le Pew can either really creep you out or completely sweep you off your feet. Either way, you can't help feeling a little awe at seeing this classic WB character. This comment personally thinks that Pepe was the inspiration behind others, would be animated casanovas today from Cartoon Network's Johnny Bravo to Disney's Lumiere from "Beauty and the Beast". <br /> <br /> His unique brand of love production is wondering in today's world where his antics would usually be merged with a sexual harassment and at least 50 meters from all his victims. <br /> <br /> In a particular cartoon, a world tired cat decides to make an ultimate makeover and get some respect for a change to pretend to be a skunk. Everything goes well until Pepe arrives and immediately pursues the unfortunate cats with his overwhelming enthusiastic love. The basis for Pepe's many brands is in this cartoon. From his lovely "Frenchmen" the love calls for the disturbing quiet hop-hunt of his. <br /> <br /> This cartoon shows only what the imagination of the world is, the most ardent wooer can go the distance ... and get his beloved "pig-eon" to leave dust paths behind them.
