This is one of the better sci-fi series. It involves character development, a few really exciting moments and reasonable episodes scripts. As another commentator said here, it looked like it was a mini-series, not a full blown series of file episodes and low budgets. The problem with the show, which is in short a Godzilla series, is that it started too big, with incredible monsters, amazing science, so cooked it all to local Americans doing things. Then the show ended too early, since the Olympics came and hey! a sci-fi show is a sci-fi show, but half-naked athletic people run around aimlessly are much more important. So they did only 15 episodes instead of the expected 22. The audience was also small, as people didn't really catch it at 8pm. Finally, the saddles made it. Competition: You have a show with good special effects, things like big monsters that kill people or destroy both, and then go into genetic engineering, transforming humans, human clones, the end of the world, tsunamis. Also, the only fillers are scenes with aggressive rednecks or other annoying people killed for their stupidity. The bottom side is that after 15 episodes preparing something big, the show ends. No real ending, no closure, just a bitter taste of cloth in your mouth, as if you just turned off a piece of suit.
