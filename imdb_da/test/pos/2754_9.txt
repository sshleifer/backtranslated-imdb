Others have commented on the slightly weird video events. I think they were trying to catch what you wanted to look at when they participated in a live performance. Feet, faces, overall view. Unfortunately, it falls a little short. But having seen it, Colin Dunne nevertheless looks happy. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progress of vision is clear, changes from the original Dublin production are evident. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "Trading Taps" is the highlight of the video. Tarik Winston is incredible, just like his partner in the play. <br /> <br /> I think the sound was better in this version than the original video production (1995). In Dolby 5.1 on DVD it is excellent. <br /> <br /> Despite the lack of videography, it is a must-own for Riverdance fans.
