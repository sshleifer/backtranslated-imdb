Like a very expensive Buffy episode peppered with lots of humor. Lots of wire and stunt kung fu. The Twins Effect goes to the list of classic to see HK movies. The vampires have a cool mix of jumping jigsaw type and the beautiful boy European style. If you get the opportunity to watch it in the theater, it's worth driving a 30 minute drive, otherwise buy the import DVD before someone screws it up by giving it a bad dub.
