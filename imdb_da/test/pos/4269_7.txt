where do we go from here? That's the overall question about this movie. And make no mistake, "mainly the ETC.", The 2003 effort of director John Jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but no one as weak or as powerful as this one. <br /> <br /> Much of the movies play as an ongoing conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and I'm sure many of the issues raised by the protagonists will recognize you from your own evenings by the drunken debauchery. But one of the many beauties in this movie is that we rarely get an answer. Questions raised ?? everything from the secular to the deep ?? but jansen is able to force his audience to examine and answer these questions ourselves with little or no help from the figures. page 1 opens with an increasingly complex and beautifully orchestrated arrangement of non-linear segments to introduce us to the protagonists. We meet them in the morning on April 8, 1994 ?? the day kurt cobain committed suicide. And it is the death of cobain, and the journey to his weapon two days later in Seattle, which serves as the backdrop for the film. In the exploration of cobain life, music and death, the characters - with varying degrees of success - try to understand and express their own lives. <br /> <br /> There are some aspects of the movie, which are what you can expect from a low-budget indie movie: The shows range from a certain mediocre to excellent, with the strongest performances of Jessica Scott (Holly) and Noel Wood (Daniel) ; Part of the dialogue is a bit stiff, but has never completely disappeared in the unreal; And there are some minor audio problems, especially when we get on the road, which makes it difficult to sometimes follow the action on the screen. <br /> <br /> but despite the shortcomings, "mainly ETC." is a solid, deeply influenced piece of cinema. In the midst of moments of creepy poignancy, laughable humor and intimate turmoil, jansen weighs all strands together and illuminates their own struggles while making them available and committed to us. and because we can see reflections of ourselves in one or more of these characters, we can identify with the issues and problems they are struggling with and we can look back and remember where we were on that day in 1994, when many people the world changed. <br /> <br /> while the jansen takes credit for writing, editing and managing the movie, kudos must also be given to his photography. With an eerie eye and a great ability to capture and retreat into each of the worlds of the characters, Jansen managed to produce shots after shots after shots that stuck me long after the credits rolled. <br /> <br /> And no review of this movie would be complete without nodding on the amazing soundtrack. the music in this movie is used for great effect; sometimes the action emphasizes, at other times when taking a central stage but never getting in the way or getting worse in kitschy music video. The soundtrack plays as the ultimate biggest hit, although I suppose the label would probably not be very good with the director. <br /> <br /> The new DVD archive edition includes some deleted scenes, trailers, music videos and a cobain documentary. The deleted scenes give an insight into the film production through alternative opening and closing sequences, and it is definitely a treat to have the rare and beautiful Raining Kind video. The cobain documentary is fine if it is a little worse for wear, and at least more extensive documentaries are available for hardcore fans. Obviously absent is an instructor comment, and I cannot do without whether the jansen is planning to release this at some point with the tasty treat attached. <br /> <br /> enough to say that next time you're looking for a strong job from a talented filmmaker, I recommend you board.
