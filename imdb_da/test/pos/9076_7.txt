This is definitely a good movie, unlike what other people say. Peline and I both watched the movie 3x and the end is cheesy, but it's part of the package ... experimenting with death is the same as trying to believe it, so the movie is cool. For those who want to see a classic Kevin Bacon movie, please see this. beware of the greeting from Istanbul. we will write 10 lines if you really want us 2, but we think it is a waste of goodbye. The rest of this review should not be taken seriously because we just wrote it to fill in the 10-line requirement (which is crazy), but we are friendly people and therefore adapt to the rules set for us. So people do not see this movie because we wrote 10 lines, but because it is good. and by the way we wrote 12 lines !!
