Finding the premise exciting and reading reviews, and being an angel fan, I saw this movie. It is sexy and original and very entertaining. David Boreanaz is Keith. He is a hunky married man, gets home father, and he feels a little inadequate in his marriage. He makes a mistake by entering a tight circle of teenage girls who are fascinated by the idea of ​​doing so with an older man. They will do anything to get into their bed, including begging, lying and extortion, but they mostly try to push their buttons. The nuttiness that follows sends Keith reeling and pushes friendships to the edge. David Boreanaz shows a little skin in it - and he looks hot. Yeah - he plays a creepy cheat - but he does show enough vulnerability and tenderness to the cool teens that you end up cheering for him in the end. Yet another thing when someone moans "oh yes, oh ... oh .. YEAH !!", it's hard to see them as victims of rape.
