This show was not only a great human drama, but portrayed racism in this country on a raw, too true way of life. When a show can be so witty and entertaining yet so exciting and educational at once, it is television in its highest form. The action was phenomenal. The scripture was unusual. Not only did the show exhibit race relations in a fair manner that seems unmatched by other TV shows, but its ability to portray this topic as it existed in the 1960s along with how it exists at the beginning of the twenty-first century , strongly demonstrates the ways we have changed, and unfortunately the many more ways we do not have.
