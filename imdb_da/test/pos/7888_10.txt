Having seen recently, Cry Uncle, at the same instructor, I decided to figure it out and am I glad I did! This is an extremely good movie. Far far better than it seems likely given the ingredients. How many times have we had to suffer embarrassment for someone who plays a middle-class father who mixes it with the flower aagh! And yet here thanks to a perfect script, it is made credible. Not ideal, not good or bad, but trustworthy. Peter Boyle, as the working class, hippie and nine ** are hates and Dennis Patrick as the upset suit, plays their respective parts immaculately, and I can't remember ever seeing the two classes come together without things being sentimental. Susan Sarandon is effective as a hippie chick, but doesn't have much to do in her first movie. This is really, must see movie recording as it does the very short period in western and especially American times, as the counterculture was busting itself wide open.
