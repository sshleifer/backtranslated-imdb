I watched this movie on TCM last night, all tense expectations, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto. I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to look for the exciting long track shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus heading to find her Boris. In a hand-held frame that certainly goes on the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back and cranes (puns continuously) across the street as she leaves the bus and darts among the tanks to cross the road. Then I remember not following any notch, we follow her close to the fence as she looks through and seeks him tense, but does not find him. But we continue to follow Veronika as she seeks the applicants of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women, all extras, and each a gem of nascent Stanislavskian behavior. How do you wonder Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky up for this extraordinary sequence. But what did I see in this version? After crossing the street that pulled the tanks, the scene ended abruptly and cut back to scenes in the apartment before continuing with the soldiers and their families by the fence. It seems to me that this movie was not only restored but also edited. What a downer!
