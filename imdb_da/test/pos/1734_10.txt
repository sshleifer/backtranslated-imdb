I get a kick out of the new Who fans who call it excellent. They are right about that, but the new series is not quite there yet, it comes there. It is certainly good. <br /> <br /> First, the good things. Special effects are obviously improving almost 20 years later since the last episode of Doctor Who "Battlefield" was broadcast. One thing the BBC has always wanted is Doctor Who (except when they tried to cancel in the 70s and 80s). The expectation and pressure were good, but I think the new series has passed the test, it is good, it is still not excellent because it has errors. Some of the stories "Dalek" were very poor. I suppose it was written in a few minutes by an idiot who has never revived the Dalek character or never bothered to see the old series. <br /> <br /> "Aliens in London" was probably the best episode so far it has launched a new story of aliens who have been crossing multiple episodes, including "Boomtown". <br /> <br /> Now, the other bad things, the companion Rose, Billie Piper, aren't great. She is actually quite annoying, but who is Dr. who a young teeny bopper had to end up and she got part. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is quite respectful, he's starting to catch his niche. He tried to play the sign, just as fun always lacks the right stroke line, but he has taken it much more seriously and it shows. <br /> <br /> Continuously, there are still some issues that were not resolved well, Paul Mcgann was still the doctor before, but he was not put back. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, although the series is generally pretty good, I have not missed an episode and it never gets boring, so I recommend any doctor as a fan to check it out and see the new one Doctor Who series.
