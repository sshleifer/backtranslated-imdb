One day a red cuddly cat is tired of being kicked by humans and attacked by dogs and mice that life would be better if he were a skunk. He paints himself black with a white stripe on his back and adds a little glue cheese to make him stink. Initially, life could not be better for him, the dog flies, and the butcher abandons his shop so the cat goes off with a pile of meat. Just as he thinks everything is perfect, he is noticed by a real skunk, not just any skunk, but the far too noisy Pepé Le Pew. Pepé fails the poor cat to a female skunk and pursues him and thinks his protest is just shame. Our poor cat thinks he has fled when he throws a skunk skin from a tall building, so Pepé will think he is dead, initially it seems to work, but when he sneaks out, Pepé sees him and Immediately pleased the dead skunk. In the end, the cat realizes that he could be better kicked and attacked than being lusted by a randy skunk ... there is also a good ending to the skunk when his wife finds out what he has been in. br /> <br /> It was a pretty fun introduction to Pepé Le Pew, who was then too amorous, but now it looks like a randy, sexually harassing stalker, even though he was immediately punished for his behavior in last end.
