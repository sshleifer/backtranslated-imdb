I think I was one of those people who found this second of Roth's pearls. His performance, as assigned, was amazing. The story, which was told so much by Francis Ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and gives way to the characters to evolve. Roeg again proves it doesn't have to be a war setting to be intersting. In a very wonderful location is a story of contrast. Ruthlessnes and beauty go hand in hand while loneliness becomes your best friend. It shows a more eerie past with a little golden age, landing on a coast full of wealth for World War I if you send the right men. All in all, a beautifully directed film from Nicola's roeg with a sublime cast.
