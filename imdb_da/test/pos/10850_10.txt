I love this movie. I saw it again and again when I rented it from Netflix. It had a lot of substance and meaning to me. I think many people will enjoy it. I have read and seen a few lesbian stories over the years and am happy to say that they are getting better and better at how they are presented. They tend to have a more positive feel for the lifestyle and sense of gay women. It is great to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this community. I think it's clear that more and more movies with this theme will grace our theaters and TV screens. Many manufacturers and directors realize that lesbians live very full and healthy lives and that we have amazing stories that should and can be seen by individuals as well as families without hesitation.
