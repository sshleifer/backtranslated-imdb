I also found "Oppenheimer" to be a brilliant series and one of the best deals on American PBS. David Suchet was particularly effective as Edward Teller, as I remember, and the overall view was spectacularly good. The only reason why the series does not consider a full 10/10 is for the low budget values ​​in some areas. Actual content is absolutely first class in my memory. <br /> <br /> The Oppenheimer miniseries will be released in the UK on July 31! It will be a Region 2 / PAL set, but it looks like a region 1 / NTSC set should be running. <br /> <br /> If you have a universal player in the United States, you can order series right now from Amazon UK. <br /> <br /> http://tinyurl.com/znyyq <br /> <br /> Huzzah !!
