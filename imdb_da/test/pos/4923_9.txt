I watch this movie at the beginning of each summer, and it never ceases to entertain me. Here, the jokes are packed in almost any dialog, giving you more bang than the average Simpsons episode. Some of the jokes fall flat or will only cause a small chuckle, but others will leave you rolling and then there are those who hold your brain ... "The audience is now deaf." <br /> <br /> video knows it's a video and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. It is easy to sit back and let the bombs of the mood begin. A good mix of slapstick, pop culture and heavy-in-kind comedy ensures there is something for everyone. I was in sixth grade when I first watched this video and I have to admit that I still find it so much fun now that I have started college. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to watch over the summer, much in the way you might see "It's a wonderful life" at Christmas or "Ten Commandments" at Easter / Easter. More than that, it's just fun as hell.
