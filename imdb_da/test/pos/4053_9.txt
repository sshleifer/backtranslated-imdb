As with so many modern American films, there must be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let it go, it is a story of fun fun and a friendly heart that is cased in a crab hole. <br /> We are presented with a scene in a city in an economically depressed area struggling to find something to be happy with. Beau Bridge's character is really against it with a family that rises, a zero bank balance and a brother-in-law who is sold out to a large business chain that he secretly hates, but where he is willing to rub Beau's nose. D'Onofrio finds its right surface Bubba lifestyle cramped by having to watch out for his "blessed" baby brother Joey, and itching to escape from this dead hickby. Their boss's business shuts down (much against his will) due to lack of new customers, and he is haunted by memories from his father as he builds the excitement of his own attempt at self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Joey, who seemed to personalize the curse in their lives, was lost to sea - thought drowned - in a freak accident. His miraculous restoration to those of the Portuguese trawlers whose boat they had just built and launched (perhaps symbolic of an English crew) is the sign they have been waiting for, and they all decide to give their lives a last roll of the dice. <br /> <br /> There is a beautifully exciting mood throughout this work, which gave us our attention as brilliantly as 'The Shipping News'. There are also other parallels with the later work that lead to a suspicion of a remake. I like 'Signs of Life' for its simpler, less constructed history and star performances by actors working on their craft rather than being noticed as stars.
