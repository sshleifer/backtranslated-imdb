There is a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford movies for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films without the name of cash registers that Ford didn't have to tailor the movie about the person of a star, it was John Wayne, Henry Fonda or any of the others he worked with. Not surprisingly, Ford considered all of these to be some kind of favorites. <br /> <br /> Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. A couple looks like cowpokes signing to lead a Mormon wagon train to a valley in the Arizona area. Along the way, they are first joined by a group of beach players from a medical show and then by a family of criminals on the move called Clegg. Their stories merge and what happens is the basis of the movie's plot. Had the Wagonmaster been made even 10 years earlier because of the two performances introduced by Johnson and Carey, both would probably have had significant careers as B-picture cowboys. For Johnson, it had been art imitating life. Johnson was a real rodeo cowboy and came to Hollywood with a number of horses for John Ford to use in Fort Apache. Ford was hit by his presence and the rest is history. <br /> <br /> But the day of the Western Western was on its way, and Johnson and Carey had good career as two fine character actors. <br /> <br /> Ward Bond plays Elder Wiggs leader of the Mormons. Bond is a recently converted though and has trouble remembering not to use any four letter words. But he is the leader because of his character, not his impeccable LDS theology. He turns out to be a wise and merciful leader. <br /> <br /> In portraits of Cleggs, Ford had to come back only four years to his My Darling Clementine. They are the reincarnation of the Clanton gang and the pure evil. In fact, if Walter Brennan, who after my Darling Clementine refused to work for Ford again, was willing, I could easily see him being cast as Shiloh Clegg, the head of the family. As it was Charles Kemper did a fine job, it's probably the role he's most known for. Shortly after this film was made, Kemper was killed in a car accident. He might well have worked for Ford in the future. Ford makes the Mormon pacifists here, and I don't remember that pacifism was part of the LDS doctrine. Nevertheless, it works here, the whole idea is that these people who do not carry weapons are innocent when dealing with evil people like Cleggs. It takes some hopeful cowboys to dispose of them properly. I think this post-WWII post is trying to say that pacifism is not always the best policy. <br /> <br /> Another transfer from My Darling Clementine is Alan Mowbray, who plays the same kind of role he did there as head of the medicine show troupe. Part of this troupe is Joanne Dru, who makes another trip like a woman with elastic virtue as it did in the Red River. Dru used to make so many westerns that she longed to be out of gingham and into some modern fashion. <br /> <br /> Wagonmaster is great entertainment, and I'm willing to bet in Utah, it's a very popular movie.
