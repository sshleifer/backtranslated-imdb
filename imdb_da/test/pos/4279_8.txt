Fellowes drama about a couple of marriages threatened by a younger third party interested in the wife of the house (Watson). Wilkinson plays the role very well as the troubled man who cannot control his wife's cheating and deals with the problem. I also like Rupert everett much in his role as William Bule, the man with whom Watson has an affair. Although I think Emily Watson is a great actress, I had some problems with how her character was written, didn't make her suffer (I know a cheater shouldn't be sympathetic, but some of her actions and things she did not have any grounds behind them). The play was perhaps the weak part of this drama, although the Fellowes direction was good, and the performance was also pretty good. This movie is better than unfaithful, but not a masterpiece in any way. --- IMDB Rating: 6.7, my rating: 8/10
