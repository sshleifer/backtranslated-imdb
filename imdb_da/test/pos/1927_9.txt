Note: This should probably only be read after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Finding a documentary or movie focusing on the loser is very rare. Deep Water does just that, making it one of the most thought-provoking movies for a very long time. It does not give us a whole look up to, but rather an anti-hero, forcing us to look at ourselves. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a group of men trying to sail around the globe, singlehandedly, and without stopping. Only one does it, several die, one decides not to return home, each one on a psychological journey exciting enough to deserve the whole films for themselves. But the most interesting thing is Donald Crowhurst, or rather the way he is portrayed by the filmmakers and our reactions to him as viewers. <br /> <br /> With some standards this man must be considered a despicable character, but why is he depicted so heroically? Why are we so sympathetic to him? From the beginning he made all the wrong choices. He risked his family financially to get the boat, he left at a more dangerous time to gain more publicity, he ignored all the warnings despite his lack of experience, he chose to lie instead of granting defeat, these choices snowballed until the inevitable and last one: suicide All for what? Somewhere in history? A sense of achievement? Maybe. What is important to consider is whether this man's situation was inevitable. Every single person should ask himself whether his natural human drive to fame and fulfillment would bring him such recklessness, and I think examining your own reaction to Crowhurst's story will at least provide an answer to that question.
