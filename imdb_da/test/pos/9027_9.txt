I really can't see why people don't like this movie. I found it very entertaining (of course, it is a fact that it is the beautiful Laura Fraser who is a bonus!) When I first heard about it, I thought it would be in line with a role-changing "Weird Science" and to one It is true, but there is a twist that I really did not look forward to. After watching the trailer on the DVD (which I hadn't seen before I watched the movie) I saw that "twist" actually appears in the trailer! Very strange. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, the "Weird Science" comparison compares less and less, and I think it's better for the two films. There are certainly some scenes that do not seem wonderful, but these are made by the young cast's enthusiasm. In summary, I suggest this is a good example of a Sci -For chick flick, and I don't think I've seen many of them!
