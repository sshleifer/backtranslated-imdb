I've seen two episodes so far, I really like it. Even though I'm no longer in college, I miss the wonderful college life. I wish I spent a little more time socializing. I can identify myself with rusty. When I shook a fraternity, my big brother was not at all like Cappie, I wish I had a big brother like him. So if a show like this can actually make people identify with the characters, then it's a good show. <br /> <br /> It is more realistic than American pie with less explicit sex jokes. Can we also call this a younger version of "desperate wives?" Some of the authors must be Greeks themselves, history seems to reflect some of the real brotherhood and sorority life. It was shot in high definition. And they actually filmed outside instead of the inside of the studios. so the picture quality is very good. They could easily make this a good movie. Unlike a movie that can only last a few hours, I can have about 45 minutes of fun watching it for free on TV every week. Casting is excellent, the actors are about the right age, and they are new and fresh, making them more real. This show is virtually everyone. There are also Asian and black frat boys and sorority girls in the show. It's almost a little shocking that they had a little story of two guys in the fraternity, had sex in the first episode, and then tried to join again in the second episode. I don't think I've seen anything like this on TV before. This show somehow reminded me of a Warner Bros television show by teenagers called "Young Americans" who were canceled in early 2001. In that show, a girl dressed as a man showed a guy, and that guy thought she was a male gay. <br /> <br /> Greek life can be fun, but at the same time students have to study for exams, etc. At the time when people actually have a little free time in their lives, there is no fraternity to participate more. I do not know how long this show will last, sooner or later, these people should also "graduate" college. Maybe they will find some new actors in another 4 years of fun university life!
