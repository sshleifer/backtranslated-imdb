This movie is so 1980s, and that's what I like so much about it. It does an excellent job of conveying the feeling of the odd decade. The reality that Russian nukes could dry you out anytime. Reagan in the White House tells everyone that things were big, while more and more social programs were cut. Young people fell out, but not as far as their parents did in the 1960s. Young people still went to school, they just smoked so much that their sensibilities were all but dead. Nothing made them, not even one of their classmates 'death in one of their friends' hands. How strange it is to realize that the murder was wrong, but you are not sure why. Looking at the characters dealing with the crime is fascinating and tells of a very sick society. Glover is amazing, Keanu is amazing, Hopper is incredible. One of the most memorable movies I've ever seen.
