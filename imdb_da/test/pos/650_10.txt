A wonderful movie in advance, <br /> <br /> I think it, in the eighties, was all about winning, greed is good? Remember that one? I've seen this movie more than 20 times. For me, it's a real desert movie I'm watching, because there's always something more to learn about these flawed characters I just love, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin, are simply wonderful Also Beverly D'angelo, Beau Bridges comes in. in a close second, don't make me wrong, there are many more good performances in this movie, and that's also the way it's written that made it to me and i hope you, a movie you want to see again And again, I think TV shows like "Northen Exposure" and now "Earl" is very much guilty in this movie. But remember it's not a Tom Cruise movie.
