The recent history of Hollywood remakes of ghost / horror films from the East has been gloomy. This movie will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or the like. <br /> <br /> It's well photographed and the sound is amazing. Display on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or DTS-enabled sound system is recommended. Of course it is subtitle, so if it brings you off then I wouldn't bother with this. Dubbing rarely works and simply wouldn't do it here. <br /> <br /> It's also really scary, with excellent performances from a cast not known to Western audiences. I would especially like to vote for the founder, who was absolutely brilliant. The end will make you see it again if you can do it. The ground is relentless and gives no comforting moments of release along the way. <br /> <br /> If I have a little criticism, there may be a demonstrable influence in some scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring. However, we have accepted equal copies of other people's ideas for Western films for years, and so my point is limited, which did not prevent me from giving it 10/10. I think most fans of this genre will derive great "pleasure" from this movie, which for a hope I go down like a classic.
