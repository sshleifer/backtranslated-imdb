Dr. Sayer (Philippe Leroy), a wealthy physician with psychological problems with the opposite sex, kidnaps an employee, Maria (Dagmar Lassander), a free-thinking liberal woman who believes men should be "steady" instead of women. Sayer retires to his palatial estate and drives Maria through a humiliating series of gambling that threatens to cloud and kill her. The applicant's desire seems to dominate his body, mind and soul, make her his sexual slave, obey his commandments, and observe his every desire and whim. After resistance, Maria is primarily patient towards her goal, but has her own plans. She says she wants to help Sayer refrain from his sadistic behavior towards women so that he could love and not feel so desirous of hurt. It seems that Sayer has her under his grip and accepts some rather embarrassing scenarios (... like lotioning his toes, "love" for a blow-up doll, which is a recreation of itself, often spending time topless and even few hang down when she hits him hard over the face and brings blood from the nose) that almost breaks her, but something happens when the worried doctor slowly falls in love with Maria .. and through what seems to be a desperate attempt To end the madness, Maria wins a big-time toy with Says lust for her body. <br /> <br /> More of a willpower, a kind of sexual warfare, where one seems to be in charge when the other really has the upper hand. Through much of the film, Sayer Maria regrets, forcing her to submit to her series of sexual psychological games. Her attempt to escape fails because his home is such a well-designed fortress. It is a typical European art deco kind of palace, old-fashioned and orchestrated by a man who has been holding up for this weekend's retreat of his for quite a syllable. walls and doors open on his command with a quarantined area for his "victims"). But when Maria apparently cuts a bottle of pills due to her anxiety on his hands, the tables turn and she has him where she wants him. He finds out that he is actually searching for her, and Maria uses this for her benefit and plays hard to come when Sayer wants to embrace and ravage her (and I could understand his frustration because she has this lure who can drive a man crazy) <br /> I felt the film works ultimately as a war wars for women, their empowerment and rebellion against men who have the idea that they should always have control, sexually and mentally . "Twist" finalizes this ideal. I couldn't swallow Sayer's fate because of his strict cardiovascular activity and exercise regimen. We see how he develops his toned athletic figure and how this treatment is part of the normal routine every weekend before the true mind games with his victim begin. If he fits so well and spends time developing into the extracurricular activities that follow his regime, how could he like the fate of ending his deal with Maria at the end when she stops resisting his progress ? <br /> <br /> Mary, he wanted to admit later, is the first thing he actually kidnapped; Others from the past, call girls, were paid for their services, so Sayer could feel the power to dominate a woman, though it is all a fictitious charade caused by a deeply troubled person with an inability to connect with the opposite sex. The spontaneous decision to do so to take a leap from the norm costs him more than he could ever know. All this psycho-sexual subtitle is quite fascinating to see unravel, but Dagmar Lassander, such a delicious sex kitten, was my reason to enjoy it then. Without her, I could not have had it so much because she is decisive as a victim worth trying. Perhaps the film's highlight, the delicious dance like Lassander, dressed in gauze (!), Unravel's wardrobe, exposing her breasts to a jazzy score. It is the kind of sexually seductive moment that makes the mouth water and forehead sweat. Dagmar Lassander must have been a pleasure for fashion designers because she wears these clothes as well. She has this kind of cool, a sophisticated and screen presence along with her beauty and seductive powers that Dagmar transcends to create an iconic character that would define her career ... even though the film is not known (.. I found myself in mouth ). The provocative nature of the script and the risqu√© topic cannot appeal to certain crowds, as it deals with sex (.. and pain) in many different forms, the dialogue rather illustrative and elaborate. At times, I couldn't help chuckling on Sarah's comments to a jailed Mary about how he enjoys getting women to suffer, and the excitement he gets to force them into a kind of slavery (... in an attempt to make the words poetic, it all feels rather hokey). But Dagmar is the right reason to see it, and the movie to me works best as a fetish movie, a possible male fantasy with this seemingly primitive and ordinary idealist, trapped and opposed to his will, forced into an uncertain situation, her destiny possibly for the benefit of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist. Her submission and how she reacts to her aggressive behavior with her (.. there are times when she unfolds to a fierce desire to embrace him and reveal a possible attraction to him, which in itself may disturb some who see it ) are among the most fascinating highlights of this exploitation feature. My second favorite scene besides the dance is the piano concert with Sayer fondling Maria, as she plays a soothing melody.
