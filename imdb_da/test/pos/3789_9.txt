Considering all the comedies with a military situation that has been made in history, one had to be the first. One could make a case that in the Shoulder Arms invented the Charlie Chaplin genre. <br /> <br /> It was hard to believe it, as it was a bold move. Considering that some of the best films involving people like Bob Hope, Abbott & Costello, involved Laurel & Hardy military service and made during wartime, it's just something you accept and laugh. <br /> <br /> In World War I Chaplin along with other stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went on farming trips. He was a great supporter of the Allied case, unusual for some of his leftist views. It seems only natural that the tramp would be drafted and unfortunately would flummox around and become devastating at all. <br /> <br /> A lot of things you would see in World War II service wars got their start in Shoulder Arms Chaplin had no more imitators because within a few weeks of the movie's release, the war was over. <br /> <br /> But a comedy art form had been established by one of the greatest comedies of the comedy.
