"Out to Sea" is a fun movie featuring the wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. This movie is not as fun as their "Grumpy Old Men" comedies (as it looks strongly), but there are many laughs all the way through. Lemmon and Matthau play a couple of in-laws taking a cruise together. When they arrive on the boat, Lemmon does not know that Matthau has signed them as dancers, so they do not have to pay for the cruise ship. This infuriates Lemmon, who has no mood to dance. What's worse, Matthau doesn't even know how to dance. Nevertheless, they go along with it, and it is the process that they meet some of their fellow passengers and crew members. Here are the crew members: There is the cruise director Gil Godwyn, played by "Star Trek: The Next Generation" veteran Brent Spiner, who acts as a vicious dictator. There are two fellow dance hosts, played by "Barney Miller" star Hal Linden and veteran movie musical star Donald O'Connor. There is the ship's owner Mrs. Carruthers, played by "Golden Girl" Rue McClanahan. As for the passengers: There is Vivian, a widow played by Gloria De Haven who falls in love with Lemmon. There is Liz, played by one of my all-time favorite actresses, Dyan Cannon, who falls in love with Matthau. There is Mavis, Liz's mother, played by veteran stadium actress Elaine Stritch. And they also meet others. All these actors are happy to see when Lemmon and Matthau play them. It's great to see the cannon here, look beautiful as ever; Stritch is a hoot; Spinner is a fun comic villain who plays the deadly straight De Haven is wonderful; Linden, O'Connor and McClanahan have a good moment or two; And finally, the two main stars, Lemmon and Matthau, are fine as usual. A nice little gem of a comedy. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
