This was really a profound film in every sense of the word. I myself was a missionary in Mormon, and I know first hand who wants to complete my mission, but at the same time hide the fact that I was gay. Like the character Aaron, I was sent home to be found and excommunicated, but being the only Mormon in a family of Catholics was not as great a shame as it was for the protagonist. This movie really took me back to those days and helped me realize years later how lucky I was to have a family that accepted me and understood what I was going through. I found myself applauding at the end of a movie when Aaron and Christian find each other again by cutting the chance at Lila's Restaurant. I was really moved to tears. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who reads this review and also declares it a must buy.
