I remember watching this movie when I was 13 years old and I fell in love with it and I was a big fan of the movie and the characters I offered. My favorite character was Stacey (Heidi Holicker) because she made me laugh when she didn't show interest in Fred (Cameron Dye) who really liked her and I hoped that eventually they would come together, so her dull boyfriend Ralphie Christopher Murray) because he ignored her and hung out with her friends. I love the cast and the story. I always love the part when Fred tries to get along with Stacey, and I always remember when he chased her around in the car. But it was so good. I will always remember to appreciate it in my teens. Now that I am 33 years old and I downloaded my copy on DVD and look forward to seeing it.
