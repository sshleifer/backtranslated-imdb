Jay Craven's criminally ignored film is a sober fresh air in the generally narcissistic and derived world of independent film. First and foremost, the photograph is pure aesthetic pleasure that captures all the gloomy beauty of northern New England in the fall (film photographer Paul Ryan did 2nd unit at Malick's Days of Heaven). Secondly, the performances are uniformly outstanding - Rip Tornes Noel Lourdes is irascibly charming, and Tantoo Cardinal's Bangor is immediately sensitive and bubbly, not to say anything about a fine support. Overall, it is a tribute to the film's narrative strength that history maintains a strong and lively pace while still unfolding in its own time, and the film comes to a consensus, natural and genuine, that does not seem to be expected. This is one of the rare values ​​in the independent film world, a film that explores a little bit of the intersection of people and history.
