This is one of my favorites. Betty White and Leslie Neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy. One is a business manager who re-evaluates life based on the expectation of her death within a year. The other is a playboy who is tired of gold-engraving young women and is seeking a relationship with a vital, mature woman. If you have silver in your hair and / or romance in your heart, microwave popcorn, curl up with your honey and prepare yourself for a treat.
