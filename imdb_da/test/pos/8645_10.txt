"Twin Peaks" and "Blue Velvet" have always been two of my favorite pieces of film making, and although previous films with lynch have been a little disappointing to me, they have always been worth a look. Being pretentious, lynch can be like a good wine - he must be savored and mulled over. But in the end you have to do what you have seen, for lynch never gives you the full answer. Many people will leave the "Mulholland Drive", which may be slamming over the mind-bending visual puzzle that has just unfolded before them. But there is a twisted logic on this movie, just look for the tracks. Betty (Naomi Watts) arrives in Hollywood, doe-eyed and in search of stardom. She then finds an amnesia in her bathroom, which has escaped from an attempted murder of Mulholland drives. together they try to uncover the secrets of the amnesia's life. all this leads to a club called silencio, where a blue box will reveal everything. And that's when the movie throws everything out of the window. People we thought we knew are completely different people ... is that a dream? a reminder of the past escapades of life? You will either love this movie or hate it. David Lynch always draws such extreme reactions from his viewers. But since the universe itself is always about extremes, it is appropriate that his films elicit such reactions. It is best to look at this movie thematically, rather than as a straight-forward story. And appreciate the fact that Lynch is a movie maker who will still let you draw your own conclusions. he has got many imitators as of late, especially in "vanilla sky", where a bend movie decides to give you all the answers in the last hasty five minutes and you will probably forget that movie as soon as you leave the cinema. Mulholland Drive will haunt you.
