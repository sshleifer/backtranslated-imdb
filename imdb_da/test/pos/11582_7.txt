I just saw Mar Ardentro and felt I had to comment on this movie. Euthanasia is a difficult subject in any area, and unfortunately it can sometimes distort the true value of a movie. Many have raved about the excellent cast and it is beautiful imagery / camera work. Certainly, Javier Bardem is an actor who brings something extra to every movie he makes. Saying that he includes the real Sampredo is a little stupid, as I don't think any of the reviewers have known Sampredo personally. Lying quietly and using some charm is an acting skill that, while well done, does not constitute a "perfect" achievement. Bardem does just what he does well ... and that's it. The camera work is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the film itself has to deliver. Sampredo here is shown as a man who is bent on dying so much that he leaves his loving family and marries a woman whom he only seeks when the other will not help him in his quest for a worthy death. Now I'm not here to say anything about the right to or against euthanasia. The problem is that when commenting on movies like this one can hardly escape it. The subject of the film is so strong that you are almost forced to discuss the movie in the strong topic. I find it a weakness for the film - unconsciously - shows Sampredo as an unhygienic character. Someone who is much smarter then his family is portrayed in the simple cousin who does not "get" the double-layered poem directed at him. Someone who wants to leave a loving and caring family because he believes his life is insignificant. A scene that coincides with the female lawyer who, according to the film, makes the "wrong" choice ends in a long state of dementia, suggesting that Sampredo's election was the right one. The woman who constantly seeks him is almost ignored for the beautiful lawyer, but is suddenly married to Sampredo when she tries to help him die. These choices make Sampredo a figured figure, no matter how charming Bardem portrays him. Arguments I would say it does not fully convince, and I think Amenabar did not intend to add this unbalanced element to his film. For a young director, it's still an impressive movie, and it has determined its strong moments (the discussion between the priest and Sampredo for example). The camera work is impressive and the film is well-functioning. But 10 out of 10 ... no, the movie doesn't reach the highest.
