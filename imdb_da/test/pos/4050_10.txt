When I began to see 3 of the episodes in this series on the Action Channel, I have to say out of all the shows I have seen that ADV released, this is one of the best shows at all times. I had to see it again and that was when I got my chance. I bought the whole set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th birthday. And I had to enjoy it and see more of the episodes I missed on the Action Channel and the same 3 episodes I've seen. My favorite characters in this show are: Sylvia, Leon and Nigel. The animation in this series was the best, and the hard suits were also cool. But the show also has a great voice cast like: Chris Patton, Jason Douglas, Christine Auten and Hillary The Hague, and more. So if you like this show on the Action Channel then you should own it on DVD. It is the best and you will see what I mean.
