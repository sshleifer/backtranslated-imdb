I liked this movie, not because Tom Selleck was in it, but because it was a good story about baseball, and it also had a semi-over dramatized view of some of the problems a BASEBALL player comes to the end of Their time in Major League sports must face. I also enjoyed very cultural differences in American and Japanese baseball and the little facts about how the games are played differently. Generally it is a good movie to watch on cable TV or rent on a cold winter night and look in the summer "Dog Day" and know that spring training is only a few months away. A great movie for a baseball fan as well as a good "DATE" movie ?? Trust me on the one! *Blink*
