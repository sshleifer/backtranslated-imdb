A boy who separates Maurice Richard from the Montreal Canadiens receives a lot for his horror, a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater in the post. I have recently seen this in a class where few of the students were interested in hockey, but almost everyone knew about Maurice Richard and the Toronto / Montreal rivalry. Very entertaining, fun and accurate.
