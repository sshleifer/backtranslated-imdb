How on earth can people give this film a low rating. Incredible. The performances of Wilkinson and Watson are so full of merit that I can only imagine that these critics were weaned on blockbusters and porn. (If that sounds bad, it's because I just dried my original 400 wiki right now). I was so impressed with Tom Wilkinson. Everyone hails the guy. This is a performance of considerable subtlety and massive skill. His development as an actor from The Full Monty to this masterpiece of performance is amazing; One of the best things to do in film production over the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson is somewhat less commanding because of the glint of the eye that says' see me? this naughty woman, here? You can't guess what to do next because I don't know it either! "It seems to be something she can't help showing us in every role, but still she is an actor with amazing ability and presence. She is very sexy here, as she should be, and fair play to her for this: This is a screen quality that I usually do not have in previous movies. <br /> <br /> As you might expect Rupert Everett to play an overclass late-30 something that could give Phd level guidance on how to not give a headline to hell because of total selfishness, deliver. He's so thin here, but in the whole movie I'm worried about him. Linda Bassett's housekeeper is also excellent: a small role, but with a great plot twist to deliver, she gets you thinking about how much talent we have in the UK in terms of character. I'd like to see more of her. <br /> <br /> The story arch is fine; It is an interesting enough plot, since no one in filmmaking apparently tries to convince Joe Public that there is nothing new under the sun, even though it contradicts the 40's melodrama in the last "reel". But remember it - it's worth a fantastic 80 minutes for anyone with half-brain money. Congratulations to Julian Fellowes on his first leadership effort: o How we need more movies of substance like this. He shows a lot of skills in adapting the original novel, telling a story with great efficiency and subtlety. And congratulations on highlighting a huge exhibition of movie actors' art by Mr Tom Wilkinson. What a geezer. <br /> <br /> T.
