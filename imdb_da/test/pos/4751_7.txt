Seven-Ups is a good and exciting movie. It's full of credible performances by Scheider, LaBianco and an effective frightening performance by Richard Lynch - although most of the characters are card-board cut-out hard guys. Sign development does not develop at all on the screen. All we know is the good guys are the good guys and the bad guys are bad. Deviating from the crime story, The Seven-Ups manages to throw Scheider and the crew into the middle of a construction site in a unique writing twist. On the spot in New York City and an excellent choreographed car ticket, the film is highlighted. The only drawback to the movie is the somewhat confusing plot line at first. They give the viewer some evidence that the men were kidnapped, are mob-related (until later in the movie). Had anyone blindly seen the movie, it may be a bit confused on the story. Otherwise, The Seven-Ups is a greedy, testosterone-filled enjoyable time.
