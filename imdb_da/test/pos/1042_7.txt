I always wanted Barbara Stanwyck, who was perhaps the hardest working actress from the 30s and 40s, though few of her movie roles are memorable. Today she is remembered most for the television show "The Big Valley". Stanwyck worked so much because she was durable; It seems that she would accept most every role and make the most of it to make the movie a success, and so leaders loved her and many a common picture gained credibility with her presence. And then for "Christmas in Connecticut" it was a very ordinary effort whose plot comes from credibility and is not even really Christmas. However, it has Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan as well as some top rated actors, including Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. Sakall so there are plot twists and funny moments that undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than they do today. Initially, the plot is about a magazine writer (Stanwyck), which the magazine's readers believe is a domestic goddess, married to a child and living on a farm in Connecticut, but who is truly single, lives in New York City and knows nothing about cooking or housekeeping. Could anyone get away with such a fraud even then? Apparently, and even the owner of the leaf (Greenstreet) is being deceived, even if one would think he would have seen it long ago, but the story continues, and Stanwyck, Greenstreet, survived a sailor recently from his sunken ship (Morgan ) and Stanwyck's restaurant friends (SZSakall) find themselves spending Christmas in Connecticut on a farm belonging to Stanwyk's bearable boyfriend (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine all the possibilities for this, as the scam loosens as it should. Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to continue the raid, but you wonder how she can stand him at all. Morgan and Stanwyck fall for each other, but he must be engaged and she must be married. Either way, they begin what seems to be a make-believe affair dancing cheek to cheek and stealing in a horse-drawn sleigh. Meanwhile, the incredibly naive Greenstreet character who has seen Stanwyck and Morgan go together, but still does not understand that one of the neighbors is taking a child back as part of the fraud and urging the police to report a kidnapping. Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the sled and the hoax begins to relax. <br /> <br /> At this point, the movie is fun as in ridiculously or absurdly, not fun, having and routinely ending as screwball comedies always did. The good guy gets the girl and they probably live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie every year at Christmas to enjoy these character actors at their best in a story that reflects the way it was in 1945 and because of a long-standing fascination with Barbara Stanwyck. Thank goodness it was set for Christmas or as 95 percent of Stanwick's movies it would be a long time ago forgotten and we would not see it again every year.
