A gang of bandits led by the clever, rugged, inconsiderate Monetero (a perfectly impressive achievement by Gilbert Roland) steals $ 300,000 gold coins under a daring robbery. But untrustworthy member Bahunda (a fun tour of Jose Torres) gets rid of the coins and saves them. Unfortunately, the Bahunda is killed before he can tell Monetero where he stashed booty. So Monetero has to join in with cunning, horny, enigmatic bounty hunter the Stranger (smoothly played by the beautiful George Hilton) and cagey, corrupt banker Clayton (a nice weaselly depiction of 50's teen idol Eddie "Kookie" Burns) for to find the coins. Cleverly directed by Enzo G. Castellari, with a clever, complex and twisted script of Castellari, Tito Carpi and Giovanni Simonelli, a playful amoral and nihilistic tone (all double and triple cross each other with happy greedy task), a Twangy, tasteful, exhilarating score by Alessandro Alessandroni and Francesco De Masi, lots of appalling shoots and praises of irregularities, a vicious dull sense of sugary humor, a steady pace and a real doozy of a surprise, this shuddered and often hilarious feature of an inspired broadcast ends up by Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." Popping in nifty secondary parts is the delicious Stefanie Careddu like Monetero's fiery mad pal Marisol, Ivano Staccioli as a hard-hired army captain, and Gerard Herter as flinty lawyer Lawrence Blackman. A very entertaining and enjoyable treasure.
