John Wayne is one of the few players in the film history who has failed his first big break and then succeeds in the second time. Of course, everyone knows that the second time was the classic Stagecoach with John Ford director. <br /> <br /> But we're here to talk about The Big Trail. John Ford's director, Raoul Walsh, discovered this long-standing child on a Ford movie set and thought he had potential. He wanted to make him look in a big budget western, as Fox was planning to do. The film as planned would be a tribute to the famous classic quiet western The Covered Wagon. In seeing The Big Trail I was struck by how similar to Wayne's character by Breck Coleman here is to Ringo Kid in Stagecoach. Both figures were sympathetic young cowpokes, but both were also vengeance. And of course both films were made on the spot and show the cost of making them. No studio product here with a backlot western set. <br /> <br /> Also, I don't think it was an accident that Wayne got this break at the beginning of the sound. Raoul Walsh, I guess looked around Hollywood and probably didn't think a lot of movie cowboys would have power in sound. That's something else Walsh saw in Wayne. <br /> <br /> According to what I've read The Big Trail flopped, after using all the money to make the film in an early wide-screen process, a genius at Fox understood that their theaters were not equipped with the wide screen to show it. And since the Great Depression hit, there would be no money to expand these screens at Fox movie houses. So The Big Trail got a limited edition, even in what we would call a formatted version, and lost money big for Fox movies. <br /> <br /> Marguerite Churchill is fine as Crinoline Heroine, which Duke wins, loses and wins again from Ian Keith. Keith, Charles Stevens and F. Tyrone Power are the trio of villains that Wayne has to deal with. <br /> <br /> F. Tyrone Power is the father of the famous film legend Tyrone Power. He was a great burly man with a great background in classic roles on the screen and on stage. I wouldn't be surprised if his son, who would have been 15 at that time, might not have hung around the set. <br /> <br /> Also look for Ward Bond, though you might have trouble spotting him under a big bush beard. It is interesting to wonder where John Wayne's career might have gone if The Big Trail had been a big hit.
