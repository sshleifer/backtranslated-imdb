Reading through the comments seems to be very nonsense about La Pianist's emotional banality. I find it hard to understand, given Isabelle Huppert's excellent performance. Huppert is poignant - she manages to convey the woman perfectly on the edge, full of self-hatred and error. <br /> <br /> The film is wonderfully paced and rated. It would be so easy to portray management as a ridiculous figure - consider, for example. The scene in the porn business. Somehow, Huppert is able to carry it off, partly because of her brilliant performance, but also because the director makes her surreal life right and identifiable. <br /> <br /> Don't ignore this movie. It's one of the most spectacular and engaging movies (and performances) I've seen. <br /> <br /> Trust Boris!
