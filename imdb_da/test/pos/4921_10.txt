This is a classic animated movie from the cartoon series! Most of the big characters get a lot of screen time plus extra characters! The film's focus is on superstar character holiday and each has its unique summer fun! It's great fun from the beginning to the end! It has excellent color, good music and believe it or not, I've seen this more than any movie. It's so big and in my opinion the perfect one!
