From the director of Oldboy comes this smooth vampire girl. Kang-ho Sang stars as a priest who was accidentally turned into a vampire while being healed by a deadly mysterious virus. His vampireism and priesthood are in conflict, but he is able to survive by robbing the hospital's blood bank and unconscious patients who may not mind any blood pressure. Because of his supposed miraculous survival, he comes into the life of Ha-kyun Shin's family. Shin has cancer and his mother believes Song can cure it. Unfortunately, the vampireism of the song raises its desires at a height where he cannot help fall to Shin's young wife, OK wine Kim. Kim is very interested in the world of vampyrism, and the two become lovers. The movie from there goes in strange directions, which I think you should experience for yourself. What really should be mentioned is Chan-wook Park's cinema media mastery. My God, I rarely have seen such a masterful artist on top of his powers. The biggest mistake in the movie is that it is a bit disjointed, especially near the beginning. Park is interested in telling his stories mostly in the pictures, which can be difficult to follow at times. But when it works, man, it flies. The movie is also perversely fun. The final sequence, which is easily one of the best in the decade, is at the same time heartbreaking and pleasantly ridiculous. OK wine Kim will be a worldwide star after this movie. She gives one of the year's best performances.
