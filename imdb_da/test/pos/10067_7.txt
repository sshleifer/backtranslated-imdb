I am really sorry that this film has received so much negative criticism. I think it's a nice little comedy and really fun. The mood of this movie is a little hot and innocent, and I like it. I also like Madonna's character and I don't agree that she played herself. She has created a character and a sympathetic one. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes were the battle situation on the sinking car and where Madonna climbs over the fence into a decorative dress to claim her love. The mood of the film has a slightly acid-realistic touch, and perhaps not everyone's cup of tea. But that's their problem, not the movie. <br /> <br /> I found this movie sound and sunny. In fact, the day I first saw it, I was incredibly sad for some reason, and this movie turned on my day. And Madonna can act. Just take your glasses off negative thinking.
