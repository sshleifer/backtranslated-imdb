I am an Australian living in Japan. I watched this movie on TV here and was very impressed with the accuracy and honesty of the depiction of Western and Japanese ideologies colliding. Anyone who wrote the play and directed this movie must have a good knowledge of how it is to be a foreigner living in Japan. The only part I thought was for Hollywood-y was when Tom Selleck's characters kiss the woman in the middle of the office and she lets him down. Public shows of love are not really acceptable here. Finally, a movie that highlights the true 'Gaijin' experience! 9.10
