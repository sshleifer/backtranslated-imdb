1. I've seen Branagh's Hamlet: Branagh is too old, often speaks with a high pitched voice (unwillingly fun!) - not a convincing Hamlet and his directors qualities - poor! (See also much ado about nothing from Branagh - the fun parts of the dialogues have mostly been cut out without talking about the mistakes of the directors in the dialogue cuts!) 2. I have seen Hamlet 2000: I think the scenario is an interesting idea - but such miserable actors - all of them 3. Orson Welles Hamlet is OK - but this BBC Hamlet is the best! Derec Jacobi is convincing - seems a bit of a lunatic - very suitable! and Patric Stewart - wonderful, and Claire Bloom is a very attractive queen. You believe in these actors what they say - I think it's the best compliment.
