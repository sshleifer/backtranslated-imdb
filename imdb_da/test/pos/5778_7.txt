Well, someone who enjoys traveling down the highway at 120kmph eats McDonalds and runs the air conditioner fifty-four and sees Fox News non-stop, I found this documentary interesting. One thing I picked up when talking about North America, I suppose this documentary was Fabrique Au Canadie. For the Canadian bashing, I will leave it to Bill O'Reilly. <br /> <br /> The consequence of oil spills will affect everyone, especially those living in large countries in Australia, Canada and the United States. I am sure green peace fears no more gas, does not mean more SUVs without realizing that people living in the under-zero temperature could starve to death. <br /> <br /> As one who has studied economics, I know for a fact that we are living in a world of limited resources. I will give the documentary props to try to present a balanced view of oil depletion. But I'm studying a degree in journalism, this documentary is full of loaded messages - Republican as warmongers. What did the Democrats not send troops to Vietnam? <br /> <br /> To present a finance and resources documentary, it is best to leave the political bashing on one side, because it could bring a potential audience to a halt. Concentrate on the issue of final resources. At the end of the day, it is best to open ordinary minds, as it is not good to preach to the minuscule chorus. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy watching documentaries like the Fahrenheit 911 and End of Suburbia not for their political bias because they remind us that the world is not so secure. Sure I like to shop and consume junk food as if there is no tomorrow, but if the world comes to an end tomorrow, I'd rather die rich and consume the living bee out of it. <br /> <br /> For the potential documentaries out there, just give the people facts and let viewers do their own thoughts. If you try to package your political views as a balanced documentary, people will smell a rat a mile away.
