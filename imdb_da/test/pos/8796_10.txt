Hi everyone, all I have to say is that human traffic and all its characters are so real it's fun. I live in Australia (Melbourne) and I'm finally out of clubbing and staying throughout the weekend's lifestyle. This film explains everything going on in the world. So exactly, I can't stop seeing it .... I used to be exactly like Moff, so my friends said, and I didn't even see the movie. I left the weekend party behind about 3 months ago after 4 years of intense parties to change my life around .. I was at a DVD store when I saw human traffic and I remember my old friends going one on it so I bought to see what all the fuss was about .. I was in it I saw it 4 times in a row because I couldn't believe anyone had made a movie explaining everything to a T. Still, this movie is far the best and funniest movie I've ever seen .. It's fun because it's so truthful in everything going on in the movie .. AND Moff is a legend !!! That's all I have to say .. :) Enjoy 11/10 blew my socks out on how real it was, that's exactly what's going on in the world .. hr rm I jabber a lot <br /> <br /> beware of everyone together...
