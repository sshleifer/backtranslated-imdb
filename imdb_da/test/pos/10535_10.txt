This is definitely the best 80s cartoon ever, perhaps the best cartoon of all time. It had all the action, adventure, excitement and more ... I can't imagine how difficult it was for the Ruby-Spears to make this great cartoon that has spent a lot of money on this masterpiece of work, and It was worth it, for example, just the brilliant scenes were hard because I wouldn't call the 1980s a great technological year with computers like now in the world we live in, so the brilliant scenes were excellent! The drawings will never be the same as they were before, so I hope they will all be released on DVD especially the Centurions as it is my favorite. I have the complete set of 65 episodes on DVD-r, but that's not the same, because if they were released on DVD, people in the world could buy it and watch the DVDs in almost any store, which means a lot to fans. My good friend Ted made this petition to either get the show back on TV or better on DVD, ie if we get many requests to get them back on DVD.
