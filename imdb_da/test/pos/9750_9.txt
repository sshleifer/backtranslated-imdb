It was a thought-provoking and well-shot and directed television movie that took a big issue with precision and intelligence, and gives it a movie treatment that would look great on a larger screen - the palette is a bit subdued for television. If you're looking for a war movie or "Bosnia little", it's not for you - it's about a regular woman who took an extraordinary challenge for humanity. If you want to learn more about the conflict and how a woman's work has influenced the world in a massive way, watch this movie when it comes your way. I cannot see that many other television films have addressed the issue of genocide and ethnic hatred at this level. The story obviously avoids the demonization of "the evil ones", and instead shows the denial and daily hatred that resulted in thousands of deaths. I was moved in several places and not in any manipulative Hollywood way of running music and flashy mise-one scene, but was allowed to discover horror and consequences along with the characters. This is a movie that is brave enough to let the content speak for itself and suppress the picture frames to support it with dignity. The actors do a helluva job to bring the intense dramatic scenes to life. The scenes where victims give their testimony before the war court are powerful, and Wendy Crewson, Stipe Erceg and Heino Ferch are excellent. William Hurt's British accent is terrible - no one else has given him the opportunity to play a Brit, and when he finally gets it, he blows it! - And although John Corbett's body was born to play a soldier / command, he is also a little good, even though he does a good job.
