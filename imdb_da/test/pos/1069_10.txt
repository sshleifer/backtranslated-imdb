I first saw this movie about 15 years ago and I have since been enchanted by it. It is such a good experience that I could happily see it at any time of the year. But for me it's the ultimate Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that it's in B & W is irrelevant - though I often wonder how it would be in color. You can just get the warm, glowing feeling to see the Christmas events unfold. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck and Morgan are perfect together, and the Greenstreet is the opposite of his usual character, Sakall is a blistering joy to see. <br /> <br /> It is easy relief and certainly does not treasure the brain, but let yourself feel glad you saw it. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for it to be available on DVD in the UK. I must definitely be in the queue front to buy it.
