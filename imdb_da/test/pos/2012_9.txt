I enjoyed this show, it was on in the UK but not at peak times and they seemed to be moving it all the time so I couldn't see them all. I was surprised when it didn't come back and had no idea why it still doesn't know, but I don't think it's important. Great performances from the two drivers, they were very trustworthy as friends. The two supporting actresses also added well to the mix. I suppose it was part of a series of shows that were lifestyle-centered, Friends were the most obvious head, but sex in the city came together a few years later. The characters, take out the coffee, they drink in fine bars, that kind of thing, a little woody allenish in a way.
