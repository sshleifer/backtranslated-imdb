Hong Kong Movie Creator Chang Chang At 1972 martial arts films "The Five Fingers of Death" is widely regarded by a large number of film experts and kung-fu movie fanatics to be the martial arts movie that started it all. <br /> <br /> Released in 1972, phase 2 of the three-step process that would lead to the explosion of martial arts films in the West - "Billy Jack" (1971) with his famous Hapkido showdown in the park was released. the year before, and Bruce Lee starred in "Enter the Dragon" (1973) two years later, thereby solidifying the martial arts film's location in the Western cinema. But what is all about hoopla about "Five Fingers of Death"? The movie, with its horrible duplication, explosive (if not highly unlikely) action sequences and technical flaws and all, has a plot, albeit very thin. Chih-Hao (the late Lo Lieh) is a young and dedicated student of Chinese gong-fu who is selected to represent his school in a forthcoming martial arts tournament. His teacher offers to give him the opportunity to train himself in the "Iron Fist" game, a style so deadly that it could very easily kill a man with only one stroke. <br /> <br /> In addition, Chih-Hao's arrival at school coincides with a violent conflict with a rival school, its students, and a trio of murderous heavy heaters from Japan. Before you know, a major setback threatens Chih-Hao's training and his ability to represent his beloved school in the upcoming tournament. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that "Five Fingers of Death" is actually a movie that started it all. As another viewer, "Five Fingers of Death" helped set many standards in martial arts films over the next three decades - Asian, European and North American martial arts films. Such standards include the dedicated student, the learning of patience and perseverance, conflict between rival schools, the intense ethnic hostility of the Chinese and Japanese, and a system of struggle for the good old-fashioned action movie motif: revenge. "Five Fingers of Death" would also make a big impact on American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's "Kill Bill" movie (Tarantino borrows quite liberally from this project among many, just so you know). <br /> <br /> Considering that this is a martial arts movie from the early 1970s, the best one is Lo Lieh. As the atypical student of martial arts, his performance is quite groundbreaking, but at first glance at this film one would not really know it because of how the special arc of character has been made to death so many times over the years. He is rather humble in his acting, does everything he can to endure his enemies and does not fight them in anger or bow to their level of stupidity or arrogance. Even when he suffers from his great setbacks, it makes your heart sink a little because it is so brutal and you wonder if he is going to recover enough to realize his lifelong ambition. <br /> <br /> "Five Fingers of Death" is a classic in every sense. It is by no means perfect, and viewers would be crazy to expect anything from the caliber of the "Godfather" of martial arts films. What it gives you is the ultimate example of Eastern hand-to-hand struggle from the time before the Eastern Cinema was a great fixture in the West. <br/> <br /> 7/10 <br /> PS: "Enter the Dragon" Bolo Yeung also appears as the Mongolian street fighter near the beginning of the movie.
