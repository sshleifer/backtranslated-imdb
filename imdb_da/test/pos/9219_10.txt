I watched this movie as a child and still enjoy seeing it every time for the nostalgia actor. When I was younger I loved the movie because of the entertaining story and interesting characters. Today I still love the characters. Moreover, I think of the plot with greater consideration, because I now see the morality and symbolism. Rainbow Brite is far from the worst movie ever, and even though I'm outdated, I'm sure I'll show it to my kids in the future when I have kids.
