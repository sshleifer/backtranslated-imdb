A very good movie focusing on a very important question. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is completely prevented. If several families saw this movie, more children might not end up as Adam. Jimmie Smits performs in one of his best roles ever. This is an excellent movie that caters for a very special family with very important needs. This is not unlike thousands of families in the United States today. There are children who struggle with this worldwide. The really important point here is that it could all have been prevented. More people should watch this movie and take what it has to say seriously. It is well done, with important messages, handled in a graceful way.
