When a saboteur discovers a controversial government research laboratory, two experimental animals are solved in a small community in Washington State. One is a dog with unusual intelligence. The other is an "Outside eXperimental COmbat Mammal" or "OXCOM". Because of the reasons uncovered further into the film, the oxen envelops the dog and it tries to kill it. Guards attack the inappropriate involvement of Travis Cornell (Corey Haim), his mother Nora (Barbara Williams) and his girlfriend Tracey (Lala Sloatman) with the dog and oxcom as two agencies of the National Security Organization, Lem Johnson (Michael Ironside) and Cliff Blu Mankuma ), track them. <br /> <br /> Many comments are made about Watchers being very different from the Dean Koontz book, which serves as the launch pad for the movie. It is true. But it should not affect your rating. If you want the book, read the book. Judge the movie on its own benefits, not how close it fits the book. Bill Freed and Damian Lee, who wrote the script, are as many artists as Koontz are (it's not a quality comparison, just a statement that they are all artists). So is director Jon Hess. Their job as filmmakers is not to follow the book as if it were a script. They adapt the book as artists to create a unique work of art. It is based on the book. Not identical to it. You must loosen your predictions / expectations when you watch the movie because you will experience a work of art that you are not already familiar with, even though you have read Koontz's novel. <br /> <br /> So is Watchers a good movie? It's pretty good, not excellent. Good enough to earn a "B" or an 8. Hess begins things on the right foot with one of the most beautiful filmed explosions I've seen for a while. Unfortunately, he raises a little as soon as we listen to some very thick, jargonistic exhibitions. After this scene, Watchers threatens to become a clichéd 1980 movie when we first meet Travis and Tracey. Weaving against cliché is a trend that is constantly threatened. But it's just a bias. More often than not, Hess is able to transcend well-believed territory with a number of interesting twists: both Travis and Tracey are from single parent homes, with their sex revolutions. Both have unique, mature relationships with their parents. Although this is a horror movie, a big focus is a sweet, intelligent dog, and it often feels as much as a fairy tale movie, as it makes horror, a thriller or sci-fi, all genres it touches. Hess introduces a large number of characters, some do not go in late into the game, but the film is never confusing and no sign feels like they are left in the dust - all the threads are nicely tied in the end. The structure is also complex because there are two major villains, and the other becomes less obviously dissatisfied when the film progresses until a twist accompanied by brutal violence makes an antagonist clearer. Shortly afterwards, Hess gives us a good moment of doubt with the other antagonist. The biggest mistake in my eyes is a horrible, common horror movie since at least the 1980s - "attacked" scenes are shot too dark, too close, out of focus and they are being edited for choppily. It makes it extremely difficult to tell what's going on, which changes most tensions from scenes that should be a highlight. Certainly, part of Hess's motivation for the style, and this is the typical reason for this problem, was concern that the creature would come across as humorous and / or fake rather than scary and exciting. In my opinion, presenting the audience with a dizzying blur is not a satisfactory solution. We will only see the creature costume / makeup clearly at the end of the film. It was probably done that better shots and edited attack scenes would have brought the movie up to at least 9. Regardless of the degree of correspondence between the novel and the film, Watchers presents a poignant story using smart, prolonged characters. It's often a nail bite, and the horror scenes are more feral than you might expect, if not exactly gory (although there are a lot of blood in a few scenes). Guards tend to be underestimated due to misunderstandings about the role of the film in adapting the literature - do not let it pass or sum up rejecting it on the basis of a misunderstanding.
