This movie came as a gift - a late night offered by the blue - so unlike other reviewers, I had no bets at all. I found myself glued to my seat, as the film slowly dictated its own rhythm, its own unfolding. I was attracted to acknowledging my own deep love and humanity, which I wanted "good" to win - but also forced to recognize that I was sometimes on the side of the "bad" guys. The film is pretty pretty - the word "elegiac" comes to mind, and more so because the movie begins and ends in an elegy. Far from being depressing or confronting, the film recognizes deep suffering - and then, in its cyclical nature - with births and rebirths as well as deaths - the film celebrates the fact that to quote an aussie poet there is "sometimes joy." Oh gods, I feel like tho I just wrote a love letter to this movie - but there it is. Hi!
