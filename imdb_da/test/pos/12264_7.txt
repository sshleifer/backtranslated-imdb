James L. Brook is one of the directors who always seems to take a quirky look at life. He is not only the producer of "The Simpsons", he has some classic comedies under his belt - "Broadcast News" is one of them. Although it does not fit his later efforts "As Good as it Comes," "Broadcast News" is still a very clever, fun and witty movie about a television radio station and all the problems they suffer from. There is a great comedy sequence of physical humor where Joan Cusack runs around the building and tries to rush a news band to the editing room in minutes before it is broadcast live on television. <br /> <br /> This is not only very truthful as to how hectic TV stations operate, but also a skilled and honest portrayal of people. A low-key, subtle movie with good acting (especially from Hurt, who I don't always like so much) and apt direction.
