Brown returned to his role from the previous year (in "Slaughter") for this tough follow-up movie. In the original, he had claimed his parents' slaying by wiping out a large mob organization in Mexico. Here he is the one who is persecuted (reciprocated) by a money launderer portrayed by McMahon. When the first attempt of murder fails, Brown is back in action and kicks the gangster stump everywhere as he tries to protect his new girlfriend Hendry. While the original film was generally a better and more coherent movie, it delivers all the exploit aspects in much heavier doses, making it more comfortable for fans of the genre. Apart from a rather dull opening to horseback and a direct deadly car driving down a village at night, this movie rocks at a very fast pace. Every few minutes, one or more of the following are shown: drug use, sex, nudity, gunplay, murder or other action. Brown is his usual reliable, gracious self-help, aided by his amazing physical presence, which goes far beyond any stiffness in his acting. McMahon is a rebellion! With tinted glasses and his hair separated in the middle (!), He has been shown to execute orders for his gang with thugs and is overheard and makes passionate love for his fur-covered bimbo. Seeing Johnny Carson's sidekick in a role like this is a perverse excitement. Stroud gives an impression as an intense, racist-threatening warrior, while Peters just adds a bit of class as an upright policeman who calls for Brown's help. Unfortunately, there is no mention of Brown's original sidekicks Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly, Brown now has a girlfriend (Hendry) who is sympathetic enough, but lacks the well-being and personality that Stevens had before. Williams makes an outrageous ride as a pimp, who apparently can pick any girl out of a bar and make her an instant member of his harem. The kinematics and overall direction are less polished than the first film, but one has a drive and a sense of danger that exceeds the original's feel. The movie spends a lot of time in the wastewater of organized crime, drugs, prostitution and other cargoes, but it keeps the interest through the creativity of its action scenes and the scary lack of political correctness. A strange note: A key-supporting player in the first movie was shown to be shot dead, but appears here in another role.
