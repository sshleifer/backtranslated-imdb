If this movie had been directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick, it would be recognized for what it is: a cinematic masterpiece, told with depth and subtlety and passion, a film without being in the visual realm. It is incredibly impressive and also very brutal in its portrayal of our great heritage of greed and extinction. And of course, what the reviewers could not observe is that it doesn't tell a simple narrative cock and jane story like 99% of Hollywood output. Its characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and feelings. They even think, something that your average movie reviewers don't understand and can't observe, so they ruined it. See the original unknown wide-format version. It is fantastic.
