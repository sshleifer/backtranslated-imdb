As an ex-nuclear weapon officer, I must admit that this is my favorite submarine movie (even exceeding Hunt for Red October). Someone knew something about submarines when they wrote the movie. OK - not realistic - but it's a comedy - and has all the "inside jokes" from the submarine force. A great throw with the stereotypical uptight submarine birds on "Orlando" and our heroes on the diesel boat. Absolutely "DBF" by the way = it means diesel boats forever. But they want ten lines to post this - are you admiral responsibilities here? <br /> <br /> Line 10.
