Nostalgia is not always the best reason to watch a movie. More often than not, the movies you loved as a child will disappoint you as an adult. Although there are exceptions to this rule, it is difficult to justify owning a Krull DVD, no matter how many insightful director's comments may be. But be sharp Gen X / Ys because the dozens of disappointments that dominate your trip down the memory channel can prevent you from stumbling across a worthwhile regain. <br /> <br /> A surprise movie worth seeing is Joel Schumacher's Flatliners, the supernatural thriller starring 80's popcorn heavyweights Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts and Billy Baldwin. You'd think a stew consisting of this caste, Schumacher's flamboyant flair and the well-known eye of filmmaker Jan De Bont would result in something morbidly stodgy, but calories aside ... Flatliners aren't half bad. While it's production design is inexplicably over-the-top, and the photo is heavily over-styled (filled with neon soaked streets spitting endless steam sources), Flatliners still manage to be an effective dark and compelling thriller. If there is an explanation as to why Flatliners were forgotten, it could be because 1990 saw the release of another, far superior, supernatural thriller: Jacobs Ladder. Had Flatliners been released a year or two after Jacobs Ladder? Probably Schumacher's flashy thriller would have been dismissed as a toned down commercialized rip-off by Adrian Lyne's nightmare masterpiece. But when these films were released in the same year, Flatliners had another fate, tripling JL's take on the ticket office despite being a dilute version of a similar premise. The passage of time has not been so kind to Flatliners, it has been lost on a dated pile of 80's Brat Pack kills, while JL has cemented its reputation as a timeless classic. Destiny aside, JL is seamlessly scary and succeeds in keeping the audience guessing all the way to the last frame, while Flatliners is the victim of over-simplification and Hollywood conveniences that pull the final action into a predictably tidy breakdown. Comparisons between the two films are unfair and ultimately overlook Flatlin's ability to represent the 80s at its very best. Released at the end of a decade of superficial surplus, Flatliners will always be dated by its hairstyles and clothing styles, but in fairness it must also be remembered as a well-executed film on (or at least near) the top of its particular pile of drunk. For purposes and purposes it is an entertaining walk down memory path.
