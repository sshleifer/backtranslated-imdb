An interesting companion to true documentaries by John C. Holmes. Unfortunately, it's not about what ultimately killed Holmes, and it could certainly have benefited from it. Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg received the greatest praise for this, but I felt the true stars were Julianne Moore as cocaine snooping wannabe, Don Cheadle as a black man struggling with identity as a porn star / stereo seller in some wild getups and William H. Macy whose wife is the ultimate sludge. Not to mention an almost unrecognizable Alfred Molina. Macy's New Year's Eve bash and Cheadle's chance for a better life after a donut shop robbery went wild wrong is probably the two best scenes in the movie, or at least the two best shots. What this movie shows best is how power can easily be corrupted in its various forms. However, none of the signs seem to teach anything from their dark downward spiral as they all return and return to their normal lives.
