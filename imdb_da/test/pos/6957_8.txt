This is a fine, under-rated movie and Rip Torn, known as he is, is a serious under-rated actor. I read Howard Frank Mosher's novel many years ago. How Well Craven Captures the Book and Beauty of Vermont's Northeast Kingdom! I was fortunate to grow up in the VT in the 40s and 50s and still lived there when "Irasburg Incident" took place. I haven't seen _Stranger in Kingdom_, the Craven / Mosher collaboration based on the incident (and another Mosher novel), but this movie has inspired me to track it.
