The film is a remake of a BBC series from 1956 called 'My friend Charles', and as such galops through the material in a relatively short time. I found it quick to move, fun and unpretentious. Let someone see other scenes towards the end, where John Mills was gas? - Of course, the producers decided to omit the scenes - perhaps censorship? - but note when he sat at the window's flat, deep breathing followed closely by similar scenes with open car window. The Francis Durbridge series all seemed to be in the same universe, namely unexplained events, people are not what they think, and the villain is close to the hero / victim. A predictable universe in some ways, but one with its own rules and rules.
