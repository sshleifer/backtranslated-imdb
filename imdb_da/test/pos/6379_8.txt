I think it was far back in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend, and I saw in the papers that one of the theaters played 'teen deviyan'. We decided to just go for it without hoping for anything good. But we were in a pleasant surprise. The film was made in 1965, but even according to today's standards, the plot was quite modern and far ahead of its times. The music was wonderful, and Dev Anand as a city breeder looked and acted his best. I still remember the elated feeling when we came out of the theater after the movie was over. <br /> <br /> Who was thinking of this story of a man who fell into three very different girls at the same time? No he is not three timing or fooling them, but he really likes all three for different reasons. One is homely, one is an actress and the third is a "high society" girl who can also help Dev in her career as a poet. The question is which one is to him. What makes the case worse is that all three of them also like him. When things come to a dead end, a hypnotist takes him in, and in his hypnotized state, he dreams of his future with each one and reaches the right decision. <br /> <br /> This dream of his, the only colored part in an otherwise black-and-white movie, is at the heart of the movie, but surprisingly edited by most versions available today. To watch this movie, make sure this part is intact. If you see this movie without this part and get confused, don't worry because you just watched an incomplete movie.
