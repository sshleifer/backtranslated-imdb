I found this DVD in the library, and it was based on the jackets, it looked as though it was interesting: a black comedy set in 1940 France, just as the Germans march in. ("Boy, it should make them roll in times ??") But it does! This is a smart, original, exciting and fun movie. I can't remember seeing anything like this before? Foreign or American that the author / instructor can find humor when we know part of the result (the Germans will occupy France for four years) is remarkable. That he does so with such charm is part of the joy. What starts as black comedy and fluff even ended with a few serious moments ?? including a race to the spirit out of a "heavy water" cache (which was part of the preliminary research for the A bomb) and a rapid history 101 initiated by the beginning of the cooperating Vichy government that would rule the South of France for much of German occupation. * But don't let any of that scare you away: the movie itself is fun, charming and romantic, and runs forward on a stable clip. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about it is the combination of actors we've seen many times (Adjani and Depardieu) and others we've never heard of before. Along the way there are two star shifts: Virginie Leydoyen and Grégori Derangère. Both are impressive, but Mr Derangère is particularly so. According to IMDb, was he in ten movies before this one? but he also won Cesar as "most promising actor" for this role, so he apparently was not all well-known even in France. He is a combination of romantic lead and comic actor ?? and he makes it all seem so effortless. You can be reminded of Cary Grant in "Bringing Up Baby" and "Arsenic and Old Lace" ?? It's hard to make comedy on movies, because the risks are huge, the actor can come out and look unlucky. But Grant drew it off charming and this guy does it too. I should think that we will hear more about him in the future. <br /> <br /> To be sure, this movie will not please everyone ?? There is a bit of violence, although nothing you do not watch on TV every day. But if you are up for something original, you can feel when you have seen this, that you have searched a movie strain. <br /> <br /> * The so-called "spoiler" in this comment.
