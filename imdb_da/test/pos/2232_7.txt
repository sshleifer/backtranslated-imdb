I tivo'd this at Turner Classic just because it was pre-code and sounded interesting. When I came around to see, I noticed that the "criticism" gave it one and a half stars on a four-star scale. I started to look with trepidation - even old movies can be bad movies - but I quickly became involved in the story and Mary Astor's performance as the business brains behind a simple seller's rise to success. Not a really good movie - too predictable - but surely better than advertised. And I would have liked to see more of Ricardo Cortez as the man who appreciates Mary, but will not give up her rich wife. I would recommend giving it a look just to appreciate Astor, and how far we've come, baby.
