I was shocked to hear that Jimmy Caan left this show, does anyone know why? I consider James as one of the all-time greats and was not surprised he ended up on television, which may be better than what you see on the big screen. The stories are slim and the camera faster than a speed ball! Don't forget the rest of the cast: James, Vanessa (yum!) Nikki, Molly, Josh, Mitch. Can anyone also tell me why in the world there is a crap theme on the DVD sets, but Elvis JXL remix of a small minor conversation is used on the initial NBC broadcasts ?? Isn't it sensible to use a tune that you would associate with gambling mecca in America for DVD releases ??
