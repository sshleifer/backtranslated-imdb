This was a fantastic movie with flight scenes that was incredibly realistic! I have seen it several times and it has kept my attention all the time. I'm a big fan of the Air Force and love watching movies where I can catch a glimpse of an F-16 flying. If you like Top Gun, I guarantee you will love this movie as well. Apart from a few mildly cursed words, this is an excellent movie for the whole family. It has a large plot and has no dull moment in the whole movie. Every second is action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next time. So again I highly recommend this movie !!!
