I buy it for a dollar !!! <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for a dollar and I've seen a lot worse for much more !! <br /> <br /> This is a Scottish sci-fi movie from Mark Stirton and according to the production of (hysterical by the way) cost production only $ 8,000. Eight grand !!! It wouldn't pay half a minute in Hollywood !! Nonetheless ---- This is the best fun movie production. If you like things gritty then you are in for a treat. These are some rough characters with coarse voices and hard swearing. I didn't mind but my friend did it !! The actors do a good job and it is interesting to see people I have never heard of or seen before. That meant I didn't know who was going to die first. <br /> <br /> If you see a movie for it's 'latest of the latest' visual effects, watch a Star Wars. The effects here are OK, but a little weak in the room. But the monsters are very well done if it looks like something. <br /> <br /> Stirton does a great job with not much, and I'd love to see his take a real Hollywood movie. At least it was not predictable and I almost fell off my chair when a guy got his head blown !!! OK, so it's a bit derived from other sci-fi, but for this budget it's a great experiment and anyone who seems to make a sci-fi movie for 8 g is light or very clear at nothing about the film industry. <br /> <br /> Good marks for a good movie, extra characters to work so hard, extra extra characters for a really interesting presentation of. No standard bull here, all problems with production have gone in to make it as Lost in Mancha only with a movie at the end. But why no comments? PLEASE NOTE THAT SCOTS!
