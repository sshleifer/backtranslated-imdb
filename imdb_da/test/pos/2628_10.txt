Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are amazing in this 1970's melodrama. The lush settings, the scary music and the plots make it a really interesting movie. I had seen it when it first appeared on television. Once again it was aired when I had a VCR, but I didn't have a chance to lose it. Would love it at VHS if anyone has a copy. Aside from the excitement (which is beautifully worked), I feel the story is unique, and that's pretty much true for the book, MRS. MAITLAND'S SAG by Margaret Lynn. I would say that it was one of the very overlooked best movies from the 1970s out of movies made for television. I have given the movie a number # 10 rating because it is done with so much originality. There is a true pathos and air of romance that the viewer sympathizes with the culprit.
