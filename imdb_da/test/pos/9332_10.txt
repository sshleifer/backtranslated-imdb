I'm not a big music video fan. I think music videos remove personal feelings about a particular song. Any song. In other words, creative thinking goes out of the window. Also, personal feelings aside about MJ, throw aside. This was the best music video of all time. Simply wonderful. It was a movie. Yes, people were. Brilliant! You had great plays, great choreography and great singing. This was spectacular. Simply a plot line of a beautiful young lady dating a man, but he was a man or something creepy. Vincent Price added his stuff to the song and video. MJ was MJ, probably said about it. This song was for video, which jaguars are for cars. Top of the line, PERFECTO. What was even better about this was that we got the real MJ without the thousands of facelifts. Although ironically, there were more than enough makeup and costumes to go around. People go to Youtube. Take 14 min. Out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art this particular video really is.
