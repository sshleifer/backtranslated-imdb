This should be one of my 3 favorite episodes from the original TV series. <br /> <br /> What is doing well is the battle between the wires between Romulan Commander and Kirk, as well as the top act of Mark Lenard, who later played Spock's father in other television episodes and films. This is a case where they climbed to the level of talent around them, and Shatner, Nimoy and the entire cast deliver an outstanding performance in this episode. Scripture and plot are also excellent, and I love the direct approach used to show us the characters and feelings and thoughts of these characters, and how freely they are expressed by the actors. <br /> <br /> This very entertaining episode reaches 10 out of 10. AWESOME !! Desert Buddha
