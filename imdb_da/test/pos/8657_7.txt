The Bothersome Man is a smart, surrealistic movie that makes you rethink what you do with your life and what makes you cross. When you see these people in zombie as trances do everyday events and realize it's what we do and what we want in real life, it really hits the home. This is a surprisingly effective movie that ultimately gives you questions about your direction and not so much the movie. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the protagonist whose life we ​​get a 3rd person perspective as he tries to adapt to a new life after being moved. In the beginning, he seems to be the most popular guy in town, as everyone at work turns to him, and he is invited to dinners etc. A good example of this is on the stage with his new boss offering him an envelope of an unspecified amount of cash saying "Here's a little something to get started". Andreas even gets a girlfriend 20 minutes into the movie, which he eventually enters. This seems like an ideal living situation as his girlfriend is an established interior designer, attractive, and never nagging about anything he does. But Andreas is unfulfilled with their relationship as with everything else in this world. He then begins an affair with a colleague named Ingeborg, whom he eventually leaves Anne for and claims he is in love with. After telling Ingeborg how he feels, she tells him that she also sees other colleagues and says that all relationships are "nice". Shortly after we see Andreas at a train station where he tries to end his misery, and for the audience's disappointment there is no question. Andreas meets Hugo, who has found a hole that music can be heard, get out of. So they go on mission to get to the other side, will it be better or will it get worse? <br /> <br /> "The Bothersome Man" shows us the occupation of society with appearances and its materialistic thinking. It does a good job making us fun by filling up with IKEA products, as the characters use each lunch to pick out. I think he is basically throwing fun at the boring Scandinavian community and its high suicide rates. For example, there is a scene in the movie where Andreas comes across a man who jumped out of a building and onto a spiked fence. Andreas, who is preoccupied with this world, also cuts off his finger and later jumps in front of a train; This is one of the most weird / outrageous scenes I've seen. This world created by Lien is similar to the purgatory where there is no punishment or reward. In this world you drink after drink, Andreas never became drunk, sex was incomplete, and no matter how many times he tried to not kill himself. This movie reminded me of "Fight Club" and how both protagonists were kind of out of sync with the world around them. In "Fight Club" Tyler Durden creates another persona who does everything he didn't want, and in this movie, the awakening Andreas is equivalent to Tyler Durden. After a while, he wakes up and tries to escape the bland life he is now apart by fleeing through a hole in a wall. <br /> <br /> Lien does a good job of continuity in this movie, which means that when a character has half a full cup in his hand and they cut away, come back, they have the glass in the same hand and it is not full or not even showing that the shot was made another day. Today, the directors are more concerned about the sound effects and overlook the little things that are the sign that bears the bracelet on the same hand as in the farm's movie? When I took television production for three years in high school, it is hard for me not to look for continuity or voice overs that drive me nuts. Lien does the little things well, he has great lighting in every shot, never leaves you wondering why something is in a shot and gives an interesting topic. This movie really worked for me because it not only makes the Scandinavians, but Western society and what is wrong with it. The only real question I had was with the man who commits suicide by jumping on a spiked fence. Because you finally find out that this world has no death, but he was motionless to assume that he was dead, and that is never the answer in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the only protagonist that others come and go and never do more than support him. His first boyfriend Anne Britt is an interior designer who, on the surface, seems perfect to him, but eventually turns out to be boring. This leads him to Ingeborg, who he starts an affair with and falls in love with. He quickly finds out that she was with a handful of other men and that what he felt was not right. Andreas finally meets Hugo in the bathroom at a bar that complains about how nothing tastes good anymore and how he can't even get drunk again. He follows Hugo home to find the hole in the wall with what is filled with children's laughter and bird cherry. <br /> <br /> Lien doesn't have much on resumption, but "The Bothersome Man" is more than a leap to a good career, but an example of a future director. If this is an indication of his talent and potential as a storyteller, Lien has a bright future and we can only hope that his future films will not take so long to make it overseas for our viewing experience. So take a seat and enjoy the trip as director Jens Lien takes you from your home to the dreamy world, "The Bothersome Man".
