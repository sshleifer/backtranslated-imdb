Random Hearts struck me up. Criticized for the inconvenience of a) the premise and b) the mating of an IA policeman and a congresswoman, as well as for its slowness, the film felt fine and even ended up being surprisingly absorbent. I found my interest engaged as the film cut back and forth between Ford's and Thomas's life as they first found out, and acted in very different ways in very different environments with their spouse's death and the subsequent revelation that they were involved in other people . It could happen; two people's philandering spouses could be in the same plane, the plane could crash, the survivors could be brought together by the recess. So what if it is unlikely? Inappropriate is not the same as removed. So ... what if that happened? Why not speculate? <br /> <br /> The performances of Ford and Thomas are credible and nuanced. Instead of finding their clutch impossible (opposite sides of the tracks - give me a break) I felt it driven by grief and fraud, neither party knew how to deal. The script does not bring them together too quickly or too easily, nor does the end of the movie solve their relationship conventionally. Where I find it unsatisfactory is when the dialogue gives interesting wrinkles or insights into the situation, personally and professionally, but never seems to pursue any of them very far. And if you fail to think too hard, Harrison Ford seems to be about 10 years old for that. For five and a half bucks at Wal-Mart, with full length director comments and behind-the-scenes featurette, the DVD is worth owning. I don't think I would pay $ 20 for it on bets, but my wife could. OK, ti ...
