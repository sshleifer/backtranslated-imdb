Great film that follows Bill & Tom's fairytale, two high school companions at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live life straight while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) doesn't take anything seriously except to party all the time. When Bill moves out of his mother's house to live alone, he faces many problems, from his boyfriend to his brother, to his landlord. Meanwhile, his friend Tom moves in to keep the rent down, but continues to turn Bill's life upside down. This movie is non-stop comedy from start to finish and is a personal favorite of mine. Soundtrack features guitar virtioso Edward Van Halen throughout the film, and also features cameos by rockers Lee Ving and Ron Wood. 70s Pornstar legend Kitten Navidad also makes a look! Classic 80s movies are worth more looks. Now, everything that needs to be done is an expected DVD release! If you've seen this movie, take a look at "The Last American Virgin", similar to "Wild Life". I rate both highly.
