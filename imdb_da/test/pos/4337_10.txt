Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Awful play! Implausible scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, malicious for evil reasons! The last 30 minutes of this movie may just be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hard-working citizens string chains across the street, beat down the evil cyclists and then shoot them, only to be joined by neighborhood kids (!!!) in party. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the diet? She sweeps out into the foam! And if that's not enough, let's not forget how fast the punches give up after Fraker's killed. I just laugh thinking about it. <br /> <br /> I also love the death film at Kersey's boyfriend. He * goes away * after seeing her blow up. It's small things like this that make Death Wish 3 such a bad movie. And I don't even mention the bizarre soundtrack. I watched this movie because of Martin Balsam, who I seriously think is one of the finest actors ever (and whoever "gets beaten by the scum" scene is fun) and I went away with a new favorite movie. Thanks, Death Wish 3 for making me laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> Some other things I forgot to mention: 1. The weird sound effect after Kersey says "Cash!" when he buys his used car. Ha! It is so bad to sound. 2. MANDY Fraker. Mandy! Did the authors abandon hard-fire names? 3. The fact that the gangs apparently have a "loan and rental opportunity" exchange program: "I need some more guys." And that Mandy has a working phone line in an abandoned building. 4. At the end of the movie, after Kersey blows Fraker: is it just me, or does it seem that street bands are breaking into choreography when they give up? Just see how in synchronization they are after the woman's punk gives the "stop" signal. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Nothing screams me like Death Wish 3!
