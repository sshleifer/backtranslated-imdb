Who can't remember The Muppet Movie ??? <br /> <br /> Kermit the Frog is now an American culture icon. Which child does not appeal to this character? <br /> <br /> As the first actual Muppet movie, the movie simply called The Muppet Movie did it really well. Kermit takes a Hollywood agent's advice and goes out of his home forest to respond to the ad. Along the way he meets up with a pig, a bear, a rock band and a couple of other quality dolls. Watch for dozens of cameo appearances like Madaline Kahn, Steve Martian, Richard Pryor, Mel Brooks and more. I grew up watching this movie and I loved it.
