The film starts almost painfully slowly, a "romance" (gab) that seems to get out of the course (whole part of the plan ...) Then about. one hour in this solemn movie The Feast. It is worth paying attention to the first hour. The party is still solemn, but humorous. Suddenly, the recalled and slightly petty characters come to life, and everyone (you and the characters) leave the feeling enriched by the experience. Women will love this. Christians of all kinds will enjoy the deep faith shown by the signs. Not my favorite movie all the time - no dinosaurs OR laser beams after all - but definitely a movie I'm happy to have seen. Don't miss out. <br /> <br /> Jim
