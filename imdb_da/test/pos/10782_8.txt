Oliver Stone, who is always ready to make movies with movies, does another here. "Talk Radio" is loosely based on Alan Berg's career, a radio talk show hosted in Denver, murdered by white supremacists. In this case, the character Barry Champlain (Eric Bogosian), a prominent talk show hosted in Dallas, loves nothing more than calling the callers. Like most of the people being called in, a bunch of headhead racists. And things can be heated more than anyone realizes. <br /> <br /> The performance of Bogosia brings a slightly comical tone to an otherwise serious movie. I really liked the scene where he jabs on a redneck calling. Granted, I wouldn't call this Oliver Stone's biggest movie ever, but it's a good reference at a time when the media is becoming increasingly concentrated. Good performances by Ellen Greene and Alec Baldwin also help.
