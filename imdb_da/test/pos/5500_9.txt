'In Fire of Fire' is one of the Hollywood movies that shows up on TV, but even though I've seen it a couple of times, I usually stop sitting through it all over again. Why? - It is well! Clint Eastwood is amazing as usual, and the character he plays is interesting and more generous than usual. The sign, Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan, is haunted by the fact that he was on the detail who failed to protect President Kennedy in Dallas, and now he is forced to match wits with a professional assassin who obviously declares that he will kill the president . However, the film does not make him a depressed, embarrassing and obsessed character. He is charming and personable and is realistic as a guy who has experienced a lot in life and is comfortable in his own skin. He is even quite convincing when he flirts with the more beautiful younger agent played by Rene Russo. The killer John Malkovich plays at his best is cerebral, conscious and enjoys playing senior games of life and death. He even goes with the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth. <br /> <br /> The movie is consistently entertaining and it delivers all goods - excitement, action, romance and drama - all in their right amount. It's a fun movie that is really helped by the great actors in it!
