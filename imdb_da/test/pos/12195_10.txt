Although this film does not have the darkness of the books, it is, in my opinion, a good movie. It's great campy fun with the beautiful Stuart Townsend like Lestat. He may not have the blonde hair and the blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, but to be fair, he would not look good with blond hair, and Lestat definitely looks good. He moves like a predator, I always imagined that Lestat would have. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are pretty good and the soundtrack is amazing. It's not Interview with the Vampire, so don't try to compare the two. Interview is Louis' story. This is a cut and paste version of Lestats. In any case, I highly recommend.
