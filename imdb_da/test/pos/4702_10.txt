Oh so beautiful, oh so tearful and so gutsy. <br /> <br /> Make everything seem so shallow, so pale, so pointless in comparison. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen is not a true saint. <br /> <br /> She is a real man - deficient, raw and dull, but passionate and with a heart of gold. What I found most interesting is that this handful of miserable, miserable people found meaning and laughter. <br /> <br /> What I loved most is how the documentary depicted the polarity of human nature.
