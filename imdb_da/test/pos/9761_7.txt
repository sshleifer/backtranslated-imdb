If you love the book, then I stop watching the video after Jean and Joe meet in Australia. Until then, it is a fairly faithful reproduction of the book, and the visual arts are great. 10 out of 10 to the point and I have had it many times. Then the story is seriously redesigned and revised in ways that truly destroy the book's body, that is, how Jean creates a city like Alice (Springs). In the early part, the big change is to make Strachan a 40-something bachelor instead of a twenty-seven widower. This rather distorts this love story, especially when there are also small changes that help make him more selfish and eerie, such as: in the book he suggests that Joe on the ship might find more than a letter waiting for him in Australia, but in the video he gives Joe no idea about Jean's whereabouts or intentions. The last hour of 5-hour video scrunches and lacks the last third of the book. I see no reason why they were throwing a fight between Joe and Jean - it is completely out of character and seems to be just an Aussie dig at Pommies to tell them what to do. Then they bring to Strachan for the wedding (instead of some three years later) - and get him to read the dish !! - Very strange, especially in relation to the relationship between Jean and Noel who threw in the video. The whole wedding scene is the invention of the actors. These abominations take time in the last hour, which wasn't long enough to make right the fascinating story of how Jean recreates Willstown as a place where she and Joe can both be happy.
