Aaron Sorking raises the same questions that Shakespeare did or did. How could they possibly know so much about the inner inner workings of the palace. Here, as in The West Wing, Sorkin opens surprising doors that are hardly a shock, but do not seem to confirm our worst fears. Everything is so relaxed and at the same time so directly responsible for so many people's lives. A puffy Tom Hanks tells us somehow that things can be manipulated with semi-clean intentions, but without weighing the consequences, and Julia Roberts in a blonde southern hairdresser reminds us of the powers that lie in the sidelines. The subject is serious, but the treatment is easy, intelligent but easy. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the invisible intermediary, steals every scene he is in, just as Charles Laughton did in every movie he was in. The dialogue is quick but not fast enough for us not to come in and discover that this is not a ordinary comedy. The seemingly informal pace filled with the hustle and bustle of violence and provocation gives another honorary mark in the Mike Nichols collection.
