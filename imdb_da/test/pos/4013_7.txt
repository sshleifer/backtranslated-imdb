Oh I remember seeing this show at 4:00 am in my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember seeing it when I was doing my homework. <br /> <br /> But the show got my attention as Alex showed his special powers and treated the typical junior high problems. <Br /> <br /> But the show was not just about adventure and special forces; It was more of an educational effort for a younger audience to become more interested in school and biology overall. <br /> <br /> The leading actress (can't remember his name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) provided a great performance. She made the show wise. <br /> <br /> They just make performances like this one ...
