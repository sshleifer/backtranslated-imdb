Beautifully-recorded, acclaimed director Hugh Hudson (Chariots of Fire) creates a story that brings the whole legend of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke and Tarzan to life by the monkeys with reverence and dignity and with a scale not so far seen in Tarzan movies . Christopher Lambert starred as the young Lord, raised in the nature of a female gorilla, after his parents die in Africa. Later returned to what is for him a world of the world, the one of class and privilege, he feels completely out of place. When he learns what has happened to the monkeys who raised him and their world, he realizes he must go back. A sad but triumphant story told against a backdrop of amazing prospects. This is one of the movies that is a must for every Cinemaphile collection.
