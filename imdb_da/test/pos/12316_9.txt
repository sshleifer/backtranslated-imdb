For his last film, John Huston directed his daughter, Anjelica, in this adaptation of the story of James Joyce's "Dubliners" and he gave us one of his best results to remember him. <br /> <br /> Joyce is about as impossible to film as anyone, but "the dead" present at least one traditional story to work with. Very (almost all) important information in the story lies in the space between the lines, in the character's thoughts and expressions - there are great moments, but they are cerebral - they are not the things that movies are made But somehow Huston gets it right, and he manages an almost flawless adjustment. <br /> <br /> Anjelica is magnificent and the movie is scary and powerful. <br /> <br /> Degree: A
