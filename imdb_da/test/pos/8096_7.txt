A good but not great movie, "The Great Dictator" is Chaplin's first talkie. It's a good bet, and sometimes a remarkable satire on Hitler, but unfortunately, the moments of Chaplin brilliance offered here have failed by a tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue. Yes, Chaplin, the silent screen saver, uses just too many words in this movie, and his tendency to write long talks and foreign passages in dialogue would transfer to his other talkie movie, which (better) "Limelight". Still, Chaplin was extremely daring to make this movie herself, and his two-roles performance is certainly memorable. Paulette Goddard does not have the glow she did in the "Modern Times" (her off-screen affair with Chaplin was cooling at that time), but she is always worth seeing, and Jack Oakie instead steals the show as a rival dictator to Chaplins famous creation Hynkel.
