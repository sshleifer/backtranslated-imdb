I've watched this movie twice now on cable. The first time I saw it, it caught me with surprise. The skaters, I saw, were the guys we followed on the pages of the Skateboarder magazine back in the late 70s. It was these guys we copied and tried to stay on ice skating. I'm glad a movie was finally made that gives an accurate account of how it all came to be. I'm almost 40 years old now and I'm guessing a pretty tight guy with all the problems of life; This movie did a good job of taking me back. Back to the available pools, the backyard halfpipes and road trips to Cherry Hill NJ. I suppose to really understand this movie and appreciate it, you had to live it. Otherwise, it probably won't affect you as it did me. But for those of you (and you know who you are), who lived it, you know exactly what I'm talking about! In any case, I don't care who you are, if you get the chance to watch this movie ... do it! I thank the Z-Boys of Dogtown for the memories of my youth and thank you to Stacy for making this movie! JOB WELL DONE!
