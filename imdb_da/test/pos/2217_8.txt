"Half Empty" is a hilarious musical about the eternal optimist. In this case, a self-help book writer who goes to Germany mistakenly thinks he's popular there. Instead of a spectator, he finds himself in a world of spoiled misanthrope, including the woman who was to be his publicist. His attempt to make friends in scenes that are largely improvised leads to a good encounter after another when mistreated mistreated by nihilistic musicians, gruff gangsters, etc. In time he manages to win over his publicist ?? both her heart and her mind - but his own world view is shaken when his hero, a much more popular self-help writer, turns out to be not quite what he thinks. The action is characterized by several music tracks. <br /> <br /> We saw this at the DeadCenter movie festival in Oklahoma City and were blown away. This is a really fun, inspired little indie production. You can stifle a few technical things (like the lighting, which is a little dark), but the play is fun and inspired enough that you can't worry too much. If Voltaire wrote "Candide" today, the sign would be a self-help writer.
