Another popular screening for a British image at Coalville's Century Theater. A well-designed, solid drama with an ever-growing plot and continuous "twists in the story" ... as the lies piled up! A master class of appearances of a flawless cast, well marshaled by first-time director Julian Fellowes. Excellent performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson, but good moves by all concerned, including support actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was keen on this movie, which includes a couple of shocks that really make you 'jump'. A good tight production in about 80 minutes, probably produced on a very limited budget, but a success that should see that Fellowes is looking again for the big screen. Some commercials for the film seemed to suggest that it was set in the 50's (as Nigel Balkin's novel), but of course that is not the case. Recommended view.
