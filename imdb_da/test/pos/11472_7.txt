You can't watch this movie for a history lesson. This was the first thing I had ever heard of the Ma Barker saga, but I could almost tell that facts were far away. And with a little internet research I realized that of course I was right. Ma Barker certainly as hell is not the sexy, calculating woman that the film portrays her as and apparently did not orchestrate all the bank robbers, kiddnapps and murders that her criminal boys performed. <br /> <br /> But don't expect a brilliant criminal drama. The writing and the play are adequate, the shooters are exaggerated and mostly unrealistic, and there is a very ridiculous slow motion scene. So why did I give it 7 out of 10? <br /> <br /> Because it was amazingly entertaining. War games are fun to watch, but there are some deeper themes that arise between them. The film has a strong sense of ego intimidation among the cast alpha men, each having their own agenda. And I appreciate the minimal use of swords for the period. The set pieces are great, reproducing a convincing 1930's era. So watch this movie as if you wanted a cult movie and take the exaggerated softness and recklessness in violation of the cheesy ultra-serious comments of the FBI man who wants to bring down the bark at all costs. Inotherwords, don't take it too seriously, just have fun with it. And if you like this, you will love serial killer.
