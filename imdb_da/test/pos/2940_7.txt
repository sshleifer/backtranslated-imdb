This show is my guilty pleasure all the way !! When I first voted in America's next top model, I expected to get bored and find it very stupid. I did not do it. This show is actually really fun. I read about one of the other reviews that makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's next top model. And it does! Who doesn't love the glamor and excitement that comes with being a model? At ANTM you will see what it really is. And who doesn't love to hear the girls bitch about each other and get into battles? Or do you like to throw something on the Janice lady? <br /> <br /> Give it a try. Don't expect anything intelligent or a show you can look for in a life lesson. Just enjoy it for what it is. Seriously fun!
