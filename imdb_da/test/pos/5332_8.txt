Simply lovely claymation feature from Nick Park and company spoofing such movie-greats as "King Kong" and "The Wolf Man" have Wallace and Gromit as rabbit security finding it hard to solve a big problem in their village. A giant rabbit celebrates lavishly on the citizens' vegetable crops! What makes this even worse is that the big vegetable festival is about to begin, and the citizens have all made a commitment to win the top of the prize. What makes the situation even worse is the Wallace grounds for the entire vegetable-demanding rampage. He tested a new invention to take his brainwaves in an attempt to wash the captured rabbits in divergent vegetable crops. What happens is catastrophic, as a kind of hybrid was rabbit created in the process .. and it has more to do with Wallace than he could ever imagine. It will be up to his loyal and profound intelligent dog and Gromit who stuck to the day. <br /> <br /> This is a clever and imaginative effort by the crew behind other Oscar-winning claymation features starring Wallace and Gromit. Seeing good ole-fashioned claymation is refreshing considering the CGI boom that has presented rather flawed fare here recently as the industry spits out more and more mediocre product. Here we get a complete function with witty humor and some wild stunts that offer great animation, not to mention gut-busting sight gags.
