William H. Macy is amazing in this Alfred Hitchcock-esque movie. Macy stars as a film critic who accidentally kills one of his girlfriends. The characters that follow are fun. James Cromwell gives a great performance as a harassed private detective. As always, Macy is incredibly fun and provides a phenomenal performance. Watch this movie when it is on t.v. and check out your video stores because this is one you will not miss.
