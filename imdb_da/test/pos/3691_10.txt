What a shame this movie was never released. (It now plays on cable.) Based on my high consideration of the stars, I was tuned in to see a movie much better than the ones I paid to watch theaters recently. I like to be surprised. As often, films are marketed as "offbeat", but are actually more of the same old recycled drivel. This movie is really different, with the bonus of a heartbreaking message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel. Though he is committed to the plot to sing some of the most mawkishly sentimental songs ever written, he makes them so good that you have nothing against it. Cathy Bates and Rupert Everett are well-molded and amazing, but a newcomer to Cathy Kate's sister-in-law steals every scene she's in. Give this movie a try.
