The film contains another unusual collaboration between director William Wyler and film photographer Gregg Toland, the first after Toland worked at Citizen Kane. But the talent of both of these men was focused on achieving a perfectly crafted film, understood in the good old American sense as a great story. The technical aspects of the film are covered so that the viewer is absorbed in the action that takes place on the screen without submitting to the power of the image. The technique is seen as a vehicle for representation as opposed to Citizen Kane, where Welles' baroque style almost drew attention from history to the way the story was told. One of my favorite moves with deep focus in this movie is the drama forwarded by Homer and Al's returning home. If Homer's girl, Wilma comes in perfect focus, Al goes to his wife in perfect focus. This is an excellent feature because it only shows by using the image the nature of these relationships that we will see them throughout the movie: Wilma loves Homer and she accepts him as he is. As a wife, he also loves him, but she feels unprepared for her to welcome him home. Also later in the film we find that their marriage has not always been a bed of roses. <br /> <br /> Wyler is an instructor whose strength lies in being faithful to his work without having to boast. He wanted to show his audience how difficult it was for the American soldiers returning from the war to fit into a society that either did not understand them or treated them with contempt. With a perfect cast and great dialogue, Goldwin and Wyler produced a film that will forever be the template for any other home game. The three hours that coincide with the "rough cut" because the test group once again felt for a moment that the action was slow and that all scenes from the movie seem justified. All things are beautifully constructed, every character gets a lot of exposure, nothing is left to chance, and it is very pitiful that Hollywood today never manages to bring as much sign conflict on the screen. TBYOOL explores the depth of the American lifestyle, the American family, and the community to such an extent that other films look like "children's time".
