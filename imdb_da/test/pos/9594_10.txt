I have it on VHS, but it is not a big copy that I have seen it 2 or 3 times a year since 1999. I am also afraid that 'her indoors' will throw it into the annual VHS cleansing. <br /> <br /> My brother and I (late 30 'still laugh at wearing in this amazing show.Tim Healy's Lucky Cup Hat and telling the apprentice you can't do any of it (shooting, passing, etc.) and he turns out to be Peter Beardsley.As a Leeds fan I have to laugh at the empty dossier at Bostock before the cup final (or did it say S ** t?) The reason I came in line today was that my Bro wants it for Christmas so ITV lets you take it out on DVD Come on The UnderFelt Men !!
