One cannot help but be impressed with the intelligence and scope of this movie, and at the same time disappointed with the lost opportunities. I found the script to be excellent and Edmund Purdom's vocal talent is quite impressive. But as an artifact of his time, the film suffers from too many Hollywood isms, especially bad casting, too much lushness of the sets and too much pretentiousness. Edmund Purdom (who plays the title character) is then naturally awkward with physical plays, I suppose he had primarily been in the Shakespeare theater before this. So, if filmmakers read this, I suggest this as an excellent candidate for a remake, especially if you are throwing genuine Egyptians as Egyptians!
