What I got was something better. <br /> <br /> Like many movies I've commented on recently, I was looking forward to this for a while. Especially after I saw one of Toshiaki Toyoda's other films, "Blue Spring", which is easy in my top 20 favorite movies. I loved the "9 Souls" trailer and I thought it sounded very good. I didn't hear anything bad about it. Now I know why. <br /> <br /> This movie starts out as a comedy, so during the last half of the movie it quickly becomes something else. It becomes more dramatic as each of the characters faces their own tragedies. Each character gets just enough screen time and you are worried about what happens to each of them. Though there are 9 characters, we need to learn and worry, within two hours, Toshiaki Toyoda pulls it out great. <br /> <br /> After I saw "Blue Spring" I hoped the soundtrack would be at least as good as it was in that movie. I got my wish because the "9 Souls" soundtrack was also incredible. The music used in each scene, more specifically the more dramatic, is simply wonderful. I loved every second of it. <br /> <br /> I wasn't sure if I wanted to see another Toshiaki Toyoda movie, "Pornostar", but after I saw this, I would. Definitely. Also because I read the plot for it, and I think it sounds really good. I look forward to it. On the R1 DVD "9 Souls" there are two interviews with Toyoda. He says he has completed another movie and he will start writing the manuscript to his next. I can't wait for both. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. You have to see it. Now.
