I watched this movie when it was released to theaters. It is definitely one to remember I had forgotten the title until recently. A friend found it through online search. <br /> <br /> A dark night is pretty unusual for the voltage genre of time as it does not contain any blood. It is by teenage scare the variety but teenagers are respectable in their own ways. It's a beautiful old-fashioned movie with props and scenes that reflect the times. Our hero rides a motorcycle without a brain hole. For example, as mentioned earlier, One Dark Night is currently available on DVD. The original negative was not available for the DVD transition. Some wheel changes are a bit rough, but it doesn't take away from the story. That said, the colors are alive and the lighting is very good. Adam West plays a rather small role in this movie as RayMar's son-in-law. Fortunately, his role as an indulgent and indifferent man is short. <br /> <br /> The story builds during the movie. Unlike many ancient horror films, One Dark Night is a great thrill story that gives the viewer time to absorb what's happening. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes or so of One Dark Night is what makes it so memorable. RayMar's telekinetic abilities are used to open old graves in the mausoleum, pull out the coffins, open them and move the bodies around. Attention was given to great details in the final scenes. The rotting, worm-lined corpse looks right.
