Yes, non-Singaporean, can't see what's big deal about this movie. Some of the references in this movie fly just over the head of foreign viewers and mostly Singaporean are those who would actually "get" it. But I talk to you, alien, look at the other crap that has been combed out of Singapore and compare it to this movie. It's like comparing a mule's diarrhea pile to a small diamond. This movie is the first to really show some singapore's seedy underbelly - something the forces that are, pretend does not exist. And there is a role in the movie where a gangster (ah-beng in our unique colloquial 'ingris') curses in 4 languages, namely Tamil English Malay and Hokkien. Well the truth is most of us can and do it all the time. The sad thing is that viewers from foreign accounts get an easier time getting their oily little claws on this pearl, in the country of origin, it first became the banner and only R-rating, and that too with approx. 20 cuts to it. It is great to know that one of the best, creative, edgy and original films ever created would be easier for you to achieve undisturbed, uncensored; halfway across the world than in your own nation.
