In 1937, Darryl Zanuck, who recently moved from the Warner Brothers production manager, tried to get his newly-created company, 20th Century Fox off the ground and on an equal footing with Warner's old bosses and MGM's glittering palace. "This is my affair" was an attempt to catch up with the current success of historic films around the turn of the century ("San Francisco" "In Old Chicago") and in succession, it managed quite successfully. The reason is fascinating. A troopmaker, but heroic maritime officer (Robert Taylor) is given a secret mission by President McKinley to uncover a ring of bank robbers who cripple US finances. He finds the gang, but falls in love with their female mascot (Barbara Stanwyck) and has to choose between love and duty. Not everything about this vintage film works well, but in general it is a good piece of studio film production. The plot gimmick would be borrowed by Kurt Vonnegut for "Mother Night" (the lead role of this movie from the book was played brilliantly by Nick Nolte) and seems completely credible, at least within the confidential belief of the studio. As a fan of old movies, I am always thrilled when I stumble over one that I have never seen, and "This is my affair" was no exception.
