Being a bit of a waste of waste, I've stumbled upon this little treasure. Action, romance, crooked police, violence. Its all here and not one has been pulled off right. I was in love immediately. Then a funny thing happened the second time. I became addicted. I thought it should be a rental and chuckle kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie. He didn't have the money to make it look good, but he did it anyway. It is very commendable. It also shows that he made the movie to himself. I don't know how many of you have heard Rudy Ray's music, but if you don't have him, he has a whole bunch of albums coming into the fifties.
