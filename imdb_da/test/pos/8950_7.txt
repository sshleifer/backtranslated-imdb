Once again I see this kind of movie more and more into English humor, not too often seen on the screen since Monty Python's days and Man About the House. Too bad. <br /> <br /> Brenda Blethyn (Who I first saw in Saving Grace early in the year, another must see by the way.) Excellent as Alfred Molina does. The rest of the cast, while almost unknown to me, also turns on great performances. The movie starts slowly and gradually goes into pace and entertainment - in the middle of time I had tears in my eyes from laughing. All in all, a fun English movie, a thousand times better than the supposedly 'funny' garbage coming from Hollywood. <br /> <br />
