This movie is great with some of the best songs preformed by Bon Jovi and kiss. The film is about a man named Chris (Mark Wahlberg) Who is the biggest fan of a band called Steel Dragon. And then when he gets the recording to lead singer his world changes upside down. With great plays by Jennifer Aniston, this movie is a must see for rock lovers !! <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
