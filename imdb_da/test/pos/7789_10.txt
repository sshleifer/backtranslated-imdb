I love this movie. Shehzad Khan's depiction as Bhalla et al. "Shut up, Robert!" was so funny. When he was hit during a battle scene, you could hear him scare. Viju Khote is the dumbfounded Robert a.k.a. "Rabbit". I love Shakti Kapoor a.k.a. "Crime Master Gogo". Paresh Rawal's dual role is so awesomely fun for his depiction as Ramgopal Bajaj & Shyamgopal Bajaj. Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor are out of this world. My brother makes a really good imitation of Bhalla. "Relax. PLEASE relax." I love the scene where Aamir Khan puts a laxative in Salman's "Muscles" Khan's food that caused the irregular bowel movements to force him to use the toilet umpteen many times.
