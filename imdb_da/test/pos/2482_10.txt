It kicks you in the stomach. There are other films with more convincing characters, a more realistic story, and perhaps even more in depth about political invocations. But then again, most of these are not directed by Peter Watkins. Perhaps the only true genius artist in the British film that comes out of the 1960s, Watkins made a bunch of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the aesthetic world - the world of political ongoings, social problems, and state solutions . Thus, his work is probably less "cinematic" than say political, as some may call a weakening of their inherent artistic quality. So again, why should art not afford to be engaged? Watkins dare. And succeed. You will not feel good about this. You will not feel happy. In fact, you don't really like the movie; it is uncompromising, honest, direct, untouched; a glimpse of your face, in short. You can't help getting angry, you can't resist letting the things you see touch you. That makes Watkins' movies so rewarding.
