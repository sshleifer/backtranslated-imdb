I'm not going to go in too much, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There were no fun scenes (which I can remember), but it had moments. The game is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual, and Eddie Murphy pulls a pretty fun performance. Clean Russo was just fine in the movie, no complaints there. There were two signs in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first was Trey Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) friend at the gym played by Ken Campbell. I assumed he was just a friend of Trey, but I wanted to know more about him. The other character I liked was Mitch Preston's (Robert De Niro) fellow / partner played by Nestor Serrano. I think he was just another policeman who worked with Mitch Preston, but I wanted to know if he was his partner or not. I think I think too much about a movie, I mean, it's a comedy ... who cares about the characters? I guess though. I was very pleased to see that this was led by Tom Dey, who also instructed Shanghai Noon. Ever since I saw the movie I looked forward to her next work. I think he did a good job with this movie and I am looking forward to his next work. All in all, it was a good movie, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price for a ticket unless you're a die-hard Robert De Niro / Eddie Murphy / Rene Russo fan. It was worth seeing in the theater but not for the full price, I would recommend seeing it at the matinee price. <br /> <br /> Here too, some movies are trivia for you. The guy who played the camera man, played by Juda Friedlander is the guy in the music video "Everyday" by Dave Matthews band. He was also a clerk in "Meet the Parents", who also starred Robert De Niro. And on the other hand, he also played Derek Zoolander's brother in "Zoolander" (both Zoolander and Meet the Parents star Ben Stiller). Just some useless trivia for you. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy the movie. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
