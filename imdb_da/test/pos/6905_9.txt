This movie was really a breath of fresh air from the Hollywood crap I've seen recently. The action is amazing and the characters are engaging and oddly endearing. There really isn't much to the story, it's simple and it works well. An easy movie to just sit and enjoy. The atmosphere was amazing and the sets really helped push the movie together and offered some great visuals. The film, of course, has aspects of horror, but is geared a little more towards the humorous side of things. You will not laugh highly hysterically with this one, but you smile all the way through. The mood works very well with the characters and the amazing actor doesn't hurt. I really saw this movie based on the fact that Ron Perlman was in it. His role is a little less than I expected, but it doesn't matter; The rest of the throw does more than enough to keep you engaged. If you like horror, see this. If you like comedies, see this. Just go ahead and see it anyway, it's really quite outstanding.
