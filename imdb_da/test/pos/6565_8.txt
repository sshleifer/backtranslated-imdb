Hi now, I never laid eyes on a Manga cartoon, but this movie is apparently based on one. Ah well, that's life. Still, this is a pretty bizarre, at least, movie that literally spins out of control in a small Japanese town. People are obsessed with uzumaki (spiral), and this young girl looks at his friend's father videotape a snail, and later in the movie do people begin to become snails? It seems that this boy's father is becoming so obsessed that he somehow commits suicide in a household appliance. There is some bizarre humor here that can be at home in a Tim Burton movie, but there is some nastiness & gore that only the Japanese can do with justice. But with a lot of Japanese movies, the end is the end and got something decided? Well, I didn't. There are some hints as to why it all happens, but they are not explored and there is much left to the imagination, or it was not considered important. Nevertheless, there are many things for the eye to feast on, and if you are not obsessed with everything that makes perfect sense, it is well worth seeing because it is just so original and bizarre. My favorite was the father with the spinning eyeballs, personally. 8 out of 10 stars.
