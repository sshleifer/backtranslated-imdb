By mistake, I ordered a series from the BBC, their new version of Robin Hood. Very disappointing compared to RoS. Awful costuming and backgrounds. While I enjoyed the Sheriff, who took the character from the Nick Grace character, the rest left much to be desired. As an "example", Marion's costume so suspected it came from Walmart. And Mr Guy, yes, he as little as a sign from an outer film! RoS has stolen the spotlight, probably forever, in the story of this story. Cast, costuming, story lines, scenery, movies and soundtracks of Clannad are all fantastic, as is evident from all the ongoing feedback about 26 years on. RoS is a timeless classic. My thanks to everyone who made the series.
