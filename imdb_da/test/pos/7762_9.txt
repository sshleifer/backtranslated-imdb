Okay, let me start by saying that I as a whole do not like anime much. I have enjoyed a few of the often cited "classic" series, but consider the medium as a whole in exactly the same way as I do American television: namely, a good 90-95% of it is complete tripe with the rest falling everywhere from "watchable" to "decent". This is the case, it is no wonder I do not like the self-defeating anime parrots out there. I don't get most of the jokes, and the medium itself enforces a particular humorous style that doesn't appeal to me at all - loud, hyperactive, lowbrow and all over the top. <br /> <br /> So when I started to see this series on behalf of a friend, I was disappointed after the first few episodes. I figured that the characters should represent clich√© characters from the shopworn story outlines, and that their actions should be satirical. I could see where it came from, but didn't think it was so wise - lots of "crazy, fun-filled high school shenanigans and goings-on, just now we are ironic about it." In about the third episode, my opinion drastically. <br /> <br /> It was at that time that the force of this series began to manifest. The quality of the non-chronological episode order, its snarky sense of self-consciousness and above all, smart humor with (gasp) a well-executed straight man. In what I consider to be a rarity in any medium, this show presents well-thought-out, witty interactions between diametrically opposed characters. The main character Kyon's eternal sense of vaguely annoyed retreat gives the perfect foil to the actions of acts, character Haruhi's generic "anime-like" exploits. It's a break from formula, and it works incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Based on the strong foundation, the series succeeds further with a phenomenal level of detail. As mentioned earlier, the episodes are broadcast chronologically. I considered this to be a gimmick at first, but it seems surprisingly good. The chronological order of events is logically logical, but the sequence of the episode follows closer to the traditional structure of the Aristotelian drama. The chosen order leaves no narrative gaps that cannot be filled with simple introductions (but while it is possible to guess what happened in an unaired "previous" episode, one still feels compelled to see exactly how these events unfold) and amazingly Planning prevents any plot gaps or contradictions. I saw this series another time immediately after the completion of the first time, and I was amazed at how well even seemingly inconsistent events were tied together. The last point is evidence of the extreme attention to detail in all areas of the series. While the drawing "anime" is a little bit, background art is exquisite, realistically rendered based on actual photographic references. Animation quality is also excellent at important points. For example, there is a musical performance late in the series where the characters are shown to actually play a song - this may sound trivial, but the subconscious effect of watching movie quality animation that actually corresponds to the soundtrack is incredible. br /> In short, I love this series for some reason. By its very nature, this is something I generally do not like, but its performance is so unique and well-executed that I cannot help it.
