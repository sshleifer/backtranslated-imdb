A good look at the 60s through the eyes of four friends from their study day in 1960 to their reunion 10 years later - a Yugoslav immigrant who is in love with the American dream and struggles to cope with the often violent reality; an early bald undertaker son; a soldier; and the crazy hippy girl they all love. Good direction and a strong throw make right for Steve Tesich's brilliant script; The dialogue is not as narrow as in "Breaking Away", but the themes of upbringing and father-in-law are equally well treated, and there are still some wonderful comic moments among the shocks and drama.
