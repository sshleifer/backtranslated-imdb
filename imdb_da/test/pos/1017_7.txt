There is much to suffer from this film, despite the fact that it is humble traps of a preaching PC tale of rape and the perpetual rushing better than the victim. The film created quite a thrill in the mystery of who sent the notes. (I was sure it was the teacher. It would actually have been more likely because the idea of ​​the best friend's friend friend came out of nowhere. I suppose it's that "rape is ubiquitous. You never know who it is coming to be ".) Mrs. Beller is shining as always (yet see the KB discussion forum for my qualification of this statement). Like all sermons, the presentation lasts 15 minutes past climax, so you may want to stop watching at that time. Unless you're really curious to find out what's happening with Phillip. Blythe Danner, as a mother, is in the role she was born to play: the loving, over-protective mother. Some good 70s scenes for 70s fans. (The dark bar that the father goes to drink his pain away are all dark-colored beams, barrels, oak and cork). A must for Beller fans and highly recommended for fans of the 70s High School melodrama or 70s kitsch in general.
