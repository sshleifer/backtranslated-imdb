Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is rarely a favorite of mine, said everyone should watch this movie as it is something that can help cure the world .... It's one of the most exciting movies I've seen and delivering on Tutu's comments .... I have read many comments, and while ranging from good to average to commenting on the choice of actors ... The fact is that it is about one of the most unusual events in our world . The truth and the reconciliation commission .... for the first time, a country has chosen to fly the horrible story, find its way and create a way for people to heal ... <br /> <br /> For the movie begins with the white a policeman is offered a chance to rid himself of brutal crimes, and the black guy is trying to make sure he doesn't get away with what it dives into humanity and the enormous need for healing we all need. ... <br /> <br /> Absolutely thumbs ..... To everyone involved .... Once again, I am proud to be a South African ..... <br /> <br /> One interesting comment can be found here: http://www.biz-community.com/Article/196/97/5223.html
