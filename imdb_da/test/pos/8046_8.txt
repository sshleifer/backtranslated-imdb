The battle of Elderbrush Gulch was Griffith's longest and most expensive card he had made at that time. In it, we see him trying to perfect the big action scene that would be needed in his full length features, packing into all the elements that had made his previous action briefly successful. <br /> <br /> Griffith uses western format ?? already the ideal background for clean, straight-ahead action set pieces ?? as a setting for his first epic battle. Like many Western of the 1910s, the starting point is a sign from the eastern direction out west? a device that might help ease the audience into the desert, and here the eastern children are a few children, which was important for the type of image this is developing. For Griffith, you could not act without vulnerability, and here he slipped it in, with the east-eastern children, Lillian Gish as the confused mother of "the only baby in town" and even some puppies in danger of ending up Indians menu. All this paves the way for an exceedingly complex and layered action sequence that blends the captured heroine scenario and the run to the battles Griffith had portrayed since his earliest civil war images in 1909. There is a phenomenal amount going on here and Griffith is doing very well To maintain the exciting pace throughout and keep everything coherent and logical. But juggling x number of elements in an action sequence does not necessarily mean that it is many times more exciting, no matter how skillfully they are balanced, and Griffith created better excitement finals before and after this. <br /> <But even a Griffith image that was so focused on action would not be without its drama, characterization, and atmosphere. In the Battle of Elderbrush Gulch, the emotional lineup is briefly but economically treated. First, we have the scene where the waifs leave their homes. The cart, they travel on heads away from the camera, make use of depth and distance to express their movement away from security and civilization. An equally effective scene is the one where we are introduced to the young family of Gish, Bobby Harron and their baby. The city's people are fighting over the precious tot, so saunter off screen, revealing that two Indians saw them from the background and added a creepy little note of danger. Of course, many viewers today have pointed out the battle of Elderbrush Gulch's offensive portrayal of Indians (as opposed to the more sympathetic Red Man's View), but perhaps all is not what it seems. First and foremost, should you look at the Indian chef's son's vest? it is black and covered with shiny white dots. It looks like me as a pearly king jacket, perhaps slightly modified for the warmer climate. Now look at the "war dance" they perform later? it has a certain "knee up mother brown" air to it. It's not Indians, they're cockneys! So it should not be offensive to Native Americans. Only cockneys.
