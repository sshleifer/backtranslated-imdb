Many accuse Rod Steiger, who is over-represented, and anyone who has seen the Amityville Horror and the 'fly' section would struggle to say otherwise. That being said, he is brilliant in this. <br /> <br /> It's never on TV, you can't buy it on DVD (legitimate). In 1988, when Channel 4 still had a recipe for innovation, they showed this among a small mix of 60s films, Privilege, etc. - and I remember a significant theatrical experience, well translated into movies. The great thing about theater is attached - how do you make it accessible and interesting on the screen? PH almost pulls it out. Because this kind of movie is never on cable or Sky TV anywhere, it's hard to get a debate going, but for everyone out there who has seen it or can remember, my memories are a fair, almost hard performance by Sally Geeson 'thats all put into use "(which scares her and her siblings' almost diffuse general beliefs in many early 70s offers), she says," there are several of these - key lines you remember years, decades on. It's the power of a movie like this one. <br /> <br /> PS I've just seen it again and it's just as good. One day TV will also be provided.
