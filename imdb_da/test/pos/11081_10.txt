... David Bovie sings in this movie. BUT IT IS!!! It's all about America, so don't be ashamed to see it. Just think if you can to prevent more damage ... You know you're just the same solid guy next door, so be careful! One of the best critics of "common" mind and friendship. Still indifferent? Go for it for the music - it's worth a try, just close your eyes, and Pat Metheny and David Bowie will touch you so deeply, you start screaming! And while you look, if you dare to open your eyes, don't do popcorn and stuff you want to miss a lot. You may think it's not worth it, but think twice - and don't look at your neighbors' lawn - you never know what to find ... Is it worth it? Try it! Just don't die or gloat over it ...
