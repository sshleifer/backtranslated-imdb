This is one of the most outstanding horror movies I've ever seen in my lifetime. Forget the exorcist and all the other hype horror movies out there. John Carpenter made a turn-the-force horror epic with excellent special effects, great performances from Kurt Russell and co and a great soundtrack that will haunt you forever! The biggest thing about this movie after 17 years is that it's not dated, it looks fresh and new, and you don't get many movies like this. In 1982, it was up to E.T. and of course it failed and was a box-office bomb. Over the years, THING has made a cult of video and sales, and so many new fans. In the end, this movie kicks ass and to me that which never loses is the edge to scare you pants and to me a horror movie. Long live John Carpenter !!
