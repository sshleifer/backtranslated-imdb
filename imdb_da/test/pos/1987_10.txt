The producers of this image are Hungarians. It is not of crazy artistic momentum that X and Z are capitalized in the titles given that the word 'icicle' means 'god' in Hungarian. - By the way, David, Isten is the word for God in Hungarian ... - Hum ... Is that so? <br /> <br /> Let's consider this movie as "A History of Violence" science-fictional siblings. Both films together have the strength to blast the respective genres; thriller and drama in 2005 one and 'no FX ed as hell' science fiction in the one we are looking at right now. Everything he does has a meaning and is surrounded by details: Nikken for Phil K. Dick (who wrote "In The Days of Perky Pat") by setting up a "Perky Pat" fast food restaurant. Stanley Kubrick's nod using 2001's naming pattern; As IBM became HAL (a letter down in the alphabet) in the 1968 movie, in eXistenZ 'classic lubricant spray', the WD-40 XE-60 (a letter up) becomes when Allegra cleans up Pikul's port. The nod to David Cronenberg by using Videodrome's witty form of formula ('Death to ...' & 'Long Live' ..) and by taking another medium to a central theme of an image (Videodrome TV, video games and virtual reality in eXistenZ In 1983 you penetrated a television set. In 1999 you were steeped in a game, welcome to Canada!) Enjoyed good taste by getting Peter Suschitzky's filmography, Howard Shore's music and Ronald Sander's editing (a team winning ). For anyone born in the early 80's with a super famicom, a genesis or an arcade stick in their hands, this movie calls a bell. Enough with the nods. The plot ? "Jennifer Jason Leigh stars as a game designer (Allegra) that creates a virtual reality game that taps into the minds of the players" as we can see on the movie's main details page. It's the story in history. For me, this picture is about a 'reality demonstrator' young couple infiltrating 'brand new virtual games' presentation session to destroy its programmer. I suppose what we see in the last five minutes is the reality if there are such things as reality. Jennifer Jason Leigh always plays a game designer in the game they are in, and the end of the movie is reality, with video game freaks giggles, big hairy dogs, 'Cronenbergy realistic' plastic texts (helmets and stuff) and 9mm handguns. What you see is true. They play transcendence in an hour or so (in this game there is a game (eXistenZ) where JJL plays the eXistenZ genius programmer and Jude-Pikul - Law a marketing trainee associated with Allegras game), they play eXistenZ because Allegra is very much Concerned about her pods health (the thing you connect to your nervous system to play), she must join and Pikul then wins the game (Transcendenz) and back in fact they kill Yevgeny Nourish, the TranscendenZ programmer. <br /> <br /> Playing the eXistenZ and TranscendenZ is about your essence, facing your subconscious, while creating a virtual reality, you have to overcome unexpected ways of winning the game (by playing the game, the girl player Allegra, reality demonstrator 'becomes Allegra, a' virtuality goddess'). Which game would Heidegger have played to feel his abstract expression then? Being really engaged in the world? And what about Nietschze (Yes Friedrich, God is dead, and you know what? Willem Dafoe stands for him! - God, the Mechanical -) ??? <br /> <br /> Yes, we construct a narrative for ourselves and we lose this thread from one day to the next disintegrating people as personalities. eXistenZ discusses the fact that reality is the whole perception of itself by anyone who truly preached it. And we could sometimes get some nice things; a notion of virtuality in virtuality in reality.
