A lot of "alternative" comedy in the UK in the 1980s was ecological, rude, overly political and unfunny, and the worst of the comic book ... stuff fell into that category. <br /> <br /> But this is at the other end - a remarkable movie that works at different intellectual levels. <br /> <br /> Is Dennis a criminal mastermind or is he lying? <br /> <br /> Is he telling the truth, bluffing, double-bluffing, counter-double-bubbly-bluffing what? <br /> <br /> I've probably seen Supergrass 20 or 30 times and I still can't decide 100%. That's the wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> As well as Ade Edmonson, there are major roles for other early comic strips - French & Saunders, Pete Richardson, Alexei Sayle, Keith Allen, Nigel Plans and Robbie Coltrane, though curiously not Rich Mayall. <br/> <br /> All the Strip Strip Castings - how much I didn't like the hidden agenda for some of their members - are compelling actors and turn into amazing performances in this great screenplay while Richardson-Rich's writing work is so often pure genius, with nice little details about it all. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is a study of crime, criminology, and human nature, all in all, it's wonderfully complex. And much fun with it. You will not be disappointed.
