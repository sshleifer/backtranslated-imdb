I can deviate from many people on this board, but I enjoy watching Mind Of Mencia. The reason I like Mind Of Mencia is the host, not afraid to speak or exploit stereotypes. Carlos Mencia does what we all do with our friends, but is unwilling to admit and see some. Mencia has no problem making jokes about any race, religion, sex or orientation. While he is getting very flat for this, it is a fresh breath in these politically correct times. Mencia doesn't care if he offends anyone, but he is not racist and even jokes about his own race. <br /> <br /> The typical format of Mind of Mencia goes like this: There will be an open shit making fun of a person or event. Mencia then comes out and stands for 5 or 6 minutes, where he speaks of various problems. The show has 2 separate skits divided by advertisements. In these sketches, Mencia does a number of things like making fun of people, giving his personal opinions with a fun twist or simply making parodies of people, events or movies. At the end of the show, Mencia comes in a moment with a final shit or something else to say. People criticize Mencia for exploiting stereotypes and saying that his statements are too offensive. Carlos does only what everyone else thinks of some races but is afraid to say. As for Mencia being offensive, he speaks only his mind. I find nothing wrong with that. <br /> <br /> The view is not perfect. The sketches cannot be composed best and sometimes Mencia goes over the line in his jokes. For the most part, however, it is a show where the comedian says what is thought of him, no matter what the consequences are and is part of a humorous question. So if you are not afraid to laugh at stereotypes and see someone, speak his mind and often say what you have wanted to say, look Mind Of Mencia. But if you are easily offended, you should not see this show because you will be offended or worse, but you may even laugh.
