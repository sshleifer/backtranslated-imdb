An opera diva has an accident that leaves the door open for her subjects to take over the role. Betty (Marsillach) is now the star of Mac Beth, but someone hiding in the trenches has an opera of his own planned out. He gets his kicks out of bending Betty up, putting needles under the eyes (so she can't close them) and murdering members of the opera company in front of her eyes. "Opera" is definitely one of Argento's more ambitious films, like mixing it with Shakespheres Macbeth, there is of course the fact that the opera in the movie is Giuseppe Verdi's version of Macbeth, but also Argento, just as Shakespeare uses ravens as a death and accident. And as the ravens encircling the castle of Dunsinane, which prevents the end of the crooked Macbeth, ravens in OPERA play an important role in the death of the killing. In addition, the killer seems like in the old game on the admonition of his girlfriend. But I don't want to go as far as to say that OPERA is meant to be a remake of either the Opera or Macbets Phantom, the similarities are too subtle. It's just a typical Argento championship, and with that he gives this otherwise quite basic thriller a vivid nuance of Gothic mystery. Although this movie is down, as the heavy metal soundtrack just doesn't fit in with this movie and the last scenes in this movie are a bit strange. All in all, "Opera" is something of a mistaken masterpiece, but still good.
