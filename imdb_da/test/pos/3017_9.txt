CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> The cell, like Antz, must be seen twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was mediocre, but the movie had such a lasting impression on me after watching, I decided to rent it again. I did, and I found the movie to be much more sympathetic. The cell is not for everyone, but it shares its stories with quality and is a visually intelligent movie that dreams up pictures and plot ideas that could not be matched. The film's script can sometimes be lumpy, like the footage, but the pictures are brilliant and bring the engaging story to an exotic and exciting life. The Oscar-nominated makeup is also bold and cautious, while the beautiful costumes and utterly brilliant set of decorations went unnoticed. Tarsem Singh, who has also directed music videos, gets totally crazy about his direction, and it does well. He has great talent and this film has many opportunities if you give it a try. Overall, The Cell is a strong, disturbing and avoids being too sticky, making it a good and comfortable watch.
