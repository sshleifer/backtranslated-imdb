It kept me on the edge of my seat. True, the story has a few plot holes, but the right excitement of what the instructor just holds the challenging premise is simply fascinating. <br /> <br /> José Coronado and Adriana Ozores are two of Spain's best players (see La Vida Mancha and Héctor), and here they look like a happy over-middle class couple. In all, the truth is that the whole of Coronado's life is a lie. He is not an economist, never went to college or does not work in Spain's Central Bank Reserve, as everyone else thinks. We get a few insights on how he stopped looking or doing it, and although it is not very plausible, it is still somehow credible. <br /> <br /> The internal effects of the scams appear intermittent, but it is credible because Coronado is a source of confidence and confidence. He does not just believe in fraud, he also believes in the film prize, and therefore he bears it. Of course, it tests that a wife would not know the inner effects of a marriage's economy for nearly 10 years, but again, as he seems to be an excellent economist. <br /> <br /> It has been said in a nationalist tone that the film is not "separate Spanish" as if it were a litmus test for good movie. True, no castanets or odd cabbies in this one, just a tense thriller. You want to know how this story ends when you begin to see.
