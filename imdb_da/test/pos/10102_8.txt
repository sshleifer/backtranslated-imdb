I see many movies, but at the moment my genre number is an Asian fate. I just bought this DVD and I originally found "Janghwa, Hongryeon" an exciting but confused movie, as I hadn't understood many parts of the story. But I saw in the IMDb Board a message entitled "Explanation of a masterpiece (all your questions answered) faster load" written by opiemar, and I was really impressed with the high quality of the explanations that this user gave to viewers like me who Missing points of the story. I would like to congratulate opiemar for his excellent work and suggest him to write a correct summary of this movie in IMDb to help and guide other viewers. <br /> <br /> Finally, I agree that "Janghwa, Hongryeon" is a great Korean movie, but I don't give ten in my voice because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once, as this film requires, and without the great support of opiemar I would not be able to understand the story as a whole. I intend to watch this movie again in the near future. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo" ("Fear")
