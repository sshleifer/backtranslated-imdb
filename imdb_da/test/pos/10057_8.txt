Nikki Finn is the kind of girl I wanted to marry. Never boring, always thinking positive, good with animals. Okay, as a reviewer wrote, a little too much peroxide, lipstick and eyebrows (Only Madonna could get away with it). But that's why I love Nikki Finn, she's not your regular girl. She makes things happen, always exciting to be around and always honest. Well, she steals, but she doesn't rob or murder (unless you're out to do her). She knows which rules can be broken and which ones must be obeyed. She knows what to take and what can't be stolen. If you need a service from her, she's 100%. Bottom line: She knows how to enjoy life. Nikki always loves (that's why she has a way of wildlife) and totally dedicated to those she loves and who loves her. <br /> <br /> Who is that girl? She's the girl for me.
