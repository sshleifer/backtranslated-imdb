Lifeforce starts in the outer space where HMS Churchill tracks Haley's Comet and its equipment records a 150-mile-long alien spaceship in the head of the comet, unable to contact the ground due to disturbances Colonel Tom Carlsen (Steve Railsback) decides that this is the only chance to investigate it. Carlsen & some of his crew members enter the mysterious spaceship and find the remains of a bat as a wildness and three perfect-looking humanoids, two men (Chris Jagger & Bill Malin) & a beautiful woman (Mathilda May) whom they board aboard Churchill . Thirty days later and back on earth, Churchill is detected on radar, a rescue mission is sent only to discover that the spacecraft is burned out and the entire crew is allegedly dead. The rescue team, however, finds the three humanoid aliens themselves and takes them back to Earth, where in a London Space Research Center they come back to life and begin to literally suck the life force out of human victims who then have to do the same with stopping themselves for dust , things look cloudy when the epidemic spreads throughout London ... This English production was produced by the infamous Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus, which in the early 80s was responsible for lots of cheap low budget actions flicks during their production company Cannon usually starring Chuck Norris & they wanted to move into the big time and signed director Tobe Hooper up on a three movie deal (which was this Lifeforce, Invaders from Mars (1986) Remake & The Texas Kainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) a successor to Hooper's own classic), which all flopped and basically bankrupt were both Golan & Globus & Cannon no longer. Anyway, despite being a commercial flop at the cashier's office, I have to say that Lifeforce is a very entertaining one if it is something stupid sci-fi horror. When it was originally released for theaters back in '85, Lifefore was cut to 101 minutes by the Golan & Globus, but in the last few years the longer 116 minute cut has anything but replaced it on DVD, VHS, Laserdisc & TV, Although Hooper's original cut of the movie ran for 128 minutes, there are even more recordings out there somewhere. I will base my comments on the longer 116 minute cut, the script by Dan O'Bannon, Don Jakoby and unredited paraphrases by Michael Armstrong & Olaf Pooley was based on the 1976 short story 'The Space Vampires' by Colin Wilson & has many extraordinary ideas That's the scale is really ambitious, and one felt that it ended up being a bit of a mess, but a hell of an entertaining one. It moves like a rocket and in the heart there is a really interesting story here, even though the film gets into a tangle. There are also some hilarious moments in Lifeforce, the scene where the security guard is trying to convince the naked female vampire to surrender by offering her a half-eaten biscuit, is a genuine leather classic, the horrible overwhelmed hypnosis scenes, including the one in which Railsback ends up kissing Patrick Stewart & many, many more besides. I don't know, call me odd, but I just thought Lifeforce was hugely fun and entertaining in almost every way, from stupid characters, odd dialogue, strange ideas that never quite come together and some amazing visual vitality is certainly not a movies that will drill you. <br /> <br /> Director Hooper had more money here to play with than he ever had (twice what he had for Poltergeist (1982) himself) and he spends every part of it to bring this spectacular movie to the big screen, the John Dykstra guy in charge of Star Wars (1977), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) and more recently Spider-Man (2002) was brought in to handle the visual effects and generally they look amazing . The sequences in outer space with spaceships look particularly, there are also some really good visual effects back on Earth, including the destruction of London as 100s blue souls fly around everywhere. There is some nudity, but not much gore, there are some wilting looks, a few shots wounds, the skin on some hand peeling away, blood spores from some eyes, nose and ears. There is a cut off arm as well as some zombies. The special make-up effects are also generally very good. I didn't want to say Lifeforce is scary as such that it is more of a sci-fi movie than horror, I loved the way Hooper shoots into the room's sequences while keeping his camera rotating to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness and that there is no "solid" floor as it was. <br /> <br /> With an assumed budget of around $ 25,000,000, it made less than half of it in the theatrical round and has not set the world alight on video or DVD, which is also a shame because even though is a little mess, it is very fun to see. Shot in place in England. Well filmed in 2: 35: 1 widescreen, 4: 3 cropped image is terrible and cuts large pieces of information from both sides of the screen. It is most visible during the opening scene in the outer space, where it is sometimes difficult to cope with what is happening and the feeling of the room's greatness and the alien spaceship is lost. The act is ok in a very stupid movie, Patrick Stewart replaced Sir John Gielgud, Nancy Paul replaced Olivia Hussey, Frank Finlay replaced Klaus Kinski, while Anthony Hopkins struck down the role of Caine. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a bizarre movie, no two ways about it really & someone looking for something simple and straightforward to look elsewhere. Anyone looking for something a little different in the sci-fi genre than giving Lifeforce a go, as it is one of those so bad, is the good movie with some impressive effects, and it's not your average drift of the mill in any way.
