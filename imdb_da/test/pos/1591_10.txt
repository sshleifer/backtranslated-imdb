<br /> <br /> This movie is a summary of Visconti's obsessions: nobility, death, aesthetic, homosexuality decadence ... All mingled with melancholy championship. Slowly to enable you to consider all of its beauty (which is in music and pictures as well as in history) it is the kind of movie we are not allowed to enjoy more, brave, deeply personal and intelligent. The real fruit of a genius like Visconti.
