I loved this movie so much. I'm a big fan of Amanda Bynes' recently completed show. I admire her (besides her body) for her training ability. She's a good actress. <br /> <br /> The movie was amazing. It's about a girl named Viola who wants to play football, but when her school cuts the girls' football team, she gets sad. Her brother is set to go to a prestigious school and he decides to go to England. So Viola wants to get an impression by playing at the football team at the boarding school. She goes to school and tries out the football team. She comes in. Meanwhile, she meets Duke, who is a sensitive guy playing on the football team. He really likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes Sebastian, who is really viola. Sebastian is dating Monique and suspects that Sebastian is not himself. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not a chick flick and I enjoyed it very much. It is so fun and lovable. I don't think I've seen AManda act better.
