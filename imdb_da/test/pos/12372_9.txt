Victor Sjöström's "choir" casts the viewer into the lower depths of life for much of his time, with ugly scenes of alcohol deprivation, family violence and suicide despair, but the most memorable passages involve the mythical image of death itself. Here, death is shaped like a ghostly horse-drawn carriage, driven by a miserable sinner who was the last person to die on the previous New Year's Eve. For a year, the fire has to gather the souls of the newly deceased souls, and after twelve months of this terrible service, the driver's own soul is finally released when the last person who dies on December 31 becomes the new driver. <br /> <br /> The scenes involving this wagon (the film became known as "Phantom Carriage" or "Phantom Chariot" in English speaking countries) are eerie and fascinating, using double exposure filmography that was rather sophisticated for its time and still effective when seen today. Most striking raises the cart to the bottom of the sea to collect the soul of a person who drowned. As fascinating as these scenes, however, the bulk of the movie is concerned about David Holm's downward spiral, which the director himself plays in a discreet depiction of a man who has given up on the opportunity to live a decent life. In flashbacks we see Holm enjoying a lovely day on the beach with his wife, children and brother, and he seems to be a very ordinary guy. Abruptly, without a story or explanation, we see Holm as an alcoholic wreck, in trouble with the law and alienated from his family. Normally, this jump from Before to After can feel like a story-telling defect, but in this case, the filmmakers trust us to fill in the familiar, sordid details on their own. It is suggested that Holm has been led astray by his friendly friend Georges, the drinking companion who first relates to Phantom Carriage's story, but whatever the cause of his downfall Holm seems to be a lost cause, a mediocre drunk. takes wrong pleasure in inflicting pain on his family and refusing to reform. <br /> <br /> While David Holm is our central figure, the true catalyst of history is a young savior poor nurse who takes a sympathetic interest in his case and yet believes in despite his hateful behavior. When the nurse herself dies - indirectly because of her ministries on behalf of Holm - she demands to see him and thus inadvertently initiates a chain of events that will result in his recovery. times, this movie resembles Dickens' tale of Scrooge in the use of ghostly visitors who inspire a deeply deficient man to exploit his life, suffer from his misfortune and reform. I was also reminded of Sjöström's drama "Terje Vigen" from 1917, when a man returns from prison to find his house empty and his family is gone (a sequence echo here). The director also repeats a standard theme for Scandinavian folklore, which was previously found in his "Berg-Ejvind and his wife" (ie "The Outlaw and His Wife," 1918), that no one can fight his fate. This time, however, it can be argued that David Holm actually succeeds in evading his seemingly inevitable destiny, for he has an unexpected chance of making changes. Viewers who expect a leap in the supernatural will appreciate sequences with the titles of the Phantom Carriage, but cannot be prepared for this film's painful study of an uneasy man's alcoholic demise. But those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate the "choir" in its entirety. It stands with the most serious cinema in its era and is definitely one of Sjöström's most accomplished works.
