"Hail The Woman" is one of the most moving movies I've ever seen in my life. I saw it twice in a row and sucked my eyes out. <br /> <br /> This silent masterpiece deserves a much wider audience; Unfortunately, the only surviving print is so heavily scratched that most people do not see it all the way through and they will miss the pearl that shines under the hard. This movie could use a digital restoration to help spread its beauty, but I doubt it will get it from anyone, as the main theme is spiritual restoration before the family's family unit, and it's not politically correct these days. But it is still a strong theme for those whose hearts are hurt by broken family relationships. <br /> <br /> Casting is magnificent, especially Florence Vidor, who literally shines like Judith, her daughter; ethereal Madge Bellamy as Nan, the poor girl who gets pregnant and thrown aside; Theodore Roberts as the crotchety old dominant father who destroys all around him through pride; and beautiful Lloyd Hughes, like David's son, afraid of his father, but really of life itself. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to watch Christmas, especially. You will not regret being patient and seeing it in its entirety despite the deterioration.
