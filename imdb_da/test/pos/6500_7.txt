... cut it. Like African-made rhythms with the jawbone of an ass and Virgin Islander's welded oil drums in ear-pleasing steel bands, it also made the place's DJ's itch to dress in the pursuit of new methods of creative expression. "Scratch" is a totally unwarranted documentary that takes you to the heart of the hip-hop / rap movement and explores the creation of turntablism, the art of riding vinyl and the ultimate DJ / MC contempo entertainment expression. The film reveals some surprisingly intelligent and articulate "Scratchers" with exciting unique skills in concert and competition, where beat meets the street. Good things for anyone interested in grass roots or ghetto boy movements in sound art. (B)
