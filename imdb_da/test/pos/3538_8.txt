I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn't see the original telecom game until a few days ago, and this is far better than the sequel. Okay it's not a million miles away from the plot of seven but it's still convincing. Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott's achievements as DCI Red Metcalfe, a policeman who seems to have led to a very unfortunate life and a person who has a terrible secret. It's easy for Stott to go over the top, but he plays the role in a rather subtle way. Likewise, the murders are very shocking, but - unlike the successor, where the murders are performed on the screen in a rather OTT way - there is actually some violence shown. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that the red herring was also obviously a red herring, which meant I was not taken off the shock (And you will probably see the shock twist so I have not disturbed a spoiler warning) and that when the real killer was revealed, it seemed a bit far-fetched and caused a few plot holes to appear in history. If I remember correctly, the successor had similar problems when the killer was revealed, so maybe it is a good idea not to make MESSIAH 3
