Sri Lanka ... not a country I have ever thought much, I must admit. I didn't even know it was close to India, let alone that there has been a bloody civil war since 1983. It seems that the rebels in the Tamil minority have been in constant conflict with the military regime that runs the country many years, causing many deaths and widespread suffering on the island. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratman's latest movie, A PECK ON THE CHEEK, tells the story of a young girl named Amudha, separated from her civilian parents by the war and raised by a young Indian couple. Amudha is a bright and rude girl whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her she was adopted as a child. Although her adopted parents love her as much as possible and have traveled without prejudice with their biological children, Amudha cannot help but learn more about her biological family. Mani Ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film DIL SE, which hides a story of terrorism and politics inside a love story (or is it the other way around?). A PECK ON THE CHEEK inhabits the same area, but is perhaps more ambitious in the ground it covers. The central theme that binds the film is love between all the different family members, and especially between a child and her adopted parents. It is a fairly honest and open look at emotions that can be extremely touching and heartwarming sometimes and quite painful in others. It is an emotionally complex movie with characters that are slightly idealized, but still behave in a very human way. The film is about 9 years old Amudha, played with the charm and vivaciousness of the young actor P.S. Keerthana in his first and only play. She is a princess and a monster who always comes in trouble, but so incredibly charming that no one can get angry with her for too long. The young actress is completely cast into the role and does tremendous work in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of her. <br /> <br /> A PECK ON THE CHEEK has such an innocent name, I was totally unprepared for the intensity of the experience. Never have such a small act come with such a huge emotional effect I dare say. The film is a bold and artistic effort to investigate issues that are not often covered by the silver screen. Mani Ratman's direction is fantastic, very safe and mature - the most sophisticated work I've seen from this director yet. The film is visually very stylish, with some good cameras and pictures. YEAR. Rahman gives the film's soundtrack, which is not as good as his classic DIL SE or BOMBAY music (based on first impressions at least), but still shows his great musical talent. <br /> <br /> I'm not aware of a DVD release for the movie yet - I saw it in Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival, of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight. Production is a truly world-class effort and I am sure it will be popular with Western audiences as it begins to receive wider exposure. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
