When you look at Mexico's best movie, you find more than likely that the photography was done by Gabriel Figueroa. He is recognized in the world as one of the best ever. His master control of the cameras gave an extra asset to the films he was a part of. If he is added to his participation, we add the direction to Luis Bunuel, you will never find a few aces anywhere else in the world. This story, Nazarin, was written by Spain's greatest writer in addition to Miguel de Cervantes (Don Quixote de la Mancha). The story itself is amazing: Nazarin a priest who lives by his faith tries to live a very Christian life, but as always there are people who do not accept this. He walks through many places to preach his Christianity, but most of the time he finds people who do not accept him. But besides the amazing story, it's always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that Bunuel sends us through the whole picture in scenes that make you shake.
