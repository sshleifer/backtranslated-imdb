Maybe this movie was thought to be nothing but fun. Maybe it was supposed to get teenage girls tied up on the whole nudity in it. But what I came up with was actually something that many people believe in. And it's "Nice guys finish load". There is a line in Angel Heart from Lisa Bonet's character who says "It takes a bad ass to get a girls heart beat faster." True. Most likely. Women always say they want flowers and sweets and courtesy and anything. But (at least at an early age) they end up going to the smart, slimy, disrespectful, uncovered guy. The one they know cannot respect their beliefs. And that's part of the attraction. What is exciting about a guy who is already the way you want him to be? I think that may have happened to Boaz Davidson. And what he has to say in this movie that is disguised with sex and nudity and parties and everything else teens can relate to is that you will have your heart broken. It happens to everyone, and it will happen to you. And it's a strong final statement in the movie. But after all that, the movie is fun. It's fun, and it shows good by the high schools. It is a rare movie that is sleek enough to satisfy the teenage volume it caters to, but also intelligent and exciting enough to show what it is; s likes to get your heart broken No highschool movie has ever done better. As I said, I think the authors must have experienced a situation like this first hand. Maybe we all have. <br /> <br /> This is an old movie, but if you ever come across it when collecting dust on a shelf in your local video store one evening, pick it up, you might be surprised. It's a hell of a lot better than never been kissed.
