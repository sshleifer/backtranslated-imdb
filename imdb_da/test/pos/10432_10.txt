This is definitely the best movie I've ever seen. At age 12 I was late and ran over the movie. It was on the US channel, Gilbert Godfrey's Up All Night. I will never forget. At that time, my friends and I were struggling with various problems, some sexual. You at 12 are a very rough and strange age. It seems you are stuck between being a little girl and being a young lady. This movie really helped answer many questions to me. I now have a daughter who is 12. Has searched for a few years for this movie. If it ever comes out on DVD, I would be the first to buy. Would recommend for any parent to see this with their child when they reach the very hard and difficult age.
