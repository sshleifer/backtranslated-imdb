"Christmas in Connecticut" is an absolute gem and a must-see for Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, a precursor to Martha Stewart, is a leaf columnist and ne plus ultra homemakers - the perfect wife, mother, and domestic goddess. The only thing is, she is not one of these things - a totally false one. Unfortunately, she is finding out. Her publisher, Alexander Yardley (a brilliant cartoon of the Sydney Greenstreet) gets the bright idea of ​​inviting a famous war hero to Elisabeth's "perfect farm" for the Christmas holidays. Only thing that is no farm, "perfect" or otherwise. The comedy involves how Elizabeth should keep her true identity under cover so she won't lose her job. Elizabeth's colleague, John, happens to have a farm in Connecticut to solve that problem. But he wants to marry Liz, but she doesn't want to marry him. He offers her marriage even though he knows she doesn't feel the same way about him as he does to her. He still makes the offer and assures her that he is willing to wait. And here, Barbara Stanwyck, like Liz, delivers one of the most devastating hits I've ever heard. With complete innocence she answers: "Could you wait so long?" OUCH! In addition, the scenes between Una O'Conner and S.Z. Sakall is fun. They do not seem to like each other (even if you suspect they really do). They are rivals in the household, and S.Z. Sakall's missing English means Nora's cold pronunciation of his name ("Mr. Basternook"). "My name is FELIX!" It's great how Christmas and Christmas are these black and white films. Great characters work by everyone involved. Don't miss this one!
