I remember this movie, it was the first movie I had seen at the cinema, the picture was dark in places, I was very nervous, it was back in 74/75 my dad took me my brother and sister to the Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire England . I remember the tigers and lots of snow in the movie also the look of Grizzly Adam's actor Dan Haggery, I think one of the tigers will be shot and die. If anyone knows where to find this on DVD, etc. Let me know. The cinema has now been transformed into a fitness club, which is a great shame as the nearest cinema is now 20 miles away, would love to hear from others who have seen this movie or anyone else likes it.
