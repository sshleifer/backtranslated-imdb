Ali G Indahouse has to be one of the funniest movies I've seen for a long time, and Coh's portrayal of a British gangsta is fun. This movie has a cool classic written over it and it has some really good lines. Ali G Indahouse is a good film that will let the viewer laugh literally from the beginning to the end. Absolutely vote Ali G and keep it right.
