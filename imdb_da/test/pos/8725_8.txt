Now I want to say that this is a very entertaining and slightly touching movie despite its mistakes. I didn't think for a moment that Matthau knew the first thing about being a dentist. Also, Hawn's character seemed to recover from suicidal thinking quite quickly at the beginning of the film. Not to mention it all seemed a bit ridiculous. However, the movie succeeds because of a good pace, humor and its stars. Matthau may not have been a dentist, but he was as entertaining as he usually is. Bergman brought a lot of sensitivity to the film (especially during the scene where her and Matthau go for a drink after work) and also a lot of humor. I think it was her performance that made my brother aware of this movie after having missed a few scenes. Hawn's performance is remarkable, though an Oscar may have been over, do it a little. In principle, do not take this movie seriously and you will enjoy yourself.
