This movie is excellent in how it portrays the reality of sexual abuse. The daughters express their conflicting feelings of devotion and fraud. The on-location scenery is absorbent authentic, and the soundtrack is discreet, yet moving. This film is a graduate-level course in a reality that is too little recognized in American society. Personally, I'm freaked out by the names of the characters - Long character is Ginny Cook Smith - I'm Connie Cook Smith, and my mother is Genny Cook. The youngest daughter is Caroline Cook, my sister's name, and father is Larry Cook, my father's name. But sex abuse was not in our immediate family.
