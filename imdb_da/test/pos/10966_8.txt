It concludes with the statement that "the movie you have just seen was an improvisation" - that once you feel like an idiot to think about improvisation was a good movie and amazed at Cassavete's genius ... again. Of course, Cassavetes told a guy, it was not an improvisation in itself on his deathbed, so ... it's the story of a light-skinned black woman, Lelia, passing for white and her family: pre-white brother named Ben, and a black-and-black brother named Hughie. When she falls in love with a white shake called Tony, he is unpleasantly surprised when he finds out that she is black and from there the individual protagonists' expectations and shortcomings go. Hughie is a jazz singer becoming a failure, Lelia is still hopelessly depressed by Tony, and Ben is anxious and violent in general, desperately in need of something to shock him out of his distinguished patterns of existence. Overall, I assume that it really is about stasis vs. change in human life. I suppose Cassavetes had the plot organized enough, and it was just the dialogue that was improvised. The dialogue itself is very uneven - sometimes someone will say something very memorable, other times it is oddly scary. What is great is the extent of the amateur actors' performance of their characters. Cassavetes went through the acting class he learned at the time when he decided to make shadows, whispered in the ears of the top ten students, and that was the result ... the boys playing Ben and Hughie are very good. At first I did not like Lelia, but when the film was advanced, you see more and more, she is one of the actors who get better as the excitement and drama builds - not necessarily the best with little talk. Shadows are hailed by many as the forerunner of the indie film movement (made in 1959), and it is definitely recommended.
