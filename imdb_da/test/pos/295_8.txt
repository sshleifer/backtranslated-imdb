You can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; The team is hackneyed. Or you can find a value-neutral comment on the madness of war (removed by "judgment"); That team is totally uninteresting. <br /> <br /> You can see this for the darn's good entertainment value of Duvall's one-liners, but it's just a coating for commercial mastication. <br /> <br /> You can try to see this as a "realistic" Vietnam war movie, but ask any veteran and he'll swell the term - most vets say it stinks. <br /> <br /> Or see it as a will or will he not 'morally play - nothing rich there either. <br /> <br /> Where I found the value was in the amazing self-reference. Coppola needed a large enough container (war) to fit the greatness of the skilled multidimensional actor who played 'a great man'. <br /> <br /> Brando Man was just as much of a Maverick as Kurtz Character. The studies were unpleasant with his acting 'method', but he always excelled and won awards; The 'Generals' are uncomfortable with Kurtz's 'unhealthy methods', despite his strategic genius. So Coppola makes a film about Brando's greatness. To hammer at that point, he places himself in the movie (like Hopper, a manic photojournalist loaded with multiple cameras) to empty his praise. Brando himself is only seen in halftones and silhouettes - Storaro film by Storaro, which only increases the power of the actors. And he goes out as the sacrifice to complete the narrative equation. Oh yes: "Fear ..." Other interests: The great use of point of view camera perspectives, including "being in the fire department" long before "Private Ryan"; the groundbreaking use of sound, especially the vicious fluttering sweeps and sonic depiction of an acid flight. <br /> <br /> Not trapped in the outer layers; The rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound, vision and self-references.
