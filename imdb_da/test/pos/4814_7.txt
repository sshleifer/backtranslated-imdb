The late director John Frankenheimer directed his first feature film, The Young Stranger, after starting direct TV dramas in New York City. This movie was hailed by the success of Rebel without cause in 1955. James MacArthur made his feature film debut as a troubled teenager with a movie producer father played by James Daly who does not make enough of a relationship with his son. Kim Hunter plays the mother who tries to bridge the gap between her husband and her son. The movie uses the popular juvenile delinquent angle of time to tell its story. MacArthur gets into trouble in a movie theater with an excessive theater manager played by Whit Bissell. MacArthur, in turn, deals with a police hunter, James Gregory, by teaching him a lesson. The material could easily be exploited, ridiculous and sensational, just as any number of others during the period did. However, the film under Frankenheimer's true direction is a sensitive portrayal of teenage and parenting. The dialogue is realistic, and most scenes are surprisingly good. Some of the scenes with Bissell, as theater manager and Gregory, as the police sergeant, are a bit heavy-handed and dated. The performances, however, are similarly good, which is necessary for a film of this kind and for this subject to succeed. This is an impressive feature debut both for MacArthur and Frankenheimer. *** of 4 stars.
