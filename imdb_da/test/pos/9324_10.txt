For those who are too young to remember or too old to have been part of the "hype", Michael Jackson's platter in the early mid-80s was on the heights of hell - like the hype about the Titanic, except that It just didn't let up. Every song, every video, every word published by Michael was important. Nothing like that had been seen since the Beatles flourishing time. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this video for the first time on a roller coaster. All stopped skating. There was no doubt whether you were Michael Jackson's fan or not; you were. Everyone squeezed around the projection screen and saw the video ... <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the longest music videos ever made, and definitely the best. It will continue to be No. 2 on the annual MTV top 100 videos (# 1 is always taste of the month, and somehow it was # 1 anytime past # 2 to make room for the new # 1 figure .), and Thriller became a phenomenon in itself. <br /> <br /> If you ever get the chance, watch the video; not only the extracts shown on MTV or VH1. If necessary, search out the Thriller in a video rental store. Hi ... your parents have probably made you see the Beatles and Woodstock recordings because "it was important" ... it's also important.
