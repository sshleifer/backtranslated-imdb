Van Damme has made some good films over the years, and one hits a big ten in my books. From the setting of Mexico to the five star battle scenes, this movie was fantastic. The film is about border patrol policies that protect the area that is the border with Mexico. Ex navy seals smuggle drugs out of Mexico in the United States (USA), Van Damme and Scott Atkins provide amazing performances such as policeman and villain. Although this film was not as good as death, it still gave the action, action and film a five-star appearance. I always look forward to these b grade action movies and they get better. Keep them coming from ponds. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you've enjoyed movies like - Until Death, The hard corps and the second command.
