Our family (and the whole sold out audience) enjoyed "The Guardian". Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances like the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben and Jake. After watching this movie you can't help but imagine how difficult it is to get out of USCG helicopter rescue swimming school and one day participate in real rescue. Although this is a fictional film, it provided quite convincing virtues of team spirit, commitment and courage as exhibited by all members of the actual US Coast Guard. <br /> <br /> The special effects used to create rescue scenes were incredible. You actually felt that you were in a real rescue. I feel the movie could have been made without the "Hollywood" bar scene (when you watch the movie, you may agree) since the real Coast Guard does not allow such behavior. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining, very action packed, definitely worth seeing. Thanks, U.S. Coast Guard and REAL helicopter rescue swimmers, "So Others May Live". I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
