Before I talk about the end of this movie, I'll talk about the plot. Some man named Gerald breaks his engagement with Kitty and runs out to Craven Castle in Scotland. After months, Kitty and her aunt went to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald is old and he has become more transparent. Gerald has certain rules for the castle (the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald doesn't want them to stay, but Kitty insists on making excuses. One night, the aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall. It scares her so much that she fails and (another excuse) they have to stay longer. Kitty gets more worried about Gerald after she tries to go to the maze, but Gerald catches her and is even more sensitive to her. Kitty then sends to reinforcements she calls their doctor who is actually their friend and his broad. So, to make things look suspicious, they invite a few other friends (who do nothing). Blah, blah, blah Kitty and her aunt finish in the maze, where the most excited story is. They are somehow separated and they try to find each other. But the aunt stumbles on the creature ... here's the moment we've all been waiting for, what is the creature lurking in the shadows? It's a HUGE FROG !!! OMG what is better than that! After seeing the aunt, the row literally goes crazy and runs, oops I mean hops up the stairs to the top of the castle. The seed then jumps out an open window. Then we take a shot from the ground and see the frog crazy towards us (oh yes, this movie was in 3-D). But you want to know what's fun, the frog that falls out of the window is actually a toy because it's the 1/10 size of the frog before it takes the plunge. It is then revealed that it was all evolution errors, including, among other things, Kitty and Gerald getting married. Then the last shot of this masterpiece of the tombs of the tombs is in the maze, the only place where he was ever really happy;).
