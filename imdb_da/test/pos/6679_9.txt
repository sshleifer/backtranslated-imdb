This is a movie that will let you think, is he or is he not? While many people have complained about the ambiguous ending, it leaves room for the audience to think and interpret it from the characters. This is my interpretation and theory, and I think it is very good. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is here. One day, Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the middle of a busy train station. After trying to help a woman from muggers, he is arrested and sent to Bellevue and later transferred to Dr. Mark Powell's (Jeff Bridges) Hospital. Prot tells freely about how he came from the planet K-Pax and is here to make a report on Earth. Of course, he is classified as a looney and is locked up in a low security level. He turns to the other patients and convinces them quickly about his story. In fact, he tells them he can take someone back with him. Soon, Dr. Powell's questioning of Pride's insanity, and as the plot progresses, is harder and harder to prove Prot wrong. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Dr. Powell, Prot is Robert Porter, a smart man who worked in a New Mexico slaughterhouse when his wife and daughter were murdered. Prot claims he is planning to leave K-Pax at a precise time on the 5th anniversary of the murders. Time comes and goes, and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients is missing and never found again. <br /> <br /> On my theory: Prot is not crazy. Prot is from the planet K-Pax. Robert Porter is a friend of Prot's. On one of Prague's earlier visits to the earth, Robert was a child who learned about the constellations of his father. Prot and Robert became best friends. After his family died, and Robert beat the killer, Robert decides to commit suicide. Prot is on K-Pax at that time, but he hurries back (in multiple of light speed) to stop Robert. So Prot takes over Robert's thoughts and takes over his body so to speak. Meanwhile, Prot (who still resides Roberts body) comes to New York and is unlocked. When he leaves K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him, but he has to leave Robert's body behind. That is why we now have the catatonic Robert. Explanations or Tracks: <br /> <br /> PROT'S ORDER OF THE PLANETERS ROUND LIBRA: As Prot says, every child knows about their own system. Only a few people on Earth had a curl about the system, and Prot added their knowledge. Robert Porter, while being smart and knowing his constellations, was not an astro-physicist. <br /> <br /> DR POWELL FEEL SELECTED BY PROT: That's true. Prot could have left the institute at any time, but did not choose too. Prote's last words to Dr. Powell is, "Now that you've found Robert. Beware of him." Prot was probably staying there to secure a place for Robert when he left. SUPER PEOPLE: It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and even could see UV rays. Prot gives his usual K-Pax ground, but there was no earthly reason given. It was also mentioned that Prot was given extremely high doses of medication without effect. PATIENT HELP: Throughout the film, you see Prot helping the other patients (or patients discussing Prot's suggestions) for a better sense of the world. While the psychologist is facing Prot's help, Dr. Powell at the end of the movie about the new life, the patients are leading. <br /> <br /> SPRINKLER SCENE: The sprinkler is connected to Porter's home in New Mexico (which is ironically where Roswell is). Porter connects the sprinkler with his family dead? Is she trying to protect Powell's daughter from the terrible fate? I have a different point of view. It is believed that Porter had committed suicide in a river. In fact, Prot (under hypnosis) is very concerned about Robert. I think Prot associates the father with the water, not the sprinkler. He tries to protect the girl from watery death, just as he did Robert. Hypnosis: Dr. Powell believes that under hypnosis he can uncover Prot true identity, but while Prot gives lots of information, he has never given up his prot persona and claimed homeland of k-pax. <br /> <br /> SAFETY CAMERA: Why would the camera just give out without any apparent reason? <br /> <br /> MYSTERIE DIFFERENCES: First, for a few days, Prot disappeared to the north. Funny, the patients are not at all worried. In fact, they are trying to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff. Of course, the most narrative disappearance of Bess is the winner of the essay competition. Not only does she disappear at about the same time, but the only reluctant link is her winning essay. This is only my humble theory. You can conclude what you want. You can take Dr. Powell's theory that Prot was just someone who was engaged by Robert Porter to mentally defend himself from reality, but it would give up many plot holes.
