The only way to truly understand and relate to the characters in this movie is to have experienced the situations themselves. For many people, this movie is almost mock-biographical, a kind of snapshot of a weekend in our lives. (I've made about 85 percent of the things in this movie and experienced the other 15 percent, usually everyone in the same weekend) For me and others, I know it's nice to have this movie look back on because other than a couple pictures of people we kind of remember and nights, there are patches and blurs, this movie is our generations "Studio 54", a piece to add to our scrapbooks to look back and smile. Personally, I'm glad these days are over, but it's great to watch this movie and say "I remember when ........." Thank you Justin for making this mock biography of a weekend of my life.
