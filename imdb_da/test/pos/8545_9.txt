There are many, many older films that deserve to be transferred to DVD format. This is definitely one of them. And Anthony Quinn triumph! Scores of films depict the victims of Nazi atrocities before and during the war, but I do not think any of them have killed into the psyche of the victim and the predator, as good as it has. Anthony Quinn was really a man for all seasons. He had the ability to portray the humble of creatures without any human display to a cabinet of extreme animalism, and to draw it as credible to the audience who watched with no thought of what they were just witnessing! Really one of our greatest artists. He's missed.
