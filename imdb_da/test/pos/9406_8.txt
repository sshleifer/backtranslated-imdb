This great movie featured the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Connecticut of a nephew of Ethel Kennedy. The use of the "ghost" of Martha to give some of the details was very effective and added much of the story. Christopher Meloni seemed to catch Mark Fuhrman's personality very well. Furhman, who received so much underserved poor publicity in O.J. The Simpson trial has certainly justified itself by his contribution to bringing the killer to court after approx. 27 years.
