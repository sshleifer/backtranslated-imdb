A remake of the 1916 silent film, based on the 1909 novel by Maurice Leblanc. The Detective series will be made for numerous plays, films and TV shows in the UK, USA and France over the years. This 1932 version comprised the crushing Barrymore brothers John (the Duke) and Lionel (as Detective Guerchard). They also wanted to join the Grand Hotel, dinner at eight and more over the next few years. Sonia (Karen Morley) appears in the duke's bed during a party in this pre-Hayes code film; first the lights go out into the bedroom, then they go out into the main ballroom, then the search for the villain and the missing jewelry, as well as other missing valuables ... You can say that talkies had not existed too long since they still uses picture cards several times. Also take care of a new kind of security that does not need a combination. Well thought out plot, no big holes, but not great surprises here either. Not bad for an early talkie movie. Smart conclusion.
