"The Dresser" is perhaps the most refined of backstage movies. The film is filled with white and spirit, mostly by the "energetic" character of Norman (Tom Courtenay). Although his character is clearly homosexual, and certainly has an attraction for the leading performer (Albert Finney) that he helps, the film never sleeps on it or does it more than it is. The gritty style of Peter Yates, which worked so well in "Bullitt", reappears and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence. This is much appreciated in a story that could easily become boring. In the end, "The Dresser" will drill many people stupidly, but it will really be a pleasure for those who love British cinema. <br /> <br /> 7.7 out of 10
