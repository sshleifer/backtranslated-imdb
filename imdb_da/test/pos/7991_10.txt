I remember really like BATMAN RETURNS when it came out in 1992, but now I think this is the best of all the Batman movies (though Christopher Nolan's amazing BATMAN BEGINS 2005 and certainly over the seriously overheated 2008 THE DARK KNIGHT!). I initially remember that the first BATMAN w / Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still love it). But I think this movie really hits the nail upside down. The 4 main characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman and Max Shreck) are all alive and memorable. You really get to see what Batman / Bruce Wayne is all about in Keaton's amazing characterization. Keaton is the best Batman, not Kilmer, Clooney or even the forward-looking Bale, who was unusual in BB and could have stolen top honors from Keaton, whose character had not been destroyed by Nolan's hacking film in TDK! <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito as the penguin is disturbing, scary, funny and mortal. DeVito is amazing and doesn't need scenery-chewing to give good performance like Nicholson's Joker. The viewer can actually sympathize with this pristine outcast and his situation to fit into the normal society. I had never really been a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer until this movie, but it certainly is my favorite performance of her. Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle is greasy and weird at first, so when she's transformed into Catwoman, she's sexy and scary, a totally deadly sex pot! I also feel that Keaton and Pfeiffer have more chemistry than Keaton and Basinger from Batman; they form a tragic love story. And Christopher Walken as Shreck is, as always, Christopher Walken! <br /> <br /> BATMAN RETURNS, more than BATMAN, is more confident and focused. Film production is guaranteed from start to finish. The way Burton introduces the penguin's heartbreaking backstory takes you from the beginning. The first 5 minutes are among my favorite beginnings for any movie: Danny Elfman's music sets a grim-preventing tone that defines the rest of the movie. It's a change from the original BATMAN and a fantastic one! <br /> <br /> Then, turn 33 into today's Gotham and we are introduced to the strong businessman Shreck who wants to build a new power plant in Gotham. During the same scene, we meet Shraff's bad, bullied, implied secretary Selina Kyle. And not slowly is this movie's exciting opening action, as Batman has to fight with the Penguin's Red Triangle Gang, a fun but deadly group of excluded and circus artists. Penguin launches the plan to attack Gotham Christmas celebration, kidnap Shreck in the chaos and force him to help reintroduce him to society. Meanwhile, Selina discovers Criminal's criminal plans, and he "kills" her by pushing her out of his high-rise, then she is revived by cats. <br /> <br /> Sound intricate? Yes, but Burton never claimed to be a realistic story. He has created a world where the viewer can accept that things like this can happen, a dark, noirish world of mistreated, deformed outcasts who will only deeply accept and care for. Safe story of story if you ask me! <br /> <br /> The action scenes are few and far between, but they are all exciting, entertaining and nail-biting. They are not there just to show how some in Batman are. And they all have meaning. The climatic scene with the penguin's "army" marches into the center of Gotham with Batman zoning in on the penguin's shadow and sidekick butler Alfred (Michael Gough in a welcome return from the original!) Assistant Batman is concise, solid and heart pounding fun! br /> <br /> I also love Christianity, the wintery setting that adds to the super-dark, cold sense of Burton's Batman world. I also love how Burton slowly introduces Batman "toys" without pushing them into our throats. Each "toy" is appropriate for the moment in the movie and we are forced to accept them for their purpose. And even though it's dark, RETURNS is still a fun movie. DeVito's Penguin has many fun lines. It also does Walkens Shreck. Batman-Catwoman exchange is extremely stimulating and humorous! A good ensemble! All in all, BATMAN RETURNS is a close-knit tale of the dark forces played in Tim Burton's fun cartoon world.
