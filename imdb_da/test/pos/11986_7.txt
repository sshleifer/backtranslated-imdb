One must take Martin & Lewis as a touch of salt and pepper. Why does Martin put up with Lewis? So again, why do all the women in this movie like Jerry? Because he is innocent sympathetic! Martin sings a few good songs (lip-sync'd at least once) and Jerry manages to kiss more girls than in all his other movies combined. I generally find that I can take as much of Jerry's antics before they get worse. BUT .... in this movie, see when Jerry is stuck outside on a submerged Navy submarine! EXCELLENT! Buster Keaton should have been proud. I give the movie a 7.
