Dashing Errol Flynn brings his usual flair to drama in this historically flawed but entertaining movie of George Armstrong Custer's life. The pounding, jovial Flynn essays Custer from his days at West Point as a reckless, haughty cadet during the Civil War years in an extraordinarily generous and biased interpretation of the story and finally as the non-famous Indian fighter whose blunder at Little Big Horn is apologetic as a victim of Custer by his command as a means of detecting corruption of officials and postal traders as well as a protest against the unfair treatment of the Plains Indians. Olivia de Havilland, Flynns co-star in several other films, scores as the devotee, and Anthony Quinn sees the part as the fierce Sioux boss Crazy Horse. The movie's scenes are excellent. The Civil War is short and is shown as several vignettes where Custer apparently is supported by just a handful of soldiers, hammering the Confederate army into submission. Custer's last fight against the Indians is a great spectacle, a violent clash of red men and whites, without a quarrel in a wild mix of military power between particular fighters. Great direction, filmography, casting and wonderful music by Max Steiner makes this movie a Hollywood classic.
