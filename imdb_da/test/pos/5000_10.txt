And what is its genre? Backstage postpone the story; What theatrical life is really like behind these Broadway (and other) curtains. It certainly has a lot of competition: Singin 'in the rain both I and II (1929 and 1952), 42nd Street, Golddiggers of (You are called the year.); Ladies of 1934; Noises Off (1992) from the Faroese side and A Star are born I and II from the 1930s and 1950s from the tragic side: not to mention the Summer Stock of 1950: the list goes on together. So what makes this movie so special? And why are there so few comments on this amazing movie? Have so few people actually seen it? How great to see a younger Frank Langella pre-Dracula and pre-Frost-Nixon with 30 years! How amazing to see the fresh and talented Tom Hulce so pre-Amadeus! And another great silent! What a wonderful series of talented people to a great extent from so long ago! And such a script! Who was this David Shaber? So full of realistic disillusionment and pathos in relation to the usual sentimentality and emotional comedy! Especially exemplified by the Star-Is-Born-like episode where the heroine obtains Broadway, while the Langella character must satisfy himself with another provincial tour. <br /> <br /> Langella's subsequent hysterical and sadistic blows up against the star. hit latin teacher and his grandson, where he vents his rage and frustration is just one of many amazing and psychologically right moments in the movie. (The Latin teacher and his love affair with the backstage life are certainly echoing Marlene Dietrich and her seductive blue angel professor from 1929.) Another in the series of mercenaries and cold-hearted agents such as Kevin McCarthy, who was pursued by Burt Lancaster in The Sweet Odor of Success (1957) and followed by Alan Alda in Clubland (2001) in film history. The sexual release of the Hulce figure resembles similar events in O'Neill's great comedy Ah, the Wilderness. And what a tribute to the missing operettas long ago: The Red Mill by Victor Herbert; Rose Marie and Vagabond King of Rudolf Friml; Desert Song by Sigmund Romberg etc. What satirical inserts of bits from the big players like Romeo and Juliet. Tribute to the theater itself as exposed by the star Langella. The richness and depth of this movie is simply endless. And being saddled by such a title! Who could have a cold of what this great movie is about from such a ridiculous and unnecessary title? But on the other hand, what title could one have searched for such a grand drama that could have lived up to the moving, emotional content? PS: I just watched (2009) Frank Langella in his latest spectacular: as Richard Nixon in Frost-Nixon. How this great actor after 30 years simply goes from triumph to victory!
