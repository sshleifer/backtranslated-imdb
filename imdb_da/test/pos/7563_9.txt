What a great movie !! It's a touching story of four high school friends growing up in the 1960s. Throughout the decade, friends are somewhat separate, but they sometimes see each other occasionally. There are many tragedies, but there are also many good moments that make you laugh and smile. It is a heart-filled tale of life, love and friendship. Definitely a must see for drama fans.
