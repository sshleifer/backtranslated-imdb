I had only written a review on IMDb prior to this as I consider most games as unworthy of time and effort ... The Curse of Monkey Island is different. <br /> <br /> Having played and been impressed by Monkey 1 and 2, I had great expectations for the third release ... and was not disappointed. The first thing that hit me was the significantly improved graphics. Don't misunderstand me for games made in 1990 and 1991 respectively, Monkey 1 and 2 were groundbreaking and delivered the goods well, but CMI steps up and delivers a great cartoon-style game that is both fun and satisfying. All scenes and settings have been meticulously crafted and well thought out, and are perfectly suited to this type of game. The animation / CGI is a mixture of realism and exaggeration; a great combination in this case. <br /> <br /> For me, the script has been crucial to the success of the two previous games. The CMI script is wise, appropriate and above all absolutely fun. Added to this, the script is now sound unlike the two previous ones, where speech is displayed in text format at the bottom of the screen. Dominic Armato's voice is perfect for Guybrush: Witty, clear and somewhat naive. All other talents fit perfectly with their characters, especially Earl Boen, who is the voice of LeChuck. I loved every single character throughout the game: not only their personalities and humor, but the way each character is animated excellent and distinctive. While there are sound effects, the soundtrack is worth mentioning. The sound tracks of Monkey 1 and 2 were both monotonous, and despite this, it was very effective in giving atmosphere and representing a change in mood. CMI's soundtrack is once again a step up. Each scene is complemented by a catchy, subtle, playful and pirated (if it is a word). With a change in attitude or mood, the music also adapts and adds to the entertainment and entertainment that the game offers. <br /> <br /> The whole idea behind Monkey Island is to solve puzzles and problems to move forward. It may sound easy, but is actually diabolical in many places. Some may be discouraged by the level of logic and mindset entering Monkey Island, but in fact making the game even more enjoyable and fun, adding the replay value as well. The option of "The Curse of Monkey Island" or "The Curse of Monkey Island: Mega-Monkey" (which involves more difficult and more abundant puzzles) suits players of all abilities and also gives good reason to play the game at least twice. Whatever level you choose, you are guaranteed a different game every time you play again, with many voice options and other puzzles to solve what does not affect the outcome of the game, but is just fun. The most entertaining part of the game is Ship Combat, and the sword "fight" that follows. These were particularly well thought out and make the game worthwhile. Add to this a great story that is non-violent and suitable for all ages that keep you connected and want more to the end. Finally, it must be concluded that a unique special mention must go to the designers of this game. The way each complex puzzle and problem is thought out is simply astonishing. While collecting stuff and items in the game, you can't see how each one should help you make progress, but with a little mindset and endurance solutions presenting themselves, CMI designers must be highly acclaimed. <br /> <br /> 10/10 for the best game I've ever played (not an exaggeration)
