This is one of my all-time favorite movies if you are not in cars then forget it !! This film contains 1 of Aussie's greatest muscle cars, XYGTHO. Yes, so the actor wasn't the greatest - it was never made to win an oscar. The car action will keep you back for more and more. There is a cool collection of muscle cars from the 70's and an Awesome '57 Chev - with a really cool cat drive it! There is also a really cool song by Terry Serio, the greatest actor. The play is quite fun when taken lightly, but the tire's smokin and draft are the main focus of this movie. Large fast cars with comfortable steel (NO PLASTIC CARS), and some nice street features. I only recommend it to people who are in cars and not someone who is looking for great plays.
