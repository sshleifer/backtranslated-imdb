The whole town of Blackstone is scared because they snorted Bret's brother Dixon - and he's coming back for revenge! At least that's what they think. A great Johnny Hallyday and a very interesting, early Mario Adorf star in this Italo-Western, of course appeared in the Alps. <br /> <br /> Bret Dixon returns to Blackstone to investigate why his brother was lynched. He is a lonely and puzzle couple of excellance, everyone is afraid of him - the Mexican bandits (fighting Gringos who took their country!) As well as the "decent" citizens who lynched Bret's brother. They lynched him because they thought he was stealing their money instead of bringing it to Dallas for the security of the bank there. But this is only half the truth that we find out during this psychologically interesting Western. <br /> <br /> But beware, it's a bit of a depressing movie, as everyone turns out to be guilty of some kind and certainly everyone is bad for the bone ... I've still had a lot and gave it an 8/10. Strange that only less than 5 people voted for this movie from January 12, 2002 ...
