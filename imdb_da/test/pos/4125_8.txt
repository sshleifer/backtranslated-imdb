I saw this (video 2000) years ago and would love to watch it on DVD. A good movie, but I would have loved it even more if it had included the legacy of The Beatles and The Hollies, etc. I also don't know how accurate the story is - were there any changes made to dramatize the story? <br /> <br /> I was only 3 when Buddy crashed and didn't wake up to his music until the late 70s. Much later I found out that our family moved into our new house - yes, February 3, 1959. Well, really small things you say and do ... His songs are always remembered - always ...
