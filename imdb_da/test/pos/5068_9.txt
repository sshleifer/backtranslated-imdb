Very good political thriller with regard to the pursuit of terrorism and the use of political torture to achieve one's goal of blowing up the terrorists. <br /> <br /> The story is interwoven, with two families being adversely affected by the terrorist acts. <Br /> <br /> This is one of Meryl Streep's best roles this year. She plays a cold, rainy, listed instructor for the CIA that allows these things to continue. She is out of the George Bush-Dick Cheney School to deal with the war on terrorism. Had her part been expanded, Miss Streep would surely have been at an Oscar time award. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is our hero. A CIA agent who really can't take what's going on. <br /> <br /> We have a terrorist who actually has a heart and it costs him his life in this orderly, fine-tuned movie. <br /> Alan Arkin appears briefly in that part of a connected senator. Mr. Arkin seems to be getting better with age.
