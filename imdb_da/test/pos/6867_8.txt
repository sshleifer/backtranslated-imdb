I was very curious about Anatomy (aka Anatomy) and if I were to see it, I had to buy it as there were no video stores in my area that brought the movie. Since it wasn't a cheap DVD, I took a chance and thought I'd look at other comments on IMDb. Many of the comments did not give me enough hope to throw lots of money into a movie I had never seen or had any traces. I basically got the idea that it was a sexy youth-oriented body that is compared to many cookie-cutter teen thrillers. Well, something in the back of my thoughts told me to ignore these types of comments and buy it! I did, and I was pleasantly surprised! <br /> <br /> If it is to be compared to other movies, I would say that it is a variation of Coma and Extreme Measures. I couldn't see any comparison with films like Scream, Urban Legends, et al. Yes, the throw is young (that's because they are fellow students! At least they are not the increasingly boring high school type characters), and yes, some are sneaky (basically Anna Loos is character, and it is handled quite tastefully in it German language version), but anatomy is well constructed, there is an exciting mood through, the sets are amazing, the makeup effects are a wow, and Franka Potente is very credible in her role. I found myself enjoying it all despite a few holes in the plot! The story of a student who discovers a kind of secret society doing autopsy on surviving patients is a pretty scary scenario, and what happens to those patients afterwards is pretty smart. Sure you could ask, why didn't she just get out of this city? Okay, but then the movie would be over in half an hour. <br /> <br /> This was the first effort of the German part of Columbia Pictures, and it's actually quite impressive. There was little care in the production and actually offering some genuine excitement is a feat. It is a little mature in mind, as it does not indicate constant opportunities for sexual encounters (a breast party) or youth medical jokes. Anna Loos' character, while often making sexual remarks and looking for fun, was actually a good mark - had a sign that was a woman more intelligent than any of the men in school. She found out that sex was really a distraction for her and the men were missing. The Important Thing: Watching this movie in the original German language with English or French subtitles is the best way to enjoy it. I saw the theatrical trailers dubbed in English and were disgusted by the change it made in the film's tone. I have never seen a proper dubbed movie in my life - they can never find voices that fit the movie's actors or characters. Sure enough, I tried to see some of Anatomy dubbed in English and the intelligence level of it fell seriously, making it seem more like a comedy. A good example is when a guy was freaked out by being cut and screaming to be sewn up again. Hear it in German, he sounded scary, but dubbed in English he sounded like a comedian. Frankly, I'm sick of hearing people say they can't handle reading subtitles or watching a "letterboxed" movie. Anatomy comes out as stupid with double voices that seem octaves too high for any of the people you see in the movie, and Anna Loos's sexual comments just sound like horrible remarks straight out of Fast Times At Ridgemont High. I wonder if the negative comments about anatomy are from people who looked at it, it just isn't called the same movie at all! This is not a cheap horror movie and deserves to be seen as it was created. Interesting to note that some of the English subtitles are different in scenes in the function and the "making of" supplement. As it turns out, I played and won with Anatomy. It is a competent thriller with sympathetic characters and tries not to go for cheap tensions.
