I put this movie in line on a whim after a recent trip to NYC and I couldn't believe I had never heard of it anywhere! It has every opportunity for a cult classic who starts with the characters. They are archetypal roles, we recognize from every single daily stretch, but became so nuanced and fully realized by the actors who played them (Peter Stormare and Bai Ling's performances were extremely strong). Their interactions are sharp and grounded while at the same time being filled with a subtle, quirky sense of humor that is unfortunately too rare in American movies these days. Writer / director Ramin Niami does a beautiful job of weaving these scenes together in a fun and moving portrait of a city of the past. Highly recommended!
