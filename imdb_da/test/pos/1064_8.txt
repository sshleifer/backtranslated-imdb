Make sure to make this lovely comedy part of your holiday season! If you admire Dennis Morgan or Barbara Stanwyck, this movie is a fun look. They work really well together as you would see in this movie. The whole cast was very entertaining. Since I'm a Dennis Morgan fan, this movie was a great experience! But ... everyone can enjoy it! Recommended!
