This movie is very long, but totally worth splitting for several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you're a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart pounding! :-) My mother is a civil war bird and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it from TV) for several more nights until we got through it all. We had every line of the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back and enjoy the action and romance. It's a great movie for those who like action, war, blood and gut, but also for those with a soft, romantic side. The clothes the women wore were GORGEOUS! Sometimes I think I was born in the wrong era, lol.
