A brilliant Sherlock Holmes adventure with the brilliant Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Despite many other actors brilliantly playing Holmes and Watson and doing a good job on it, Rathbone and Bruce will always be the best two. <br /> <br /> Holmes takes a Professor Tobell from Switzerland to London. Tobell is wanted by Nazi. He has a bomb sight that could win the Second World War. His bombing has been divided into four parts, each hidden in books. Tobell agrees to give his bombing to the British government. On the night after his arrival, Tobell goes to his girlfriend. He has drawn some men's figures if Tobell were to disappear, the lady was giving the drawings to Holmes. On his journey home, he is attacked, but a policeman stops this and the attacker runs away. Tobell is happy for the British government to use its bombing, but refuses to give it to Tobell's wants to take care of it. The Bomb site is divided into four parts, each part completely useless without the other. He gives part of each of these bomb sites to one of his scientist friends. Then Holme's biggest fear happens, Tobell goes away. Holmes visits the young lady Tobell was with the night he was attacked. She tells him about the drawings. The drawings have been stolen. She says that only one man came in at the time Tobell left to fix the light bulb. The man she describes is Professor Moriarty. He works for Nazi. Seen as he has the drawings, Holmes is made for. But he finds the writing pad he used and used science he manages to see what Tobell wrote by looking at the next page on the pillow. He sees it's code. He sees that is the name of four scientists. The first three, he works for the code, but he cannot train the fourth. The three scientists he has produced have been murdered and the bombing has been taken. Holmes cannot train the fourth scientist, but neither can Moriarty. Disguised as a sailor, Holmes manages to get into Moriarty's office. Moriarty immediately sees it's Holmes, puts him in a box and has him thrown into the sea. But Watson and Lestrade insist that they search the box and find Holmes in it. It is now obvious Moriarty is at large. Holmes is able to train the fourth code, a Frederick Hoffner. Holmes immediately comes to his house and gets Hoffner and the crucial fourth part for safety. Holmes must now get Moriarty charged to work with Nazi. He pretends to be Hoffner. Moriarty works out the fourth code and gets two men to walk around and get Hoffner. They take him back and he comes face to face with Moriarty. Meanwhile, Tobell is not in a good way he has been tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist. Moriarty has had it with Holmes now that he has got him and his death must be a long one for Holmes. The idea is to put him in his hospital, put a needle in his vein and watch him die from blood loss, drop-by-drop. Watson runs in and saves the day though. Moriarty gets away, but Holmes was just careless enough to leave Moriarty's trap door open. Moriarty sucks sixty feet. <br /> <br /> So Moriarty died. No. He makes his last trip in the movie 'The Woman in Green', but in 'Green' he is definitely dead, a suicide he jumps off his roof. It was Moriarty's second of three appearances in the Rathbone series, another actor who played him at each occasion. His first appearance in 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' was played by George Zucco, his second in this movie he was played by Lionell Atwill and Henry Daniels plays him in his last outing in 'The Woman in Green' The First Three Holmes Movies made by Universal was put into war as Holmes triumphs over Nazi. 'Terror Voice' was the first, saw this movie and then 'Sherlock Holmes In Washington'. Then it was back to Victorian times with certain connections to Edwardian and Georgian (George the fifth and sixth) times. This movie had a close link to Sherlock Holme's short story 'The Dancing Men', which can be found in 'The Return of Sherlock Holmes' A stunning movie, although blatantly propaganda, it was a glorious Holmes excursion.
