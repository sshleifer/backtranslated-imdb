Mel Brooks is a great writer, director and actor, but occasionally he can get a clinker. The beginning of this is almost just beginning to meet one character after another. You have Cary Elwes, who is charming and talented, but he can't make comedy. His expression in the camera shows that even he cannot believe in the inanities of the script. Richard Lewis looks bored and distracted through without much to do, and Amy Yasbeck is stuck in high school act fashion. Dave Chapelle shows great comedy range and hamming for the camera, and Mark Blankfield is mostly cattle in the blind man, but he still manages to show great comedy range. Eric Allen Kramer doesn't have much to do, but the few scenes he has are binding. The best roles are Roger Rees, Tracy Ullman, Megan Cavanaugh and Brooks for when he looks. Dom DeLuise has a fun ride as a Mafia Don who uses a Clint Eastwood lookalike, but on the minus side, some of the jokes are not so funny, while some of the really fun ones seem stolen by Mel's other movies.
