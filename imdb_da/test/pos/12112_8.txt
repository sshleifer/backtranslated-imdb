"Buffalo Bill, Hero of the Far West" director Mario Costa's spooky Spaghetti Western "The Beast" with Klaus Kinski could only be produced in Europe. Hollywood would never dare have made a Western about a sexual predator on prowl as the protagonist of a movie. Remember that Kinski is ideal for the role of 'Crazy' Johnny. He plays a person completely without sympathy, ironically dressed from head to toe in a white dress, pants and hat. This low-budget oater has nothing appetizing about it. The typically breathtaking Spanish nature around Almeria is not in evidence. Instead, Costa and his director of photography put Luciano Trasatti, who shot another Kinski Western "And God said to Cain", this horse opera in pretty everyday surroundings around Tor Caldara, Lazio, Italy and Monte Gelato Falls, the Treja River, Lazio, Italy. Nevertheless, "The Beast" qualifies as a continental Western because it deals with completely unscrupulous characters, and the action can be classified as film noir because the hero and heroine are trapped by intolerable circumstances that force them to resort to criminal activities . Predictably, their well-chosen plans plan to largely depend on the Kinski character. In fact, the equal Kinski character resembles a Wily E. Coyote type character. Consistently, he struggles to have sex with several beautiful women, but either lawmakers or crimes frustrate their efforts. In the end, "The Beast" constitutes a tragic character study with irony. The Stelvio Cipriani orchestra track sounds like it was lifted by Tony Anthony Western "The Stranger Returns." The Mario Costa play takes place on the western border between San Diego and Mexico, which is being terrorized by an infamous Mexican bandit called Machete (Giovanni Pallavicino of "We Still Kill the Old Way") and his gang. They offer stagecoach and no one is safe because of their extortion. The first time we see 'Crazy' Johnny Laster he pauses to update himself by a stream and tracks a beautiful looking woman who washes clothes. He creeps up behind her and attacks her, but a larger man armed with a rifle enters and he has to flee. He appears in a nearby town, and a sniper player recruits him to help prevent a wealthy man, Mr. Powers, on the path and rob him. They turn up and kill him and get no money. Mr. Snuff-Sniffer accidentally leaves his coffin at the crime scene and in the sheriff's arrest with suspected murder. 'Crazy' shoots his accomplice from his hotel room so he doesn't have to worry about being involved in the crime. Meanwhile, a young couple in love has trouble making their way into the world. Riccardo (Steven Tedd from "Requiem for a Bounty Killer") lives a Mexican couple at their ranch and helps them travel their real son Juan. In the village Riccardo's lovely girlfriend Juanita (Gabriella Giorgelli from "Stranger in Sacramento") sings and dances in the canteen. Riccardo and Juanita are planning to marry, but the last place Juanita wants to settle down is on a dusty ranch. She dreams of living in the city, but life in the city requires more money than either Riccardo or she has. They go along with a blonde ban name Glen (Paolo Casella of "Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead") and they plan to kidnap Mr. Powers daughter Nancy, when she comes to get her inheritance. Glen makes the lethal mistake by acquiring 'Crazy' Johnny to help them because Glen knows Johnny needs the money to get women. <br /> <br /> They abduct Powers' daughter and keep her at a remote cabin with Johnny standing guard over her. However, Juanita masks as Powers' daughter and appears in the city to get the money from Powers lawyer Gary Pinkerton (Giuliano Raffaelli of "Blood and Black Lace"), but he becomes suspicious because Juanita doesn't see anything he remembered Nancy. Riccardo brandishes his six-gun and warns Pinkerton that they have kidnapped Nancy. Unfortunately for Riccardo and Juanita, Pinkerton can only put his hands at $ 50 thousand because Machete has hit such fears in everyone's hearts that the overall legacy of power cannot be passed through the territory of stagecoach. Meanwhile, the swollen Johnny tries to rip Nancy back, but she knocks him out, knows him with a chair at the expense of having to be alone while she is dressing up. When she knocks him unconsciously, she steals a buggy and drives it back to the city. Johnny recovers, pursues her, and kills her that Glen, Riccardo, Juanita and Pinkerton meet him on track. They inform Johnny about the complications created by Machete's terrorist attack and give him $ 12,000 as his cut of money. Pinkerton is horrified at the sight of Nancy's blood-like body and threatens Johnny. Of course Johnny kills him in cold blood on the spot. <br /> <br /> Things are really getting worse as the San Diego law sets out to capture Machete. Glen, Riccardo and Juanita return to Mexico, while Johnny attacks two women on a ranch and doesn't get narrowly caught. He rides to Mexico, finds a cantinahore and goes down on her when a bounty shoots a revolver in his face. Johnny admits that he knows where to find more money if they want to release him. Machete men follow up on Johnny's tip and catch Juanita. The villages join Riccardo to attack Machete, and Johnny saves Juanita, but she later dies after a big shootout. Riccardo is now alone. Machete and his men retaliated against their step-parents, not only killing them, but also little Juan. Everything Riccardo and Juanita dreamed of having, goes up into the cloud's smoke smoke for an unhappy ending. "Crazy" Johnny dies and never falsifies his desire. If you think of Costa's uncompromising sagebrush, "The Beast" emerges as an interesting character study and an exercise in film noir in a Western setting where everyone is punished.
