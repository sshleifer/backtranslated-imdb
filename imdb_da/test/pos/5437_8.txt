In fact, I will admit that I am a political junkie, so this is reasoned with me, but Mrs Green's erratic character (yes I know what they did to her), but the end was such a copout and completely incompatible with the film itself. Why can't Barry L and crew just leave us, wondering what he would do? Let's discuss it. <br /> <br /> Instead, they have this "Oh, I'm not worthy" Bullshit ends and it just shows that when the chips were down, it is better to leave the table instead of doubling. Stop Disney ending and putting a bow on it. Life is not easy, they should have had the courage to give the protagonist some backbone. We had to listen to the rhetoric of the whole movie ... and then it became sniveling and the stupid, inane behavior of Mrs. green (since crap was out of her system) just made for a ridiculously close end of the movie that was icing on the cake.
