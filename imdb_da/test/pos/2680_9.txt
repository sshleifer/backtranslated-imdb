"KING OF QUEENS", in my opinion, is a pure CBS hit! Despite the fact that I have never seen each episode, I still enjoy it a lot. For that reason, it is difficult for me to say which episode my favorite is. Still, I have to say that CBS really knows how to make a good sitcom. Before I unpack it, I would like to say that everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well-designed, and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, if this show continues in syndication when it goes out of CBS, I strongly recommend that you catch it only if it goes well into the air.
