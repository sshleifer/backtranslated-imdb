As a big fan of Hammer Studios and enthusiastic guards of their gothic horror movies, I wonder what took me so long to start watching their TV series "Hammer House of Horror", which only ran for a 1980 season Now that I have seen the first four episodes of the show, I can say that it easily meets my expectations so far. While this first episode "Witching Time" may not be the most imaginative Horror story ever told, and not entirely delivering the gorgeous Gothic atmosphere that I love Hammers movies from the 50s to 70s, does it Undoubtedly, telling surprisingly eerie narrative and creating some real creepiness within fifty minutes. Movie composer David Winter (Jon Finch) is afflicted by the 17th-century witch Lucinda (Patricia Quinn) ... While the story may be simple, but for a lifetime of less than an hour, it is effective and delivers many scary moments. Northern Ireland actress Patricia Quinn, probably best known for her role in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" (1975) and the stunning Monty Python comedy "Monty Python's Life of Life" (1983), is wonderfully vicious in her role as a fit her like a glove. Jon Finch is also quite good as David, and although Prunella Gee, who plays her incredible actress wife, may not be the best actress ever, she is absolutely nice to look at. The section is accompanied by a good score that plays well with the atmosphere. Overall, "Witching Time" is a very entertaining episode with several truly eerie moments and decent opening to the series.
