It was easy to dismiss this movie as hyperbolt at the time of its release. Fonda, Douglas and Lemmon were known as "lefties", but the accident at Three Mle Island shocked the fictional drama. <br /> <br /> This movie works on many levels and shoots on both public and television news. 1979 was drawn by the infamous "Happy Talk" format of television news (see also "Ron Burgundy") and it is here on display in all its glory. The anonymous anchor merely reads a story of a "grinding on the main collision" before pleasingly introducing Kimberley Wells (Fonda), making a story about a veterinarian doing house (or is it "aquarium?"). The show's producer and station manager argue for the content - or lack thereof - behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> There are a few technical flaws. The PR flat (James Hampton) shows Fonda and Douglas the necessary scale model of a pressurized water reactor plant built by Westinghouse. Later, when Lemmon and Wilford Brimley (nicely playing Lemmon's friend / colleague caught between duty and loyalty) fight a sudden crisis in the plant's control room, they naturally run a boiling waterworks (built by GE.) A small point, but curious, of how many details the screenwriters got right. <br /> <br /> Like any good drama, the film asks more questions than it answers. The real accident on TMI shows the film's basic premise. The movie title was originally "Power" and you want to see why. Since nuclear power is preparing to come back these days with $ 3, "Chinese syndrome" is just as relevant today as over 25 years ago.
