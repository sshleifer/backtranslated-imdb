I think this TV movie was first broadcast the same week that Manchester Utd played in the Champions League final (1999), they run many soccer-related topics that week and this was an absolute standout. <br /> <br /> It played on all the cliches that are combed out every season in the FA Cup, ie. cool underdogs, lucky clothes / mascots, name of the cup, etc. And turned out to be great fun. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised it has never been repeated prior to other major soccer occasions, even now with the World Cup going straight. <br /> <br /> A few previous non-football fans have said they still love it, but a football fan will find the fun imho.
