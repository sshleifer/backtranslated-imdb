After all these years, by Peter O'Tool's brilliant precious release of his Soul, movie by movie, Hollywood recently struck him an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Country Dance appeared one night late and of course I blew myself out of my complaining niche in my alleged "Life". How does he do that? <br /> <br /> Again, York is brilliant in this kind of play. Both psychological battles loaded to bear .... Bravo to writer, instructor, cast and camera crew. No wonder the Nazis are lost in these Irish, Scottish, English blends .... brutal honesty hurts ... back in the 70s when I personally believed "honesty" was pure and absolutely vital to trust. I have changed my edgy extremes and will settle more human, hot mistakes in myself and others. Forgiveness enables humanity to have a reverse gear and allows us to correct our own bullied egos and erotic mistakes.
