We stumbled across this show on a Sunday morning at 6:30 am as you flip through all the cable channels and it turned out to be the best show on! It is absolutely sweet. We need to look like that for children (and adults, since I'm certainly far beyond my childhood years.) As one of the other comments pointed out, this has benefited from the simplicity of the character and stories. The dolls are wonderfully cute, the backgrounds are colorful, and even though they are made of cardboard, foam, paint and pure imagination, they remind us of our own childhood as we could spend the day in our own grandmother and explore the world around us. For those who were never lucky enough to have a grandmother as beautiful as Nana, this show is for you to make up for lost time! This show is a true inspiration and filled with wisdom and humor and just fun for children and adults alike. In other words, don't overlook this show just because you're over three years old! Spend half an hour with Mona, Nana, Mr. Wooka and Russell, they become friends, you look forward to seeing!
