I have no words to really describe this series. The premise behind this concept (a very hyperactive girl with a very eccentric personality who ends up blowing a team of oddballs into her own conception of the world, which after all was a creation of Haruhi, as she wants a world of foreigners, espers and time travelers) is a fresh breath in a world rides with repetitive anime series and non-innovative TV shows. <br /> <br /> Signs are well developed and you will end up loving them, some less than others. The word to describe the animation job does not exist, as "excellent" would really be short to describe how it was done. There are many fun situations that either make you smile or put you in deep thoughts. Don't get the impression of the first episode as it is only the tip of the iceberg as the Romans do not yet come. <br /> <br /> The only problem comes because of the lack of chronological order in episodes, but you can solve that problem, no? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Undoubtedly, one of the best series from 2006.
