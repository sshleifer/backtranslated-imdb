I loved this movie, I saw it when I was about 8 years old and almost seven years later, tonight I saw it again. I really thought it had an interesting idea, the only ones that disturbed me were the end, which I felt was a policeman. 'Round here is hard to find this movie, and I was lucky enough to have seen it at BRAVO. I also expected to see more Drew Barrymore here too!
