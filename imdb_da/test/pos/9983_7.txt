Disney's Buena Vista Pictures presents a wonderfully told fact-based sports drama directed by actor Bill Paxton. Photography is amazing, but the story sometimes lumbers together. This film is about 20-year-old amateur golfer Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) and his competition in 1913 U.S. Open. What story; a chance for a presumably inappropriate young man to play with the best golfers of the time, including British masters Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) and Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus). A history book ends leaving a knot in the throat. Cast is also: Peter Firth, Elias Koteas, Marnie McPhail, Robin Wilcox, and possibly stealing the show are Josh Flitter who plays Eddie Lowery, Ouimet's caddy and best friend.
