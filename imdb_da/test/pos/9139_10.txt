Not having seen this movie for some time, we caught it not long ago in the nicely transmitted Criterion DVD. "Le cercle rouge" is a film that owes much to other films, as it reminds us of "Rififi", "The Asphalt Jungle", among other things because they all deal with hijackers who take center stage in the film and reproduce it in great detail. Unfortunately, you know the old saying that crime does not pay, and from the beginning these men are involved in the sentence from the beginning. Jean-Pierre Melville was the director of few words. He didn't fill his pictures with a lot of dialogue, as is the case here. But to be "talky" they had their own style as shown by "Le Dolous", "Le Samurai" and his masterpiece, "Bob le flambeur", among others. Mr. Melville had a sense of style coming across in everything he did. In this film, he, along with his film photographer Henri Decae, takes us together for a tour through Paris' streets, showing the vibrant city mainly at night and the gloomy winter in France. The score is by Eric Demarsan, who emphasizes a jazzy music that accompanies most of the action. <br /> <br /> Though the movie shows Alain Delon, like Corey, in the midst of the action, it is the wise inspector Mattei who is the real hero in the movie. As played by the great Bourvil, he is a man who shows a lot of patience because from the beginning he has found out how to catch Vogel, and in the process he becomes involved in the exploration of the jewel, where he knows the escaped man He is the rear loom large behind it. Bourvil gives an extremely satisfying performance as Matti shows equal parts of determination and tenderness as is the case with the three cats he loves. Alain Delon always responded with interesting performances, such as his appearance in Mellille's images. Here he is Corey, the man who has first gone from prison and promising himself, he will not go back, but he can not take good care when he decides to continue and participate in the robbery. His connection to Vogel and Jansen pays off in the way they get the job done, but it will also show a mistake in the way they will not be able to remedy the foliage as the fence they have invoked has a change of the heart. <br /> <br /> Gian Maria Volonte and Yves Montand are seen as Vogel and Jansen respectively. They were excellent actors who blend well into the film's action. Both actors were at their best moment as they took the role of the movie and it shows. Mr. Montand has the more complex character to play as we witness in his first moment in front of the camera as a man with many demons inside his head. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pierre Mellville got amazing results from his cast and crew in a movie that even feels a little longer, but still manages to show his style in one of the most memorable images from the director.
