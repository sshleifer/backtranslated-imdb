Beyond Rangoon is one of the most emotional and intense movies ever made. Superbly directed by John Boorman, and intensively traded by Patricia Arquette, this movie can easily be called one of the best films from the 90s. The story and the living characters just take the audience from the opening itself and never let go. After watching the movie, the viewer will never forget "Beyond Rangoon". The film made some money at the ticket office, and is a little known, but should be highly profiled. When you see it, you can tell that it was supposed to be seen by a large audience. It is a very important and moving movie and should be seen by everyone. <br /> <br />
