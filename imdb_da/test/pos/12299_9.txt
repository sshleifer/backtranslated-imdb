A rare exception to the rule that great literature creates disappointing films, John Houston's good-bye to life and the movies, is almost entirely true to the story and spirit of James Joyce's short story, an expensive meditation of love, death and time expressed in events in a twelfth night party in the middle class Dublin approx. 1910. Unsurprising as the material may appear, the film succeeds in its willingness to tell the story in its own quiet, seemingly inconsistent terms rather than forcing a conventional film form of plot points and dramatic events on it. Only once is the wrong note beaten when old Miss Julia (a trained singer and music teacher whose voice should have been cracked aged, not crushed) sings so hard that the audience burst out when I saw this at the cinema. Fortunately, the mood of the foam and gently melancholy is restored in plenty of time at the moment with revelation between the couple Gabriel and Gretta Conroy in a hotel room that snow begins to fall outside. It's a sad story I suppose, but the kind that leaves you feeling better, not blue. Especially recommended as a dating movie - for people in love who are not afraid to confront the sweetness and sorrow of life.
