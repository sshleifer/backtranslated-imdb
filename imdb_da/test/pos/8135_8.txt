Below was an idea succeeded during the "golden days" of the films that you could bet on your bottom dollar that it would repeat; Although "Reworking" is the term used. Of course, one can argue that this reworking business has never left us, for success in film or television always leads to a trend; with all competing parties who dare to come up with their own version of that hit movie or TV show. <br /> <br /> for this last premise, we strongly disagree; for this is copying or plagiarism, clean and simple. <br /> <br /> THIS, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, must have been quite well received; ANGORA LOVE (Hal Roach / MGM, 1929) was reworked on Roach Lot, not once, but twice over the next three years. We were treated to LOW GRAVY (Roach / MGM, 1931), where the goat was replaced with a cute little puppy dog. The weather has also been transformed into the death of winter in the middle of a snowstorm. They also made other line-up changes to replace homeowner Edgar Kennedy with homeowner Charlie Hall. The second recast of the hidden animal presentation is 3 Reeler, The CHIMP (Roach / MGM, 1932), which replaced a female monkey from a dissolved and wounded circus, which Stan and Babe were former employees. The circus paid their employees their assets, and the boys received the chimps as their final payday. <br /> <br /> BACK to our original 'victim', today's topic, ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? The short starter simply enough. The boys encounter the goats on the street and the nanny returns them to their room; after Stan feeds a donut to her. The comic moments that follow are generated by the interaction between L&H and slow-burn exponent, Edgar Kennedy, their homeowner. The impact of the incident is enhanced by the interaction taking place at night. And as luck would have it; their room is located directly over the landlord's neighborhood. <br /> <br /> In addition to noise, the goats' bathing, smell and landlord Edgar's suspicions that Laurel & Hardy have another person illegally in the room; We were most amused by a small throw-away gag, which may have been missed by the censors. While mounting boys about the noise they had made and reminding them of the house, the rules of any unauthorized person are in there overnight, regardless of their gender. ITS camera shots are made from within the Boy's room over their shoulder. With Edgar in the hall and turning them, he warns; "Remember, this is a respectable establishment!" Just as he says this, a lady dressed in evening wear clothing across and behind the landlord; followed by a uniformed sailor who roams his hat forward when passing! POODLE SCHNITZ !!
