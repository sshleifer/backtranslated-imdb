First, I'm American - I haven't seen any comments on IMDb about this series from an American viewer. Secondly, I work in the television business in development. So I wake up in much of the slam that comes out of American broadcast programming. "Unit One" is an example of television that is a recall of what I would assign as "70s-style scripting, feature-wise. Especially the movies made by young autueurs who had free clothes to get the dramas To feel more realistic and allow for ecological character development, it sticks more in step with the stellar British dramas such as "Cracker" and "Prime Suspect" as well as Australia's brilliant "Underbelly." "Unity One" contains independent cases that are committed and then resolved every week, the secrets are not extraordinary or especially Byzantine, they usually center around a single twist, time generally in 40 minutes of mark, and the solution is nicely wrapped for the 15 minutes thereafter. contains main characters that you are hooked on and finds relatable of episode 2. These are real, breathing, live characters that have personal luggage, but it is not a talky, batty type of luggage on the United States English flotsam like "Grey's Anatomy" or "Desperate Housewives" spares. These are realistic people whose backstories unfold leisurely during the series as if you're working with them daily. After the thoughtless decade of "CSI's", "NCIS's" and "Criminal Minds", along with their subsequent spawns, it is refreshing to actually sit down to see friends you want to spend time with, as is the case with "Unit" One ". "The creepy teasing, the unemotional tree dialogue and the overall danger that the American series I mentioned every day are invisible to the nuance and the silent resonance you get with this remarkable Danish series. I am on episode 7 in the first season, but I've already bought all four seasons and are in the long haul, if you need explosions and dangerous jump testosterone along with music from The Who and fast-paced, neon-lit, jittery pals-cam action with cipher-like main characters As your main diet of TV drama show, I suggest you stay away from this series, if you are an adult with a hunger for subtle, exciting, thought-provoking and, indeed, sometimes progressive crime dramas, I encourage you to check this show .
