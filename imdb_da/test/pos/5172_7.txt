Although I had never seen or heard about Georgetown, CO, it would be a cute little movie. But my father was born and raised there, and it is my uncle's horses that you see pulling the sledge! So this movie is very special to me. Much of the interior is shot in buildings and houses that I recognize and are very realistic. The story is a little hokey, but Georgetown is the kind of magical place where things like it could happen. John Denver was a better actor than many people give him credit for. Mary Wickes plays that kind of "sensible lady with a lot of stuff", she played so well in many other movies, especially "White Christmas". I usually won't go out there in the winter, so I like to watch this movie at Christmas time to "tide me over" for my next trip!
