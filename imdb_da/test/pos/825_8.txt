After 10 years, it is finally safe to say that our Belgian Action Star is back again. I personally found this to be even better than Wake Of Death, making it his best movie in ... 10 years !! Okay, it's not his highlight year like Timecop, Universal Soldier, Sudden Death or even his best bet to date: Hard Target (one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors John Woo.) The action is good, the story is exciting, the dialogue is quite fun, one is better than expected. The evil ones are awesome as in Hard Target, and the battle scenes are "old school". Real fans know what to expect. I must say I gave him up, but Van Damme is finally back. More, thank you ....
