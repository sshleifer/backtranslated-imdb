I have a completely prestigious point of view primarily because I live and enjoy the lifestyle of the club culture. Being a DJ and frequent club go I see honesty in this movie and I love it. If you do not know the club / rave culture, it will be a good foray in the culture of anyone who does not know the first hand. The honest portrayal of human emotions and problems in that part of Jip I loved. The signs were well constructed and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I really don't enjoy the fact that you have to write ten lines on this site. I want to write at least 6 or 7, but I feel I can portray my point with fewer than ten. Here are some extra lines to make IMDb the gods happy.
