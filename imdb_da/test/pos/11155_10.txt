While I agree this was a 1950's sitcom, I didn't feel it was "typical". First, Donna Reed was a strong woman, unlike the regular 50's sitcom VAT. She enabled women's dignity and equality (remember the episode where the TV show says "just a housewife") and Donna stand up for all women to do and represent, especially those who do not work outside the home? And when the women rebelled against something in the series, it was nothing trivial ... it was always something to show that women are entitled to be treated with the same respect as men. Remember that Donna Reed was married to the show's producer, so she had much more input to make her a stronger character. <br /> <br /> The kids were intelligent but not precarious. They were normal kids. And they could ACT. <br /> <br /> Something else that made the Donna Reed Show stand out was not only that the kids looked like their parents, but one could feel the chain between all the actors in the real life situation, which then came out in the characters. Shelly Fabares and Paul Peterson have often written and remarked that they were treated like the children of Donna Reed and Carl Betz, and that the adults were very protective of the child's actors and treated them accordingly. Donna and Alex also had some of a sexual chemistry that was not seen on the other family exhibitions. And the characters could be flawed, and in great ways, yet accepted for errors and errors. These were not super-parents who did nothing wrong and had no emotional heights and lows. They were normal people like normal people. <br /> <br /> Women's rights, substance abuse, child abuse, single fathers, poverty, children in need of good health care, but can't afford it ... it was all shown on this show. Pretty groundbreaking for the era. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed Vis didn't last for eight years without a reason. And it might have been expelled if it hadn't been for Tony Owens and Donna Reed's divorce. <br /> <br /> This show is heavily underestimated and must be displayed so that other generations can appreciate quality. <br /> In summary, I agree with the original poster, which obviously cares about the show, but I think the Donna Reed show has so much more to offer than casual entertainment.
