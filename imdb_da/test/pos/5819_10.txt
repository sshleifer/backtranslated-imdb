I feel like I know these people and have known people who are similar to them. These days, however, people are barred from showing such passion for something especially love and loneliness. It has a slow start, but then look out! If you love romantic comedies, but would like to see someone who had some foundation in reality for a change {or at least had back in the 70s} then you should watch this movie!
