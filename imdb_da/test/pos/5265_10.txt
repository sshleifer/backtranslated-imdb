As a veteran screen writing instructor at Richland College in Dallas and a former MGM screenwriter back in the days of decent movies, I am thrilled to have accidentally clicked on Channel 33 in Dallas tonight and saw this enchanting movie where Betty White is GORGEOUS and longing for the good old days with great movies before Hollywood began slamming all this stuff for teenagers. If a producer listens, I'd like to say that there are plenty of us over 60 who will happily pay a buck to watch a movie that has no weapons, no kills, no special effects, no sex and violence and just a good touching tale of human relationships that leaves you with a good warm feeling that this movie did for me.
