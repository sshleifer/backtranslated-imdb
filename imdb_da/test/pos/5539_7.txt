If you are looking for a not so serious mob, with a woman as a leader, you are in the right place. Pfieffer has acted much better than this. You can see she has matured beyond this picture. <br /> <br /> When I first picked up this movie, I expected Pfeiffer to be badly mistaken, but she played her mob wife role to the hilt. Not a bad achievement from Baldwin, either. <br /> <br /> If you don't watch your hair, you like this movie. But don't take it too seriously ...
