Personally, I think Kevin Spacey is one of the greatest players in his generation, perhaps the greatest. This, in combination with another great actor named Jeff Bridges, can't be bad. And that's exactly what this movie is! "K-PAX" is one of the most pleasant surprises in recent years. Initially, the film has an excellent written story. It is part of what makes the film so great. The other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the film is the actor. The combination Spacey-Bridges really works. <br /> <br /> This was the second time I saw the movie, and I'm sure it won't be the last time. "K-PAX" has everything. There are moments that are extremely fun, parts reminiscent of a true thriller and others reminiscent of high-class drama. I think this movie deserves a much higher rating and many more awards. Great film! <br /> <br /> 9/10
