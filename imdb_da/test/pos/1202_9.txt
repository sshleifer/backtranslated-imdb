The 1979 film musical of HAIR was loosely based on the infamous 1960's Broadway musical that became famous for its infamous nude scene. The scene musically is not much more than a group of sketches tied together with some funny songs; however, for the film director Milos Foreman (who won an Oscar to manage ONE FLEW OVER CUCKOO'S NEST) and the authors have taken the basic premise of the game and score and constructed a real story to make the show more "user-friendly" for the big screen. In the film, the naive court pillow Claude Hooper Buchowski (John Savage) will enter the army and decide to spend a few days in New York, where he meets a group of aging hippies (Treat Williams, Dorsey Wright, Annie Golden, Don Dacus), who Get him involved in a group of nutty misadventures, including the pursuit of a snooty community girl (Beverly D'Angelo). The story is divided into a number of vignettes ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime, but it is all gorgeously photographed with a clever use of NYC sites and imaginatively decorated music tracks (outstanding choreographed by the legendary Twyla Tharp). Treat Williams lights up on the screen as Berger, the unconventional and open-minded hippie who does his best to get Claude to loosen up and is matched scene by the scene of Savage as Claude, bringing a nice sweetness to Claude's role. Annie Golden is a charmer like Jeannie, the pregnant hippie who is pregnant by Wright or Dacus, does not know which is the father and does not seem to care about. There is an excellent musical number after the other here ... "Aquarius" is a trip through Central Park that includes dancing horses ... Treat Williams interferes with a fancy dinner party in "I have life" ... "Black boys / white boys "contains the late Nell Carter and Ellen Foley, who reinforce men's ethnic virtue and" Easy to be Hard "is a powerful rendition of one of the best songs in the show by the original cast member Cheryl Barnes, who plays Wright's ex. girlfriend and mother of her child. This is a beautifully photographed, well-behaved song and danced psychedelic acid tour of a movie to be seen and seen once, will launch more views as this dazzler has too much to offer to capture it all in one view.
