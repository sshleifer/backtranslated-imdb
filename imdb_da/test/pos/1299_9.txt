I was geared not to like this movie, and the first 10 minutes didn't do anything to remove my fears. It starts with 2 high school bands squaring against each other with poor kung-fu. A scenario exists in countless other Korean films. Ho-hum. Add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote "He Was Cool" (which was almost unacceptable) and I thought I was in an indescribable 2 hours. <br /> <br /> But don I don't give up so fast! "A romance of their own" was directed by Tae-gyun Kim, who also did "Volcano High" (which I thought was lots of fun). Anyway, "Romance of Their Own" will soon take a trip much for the better. A high school girl who has just moved to Seoul finds herself in the center of attention from two potential suitors. Each guy has his own profit and it is not clear which one (if it is) would be the right choice. What follows is not your usual teenage lack of value. The emotions are complex, and while you may not agree with certain choices or actions when the film evolves, you can certainly understand why the characters do them. <br /> <br /> The film questions the characters and the audience. Who chooses one? At what time is one obliged to choose (and is it unfair for one if it seems that he is excited)? When you (or your heart) have chosen a choice, how do you react (and how do you react) when new information shines new light on the situation? There is a scene near the end that is very subtle but captures perfectly what I think would be a real reaction instead of over-the-top "movie reaction." The subtlety is in a character in the background of the scene. Recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed. Basically he doesn't know what to do about things. Instead of getting him to "act" something or see all the mouth-worn dumbbells, he just stares at a certain time that can't react or say anything at all. It's as if someone just pulled the plug on him. His reaction was right on me, and I appreciated the scene. <br /> <br /> Like most Korean movies, there is a mix of action, bravado, slapstick and melodrama. Korean movies often take sudden turns (see "Sex is zero" for a good example), which can be a shock to the uninitiated. Go ahead and start yourself with this. Like it, love it or hate it, I think most viewers will be able to relate to and appreciate the character's actions and reactions.
