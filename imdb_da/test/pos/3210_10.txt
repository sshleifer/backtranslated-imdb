This show is truly amazing. It is smart. It is fun. It's amazing acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The dialogues are really fun and well-behaved. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a good chemistry. You really think they are mom and daughter. This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really do not have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends, but at the same time it turns out it's really hard sometimes to be more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily. Just watch this show, I highly recommend it. It's amazing and definitely the best show on the air. Season 7 stars Tuesday, September 26, 2006, 8 / 7c on the new The CW
