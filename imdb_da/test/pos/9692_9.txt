First of all, I want to say that most people who give this a bad review do not like this kind of comedy, the movie is great if you have an open mind and are not afraid to laugh at some stupid things. <Br /> <br /> This movie is shot like the television show with many short clips compiled into a long movie. Some of the scenes do not even have dialogue anyone just wants to come out and do something unexpected and it is fun !! The only negative I had, I felt I was wasting money on my Popcorn and Icee, there was no way I could eat or drink anything under this movie, I shot constantly. I was honestly nervous about drinking some ice cream and seeing something that made me laugh and shoot it everywhere. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind a male nudity and you enjoy the Jackass movie, the jackass TV show, and viva la bam, go to this movie. <br /> <br /> And if you don't like the first movie or TV show. Don't see it and if you see it, don't write a bad review about it. Hardcore Christians who see this and bash it just don't seem right to me.
