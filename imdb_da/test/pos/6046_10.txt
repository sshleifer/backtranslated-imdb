Hi there army I'm sorry, but being an SGT in the army and being in the Army National Guard doesn't make you qualified to comment on a marine movie. You're not a Marine, and just because you use a uniform doesn't mean you can relate to being a Marine. We are simply the best we have the hardest training, yes we have big heads about ourselves, but hi when you are the best, you like to starve your stuff. I was in the Iraq invasion and in Fallujah. I fought beside soldiers. You are not "qualified" to say anything about my Marine Corps. I hate being the one who starts the whole "which branch is better", but you have no right to say you are qualified to judge a marine movie. Oh yes ...... we are drill instructors ....... do not live SGT's. It's the biggest clue you have no idea what you're talking about. Yes we "curse" not on recruits anymore. Tell me how to cuss on someone who makes them a better Marine? How Do I Make Anyone Make a Marine a Better Marine? Yes, it's a children's boat camp from what I went through. But we have to deal with different times and people. We train people who are more smarter than our generations recruits. We want smarter recruits, don't mean. And anyone who signs up to be a Marine in the first place has a dedication to being the best his country has to offer. We do not need to strengthen it in Bootcamp. Marines come to Bootcamp, who wants to be killers. We don't have to teach them to demoralize them by beating them and beating them. At least that's how I feel. And yes, I'm "qualified" to say so. I have been on the battlefield many times and I have trained marines and recruits who eventually ended up in the battlefield. But then again, what do I know. I was just there, finished, got a t-shirt. Army SGT ....... get a clue!
