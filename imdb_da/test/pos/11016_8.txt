Because it is delayed and I run short on vocabulary, I will describe this movie as "beautiful and heartbreaking", begging the forgiveness of those associated with such clich√©s. Robin Tunney does a great job showing a young woman in the clutches of tourette's syndrome - her character was absolutely sincere and convincing, and I want to follow her career wherever it goes because of this movie.
