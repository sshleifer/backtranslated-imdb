Everyone knows that Lindburgh succeeded in the first transatlantic flight. So how can there be excitement or intrigue in this movie? Now there. Don't ask me, but there is. Partly because of the director's expert report on the story, but mostly because of Jimmy Stewart's thoroughly engaging performance, we are drawn into the story as if unfolding for the first time just before our eyes. Despite the fact that half of the film is filmed in a narrow cockpit, it is as dynamic as any action flicker out there. So if you're worried about watching this movie because you think you already know the story, give it a shot. I think you will be impressed.
