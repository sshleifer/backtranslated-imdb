A kind of guilty indulgence today, it was necessary to look at when I was in high school. It is really a great illumination of the growing punk scene in LA in 1980. As the tapes play, Spheeris prints the lyrics in subtitles, which of course is necessary if you really want to know what the guy is screaming in the microphone. But it also makes the camera's POV a tourist that passes through this alien world. Band interviews reveal an honest approach to the music that really doesn't exist anymore. So again it is not so easy to come up with $ 16 / month past church cabinets like Chavez of Black Flag do. How many unheard-of bands do you know that don't try as a dick to get a record deal? These guys just didn't use it. And who can't love the comment from the little French guy who used to be "singer" for Catholic discipline (of which Phranc was a member). His gritty voice delivers one of the best soliloquies ever caught on film: "I have good news for the world ... there's nothing like New Wave." Whew! What a relief!
