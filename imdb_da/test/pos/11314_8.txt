Before I saw this picture I was totally skeptical, I don't like movies with an agenda and I appreciate being afraid to think like the author. I was also worried that it would be like the 2-part mini-series "10.4" that had a very pronounced concept, little relation to the real world and very poor performance. Initially, it says: "This film is fiction, but the events are portrayed and the information on British emergency planning is based on extensive research"; And the general feeling is that you are not sold on an idea, but that you are taught a lesson in civil consciousness. The message being conveyed is obvious from the start: It comes and we are not prepared. The use of real places and a scenario that could not only happen - There are plans when it does - everything adds to the disturbing effect the movie will have on even the most cynical viewers. The film's perspective is society's society, and it stays away from heartbreaking personal moments that will not convey the message, so none of the romo-julietic drama we are used to.
