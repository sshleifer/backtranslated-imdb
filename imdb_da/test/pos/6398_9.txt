"My life and children" is, in my opinion, an absolute ABC classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. There are many episodes I enjoyed. One of them was where Junior (George O. Gore II) got his driver's license. If you want to know why, you should have seen it yourself. Before I unpack it, I would like to say that everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend you to catch it, just if it goes well into the air.
