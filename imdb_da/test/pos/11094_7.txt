In the film "The Falcon and the Snowman" when they showed Christopher Boyce around the complex, the satellite in the background was the actual Ryholite satellite that is now in space. TRW allowed internal shots. TRW also allowed both internal and external shots to one of the original Star Trek TV series. (The section is where Spock goes blind when a number of satellite lights are activated to kill foreigners). Christopher escaped from prison (Lompock) and was presented at America's Most Wanted. He drank in a bar when the show was sent. He said, "Hey, it's me." Needless to say, he was caught and transferred to a maximum security prison.
