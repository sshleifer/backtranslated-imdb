When I was in 7th grade (back in 1977) I was asked to read the novel, which was based on my English studies. I remember being very affected by it and excited when a television version came out a year later. <br /> <br /> Kristy McNichol was a popular television actress when this movie was produced and already played a daughter in a dysfunctional family on the hit television series "Family". It was clear that she had the reach and the ability to pull this part off. I remember her being a little "stiff" at times, but everywhere she does a good job. She wears the film well. Esther Rolle is great as the domestic, who seems to be the only one in the household who seems to really care for her. Barbara Barrie as the slightly frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good as the youngster is Robin Lively (who eventually should appear as the black widow Lana Milford in "Twin Peaks") as the sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus for the parents' love. Bruce Davidson is also appealing as the German soldier of the title <br /> <br /> The best achievement though is Michael Constantine. It is truly powerful and merits more recognition than it did at that time. The bitterness and coldness he expresses makes scenes where he seems hard to see, but makes it much easier to understand the desperate desperation of the rejected daughter. Constantine gives all the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations. <br /> <br /> The film differs only from the book in some small ways. It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope it will be released again for video or DVD. <br /> <br />
