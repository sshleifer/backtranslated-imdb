I saw Anatomy many years ago - called to a friend's house, I can't remember much, and so in the video store, there is another - not really related to the first, Franka Ponte makes a little cameo. And one was okay not as good as the first one. I see the first one again tonight - not called collectors edition. I really like German movies like this, it's very interesting, and people and cultures like the one in the movie I think I don't. But it is very rough and frightening. Anatomy 2 is slightly different, and the signs are not as good as the first. But if you really thought Anatomy was interesting and good, you should see the other.
