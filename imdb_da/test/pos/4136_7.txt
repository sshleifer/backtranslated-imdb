It would be unwise to judge that it is either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other. Both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality, as producers seek to reconstruct and tell stories in their perspectives. Since both formats usually leave some problems undiscussed because of the "complexity of subplots" and screen time, it refuses viewers the opportunity to open debates and further investigate and construct the real truth. The addition to the viewer's inability to evaluate sources (eg, comparisons with written history) and the logic behind the arguments, the story may be open to distortion through narrative and documentary. <br /> <br /> For most people, the documentaries can be seen more truthfully as it usually involves the testimony of actual participants and moving images. However, these images are selected and edited so that they can present their realism to the viewers. In The Real Buddy Holly Story, Paul McCartney seeks to establish Buddy Holly as remembered by family and friends, and how Buddy influenced the rest of the music world. The testimonies may have been distorted because memories may not be correct, and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of Buddy. The documentary made corrections to the movie version and covered other events as if there were 3 members of Crickets and that Buddy's music was actually heard outside the US at that time (he had to start a world tour!). But it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to Buddy's wife after his death. Criticism and / or negative discussions may have been excluded from the documentary film, as the producers are trying to present a buddy whom the world should have remembered. Eventually, we cannot succeed in building the whole truth, as we only confine ourselves to the earlier "realties" that the documentary tells us. <br /> <br /> Personally, I prefer a narrative movie because it provides rich visual images that help us reconnect to the collective memory of that era. It gives the audience a more constructive structure of the story, and this leads to better memory retention for the audience when they tell the story. There is also an element of flexibility that allows filmmakers to express their thoughts and views on specific issues. In The Buddy Holly Story, race issues were highlighted, and viewers can certainly relate to these issues in relation to current situations. Movie guests consistently seek to revise certain emotions when watching movies and using these feelings, the audience can choose to make personal connections with the meanings applied by a film producer. In most stories, people are more inclined to selectively remember the struggles, the inspirations, and the way history ends. Through Buddy Holly Story, we remember the games Buddy and Crickets had, how Mary had been a source of encouragement, and that Buddy Holly was a great performer until the day he dies.
