This is like something I've never seen before. It made me crack up all the time, I don't think there was a scene I didn't laugh at. It's about a girl from the country in the south, going out to a big city for college. At school she turns to RA across the hall. When she realizes that he has no family to go to Thanksgiving, she invites him to come home with her. Rabecca and her family and her serious girlfriend all go out for dinner one night, and Becca realizes what her boyfriend is doing ... Suggest. She calls on Cral to do something so he gets up and shouts something like ... Sorry, but you're too late I've already asked Becca to marry me a few weeks ago back to school and she said yes . It all turns into chaos. Please see this classic, it's totally worth it ... I swear.
