Although it may not be his most ridiculous movie, MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE stands as one of Charley Chase's most satisfying farce comedies, twenty minutes of clever synagogues, nicely choreographed physical comedy and entertaining quips (rendered by title cards, of course) all based on a crazy and wildly incomparable premise. We are told that this is "a story of domestic people - a wife with a face who would stop a clock - and her husband with a face who would start it again." Soon we will meet cock-tailed Charley Moose and his wife Vivien, who has a huge nose. But there is no point in discussing plausibility when our plot is linked to such an incredibly unbelievable number of coherent coincidences: First, Charley will get his bit over corrected the day his wife would have his nose fixed, second, that each spouse would keep their respective cosmetic operations secret from the other and third, that when they bumped into each other publicly afterwards, Charley and Vivien would not recognize each other. It sounds like a little stretch, right? Several stretches are more like that. Obviously we are in the farce world here and just have to roll with the stupid plots as long as you can relax and forget about the likelihood, you will probably enjoy this brief. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE, AS A MEETING goes for a leisurely start when the various complications of the story are established, but things pick up when Charley and Vivien have "met" and made a date to participate in a party together in the home of Charley's dentist. They rush home with joy and go in separately and are initially ignorant of each other's presence. (Mr. & Mrs. Moose seems to be quite wealthy, incidentally, when they live in a mansion, the size of a luxury hotel.) There is a beautifully timed sequence reminiscent of Buster Keaton's NAVIGATOR, where husband and wife dasher house without ever meeting face to face. And when they arrive at the party, comedy really comes to a high gear when Charley is forced to dance with Gawky Wallflower Gale Henry. Henry, an estimated player in himself, who was in many short comedies from 1914, is hilarious as the dance partner who brings great energy but a little grace to her dance. There is also an elegant cinematic touch in this order when the camera pounds down to show us only the shoes of Charley, Gale, Vivien and Vivien's dance partner, but we are able to follow exactly what happens between the principles of seeing their feet . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for Charley and Vivien, they are partying, raiding, and from there lacking the complications when they manage to escape from the police trainer and return home. When Charley realizes that his curious wife was trying to step out with another man, he solved a lesson separately. . . while of course he forgot he was trying to do the same. The last few minutes of this movie offer some of Chase's funniest physical comedy, covered in a good singing song for the battle line. MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE leaves the viewer with a warm glow, and certainly ranks with the most entertaining comedies produced by the productive, unfortunately underestimated Charley Chase.
