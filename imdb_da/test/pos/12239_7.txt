Early 80's creativity relates to a far-abandoned gold mine that some pristine miners are determined to check out. Of course, they don't find any gold down there, but a very hungry monster that slithers together after trying. <br /> <br /> While I must be honest and admit, I found it boring at first (I prefer the thematic "Boogens" thematically), it actually grew on me when it went together. Now the characters are not too interesting, nor the actors. Close to an interesting character is Morgan, played by Keith Hurt. In any case, female leader Terri Berland is very nice and Rolf Theison makes his dominant smoke an easy person to hate. The author is played by effects man Mark Sawicki carries thinly fast. It begins in a comfortably predictable way with a nighttime set piece where two victims are allegedly getting things to an acceptable start. The monster itself is exciting for its design (as you can imagine, it is revealed a little at a time until late in the game) and for the product of stop motion animation, as this process was no longer widely used. Director Melanie Anne Phillips (led by David Michael Hillman's pseudonym) and crew deserve some credit for their creation of atmosphere. They manage to make the film look quite claustrophobic and gloomy, and their use of lighting works well. The film is based on intensity against a fairly good ending. Suffice it to say that they do the best they can on their low budget. <br /> <br /> An unclear little item worth looking for deadly horror buffs. <br /> <br /> 7/10
