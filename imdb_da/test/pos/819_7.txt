Crack House (1989) was one of the few films during the 80s that fall into this genre. What was supposed to be an anti-drug film turned out to be nothing more than a white exploitation exercise in depravity. However, there is nothing wrong with that. The video presentation itself has an anti-drug message from one of the stars in the show Richard "turncoat" Roundtree, <br /> <br /> The film follows two young lovers in high school. One of them is a quasi hard guy and the other is his girl. One of them is expelled by a common friend, while the other gets a trip to the slam and later gets the chance to get back to his former friends. Jim Brown appears as the movie's "Mister Big", he is a poor guy who can still punk-out someone and is a very sadistic guy who likes to beat his picks and turn tar out of those trying to hesitate his word . Luke from General Hospital also makes a guest star. <br /> <br /> If you like hard edge slip, then this movie is for you. Unfortunately, Hollywood does not make these more, and when they do, it is neither exploitative nor entertaining. <br /> <br /> Recommended for sleaze fans.
