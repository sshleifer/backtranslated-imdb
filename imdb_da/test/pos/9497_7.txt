I found this movie to be full of irony. But watching the movie you can almost see what will happen. Leila is a confused boring housewife who constantly seeks happiness. When she thinks she finds true happiness, she clings to it and leaves everything she knew. But she finds herself almost comparing notes between her ex and her current husband. She learned that if she had only communicated more about what had bothered her in her previous marriage, it could have been much easier for her to have it. She realizes that words are nothing without action, but she learns too far into her second marriage and finds herself looking back and hoping for change again. The main conflict in this movie is Leila vs himself. You can't have true happiness with yourself being really happy. I liked this movie, but I would only recommend this movie to women, I can't see a man really enjoying the movie.
