I was part of the Space Odyssey draft that played FIDO in mission control. I just want to say that none of us actors, especially those in mission control who had to react to a green screen for the most part, had an idea of ​​how amazing it would be. I knew it would be good if it were just for the sheer companionship and professionalism that the Impossible Pictures production team gave everyone involved. but as we all saw the first time on the screening at Curzon Mayfair, well, I felt for a very proud. I was so happy that none of us looked like we were in Star Trek. Joe Aherne, scriptwriter and director, is the most amazing man to work for. He gets a good team together, and therefore trusts them implicitly to do what they do best. I'm really lucky to have been part of this show. Who knew anything that this epic and complicated understanding would turn out to be so enticing to see. and my god it's a beautiful universe out there.
