The year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon; two rival Bond films. "Octopussy", starring Roger Moore, was part of the official Cubby Broccoli Bond franchise. "Never say never again", made by a rival producer, is the only Bond movie that is not part of that franchise, except for the terrible "Casino Royale". The big attraction was that it brought back the original Bond, Sean Connery; its title is derived from Connery's commentary on "Diamonds Are Forever" that he would never again play the role. Some have complained that Connery was 53 years old for the role, but he was actually three years younger than his successor Moore, who not only made "Octopussy" that year, but continued to make another Bond movie, "A View to a Kill, two years later. <br /> <br /> The film owes its existence to resolving a lawsuit on the rights of Ian Fleming's work. Perhaps it is unfortunate that the terms of the settlement contained a clause stating that the new movie should be a remake of "Thunderball" as it might not be the largest of Connery Bonds. (A remake of "Dr No" or "Goldfinger" may have worked better). The reason is much the same as the previous movie; The terrorist organization SPECTER, along with a megalomaniac tycoon named Largo, has stolen two US nuclear weapons and is trying to ransom the world's governments by threatening to detonate them unless they receive a large sum of money. Of course it is for Bond to save the world by tracking the missile missiles. <br /> <br /> The movie is fortunate because it not only has one of the most beautiful Bond girls of all, Barbara Carrera as the seductive but mortal Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger as Largo's girlfriend Domino, who defective Bond's side after learning about his lover's evil plans. A number of Bond films have a plot that depends on the hero's ability to win over the villains' mistress or female accomplice. There are similar developments, for example in "Goldfinger", "Live and Let Die" and "The Living Daylights". In the official series, Bond's allies are usually regarded as the female leader, but here is Carrera, who plays the villain, billed over Basinger, who was a relatively unknown actress at the time. Of course, Basinger has become one of Hollywood's greatest stars, while Carrera is one of a number of Bond girls who have slightly faded from the show. <br /> <br /> Of the bad guys, Max von Sydow makes an effective Blofeld, leader of SPECTER, but Klaus Maria Brandauer seemed too much and non-threatening as Largo, except perhaps during the "Domination" game, a more sophisticated variant of the violent computer games such as "Space Invaders" that were so popular in the early eighties. Brandauer can be an excellent actor in his native German, in films like "Mephisto" and "Colonel Redl", but he does not come across so expressed in English. <br /> <br /> One of the features of the movie is that it follows both the normal Bond formula and differs from time to time. There are standard world-in-peril plots, chase sequences, a variety of exotic locations, glamorous women, spooky villains, and a specially written theme song based on the movie's title. However, there is no extended pre-circle sequence and we see some known signs in a new light. For example, Bonds boss M becomes a blunt, super-weary aristocrat. His American colleague Felix Leiter is shown as black for the only time, and researcher Q is portrayed by Alec McCowen as a disillusioned cynic with (despite his characteristic upper class Christian name of Algernon) a distinctly working class accent. There is also an entertaining cameo from Rowan Atkinson as a bumbling British diplomat. Although Connery might not be a good one here when he was in some of his former films in the role, this ringing makes the changes to the well-known theme this to the most memorable bonds. 7/10 <br /> <br /> And goof. Rowan Atkinson character says he is from the British Embassy in Nassau. As the Bahamas is a Commonwealth country, Britain would have a high commission in the capital, not an embassy.
