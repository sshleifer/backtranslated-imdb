This film does an excellent job of taking us all the way through the dark tunnel of espionage, from the beginning through the ultimate bill. The film's impact is made even deeper with the realization that it is based on a true story. Timothy Hutton gives us a quality, underestimated performance, and Sean Penn demonstrates why he is one of America's finest living actors. As with "Midnight Express", this movie should make us think twice about doing something we should not do in a foreign country.
