wow! I just have to say that this show is super cool! I fell in love with the show from the start! The idea of ​​the show is very original and very calming! It is also a pleasure to watch the show the two lovely leading ladies, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they are simply wonderful! I am especially a great admirer of Lauren Graham! She is not just a beautiful face, she is also a "monster" of an actress! I'm not saying that Alexis is not a wonderful actress too ... I happen to like Lauren better! yet it is a real pleasure to see them on the screen, "scarce" with words! in the words of the immortal Jim Carrey "B-E-A-UTIFUL!"
