"Are you alone in the house?" Belongs to pre-cable TV days where the network was eager to offer an alternative to popular TV shows. It is a well-made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations. Kathleen Beller plays a high school student who gets a number of threatening letters. Everyone seems to think it's nothing more than a prank, but Beller is really scared. Tony Bill and Blythe Danner play Beller's parents, Ellen Travolta (John's sister) is High School Principal and Dennis Quaid has one of his earliest roles as a cocky rich child. It is a competent cooler with a still relevant social message. Cells are lovely - if you are 30 or older, you will remember that she was very popular with young people. Blythe Danner, which I usually don't like, gives a really fluid performance. Nice little movie.
