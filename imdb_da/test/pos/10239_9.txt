I was convinced that the best make-up academy award went to Dick Tracy, a horrible movie with horrible make-up. Nightbreed (based on the better term "Cabal" novella) looks great, the play is excellent, and David Chroneburg makes a truly eerie and amazing antagonist. <br /> <br /> The basic focus is on Aaron Boone, who has recurring nightmares about a community of monsters living under a cemetery. Does he make it up or are they right and call him? His pyschologist (Chroneburg) convinces him that he is a killer, a slayer of families. <br /> <br /> Troubled and suicidal diseases seek Boone refuge in Midian, but the monsters do not want him first. He is also traced by his girlfriend, Lori, who refuses to give up even after he dies and comes back cold and monstrous. <br /> <br /> But Decker shouldn't let Boone continue. He raises the locals on an all-out attack on Midian, as a holy war in the goddess's name led by the devil. <br /> <br /> Barker's themes of misguided monsters can come from his experiences as gay men, but they are always strong and honest. Nightbreed turns the genre upside down. The monsters just try to survive and want to be alone, but you are on the hunt. A 20+ minute longer cut was originally submitted by Barker, but the study hacked it into this broken masterpiece. Barker is hard at work trying to find the missing footage for a director's cut release. Until then, this version must do.
