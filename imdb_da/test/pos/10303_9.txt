This is a great example of very Hollywood filmmaking, which is very thoughtful, moving and not without humor, Kevin McKidd and Paula Sage are amazing. <br /> <br /> I actually saw it on Sennat TV, and I can see why I missed it in the cinema, it's not the kind of movie that multi-screen movie mega shows today, rejects it. <br /> <br /> I'll look for the DVD. Not for those who prefer, the current tendency to special effects and no history. If you liked the best-selling book "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time", you will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie extends to the best of Scottish movies such as "Small Faces" and "Trainspotting". All movies that Kevin McKidd is also on. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
