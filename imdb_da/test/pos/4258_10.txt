Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this movie shows African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), who is made the CEO of a company after the white CEO dies (the white leaders all hate each other and cannot determine who will succeed former CEO). When he is in power, he decides to make it a militant organization. <br /> <br /> I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did, but he did! "Putney Swope" is the ultimate jab on America's power structure. These are the kinds of things that seem to have come out of Richard Pryor's mind. This is a comedy classic in every sense of the word. A real masterpiece. Hysterical fun.
