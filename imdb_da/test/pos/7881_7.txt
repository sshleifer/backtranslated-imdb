Joe is the film about the dark side of the 1960's power in America, and Susan Sarandon had good breasts. This movie scared me so much when I saw it in the theater that I never liked Peter Boyle until Young Frankenstein and still was very much learning from him even after that comedy. Looking back from today's experience, this movie seems to be re-emerging to be directly and to the point of half-voters' approval of John McCain's "Joe The Plumber" typecast and their fears of choosing a black man as US president in the coming weeks. A black Prez would be considered "niggers" sweet revenge, but bound to bring fire to many minds again, if not the streets, this time by Joe enthusiasts. So, Joe's spirit in the movie reappears in Joe The Plumber's campaign! Still, I love being American and being scared of both and knowing how to illustrate what, ironically, Gregory Peck said our civilized law is: "a living, breathable reality!" God helps us.
