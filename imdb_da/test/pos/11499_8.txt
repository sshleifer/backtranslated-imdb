Some people go through life, moving from one thing or person to the next without throwing an eye; others are locked into a cause, another person or principle and remain adamant, committed to what it is - and figuratively or literally they give their words and stand by it. But we are all different, "Made of different clay", as one of the characters in this movie puts it, making life so interesting. Some people are simply crazy - and maybe it's the way you have to live among the masses. Who knows? Who knows what it takes to do things - life - work? Writer / director Lisa Krueger takes a shot at it using an easy approach to investigate the thin line between being committed - and how to be - and obsessed, in "Committed" starring Heather Graham as a young woman is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little crazy too. Her name is Joline, and this is her story. Of course, Joline has always been a committed person; in work, relationships, in life in general. She is a woman of her words who sticks to it no matter what. And when she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it is forever. The only problem is that someone forgot to tell Carl - and 597 days of marriage he is gone; out to "find" themselves and find out everything. When Joline realizes he is not coming back, she refuses to give him or her marriage. Maybe it's because of "laughing" she's made of. Whether she leaves their home in New York City and goes out to find him as she does - in El Paso, Texas, from anywhere. But when she knows where he is, she keeps the distance and gives him his place and not even to let him know she is there. She considers Carl to be in a "spiritual coma," and it is her job to hold a "spiritual guard" over him until he comes to his senses. And while she looks and waits, her life is anything but boring as she meets a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velazquez), a waitress at one of the local eateries; Carmen's "Grampy" (Alfonso Arau), something of a mystic; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver who has questions about Carl; and Neil (Goran Visnjic) an artist who does pinatas and wants her. For Joline, it is a journey of discovery, where she learns a lot about Carl, but even more about herself. <br /> <br /> There is a touch of humor, a touch of romance and some insight into human nature in this quirky movie that is more about characterization and character than plot. And Krueger presents it all extremely well and delivers a movie that is engaging and entertaining. Her characters are very real people, with all desires, needs, and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story. We see it from Jolin's point of view, as Krueger makes us devoted to Jolin's thoughts and hence her motivations that put a certain perspective on the events they unfold. It, along with the conscious pace she sets, allows you to enjoy the atmosphere, and the mood she creates makes for a very effective piece of narrative. There is an underlying seriousness in this subject, but Krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy or too deep and concentrate instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that Joline meets. And the result is a well-structured, influenced and optimistic look at the thing we call life. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham tackles this role from the movie's first frame to make Joline a very unique creation. She immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is compelling and trustworthy, adding the small personal traits and nuances that make all the difference between a depiction that is merely a representation of a person and someone who is genuine. And for this movie to work, it was imperative that Joline was viable and credible - and Graham succeeded on all fronts. Her screen presence has never been more appealing, and her lively personality or just as she uses her eyes is enough to draw you completely. it is part of the sign she creates; There is an appeal for Joline that radiates from all over her face who she is inside and out. She is a sympathetic, pleasant person, and because you have shared her inner thoughts, you know who she is. It's a good job all around, starting with the way the character was written, so Graham brings her so vividly to life. Like Carmen, Patricia Velazquez is also engaging. Her performance is very natural and straightforward, and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character. She has a charismatic presence, but is less than flamboyant, and it gives her an aspect that is attractive to the ground. She is refreshingly open and upfront; You get the impression that Carmen is not one to hold anything back but is quite honest on all fronts, and that is also part of her appeal. And as with Joline, this character is well-written, and Velazquez brings her convincingly to life. Overall, there are a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this movie, including those of Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (like Joline's brother, Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau, and especially Mark Ruffalo as T-Bo, as with very little screen time can create a memorable character. <br /> <br /> The support model includes Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (New York Car Thief), Dylan Baker (Carl's Editor) and Mary Kay Place (Psychiatrist ). A movie that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture - reflecting who we are, where we are going and what we really need - `Committed 'is an enjoyable experience; a trip definitely worth taking. 8.10.
