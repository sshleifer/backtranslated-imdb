I have not seen the recent traffic based on this, but I bet this as the better creation. I don't know of any other movie that has so well depicted the intricate tragedies of drug trafficking and "the war on drugs." I have seen this at least four times and enjoy it again as part of the masterpiece theater's 30 year anniversary presentations.
