James Cagney, racket and political ward heeler, becomes Vice President of Correction and visits a boys reform school. The prisoner is that Cagney is not in it for the grave, he will really make a difference in the children's life there because he comes from a background like theirs. <br /> <br /> The crook of the play is Dudley Digges, who is a grafting chisel and a haughty hypocrite to start. One of the subtitles of Helly's mayor is that these children are mostly immigrants, and those who judge them and are in positions of power are those who are here for a few generations. Note in the exhibition hall the scene as Digges gives a thank you for the food they are receiving. Digger eats well, but kids get quality that you won't feed to your pet. <br /> <br /> Cagney has his own problems back in town with some of his henchmen and he has to take it on the lamb. It puts Digges back in responsibility and sets the film to that climax. <br /> <br /> The Mayor of Hell was a typical product of the working class study. And because it was pre-code it gets pretty cruel at times. A later version of this, the Crime School, with Humphrey Bogart and Dead End Kids, was a more sanitized remake. <br /> <br /> Although Cagney is in the lead as Madge Evans is the school nurse, the actor honors go to Dudley Digges. Hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunk but friendly, a bend surgeon in Mutiny on the Bounty. But Digges is a great player and a joy to see in every movie he is in. This film is not often shown because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it portrays. A whole lot of minorities would be offended today. It's still a nice movie. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, some years ago, the movie Sleepers came out and it touched on some of the same issues. I think movies about reform schools do not change at any time.
