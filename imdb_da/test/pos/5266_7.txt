Florence Vidor stars as the daughter of a strict bible toting father who throws her out of the house when gossip picks up her name. In the big city she finds her own brother's dying wife (the two were secretly married) and raises their child alone. Years later, she goes home to confront the family. <br /> <br /> This ancient melodrama is greatly marred by fascinating feminist themes (circa 1921, but sounds remarkably modern). Some of it is put on with a trowel (like the father Theodore Roberts gives his eyebrows a real workout), but it is well put together dramatically and lovingly composed and shot by film photographer Henry Sharp.
