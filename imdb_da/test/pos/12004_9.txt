I felt the way I saw the episode in its original round and still agree when I look at reruns. You had the culprits completely mocking Columbo throughout the episode and treating him as if he had a syndrome. And finally, you see their shock when Columbo gets them dead to rights and arrests them. You also get a realistic reaction from the arrogant preppy killers. They still couldn't give Columbo his props and say he was just lucky. I like the formula where there is extensive crime, underestimating the killer (s) completely Columbo, and then you understand that Columbo completely played the criminals. I remember in the first episodes of the post-episodes in 1989 that they did not follow that formula, and that was the first episode I was pleased with.
