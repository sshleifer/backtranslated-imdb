I really enjoyed North and South a lot. I think it's one of the best and most lavish TV shows I've ever seen. The clip's caliber is great, you have actors from "The Golden Age of Cinema", people like James Stewart, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons with other actors who were the new faces of the 80s like Patrick Swayze, James Read, Jonathan Frakes, Genie Francis, Philip Casnoff and Lesley-Anne Down. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the story is the friendship between two completely different men, Orry Main (Patrick Swayze), from the south and George Hazard (James Read) who is from the north. Throughout the series, their friendship is threatened with the differences in their backgrounds, especially on the treatment of slaves in the south (especially at Orry's plantation), but when they each need the other, they will forget the arguments and go and help their friend. I really liked the chain between the two men and was really interested in seeing if their friendship could survive the war. <br /> <br /> I liked how the series showed how life was before the war, so the audience could see what were the factors that led to the war, what happened at the time, so the destruction of a nation that was torn apart and then the country had to rebuild the country. The war scenes were very well choreographed and very realistic to me. I think what's good about it is that it has so many elements running through it, romance, history, battles that interest the audience, there's something for everyone. I especially enjoyed the romance between Brett (Genie Francis) and Billy (Parker Stevenson / John Stockwell), especially when she stood up for her sister Ashton for the first time. The other romances were interesting, as there was not much the same, each had something different than the others, who kept me in particular in Madeline and the Orry narrative string to see if they would be together eventually. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best American mini-shows I've seen, history had the right balance between romance and the more serious story side that happened in that country at the time, but it is pacet just right. The characters are very visible, and the location is beautiful, and the music especially at the beginning and end of the episode is so foolishly good and works with the mood of the story.
