I just saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival in the beautiful Elgin Theater. I was blown away by the beautiful filmography, the brilliant adaptation of a very difficult game and last but not least, Al Pacino's bravura performance, which was born to play this role, which was perfectly balanced by an equally high performance from Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> The film explores the themes of love vs. loyalty, law against justice and passion vs reason. Some may protest that the content itself is anti-Semitic, but they should take into account the historical context of history and the delicate and nuanced manner in which this adaptation is addressed. 9.10
