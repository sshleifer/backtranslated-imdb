Seems to have been made as a vehicle for W.C. Fields and Carol Dempster dominate it. Fields already have their film character well developed. Carol Dempster seems to dance through the movie, and her play reminds me of Mary Pickford, who has also been working for a long time under D.W. Griffith. Typically for later Griffith movies technically. <br /> <br /> Later as Poppy (the original title) made with Fields in the same role.
