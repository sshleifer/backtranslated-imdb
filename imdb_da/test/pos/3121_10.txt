This little John Ford Western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it tracks the voyage west of a party of Mormons, and it can be the most authentic look of all Ford's films (it is on par with "The Sun Shines Bright" which he made a couple of years later). There is a plot of varieties (a group of bank robbers taking part in the lorry at some point), but the dramatic highlights of the film are almost random. The amazing performance of Ford's stock company (Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr., Ward Bond, Jane Darwell, etc.) greatly adds to the film's authenticity, while the closest movie comes to a full-star's performance, is Joanne Dru's Denver. Dru was a much finer actress than she ever got credit for, such as Bond and Johnson, who were at least finally awarded with the recognition of an Oscar for her work in "The Last Picture Show". As he said himself, "it couldn't have happened to a nicer trap". Add Bert Glennon's excellent photography and you have a real piece of Americana that couldn't have anyone other than Ford. This is a movie that is really called America's pioneers and is full of feeling and feeling.
