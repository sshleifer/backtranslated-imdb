Gosh, I learn quite quickly that sometimes when you see a movie as a youth, and then again 20 years later, you get a different view - primarily because you learn more for 20 years. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how big a director was he and how much of it made this movie fly. All I can say is .. I really liked this movie because it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can it ever exist? Well in certain doses, yes ... and this movie got out a bit ... "how." <br /> <br /> Being a young with not much life experience the first time I saw this so I focused more on the "rich" and "famous" part between the two. At that time, I had no idea that there was a difference, and what would happen to two women who discovered that there was ... and how it would affect their friendship. Through their men, their careers, the decades that defined them. And getting into a thing remained stronger than anything else ... their friendship and knowledge of each other more than anyone else could have. <br /> <br /> Then I got older, studied movies a little ... and looked at this movie again with my best friend from high school. We understand the 'rich' and 'famous' angle ... and we are still the best friends ... but this movie is not a cinematic masterpiece ... it can be seen as a bit campy at times ... just over the top at points (a bit of a 'dynasty' and 'Dallas' level for me ..) and frankly I can identify with the "teddy bear" scene, because we share a bear that means much more than a stuffed fun toy through our trials and tribulations with men / career, et al. so it's not like over the top as it seems ....! As many have already said, Meg Ryan and Matt Latanzzi and Dack Rambo and David Selby look good in this 1981 piece. this is a nice "chick" flick!
