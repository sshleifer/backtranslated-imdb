This is probably one of the best Portuguese movies I have ever seen ... I absolutely enjoyed the plot, because at all the story was being developed, you would be more involved in how their world really was on the head .. There is just one part that doesn't really fit into the movie, which is the girls' strip ... It doesn't add anything important to the story, it just seems to be there for a man's entertaining purpose . The end is a little unexpected, but at the same time it is expected to be something. If you don't understand, follow me: After so many strange events, the viewer is so accustomed to oddities ending the movie with totally unexpected relationships (like Mimoso and Susana) sounding natural after seeing the rest of the movie. But most of all, Black Nula is a movie that makes you think hard to solve the mysterious events, laugh your head with their unfortunate life and mess with your perception of what can happen in minutes when you return away from anything ... for all that i rate it 8/10
