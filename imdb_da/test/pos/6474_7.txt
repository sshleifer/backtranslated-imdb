Recently traveled in Norway from Bergen, Norway and stopped in Voss, Norway, and there was a monument in honor of Knute Rockne, who was born in Voss many years ago. People know everyone about Knute to this day, and travel guides are proud to stop at his monument. This movie is a great story of this great man and his great love for Notre Dame. Never realized that Knute has such great talents in chemistry and laboratory science and also taught chemistry for years and at the same time trained the football team. Ronald Reagan played the role of George Gipp, (The Gipper), who was an excellent football player; Reagan had a short role but gave a great support role in this movie. Donald Crisp (father John Callahan) was excellent as a priest who always had great faith in Knute throughout his life at Notre Dame. This is a great classic movie and is seen by many future generations. Enjoy.
