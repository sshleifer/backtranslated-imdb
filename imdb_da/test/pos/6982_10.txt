(VERY mildly spoiled) <br /> <br /> I must begin by saying that I am not normally impressed by science fiction, so Pitch Black (2000) was a pleasant surprise. I had chopped it from the beginning with rhythm, intensity and visual breakout that left me fascinated and glued to my seat. I am very happy to say that this movie was the best (okay, at least * a * of the best) science fiction piece I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Basically, it may sound simple - a (space) ship crashes on a presumably deserted planet, and Captain Caroline Fry (impressive Radha Mitchell) has to bring the survivors to safety. First, a cold-blooded killer, Riddick (Vin Diesel, who plays the role of a very credible extra style), perhaps as the group's biggest problem, but as dusk begins to creep in, the creatures of the night begin to awaken ... It leads to a desperate Attempts to escape the bloodthirsty predators that, as we all can guess, do not lead to a happy family picnic. It's not the plot itself that makes the movie worth seeing - let's first see if you strip it down to the basics, it's not * the * original - but the skill it is told. The story flowed forward, leaving me not gaping (at least not much) at any point. The management was fabulous work. This was a very visual, even beautiful film; the purple night view was a real treat. Although 'beautiful' may not be the right word to use; Yes, the pictures shown were sweets to the eye, but they also added a touch of unspecified grotesqueness, eeriness, as if something were about to break out from under the still surface. (Not to mention that the monsters were really well done, so the realistic ones seem to be rare today [maybe people just can't be disturbed to make them look real ...]) You don't just enjoy it visual side of the film, but also the psychological aspect of the story. During the film we will see the characters raging - some of them fall, some of them rise - but what fascinated me the most was the development of the character of Riddick. I enjoyed watching the change in him throughout the movie. To go even further was the other thing I enjoyed a lot from Riddick, the incredibly good and originally performed UST (Unsuccessful Sexual Excitement) between Fry and the "not" (you get what I mean when you see it). [You can't deny that they had chemistry. Don't even try or I'll lead you out and make you listen to me playing chopsticks until you scream * laugh *] It was fresh. As Radha Mitchell once said (a modified quote), "Pitch Black is a really sexy movie without sex", making it even more interesting. <br /> <br /> So to sum up, I recommend this movie - even if you're not really a fan of "space stories". The excitement was held until the end, and what's important we were (or at least I was) back who wanted more. If you can't be bothered by thinking of psychology, subtitle and such (as it is my habit), you'll still find Pitch Black very entertaining. Just save your shoes and enjoy it.
