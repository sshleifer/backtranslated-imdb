One of my absolute favorite childhood films. Chipmunk adventure packs incredibly fun gear for both young and old. The animation is lively and colorful, and the movie itself boasts some of the best songs ever laid in an animated feature. Who could forget about the dynamic "Boys / Girls of Rock n Roll", the exciting "Diamond Dolls" and the heartbreaking "My Mother"? <br /> <br /> This should be considered a nostalgic classic animated gem from the eighties. It's too bad that they don't make them like this anymore. Most animated movies today go to violence, raw humor or sentimental mush ... apart from the Pixar people, of course. BOTTOM LINE: A fantastic and unforgettable adventure for all ages.
