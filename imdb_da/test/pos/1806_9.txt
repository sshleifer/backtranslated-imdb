The sweet, rich little girl develops in love with a punk from the alley, and when her snobbish friends dislike him, she is forced to choose between her heart and her popularity. Very fun romantic comedy mixes in elements of black comedy and 80's cheese that make this even fun to watch. The film not only follows the life of the valley girl and her punk; But also their friends when shopping, partying, hanging out and going to the mall. If the dialogue doesn't have you laughing outside for a week, the music will. Songs like "Johnny, are you Queer?" found everywhere. Also, Elizabeth Daily is a fun, existential character and the Prom King & Queen speech at the end is fun!
