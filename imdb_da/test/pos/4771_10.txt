It's the 1920s. And a man named Walt Disney was on mission: to satisfy families and children all over the world with one thing: entertainment. What did he do? He made cartoons! Waow !!!!! And he made a character as big as a mouse ... Mickey Mouse. Ha ha! Oh boy! <br /> <br /> Two films were designed by Mr. Disney itself: "Plane Crazy" and "Steamboat Willie." This review will focus on the 1928 feature, "Steamboat Willie." Ever since I learned about this movie as a little boy, I've always wanted to watch this movie. Well in 1997 I rented an old VHS that had lots of old Disney cartoons on them starring the mouse !!!!! Mickey Mouse!!!!! And guess what? The short was there and I loved it !!!!! Soon after I took the tape back, it played on the old Disney Channel (note: the "old" Disney Channel) early on a Saturday morning. Yes, this is a fantastic cartoon; This paved the way for more amazing Disney stuff from 1928 to 2002! <br /> <br /> 10 stars, yes !!!!!
