Although I was the only one in the movie theater that laughed at times, this is the greatest pleasure I took from the beautifully shot "thirst" - laughter. Although sometimes the movie had an identity crisis and did not know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy, the blackest of black humor shone regularly. <br /> <br /> Of course, helping everybody involved was wonderful, and I was a little obsessed with the sometimes evil leading lady who was gorgeously elegant, no matter how blood-soaked and vicious she became . <br /> <br /> I read reviews that suggested this movie was lengthy. I didn't think so. In fact, the last scenes, move and hilarious (I mean, the brown shoes ....) by swing, were among the best in the movie.
