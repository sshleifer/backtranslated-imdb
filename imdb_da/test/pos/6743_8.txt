In April 1947, New York City faced an epidemic crisis. Eugene LaBar, a carpet importer who arrived from Mexico, had arrived in the city and caused the deadly pox virus. He stumbled on a bus, complained of fever and headaches, and soon died in a Midtown Hospital, but not until he had infected a dozen passersby. The damage had already been completed for the first time in decades, the copper stalked the streets of New York. The city's health authorities acted quickly to isolate sufferers and contain the virus and adopted a free vaccination campaign that saw over six million New Yorkers immunized against smallpox. Thanks to their rapid response, the virus was contained with minimal losses. Nevertheless, the outbreak must have left an indelible mark. For several years, it was followed by two similar thrills, where a single contagious carrier is to be added in a million city: Elia Kazan's Panic in the Streets (1950) and Earl McEvoy's lower budget 'The Killer That Stalked New York (1950). '<br /> <br /> McEvoy's film unfolds in a young-fashioned docu-drama style. Reed Hadley's story sounds like it was picked from a press play, and recited facts as reading the official police print. This technique feels a little cheap at times, but fortunately, the story is very limited to the movie's bookends, as well as giving some explanatory filler during breaks in the plot. "Killer" stalking New York, in this story, is not a carpet importer from Mexico, but the beautiful diamond smuggler Sheila Bennet (Evelyn Keyes), who has just come from Cuba. In a few days, Sheila has two parties who independently pursue her: Treasury agent (Barry Kelley) seeks to arrest her for smuggling crimes and a team of doctors (led by William Bishop) who have identified her as the source of the copper outbreak. As in 'Panic in the Streets', an otherwise routine manhunt gets an increased sense of urgency, especially when in the persecution they have no idea of ​​their suspect's identity or appearance. <br /> <br /> "The Killer stalking New York," mostly manages to sidestep its low production budget, apart from a selection of few lines of dialogue ("we must stop it!" exclaims Dr. Wood at One time, as if coming to a difficult decision), the filmmakers and cast members give the opportunity to unfold the story in a realistic and exciting way, in that respect the low budget probably helps the film's intentions, necessitating a documentary style that adds Evelyn Keyes is excellent in the leading role showing a tough resilience in the face of unimaginable torment; after the film's end she seems so brutally incapacitated by her illness that it is almost painful to look at her face. Charles Korvin is the biggest villain in the play, which Sheila is greedy and incredible man who is sure to get everything that comes to him, and if all nurses were like Doroth y Malone, it might not seem like a bad break to catch cups.
