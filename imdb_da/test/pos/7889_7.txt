WARNING: Reading this post after watching the movie! As 'Easy Rider' released a year earlier, 'Joe' tries to illustrate what happens when the counter-culture and the ordinary (albeit right-wing) America meet: A violent end follows. Although this movie is mostly a slow-moving display of traditional "old-fashioned" American morality over the 60's "do-what-feel-good" lifestyle, it is also a comment to the top class vs. class and their inability to meet in the middle as illustrated when Comptons meets Currans. Boyle's Joe represents a generation stuck in the 1940s and 50s, where 'Kill a commie for Mommy (or jap or hippie for that matter) is okay as long as it helps and saves America. Joe and wife Mary Jo are clearly the archetypes of Archie Bunker and Dingbat wife, Edith. This movie - which will always be known to be violent (but not bloody - no blood is seen at all), is the end uneven. Joe Blaster (verbally) The hippie generation then (literally) joins them to infiltrate their numbers to find Compton's daughter - when he should obviously have been rejected by the idea, but rejects the separatist idea for the sake of gender. When he is betrayed through theft (read: Confidence in the older generation to the newer generation), he flushes out through a relentless chain of murders. Perhaps it is because of Hollywood's Tarantinos that the guard expects bloodstream death in the final scene, but the bloodless shootings long for any kind of influence or realism. 'Joe' is not a good movie, but it is an interesting display of class and culture alienation and the animalistic underlying extremes of the generation gap.
