This program was on for a short time when I was a kid, I remember seeing it while eating fish and chips. Riding on the Tron hype behind this series was very similar to streethawk, manimal and the like, except for more computer-like. There was a geeky child whose computer somehow created this guy - automan. He wanted to go around solving crimes and the party. <br /> <br /> I really remember was his fancy car and the little flashy marker that used to draw the car and help him out in general. <br /> <br /> When I mention it to someone, they can also remember very little too. Was it true or perhaps a dream?
