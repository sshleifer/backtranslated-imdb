Firstly, positive: an excellent job of portraying urban landscapes to suit the mood of the movie. Some of the shots could be paintings by De Chirico. Sophie Marceau, beautiful. <br /> <br /> Negatives: The stories are hard to believe. Unreal, un-dimensional characters characterize and set 100% of the time as if they were in a kind of catwalk. This is neither Antonioni from his earlier, much better movie or Wenders, we have all come to know and appreciate. Malkovich is excess baggage in this movie.
