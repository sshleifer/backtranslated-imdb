This is the thirteenth Falcon movie. Tom Conway has not lost his humor and style and does not show signs of getting tired. The film has a very satisfying story, with lots of red herring, suspects and ladies. Madge Meredith is the good girl in history, she plays it adequately, but by no means puts the screen on fire. Myrna Dell is a poor girl and she puts out an excellent stone with the agate's eyes and you are just waiting for her to kill as many as possible to encourage herself. Edward Brophy is back as Goldie sidekick, but surprisingly, his manic overactive has stopped and he is actually under control. This is a great tribute to William A. Berke's managerial skills that had made so many Westerners that he was probably not willing to take any nonsense from a Brooklyn dummy. The result is that for the first time, possibly in his career, Brophy was toned down enough to actually add something to a movie rather than trying out the viewer's patience with the annoying behavior of a retarded but outrageous six-year-old. It all goes very well and is thoroughly entertaining.
