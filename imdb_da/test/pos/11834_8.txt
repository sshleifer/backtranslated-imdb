"In love and war" is a simple emotion-good TV movie and should be seen as such. <br /> <br /> It is the story of another world war British soldier, newby, caught with his command of the Italians and imprisoned in a former orphanage. As the Italians surrender to the Allies, the command is freed and tries to escape. But the Germans arrive and the command is captured again. Only Newby, wounded, remains big. The rest of the film tells how he is hidden and protected by the partisans and his survival. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, "In Love and War" is a refreshingly straightforward movie. Half comedy, half-romance, history is simple and unambiguous. The atmosphere is warm and sunny, and the various stereotypes (the desperately disorganized or romantic Italians, the serious, strict Germans and the phlegmatic and pragmatic British) are, though unoriginal, still humorous. Nicola Piovani's musical score also adds to the Mediterranean flavor. Although it is far from being "Tea With Mussolini" or "La Vita E Bella", "I Love and War" is a cute simple movie that will put a smile and maybe even a little tan on your face.
