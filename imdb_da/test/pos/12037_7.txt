Turner Classic Movie Channel has been using the month of January to film one of my favorite actors, Robert Montgomery. His films are rarely seen these days, except for those who were atypical for most of his career - which means that the roles that often come back on television are THE EXPORTS, THE LITTLE LIVING, JUNE BRIDGE , NIGHT MUST FALL THE SAXON CHARM, RIDE THE RED HORSE, RAGE IN HEAVEN, CHARLAGO'S HEADLINE (In short, the films he struggled to get into the roles because they were not the usual cartoon he usually appeared in). It is ironic that today, when you think of Montgomery's career, it is the films that were mostly made after 1937 being pushed - those that broke the original image that MGM and Louis B. Mayer pushed. Concern for this is that Montgomery was a gifted comedian and saved many movies from being routine. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is such a film. Produced in 1936 with PICADILLY JIM and ERROR FOR TWO, it was a great year of good performance by Montgomery and helped him convince the powers of the MGM to allow him to play "Danny" at night to drop it next year. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is set in Labrador and Montgomery is a weather station operator called Dascom Dinsmore. He has lived there for five years and has not been with a woman (except for Inuit women) for most of that time. He has a boyfriend of varieties named Clara (Winifred Shotter) whom he has suggested, but it has been two years since he has heard from her so he thinks she has given up on him. <br /> <br /> The Dinsmore world is rocked when Sir James Felton and Irene Campton (Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy) come up. They fled to Toronto for a business meeting to be dealt with by Felton. Felton is engaged to Campton, but Dinsmore finds her enchanting ... and gradually she finds him as attractive. Surely the pompous, self-sufficient and hopelessly inappropriate Felton is no competition (it is a goal of Owen's play that he keeps the character entertaining, although it is hard to believe that such a bob is a Canadian industry captain). <Br /> <br /> There is something surreal about this movie - probably because of the original game. While the "Labrador" scene is rather false, it looks like the purpose of the comedy (witness to the polar bear's order). But the height of surrealism is the dinner Dinsmore serves its guests, a dinner of "pemmican steaks", which Owen eats with true tasting. Owen (a lesser noble as the baron) is dressed in normal clothes - a winter suit for the climate). But Montgomery is dressed in his dress of evening dress (as if he is attending a ball at the embassy). Loy, see him dress up and put on a dress as well. They are served by Dinsmor's servant assistant, Inuit Kimo (Otto Yamaoka), who also has a dress dress - it turns out it's Owen's! Owen, who previously insisted that Dinsmore switch to clothing more suitable for his station, is the only person wrongly dressed for this dinner !! Montgomery was MGM's most elegant actor in a tuxedo or evening dress (Franchot Tone was his closest rival). It's a movie game if Montgomery or Fred Astaire was the more elegant figure in such suits. Hard to decide. <br /> <br /> Love does not go smoothly in comedy or drama. Clara turns out (we are tipped too early on this at the start of the movie when we see her on an ice boat). Will Dinsmore break with Clara? Will Irene break with Felton? The movie is fun, and Loy and Montgomery make a good couple. They had come together in another movie and both were in separate scenes in a second before this movie. But this would be their last movie together. <br /> <br /> One last point of interest - at the start of the movie when credits appear, you see illustrations of men and women in comic situations. They are based on John Held Jr.'s artworks, the great comics / illustrator from the 1920s and 1930s - who was the recorder of the flap and the "Jazz Age". It's an unusual choice - as it has nothing to do with the movie's plot or Labrador.
