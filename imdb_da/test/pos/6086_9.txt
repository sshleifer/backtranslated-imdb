Seeing "The English Patient" again after Anthony Minghella's death is a strange and moving experience. Most of his work is dedicated to a crushing point. The endless moral struggle for those who deliberately go a very thin line. In "The Talented Mr Ripley" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the killer a conscience. In "Breaking And Entering" Minghella, Jude Law's character gives the need to confess and the rewards are chilling to move. Here in "The English Patient" the loving characters are never too far away from their corrosive feelings. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They stretch their characters from any kind of event into a compelling complication with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is simply spectacular, and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a "Minghellian" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were somehow the unpleasant mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought of his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying himself. There is something clear, honest and sensational about Minghella's opus. I already miss him, but I am grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.
