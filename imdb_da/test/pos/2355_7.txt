Saw this movie the first time in 1953 with my older brother. It was one of the great 3 Demension movies released in that era. We saw it at least thirteen times and were proud of it. Scott makes a typical western shoot em up job while surrounded by the Indian arrows instead of surround sound. Oh, for the polaroid lenses again.
