From the play to Cardone's direction, this new twist on the well-known ghost's erroneous theme will keep you glued to your seat. Slowly at times because it builds this 'what's going to happen' excitement. Medium-well on gore but what is nicely uncomfortable. Spoiler: The death of jockhole and subsequent party is a highlight of gorehounds. The writers made an old story, but added phrases and reintroduced you typically ghost. Cardone brings it to life. . . is. . uh death. <br /> <br /> Lori Heuring, Scout Taylor-Compton and the always fabulous Ben Cross are real, no sign of acting here. Everyone in the cast is committed and really is not what a director strives for. The actors believe so we think. Along with the traditional ghost story surprise the movie is filled with lots of atmosphere, from the mine, Hank's house and the Tunny home, there is an insidious fear from the first frame to the last. <br /> <br /> Fear fans, do yourself a favor and enjoy what constitutes one of the true horror movies out there today. <br /> <br /> I end up with a big kudo to Boaz Davidson (story) Ben Nedivi (manuscript) for without inventive writers Hollywood would be anything but a nasty reality television party.
