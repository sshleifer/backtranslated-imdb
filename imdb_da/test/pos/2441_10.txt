This movie has not been seen by me in a few years. It came on the Disney Channel in the small hours of the morning. I stopped seeing it and found it even more entertaining than the first time. The story, nature and characters are as good as they come. I know that if someone takes the time to watch this movie, they definitely find it worth seeing another time. It is very memorable in more ways than one. I would recommend this movie to anyone because it is both entertaining and educational for everyone concerned. <br /> <br /> p
