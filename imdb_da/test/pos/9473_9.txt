I just took my 11-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son to this movie and I can't remember a movie where I laughed so hard - literally loud, deep shots of laughter because this movie is fun. Granted the story is predictable, but the trip is so enjoyable, it doesn't matter that you know how it will end. The actors' comic senses of timing were impeccable. The actors were completely cast. My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes seems to be the last of the young female actresses who do not destroy their lives. She is so refreshing. My kids said this is their favorite movie from 2006. Our money was well spent on this movie.
