For anyone who has ever sought happiness, "Half Empty" is a must-see. This original cross-cultural musical comedy features hilarious songs, making "The Producers" seem incredibly stubborn. Author Bob Patterson puts his soul into sharing his thoughts on life, wisdom and happiness, even writing inspirational comments on index cards, as his girlfriend wastes his heart and finishes their relationship. When his book of luck, "North Star" finds zero success in the states, his publishers send him to Germany for a book signing tour. As they explain their decision to Bob, the control room spreads into a bursting song that would make Monty Python proud. From his arrival in Hamburg, Bob's complete ignorance of the German language leaves him a particular disadvantage. But he sold on his host's impenetrable true feelings to him until a wildly devoted fan emerges and alters everyone's reaction to him. <br /> <br /> The original songs drive the film and often describe the subtitle of the story in side-cutting precision. The cast, led by Robert Peters, exhibits an immaculately dry humor and resides in their characters as if they were not acting. See it for: A case study of how good intentions are completely irrelevant; Where innocent Americans abroad are seen; How little reason it takes to burst into the song, and above all, for a stupid, entertaining, unconventional laugh.
