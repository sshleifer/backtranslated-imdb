Saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, over three years ago. I went in without expectations as Christopher Nolan was a no-name at the time, but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw at that festival. It worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting the scenes out of order, adding the mood. Mr.Nolan gave a good account of his presentation at the end, enough to put someone away from starting as a filmmaker! I liked it better than Memento, although it was due to the lower expectations. And the fact that it was more an art house film.
