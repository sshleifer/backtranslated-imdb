In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and Americans, in the early twentieth century, the Moroccan leader Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisuli the Magnificent (Sean Connery) kidnapped the American Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), her son and daughter . His intention is to get some money and rifle as a ransom for them to fight the corrupt sultan of Morocco (Marc Zuber). In election times, US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with the proposal. But Raisuli is betrayed, and Eden helps him to be released from prison with the US soldiers. I don't like movies about explicit colonialism and the lack of respect for other countries' sovereignty, but "The Lion and the Wind" is really a great adventure. The action scenes are very realistic. Candice Bergen, the most beautiful American actress in the 70's, is wonderful and performs a abducted woman as in the remarkable movie `Soldier Blue '. Sean Connery is as usual perfect as an honest and nationalist religious leader. Brian Keith is great as the US President. I don't know much about Morocco's history to analyze whether there is any truth in this story, but this movie is a worthy entertainment. In Brazil, it is only available on VHS. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `O Vento e o Le√£o '(` The Lion and the Wind') <br /> <br />
