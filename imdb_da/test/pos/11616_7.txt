Well, it is safe to say that subconscious cruelty is a strange movie! Probably an insight into the human mind consists of the subconscious cruelty of four macabre and bizarre stories of the extreme. The first segment titled 'Ovarian Eyeball' is really just a warm-up, but it's good that it gives the viewer an idea of ​​what to expect from the next three segments. It simply looks like a naked woman on the table, while another woman cuts into the stomach and pulls out a human eye! I have no idea what the meaning is, but it does give certain visceral view. The following story is the best of the pile and goes into the "old favorite" sick movie theme of incest. The segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister. He is laid off by his pregnancy - yet he wants to have sex with her anyway, and of course he gets the way. This story stands out because of the monotonous and actually 'narrative, as well as the end - that does not fail to deliver the shocks. This segment is well acted, well filmed and easily the highlight of subconscious cruelty. Of course, the next two sections are not as good as the other; So the only way from there is down, but director Karim Hussain is still able to pull something out of the bag before the movie ends. He does not do so immediately, as the third segment is the weakest of the film and simply sees that many people have sex with the earth. It is very surreal and therefore memorable for the same reason; but there didn't seem to be much point in it, and I was in the mood for something a little more morbid after the second section. However, the film ends high, while I'm not quite sure what the meaning was - the final segment has the film's best imagery. This segment focuses on religion and certainly not for anyone who appreciates it! Director Karim Hussain has achieved something here - as this collection of four 'extreme' stories does not come together as a complete whole, the film feels almost tasteful as it is shot in such a eloquent and conspicuous way. The director seems to have imitated the highly respected surrealistic director Luis Buñuel, albeit with gore, rape and incest; And if you ask me, he hasn't done a bad job at all. Not for everyone, but definitely for extreme fanatics!
