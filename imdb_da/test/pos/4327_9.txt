What is the purpose of these messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about next season ... Here is my forecast: 1. The hatch was actually blown, but somehow survived everyone inside. Buts can see about it. 2. The episode at the end of the tent is an observation team that monitors the tracking device installed on Desmond's Penny boat. Now that the magnetic source around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observatory and they will send a rescue mission. 3. After the destruction of the hatch, the island is no longer isolated and other ships / aircraft will arrive 4. The others will finally share their secret with us bad observers. <br /> <br /> Was it actually confirmed that there will be 4 seasons of lost? <br /> <br /> Bowl Mike
