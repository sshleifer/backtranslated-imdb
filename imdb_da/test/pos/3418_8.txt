... and usually I don't like surprises !! Watch this movie by chance in a motel in South Africa the second week of a three-month motorcycle holiday in the ZA. Apart from being well shot and acted, it helped me to understand the country's problems tremendously. Just looked at "Million Dollar Baby" and had to look up Hillary Swank when the name sounded and her action was amazing. Didn't know she was a lawyer in "Red Dust". Well, I'm not going to worry that she'll disappear like so many other sidekicks of Clint before ... Now I'm asked to write ten full lines of comment, which is pretty ridiculous, because I've written what I wanted write. OK, here it goes: I think if you are from a Western country, especially Europe, it seems to help you understand a little better why what happens is down there! So this will hopefully fill ten lines.
