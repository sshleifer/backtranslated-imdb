I think I share the same psychological perspective on the world with Kieslowski. He is Polish, I am Dutch, but we share a synthetic mind: The world is not invalid of the metaphysical in the middle of the overall case. Almost not ruled by man or perhaps by a poet-prime minister, so that Poland as a social and cultural "low pressure" could play the role it did in World War II, but as a critical yet Christian towards the Jews, but often no less critical of itself . There is innocence and guilt in Kieslowski's world view, as the symbols of Catholicism: the white against the black madonna. In Rouge, the black madonna is who the judge fell in love with when he was a young man. Flashbacks are magically realistically intertwined with the present, although it is quite coincidental that the camera simply swings to the other side of the street or the then-judge's red jeep that passes the now-young woman's car after she accidentally hit her dog the. That we ran through time in the same camera movements is what we understand later. His love was unanswered so his life was not as he had planned. He lost his ability to love other people and animals. Being a judge, he feels that he is actually spying on other people's lives, and when he retires, he just continues to spy on his neighbors this time. The younger woman's innocence and sense of justice (by literally) randomly comes into his life, reintroduces his better judgment, and it is because of her that he spontaneously confesses his espionage to his neighbors and the police as he accepts and even holds on to stones thrown accordingly through his windows. In the process, the story repeats itself between this man and the woman he loves, although this time he is old and the woman is not the same. Kieslowski may have struggled with this bit, because the old judge is his alter ego, and it is said that he was vanquished by Ir√®ne Jacob. Both women play the same important role in their psychology, one (!), Who possesses his heart and soul and can therefore make him or break him, even as an old man! It is as if "forces in the air" are, or God is, bringing them together. Coincidences are also * random to just being chance or even good luck. There must be some mysterious, supernatural or theological source that influences these incredibly deep decisions of life. The study book fell and opened on the side of the exam question is another example of this. Or the moment the old judge spoke his heart to the young woman, the wind outside the opera house suddenly strikes the open doors and breaks the windows. The gigantic image of the young woman happens to predict it on television after the drowning accident on her Canal crossing trip. These moments are highlighted effectively by the human voice of the liturgy or what it says (Van den Budenmayer).
