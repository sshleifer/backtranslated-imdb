Richard Condie is a Canadian marvel and one to share with the world. Become the gut-busting early work as "Get Started" and the Oscar nominated "Cut" through "The Apprentice" and the digitally crafted "La Salla", Condie is a valuable local heroes. But no unique piece of work puts a stamp on his career as "The Big Snit". And have I mentioned that it was nominated for an Oscar? Darn tootin '. <br /> <br /> "The Big Snit", though clearly a dated message carrier from the 1980s (the cards are about Cold War-esquire nuclear destruction, but don't worry, it's fun as hell), it brings a greater importance, and most of Condie's work is underestimated. While the planet scurries for cover from Armageddon, a few bickers over each other's annoying habits (in true Condie fashion, he hacksaw the furniture while she shakes her eyes literally). And don't forget to see it again and again, 'cuz there's always something to look at. Condie puts this up with countless visual gags and memorable catch phrases. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this incredible animation, tracked down. In Canada, it is usually seen in a National Film Board video containing other star charts (including with Winnipegger Cordell Barker's just fun "The Cat Came Back"). Americans just have to dig a little deeper, but stick to it ?? The reward is the hassle.
