This depiction of abandoned Japanese forces in the Philippines is a trip they force in the complete meaninglessness of war. It is an effective representation of Japanese pacifist views after World War II. In the film, Japanese soldiers have been left to manage themselves in the Philippines jungle. Unlike the impending hunger, they use cannibalism and gradually lose the small humanity they have left. Calling this movie depressing would be an understatement. The viewer is back with a completely desperate sense of life's lost value in modern combat. The final scene is almost too nihilistic, but the film is a worthy statement, not less. Highly recommended.
