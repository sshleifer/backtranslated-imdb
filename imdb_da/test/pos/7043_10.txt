"Rattlesnake! Look out!" "Is it a bra you're wearing or are you expecting a murder attempt?" "Spaz, what are you a gay or what?" "OK way to go to you! Feed, he's our hot man." "Do you know that they use the most sophisticated training methods of the Soviet Union, East and West Germany and the latest Olympic power of Trinidad and Tobago." "Oh Spaz you old make-out master!" "What, no mustard?!" "Oh my God, his nose bleeds." "It'll be bigger now" "Our political round table ... Henry Kissinger will show up. Yassir Arafat comes out and spend a weekend with the kids just raping with them." <br /> <br /> These and many other amazing lines make meatballs a hall of fame comedy. Only in Caddyshack is Bill Murray more fun. He probably has ad-libbed half lines. The high school actors seemed to have a blast to be in the same movie with him. <br /> <br /> Hilarious movies to watch any time of year, not just in summer.
