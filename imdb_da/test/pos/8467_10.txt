This movie is a scary but interesting movie. I will tell you why it is frank later in this review. The film is interesting because it was the first movie that ever contained sound. No, it can't be a movie in an hour and forty and two minutes, no it shouldn't contain big action scenes, but it's still a wonderful movie for me. It was a well-known revolution, if you like, of sound film. It may be a little scary to see that everyone in that movie is now dead, I can hear a person's voice in the beginning, no longer going to see the earth and the sound is sharp and broken. <Br /> <br /> I recommend this video to anyone to watch. This created movies as we know it today!
