Anne Frank's diary is the second best-selling nonfiction book in the world and for good reason. Nevertheless, by sitting through this documentary about his life, which fills some of the details that the diary left, I thought, "Just another documentary about Anne Frank." I found it to be competent but not extraordinary. It was my complacent attitude, because I was already aware of the story of Anne Frank; most of what the documentary had to tell me was not news for me. <br /> <br /> Everything was changed when I came to the end of the documentary --- when I watched the movies from Anne Open. The emotional effect of watching this recording, just a second or so, did everything that came before the thousand times more real --- but not just all that was in the documentary; everything I had previously known about Anne Frank suddenly became more real to me, more personal. I had always been moved by her story, but when I saw that recording, what I felt was stronger and deeper and deeper than any other movie experience of my life. (I knew beforehand that this documentary contained live footage of Anne Frank, and I had even seen the pictures in a movie review on television, but seeing it in the documentary's frame was a completely different experience. My not likely to mention it here will ruin it for anyone.) <br /> <br /> I now realize that many still do not know the history of Anne Frank; It is sometimes a deterrent to witnessing this kind of ignorance. I think to myself, "How could anyone not know the story of Anne Frank?" This is the case, but ANNE FRANK: REMEMBER, along with reading his diary, is the best place to start. It's a story that everyone should know.
