I really refused to watch this movie. I refused to go to school and I refused to go with my parents. Just by looking at the trailer, it looked silly to me anyway. One of my friends wanted to take me to the cinema that day and he offered me 2 selections, "The Dukes Of Hazzard" or "Wallace And Gromit: The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit". It took me 17 minutes to decide. Time runs out. I had to choose. It came up on the screen "Get" as in a few tickets left. When we had to get up and get our ticket, only one of us could enter. I desperately wanted Nicholas to go in and see it. But he forced me. I crossed my arms and was very spirited and disappointed that I went in to see this childhood. I went in, sat in the only seat that was available and prepared for the movie! must say I was very surprised that I was sitting through the MASTERPIECE! It was amazing. I don't know what I complained about. Clay Animation was by far the best I have ever seen in my life. The story was brilliant. About a rabbit that disturbs and crashes a carnival that was planned for over 500 years. In principle, Anti Pest Control protects the people competing for the vegetable competition. Anti Pesto known as Wallace And Gromit (Who's in charge of this business) is trying to keep all rabbits away from the vegetable carnival. I don't want to say more. It's just too good to tell. I admit that the whole idea of ​​a Were-Rabbit is ab-it incredible and ab-it childish, but Nick Park adds substance to it, making everyone love it. I mean, there won't be a 10 foot rabbit on the loose and there will certainly not be 8 feet werewolves as said in "Dog Soldiers." Then again, war-rabbits and werewolves are not real creatures. But in some way it worked very well. <br /> <br /> Witnesses had also grown up. The kids won't get any of the jokes. It goes way beyond their heads. It had many British jokes in there. If you love British humor, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> I also loved the cast and the voices. Everything about the film is so incredibly well done. Direction and pacing were absolutely ... FANTASTIC! I recommend this to fans of the old Wallace And Gromit shorts (and no, I haven't seen them yet) and I recommend it to fans who liked "Shrek" and "Shrek 2 and most importantly, I recommend it to the people who love Clay Animation Cracking good movie! 10/10
