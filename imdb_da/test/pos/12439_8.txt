The game is cleverly constructed - begin with gates, Rainbow - and let the audience see the background unfold through his eyes. The film follows the play with great faith and works without a doubt on the simple premise that it could not improve. Now put in a wealth of amazing character players - and the result is a resounding triumph. A definite must-see.
