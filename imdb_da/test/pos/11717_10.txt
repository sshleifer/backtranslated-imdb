Without a doubt the best Burt Reynolds movie ever! Even better than Smokey and Bandit. This was probably the first true bloody cop-thriller of the 1980s and delivered the perfect blend of humor, action, mystery and style missing in today's movies. <br /> <br /> This one has it all: A psychotic Henry Silva jacked up on PCP, $ 1,000 a night call girls, ninja killers and Burt Reynolds get their fingers cut off one by one with a butterfly knife. The film is based on William Diehl's novel, which also wrote PRIMAL FEAR, another of my all-time favorites. This movie is worth seeing just to see Henry Silva being shot six times, crashing through a window and falling thirty stories from the top of an Atlanta apartment building. This is probably the coolest stunt in Hollywood history, performed by legendary stuntman Dar Robinson. <br /> <br /> Robinson also played "Moke" in the Elmore Leonard movie STICK, who also starred Burt Reynolds. Stick has another great Dar Robinson stunt. Robinson falls from a Miami apartment complex and solves all six shots from a .44 magnum on the way down. Very cool stuff. <br /> <br /> SHARKY'S MACHINE is my favorite police drama. I never understood why this movie flopped the way it did. If Burt did more movies like this, he would have built a better reputation for himself. He turns out to be a talented director with Sharky, as well as a gifted actor. Burt is supported by Brian Kieth, Charles Durning, Bernie Casey, Richard Libertini, Rachel Ward and everyone's favorite bad Henry Silva. Please replay this classic movie! Get Affleck and Samuel L. and some other hot actors and you have a great movie just waiting to be filmed. <br /> <br /> I give it a 9 out of 10
