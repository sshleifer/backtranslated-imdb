Not an easy movie, which with both main characters is rather incredible, but fortunately, heart and soul are in the film Paula Sage's touching performance, driving the movie to blurry water and exceeding the rather awkward story. This gives the film a sense of true truth and makes you think you've seen something special. (7/10)
