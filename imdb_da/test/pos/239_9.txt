One of my favorites non-MGM musicals, it's a classic!> Rita Hayworth is in top form, her beauty jumping out of the screen. Gene Kelly shows her dance sciences and introduces the musicals to her edgy and innovative choreography, which will ultimately change the way the musicians choreograph. Phil Silvers is the perfect second banana, and Eve Arden injects this movie with a lot of classes. <br /> <br /> The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why in the time when big Broadway shows come from movies, Cover Girl has not been adapted to theater.
