In my work with the only nationwide non-profit organization, Security On Campus, Inc. Dedicated solely to the issue of college campus crime prevention and student awareness, I too often see the type of campus violence and 'cover up' through secret campus courts portrayed in the movie `Silencing Mary. "In fact, we receive numerous calls and inquiries every month from campus journalists like" Mary "who are facing similar situations. <br /> <br /> It is the image of a campus rape and the subsequent crusade of the "Mary" victim's roommate and a student journalist played very well by Melissa Joan Hart, for justice was very well done and accurately examined. <br /> <br /> This was the first television movie I have ever seen that I felt really reflected and included all the various complex issues associated with the treatment of rape and other violent crimes at our country's university and university libraries . Although it would not be possible to solve all these problems in depth in 2 hours, this movie comes closer than anyone else I have seen.
