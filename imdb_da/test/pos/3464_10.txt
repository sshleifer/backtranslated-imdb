If you want a movie with the full spectrum of emotions, look no further. dramatic and fun, and scenes of frightening emotions; I can certainly guarantee that very few will be able to see this hot and very human movie without scouring a tear now and then. It is hard to believe in the actions of the two leaders. you would swear the two young men really suffer from muscular dystrophy (rory) and cerebral palsy (michael) simply two of the finest performances I've ever seen; It's also two very credible signs, and you never have the feeling that things are just "thrown in" for dramatic purposes or causing sympathy. In the DVD release as "extras", they have "deleted scenes" (including an alternative ending) and an "extended party sequence"; Why these clips were not in the final movie is hard to understand as they blend in with the rest of the movie perfectly and in no way superfluous. But without reservation, I highly recommend this movie to anyone; one of the very best I've ever seen.
