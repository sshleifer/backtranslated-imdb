this movie made me stuck in this endless loop of thinking about it for days after ... granted i am not the movie snob that some people seem to be about, but i thought this was incredibly well-functioning and a strong creation if lacking a slight subtlety in exectution. I happen to admire movies that can effectively restore the feeling of seeing a stage play, it creates an eerie creepy that works well with this flick. I'm also a big fan of Alan Rickman, so it can be my bias. Personally, I found the lack of spatial landmarks a good thing - it could actually be anywhere and probably it is. I say go easy on what was a powerful experience for me and probably for anyone involved in any kind of political activity.
