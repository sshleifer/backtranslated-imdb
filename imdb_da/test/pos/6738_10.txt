One of my favorite movies. Great cast, led by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Serious drama situations with brilliant comic strokes. An accurate blend of character and history. Real people with real problems and everyone has a different relationship with each family member. Moving moves from a bit sad to hilarious fun. Read the quotes. This is the best fit for a Neil Simon game. <br /> <br /> To see more of Eugene checking out Biloxi Blues (with Matthew Broderick playing in both scene versions) is ok, a little on a darker side. Get away from the Broadway Bound.
