I really like this series. Its fun and unique style outside the wall, sometimes controversial comedy, is a fresh utilization of the genre. While it is a sitcom, it stands out because of what might be awkward issues. <br /> <br /> Every aspect has a comedy tour and the show is really very good. My favorite part of the program is the little weird comments from Dad, Dave. his rants break the program and allow a really good flow. not perfect, because in some cases the comedy is not laughing much fun, and the actors sometimes seem to wait for an audience response, but otherwise this program is good. I highly recommend this program and I am very sorry that it has been canceled. please make another series and finish it correctly
