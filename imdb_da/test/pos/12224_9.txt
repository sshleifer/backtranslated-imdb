I am constantly amazed at the American networks. What's with them? Yet another very promising series is increased after only 15 episodes, and we are not knowing what the hell is going on with everyone. I really enjoyed this show thoroughly and am so annoyed that we will never find out what happens to the characters and the "monsters" from the depth. This show had everything. Humor, excitement, action. What more can you have. Why oh, why did you take it on? It just doesn't make sense. Buffy went on to 7 series, which were Charmed and enjoyable as they were, Surface, Invasion and Dead Like Me were even better. Just because a show doesn't get terribly loud, doesn't mean it's nonsense, and if they gave it a little longer, more people would probably get it, and they would end up with a big hit on their hands. A season just doesn't allow enough time to catch and the network is far too eager to pull the plug. They must learn it as fine wines and cheeses they take time to mature. <br /> <br /> Take the surface and invasion back - P L E A S E !!!!!!!
