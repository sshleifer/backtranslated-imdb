Doctor Who is fantastic. There is everything 'head to'. It must be. The boys will like monsters and action and adventure and the girls will like the feelings and feelings that go around. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was extraordinary as Rose Tyler. She was so emotional and made Rose so genuine. <br /> <br /> David Tennant is also so witty and funny, and it's so much fun to watch. <br /> <br /> But now Billie has left and Rose is stuck on a parallel universe with her on-off girlfriend Mickey and her mother and father (he died when Rose was a baby, but this Pete Tyler is from Parallel the universe). It will be very strange that Martha is the new companion, whom I have only seen with Rose (Except the Runaway Bride with Catherine Tate). <br /> <br /> Freema better be good !!! <br /> But no one can beat Rose !!!
