I saw the 'Begotten' last night and I have two minds on the movie. On the one hand, I appreciate it being the overall reverse of a Michael Bay movie. No dialogue, extremely stylized grainy B&W photography, some of the most truly horrific images ever set for film, and a very convincing use of sound (which no one else seems to have really downloaded yet). It is a reflection on a theme, and it dares to go where most filmmakers are not only in the form of pictures, but about production and concept. It's a movie that most people don't understand, and if you read through those comments, you'll find a lot of people whose inability to figure out this movie results in them screaming for 'pretentiousness' with a gibbon rattling bars in the cage at the time of feeding. It was really shocked and disturbed, and last time a movie managed to do it a while ago. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is a thirty minute card that spreads out over an hour and a half. I understand that there can be artistic merit by using repetition and monolithic pacing as a bludgeon, but in this case it not only helps everything. Imagine being approached by a ragged man in the street digging your shoulders and saying something that completely disrupts the essence of your being ... but then, instead of leaving your broken and gibbering in his club, he just keeps Speak and speak and speak. At the end of the movie I found myself looking at my watch over and over again. <br /> <br /> This is not entertainment, people. This is disentertainment. How to program people who have just seen "Glitter". If you see movies being entertained, it will frustrate, confuse and possibly anger you. You do not approach 'Begotten' as a chocolate cake you want to eat because it tastes good. You approach it as something on the menu you've never heard of before, something you see furtive glances through the kitchen door, something that is dark and glistens and shrinks on its plate; something you order not because it will taste good but because you just need to know how it is.
