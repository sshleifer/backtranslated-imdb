Mel Brooks has really surpassed this movie. No one can deny that Blazing Saddles was a classic and a breakthrough in this style of comedy film, but Men in Tights has become the top of his creative genius. This movie is a definite must-see. If you enjoy this movie, I would also recommend Space Balls and History of the World. The same goes in reverse. If you've seen any of these movies, men in tights should be next on your list.
