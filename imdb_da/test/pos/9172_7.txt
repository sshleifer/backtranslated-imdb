While the concept of "date doctor" is the only thing that saves this movie from being an otherwise average romantic comedy with a standard character for the genre, I found it comfortable enough to raise my mind about it so I ended up suffering it a lot more than if it had had a mediocre plot without many twists. Will Smith does a good job as always, acting as Hitch, the man who uses his life to advise men, how and how to not win over women ... ever since his failed attempt to keep his college girlfriend . There are lots of laughs as he tries to help his latest patient, obese, asthmatic Albert Brennman (Kevin James) successfully the beautiful colleague Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta). Also, when he decides to get rid of a woman, he meets in a turkey hanger who just doesn't seem to get her not wanting him and he finds himself attracted to Sara (Eva Mendes) - it seems that Be a great act for him so I guess since college he never actually practiced his own rules about himself. Unfortunately, Sara is a gossip collector who is interested in the "Doctor of Doctor" who got a seemingly helpless guy like Albert along with Allegra - especially after player / jerk Vance Munson (Jeffrey Donovan) breaking her best friend (Julie Ann Emery) heart and suggesting the date The doctor he then inhibited him when she did not realize he refused to see him. Still, the problems follow, and Hitch is stuck and wondering what to do with his own relationship, without much help to Albert when trying to find out more about him. The action is good, there is a lot of humor and some other fine points with meaning. Hitch's character is witty and clever, sometimes ready to be both at once. True, the misunderstanding where the woman is confronted with something that the man has not really done (why do they always show it?) Is, as usual and annoying, guessing that it would not have been if it was 1. not 5. Once I have seen IT - but the rest of them were brand new. I only wish this movie was longer - I remember being able to watch 3/5 of it while playing on a restaurant tv once - but I still approve. It is definitely worth the money to pay for its briefness.
