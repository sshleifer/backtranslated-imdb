Wow, this movie is amazing. It's such an excellent movie. Have some sick scenes (almost not as sick as Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie) some nudity, and this was the movie's debut on film! This has set the stage for many of the Tromas films, this is a very tromatic movie. It mixes comedy, romance and my favorite, HORROR / GORE! Not so much to do in this flick, but enough to satisfy. This is the best fit of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Much better than any other version. They make it so entertaining and fun to watch. And we have Debbie Rochon ... hehe ... I like her. :) All I have to say is, it's a good movie, very funny, and Lemmy is a good host for it. The action is good, and Kaufman looks stylish as always. Must watch for all FAITHFANS!
