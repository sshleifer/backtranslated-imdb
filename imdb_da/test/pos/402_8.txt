Better than average "who-dun-it" with Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist, now called Robert Ordway, helping both the police and criminals who want to go straight. Crime Doctor's Courage is the fourth in the 10th series and also involves a victim who may have some mental problems. The link to "courage" is not very clear. <br /> <br /> This post is about the death teller's death, Gordon Carson, whose two former wives have under mysterious circumstances and who, in turn, die in a locked room under conditions similar to suicide, but Dr. Ordway marks murder. Hillary Brooke plays part of the widow Kathleen Carson, who is involved in Anthony Caruso - a mysterious Spanish dancer whose action includes his sister who disappears on stage. As a mystery writer, Jerome Cowan is a good supportive actor, as Lloyd Corrigan is as an aficionado in crime. Spooky houses with crushing doors, caps in the basement and suspects never seen in daylight add to the tension air. The set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music is very good. Direction, production design and photography stand out. The exterior shots and costumes suggest more prosperity than ordinary "B" detective thriller. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
