One of my favorite movies from all times I have seen it three times already. It does a good job of summarizing Isrelai walks, Israeli humor and seriousness, and many of the problems that the Israelis are going through. Universal theme that wants to be accepted and accepted by who you are. Good subtle humor, and it's the charism of the characters that make this movie magic, and says a lot about Isrlaei culture and irnonicness, contradictions and humor, with a great actor in it, Oshri Cohen. I highly recommend it to anyone and it is a movie that is perfect for almost any family movie, girlfriend / girlfriend movie and also says apart from Israeli culture who wants to be accepted, most of all how important the family is with all its diversity and imperfections. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie.
