Although I'm not crazy about musicals, COVER GIRL is a pleasure for classic movie buffs and especially for fans of Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. The movie may be dated to today's standards, and the story and songs may not be special, but musical numbers are wonderfully tuned and there is a great cast to go with the movie. Plus, the movie is a worthy introduction to fans of Rita Hayworth ... she is simply breathtaking in glorious Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Despite Jerome Kern's collaboration with the film, his music here is not as close or special as memorable as his songs in SWING TIME (1936), but the songs serve the film well. The dance is nothing short of excellent, especially from Gene Kelly's solo song and my favorite music number, "Alter-Ego Dance". The funny Phil Silvers almost steals the movie as Kelly's partner. Otto Kruger, Eve Arden and Edward Brophy perform well in their dramatic supporting roles. And Rita plays a cute, charming girl here; a role far from her femme fatale babes in films such as BLOOD AND SAND (1941). All in all, this is a lovely movie that is worth seeing even if you are not great at musicals. But the movie's music could have been more memorable if only my favorite period songwriters, Irving Berlin or Cole Porter, wrote the songs for this movie. But it is the wonderful Technicolor film and the imaginative dance that is the right treat for the film's production. <br /> <br /> While I saw Rita Hayworth, doing her thing, I don't think I've ever seen a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen since I saw Moira Shearer in Michael Powell's masterpiece, THE RED SHOES (1948) . Just see Rita in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her.
