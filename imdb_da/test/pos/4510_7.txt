I found a good story of loyalty, cowardice, fraud and redemption, with a brief insight into Afghanistan's recent history, from a peaceful period of the 70s to the present days of the Taliban. The actors and actors have good performances that give credibility to the realistic story. The dry places in China remind us of the pictures we see on television from Afghanistan. Eventually I found "The Kite Runner" a good movie. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Ca√ßador de Pipa" ("The Kite Chaser")
