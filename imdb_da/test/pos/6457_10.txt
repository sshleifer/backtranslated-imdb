I first saw this movie on cable in the 80s, and it rocked me to the core. It appeared again on television about six months ago. <br /> <br /> Film-based on-site depicts the black and white filmography graphically 1950s New York as the gritty "urban jungle" at a time when there was far more industry and port activity in the city, especially in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes always brought a special intensity to his acting and is magnificent in the role of the army dodger. His short 1959 TV series "Johnny Staccato" is also a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier and (later in the movie) bring Ruby Dee freshness and vitality to their roles. But it is Jack Ward's outstanding play as the evil, brutal shift manager who grabbed my attention. To get an idea of ​​Warden's versatility, watch this movie, check out a 1962 episode of the television series "Naked City" entitled "Specter of the Rose Street Gang (available on video)." If you are a fan of film noir, this is a must see. Enjoy!
