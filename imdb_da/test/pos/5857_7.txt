I knew a bit of this movie when I entered the theater for an advance screening. I collected from the ads that it was a thriller. <br /> <br /> What we have is that "Compulsion" meets "Matlock". Two teenagers decide to commit a perfect murder. A victim is randomly selected and performed so carefully that there are no traces of the actual killers. Then a bunch of false leaders are planted pointing to an innocent bystander. (Innocent of the murder anyway) <br /> <br /> Enter Sondra Bullock as investigative officer. (IMDB says she is the FBI, but I don't remember. I thought she was a regular policeman) She is frustrated by the lack of conformity of the killer profile ("The profile does not fit the profile!") And by power and influence from one of the boy's father. <br /> <br /> She also has her own demons, highlighting in her decision to become a policeman. But this is the only character that really is more than one-dimensional. Everyone else is pretty flat. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, there is really no great excitement. It's mostly a cat-and-mouse game as an episode of "Matlock" (which she sees at some point in the movie). Twist is that there are two involved in the killing. Just who is the real killer Justin or Richard? It costs you eight dollars to find out.
