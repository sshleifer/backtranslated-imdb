SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The reason is forgettable, the satire is light and the action sequences, although well organized, are not so exciting. But I laughed. A lot. Credit goes to the inspired mating of De Niro and Murphy. They have good chemistry. Murphy delivers single-liners, De Niro cracks us up with a glance or grimacing. This movie gets a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you are a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you will enjoy this movie.
