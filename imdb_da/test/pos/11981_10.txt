Don't let the score of 5.9 (as of this writing on 8/22/2002) fool you, this is an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> I cannot understand how such an assessment has been given, being so solid at all levels. The direction, acting, movies - all good. The story is interesting and original and my only incentive to understand why the assessment is such is the fact that it is probably the type of movie that people's judgment usually can't normally see. <br /> <br /> It equates to playing modern rock for an 80 year old. You can be young, bred on it and love it, but he or she hasn't been and as a product of another time and taste - doesn't take care of it. <br /> <br /> If you like movies and can handle movies based more on real people versus those of thoughtless action, huge flashy budgets and mediocre talent, give this one a chance the next time you see it ... <br /> <br />
