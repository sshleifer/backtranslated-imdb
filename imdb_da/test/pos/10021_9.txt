A gem of a cartoon from the silent era --- it was rediscovered by CARTOON NETWORK and was probably broadcast for the first time in decades if ever. <br /> <br /> What makes this fun is the varied cameos ... Douglas Fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitoes; Will Hays visits a visit as "Chief" of Static Studios; as well as performances by Chaplin, Keaton and William S. Hart. The picture of chewing gum that decimates the shoe of the people (a money-making idea for Felix's near-bankruptcy = salesman manager) cannot be described - it must be seen. A wonderful cultural gem.
