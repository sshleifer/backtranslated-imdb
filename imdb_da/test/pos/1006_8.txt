[Contains SPOILERS !!!] <br /> <br /> Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a rut. They had virtually no life at all. Everything they did was lying around and counting the ceiling tiles. Jon even organized his sock tray by color and fabric. He needed a life. Then he consultes a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. A single bar was a good place to start. Unfortunately, when the music started and Jon hit the dance floor, we see what made disco die: Jon killed it. Next time Jon tried to pick up girls in the video store. He ended up feeling down in his mouth. Literally. The washing machine was no price, even when Jon and his wild date got a glimpse of each other's underwear. Jon tried to trade everything on the beach on the beach, but soon he was angry with a real shame that left Jon feeling in his mouth again. Literally. Jon then tried to gather girls walking and jogging past. No use. Jon pulled out a guitar and sings the blues. Unfortunately, when he mentioned that his cat was fat, a fat man went up and bumped into Jon's guitar. It was hopeless. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Jon, an ad flashed on the TV: an ad for Lorenzo's School of Personality Impaired. It guaranteed a lifeless person to have a life in a few simple steps. Jon and Garfield attend the class. The building didn't work exactly as it did on television, nor did Lorenzo act as peppy as he did on television. Jon sat next to a beautiful girl named Mona. So while Lorenzo taught his lessons to introduce yourself, check your heart rate and pretend to speak a foreign language, Jon and Mona get to know each other. They go together and forget about Garfield. In the home, Jon and Mona sat on the porch and talked. Garfield was jealous of Mona for fear that she would take Jon away from him. Garfield imagined the future: Jon and Mona get married, she enters, and soon she is born to a small Arbuckle who is happy to draw Garfield's story. Back to the present, Garfield wouldn't stand it. He tried to get Jon to get rid of Mona until she started scratching behind her ears. But then Jon learned that Mona was allergic to cats. So it was basically the end of their relationship. But they still saw each other, and Garfield was sure to be with them. <br /> <br /> Another fun Garfield TV special! This was made during the TV's Garfield and Friends. Garfield was worn down somewhat. Something. Comics since the early 1980s. The scenes in Jon trying to collect chickens are fun, so is the one where the fat guy stumbles on Jon's guitar. Good ol 'Lorenzo Music is back as Garfield. Thom Huge is Jon. Frank Welker (the third man with 1,000 votes) is Lorenzo. And June Foray (the woman with 1,000 votes) is Mona. If you like Garfield, I recommend you watch Garfield get a life today! It's with Garfield and Garfield on Town, just released on DVD! So check them all out today! You are guaranteed a good time. Hey, has Garfield ever settled down? <br /> <br /> -
