A beautifully constructed and brilliantly recorded comedy. There is no one in the cast who does not free himself (or himself) with the fun distinction. The real star of the movie, however, is the invisible director, Frank Oz, who brings all the madcap sensitivity and joke to this farce, which he brought to Miss Piggy's encounters with the Kermit frog. This is a not-to-be-missed movie.
