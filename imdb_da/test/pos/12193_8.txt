It has very little to do with the books: half of the characters have been eliminated, the reason has changed a lot, people's parents change to different characters. . . <br /> <br /> But if you see it as an independent piece (try to forget you ever read the books), the movie is very well put together, everyone is very nice, and there is even a cute ending ...
