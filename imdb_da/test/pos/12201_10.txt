I have seen the whole season one and can say that I have not had a show of this standard for a long time, it is great to see a show like this along the way and hope that there are many on the way to the season finale was best bar no can wait for season 2, as far as i am holding things can only get better as how will milles continually change will rick get his family back and how will they get out of church work to shop at this level it is easy to see why the show is so big hit with people, as long as people who show shows like this, i want to keep an eye on, i find it difficult now to come up with an original idea, as so many shows have covered a large selection of topics so that See one as original as this is refreshing
