This twisted comedy is well-groomed and straightened. Very fun and the production quality is excellent. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted for so many festivals and won awards. <br /> <br /> Everyone can identify with Calvin with a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role excellent! Richard Moll as Tim brings dark and vain, giving this movie just the right twistedness. The old man adds the humor of history. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish! <br /> <br /> This short will bring lots of laughs. And don't miss the credits as they play at the end!
