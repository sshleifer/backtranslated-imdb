The best Batman movie from the 90s is without a doubt about it. This movie takes place in a city filled with insecurity and nightmares. Although the villain is a cheese, they fit perfectly into the film's tone in colorful but nightmare filmography. <br /> <br /> The performance is really good and the comic book behind them really lives up to expectations. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the cheesy outfits, this is a movie in the pure style of Burton. It cannot be described; Burton is a sui generis director who took the Batman franchise to another unclear level but didn't forget it's cartoon style past. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of action cinema and best of all, if it is about superheroes.
