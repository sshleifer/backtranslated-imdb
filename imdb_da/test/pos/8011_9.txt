I saw this show for my puberty, but I still found it to reflect many situations that worry us when we are teenagers, even though it was a family oriented show. Until the mid-1990s, it focused more on young adults and their situations. That's why I loved "Step by Step". I mean, it offered situations of all ages and unlike many shows of it's sweet, it delivered expectations. Let's be honest; This was not a very fun show, no, but it had some situations that you could feel related to, but only fun. There was an extremely good charm between Patrick Duffy and Susan Sommers. Duffy rocket! Sommers were tender and actually fun. I was in love with Stacy Keegan because she was extremely sexy (loved her legs) and witty. But Sasha Mitchell stole the show with her Cody character. He was the man back today! Oh, the memories. Today, this show has not been able to be sufficiently accurate on the new generations, and therefore it should be kept in memory memory. That's it, only memories. <br /> <br /> Thank you step by step for making my puberty more fun.
