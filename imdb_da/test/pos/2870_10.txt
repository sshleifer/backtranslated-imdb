Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burnt old hotel where eight teenage prisons go to do something clean. Most of them die except 3 of them. In my case it was not the best writing or the best ever. I still thought the killing scenes were really well done. Like when one girl is eaten by the hungry dogs. The best thing was to be when he pushed the mobile phone down into the blonde girl's mouth. Kane was a serious horror movie actor, he had this serious view of the whole movie and it would never change. It was his only look at the whole movie. Great acts and killing scenes, I don't think I could give it a full 10 out of 10, but 6 seems good.
