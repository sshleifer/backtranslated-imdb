This was an interesting movie ... half-comedy, half-political thriller. It had many good features, though it was a little predictable. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams stars like Tom Dobbs, a popular comedian with a hit show where he gives political comment. Think Daily Show with John Stuart. During the loss of one of his shows, a woman in the audience tells him to run for president. It was followed by a few jokes taken seriously all that was needed to get the ball rolling and start Dobbs' political career. <br /> <br /> He runs independently and opposes Democrats and Republicans equally. He is straightforward and honest, and is becoming increasingly popular - but perhaps not popular enough to actually win. He is clearly underdog in this election. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a corrupt software company has set up a program to vote much faster and easier for ordinary people - but there is a mistake. The glitch is discovered by a young lady named Elanor (Linnley) who is appetized by the software developer with a lie that he got to disappear before the upcoming election. <br /> <br /> The election day comes around and see and see, Dobbs is declared the winner. (Big Surprise!) Elanor knows he's not really the president - he doesn't win legitimately - she decides to tell the president ... but complications arise. Her company went as far as poisoning her to blackboard her. In addition, she quickly likes Dobbs. <br /> <br /> The reason is taking a few turns before reaching a slightly predictable conclusion. But it never got boring. Robin was great as usual, and Christopher Walken often stole the show as Dobbs' leader-reverse-political adviser and best friend. <br /> <br /> It's an entertaining movie and it has a good message. I recommend it if you are in the mood for dark satire or something that makes you think. Overall I give it a 7/10.
