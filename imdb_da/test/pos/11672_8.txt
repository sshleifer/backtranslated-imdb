This is one of the best movies made about the 80 punk scene. I saw this a few years back on a "bootleg" copy and was amazed at it. Very few of today's children know the true roots of the punk, and this film shows some of the 80's punk legend as The Germs and shows how it was then. Today, so much punk has become common with MTV and radio, and it is great to see the original scene's true underground rebellious movement. Darby Crash (of The Germs) is one of my heroes, and this movie shows why. One must look for all the "punks" and any curious after the 80s punk scene
