Mickey Mouse is now 75 years old. He was created by Walt Disney, a famous creator, producer, director, etc.: I love the Disney movies because it is fun to see the comic books. Altogether Walt Disney, I think, is the King of Creations. Everyone has to love these creations and films by Walt Disney. Thank you Walt for all the classic characters you made.
