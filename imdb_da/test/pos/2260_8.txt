Having not read the book, I was more open to the free interpretation that each director gives to their medium (which is film, not "to the letter" reproductions of literature) on this film. I was glad that the Holocaust that took place in Russia (and its neighboring country) finally got some attention. The Nazis were extremely cruel to Russians and Russian Jews. If you read the stories and see the monuments built in Smolensk and nearby regions, you understand this movie and why many kept quiet when they should have spoken. <br /> <br /> It was definitely time to get chronic and I hope more stories come out of this. It's about time.
