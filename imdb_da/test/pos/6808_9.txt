A sentimental, heart-dragging family film in England from the 1920s. A young Elizabeth Taylor wins a horse at an idle and decides to enter the Grand National; Luckily, ex-jockey Mickey Rooney is around to give Liz some help. Director Clarence Brown shows some remarkable control over material that could have been excessive maudlin in the hands of others. He and the writers Helen Deutsch and Theodore Reeves take great care in creating true characterizations and developing the story naturally. It is true that there are one or two scenes that seem a little forced, but generally it is quite influenced and gorgeously recorded in Technicolor. The race itself is quite exciting, and like so many great classics there is a fantastic, three-hankie fade-out at the end. Liz shows that she was a real trooper right from the start, and Rooney - which I usually find rather annoying - is surprisingly subdued and really very good. Donald Crisp is horrible as Liz's grandfather and Angela Lansbury are a delight as their older, boyish sister. Most of the acting kudos, however, belong to Anne Revere, who won a really deserving entertaining actress Oscar who plays Liz's clever and caring mother.
