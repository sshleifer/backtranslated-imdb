I originally saw this movie, while I was working as a musician by making musical theater in summer. If you've ever done some work in the theater - especially in a summer theater - you'll really enjoy this movie. Yes, there are some moments of really bad writing in the movie, but overall it's a lovely tribute to the theater and why people love it.
