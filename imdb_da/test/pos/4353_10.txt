The questions and answers of the human spirit are all here in this masterfully crafted historical documentary. The crooked beauty and destiny of a man goes through life, revealed in totality. Dieter and Herzog are combined and connected via a mental labyrinth that has been transformed into a single straight corridor where the walls have been patched with images created by a man's characterization of himself by vibrations of his own vocal chords. This movie, for approx. 80 minutes, has discovered a new dimension of the story. What do I call this apparently new meaning. Only God knows that it is not a MIRACLE that God does for us, but chooses to remain ANONYMOUS? <br /> <br /> This is a requirement to see. If you like to experience the wonderful war of war, this documentary will cleanse your soul to the stomach.
