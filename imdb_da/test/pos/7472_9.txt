I saw this movie yesterday. I must admit - I love it! It's like early Tarantino, but better. Really a must, but ... don't show this movie to anyone younger than 18 years old. It is full of blood and sex (the rape scene is great :)). Now I'm just waiting for other movies from this director and a DVD release.
