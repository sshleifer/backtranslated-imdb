I just watched this movie and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it keeps your full attention, plays are amazing, Tom Wilkinson was great and Emily Watson was also very good. A really good movie about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the trials to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor provides a show that makes you feel the character's anxiety and suffering. Emily Watson's character is very strong and she only has to give a quick overview and you understand everything. I don't want to say more because it's better because you have to go into the story as it unfolds.
