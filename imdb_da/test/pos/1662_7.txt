You can take the villain out of the joint, but it seems much harder to remove the cormorant from the villain. We have seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before (and since): in movies like LE FLAMBEUR, ELEVATOR FOR GALLOWS, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI, ANDERSON TAPES, etc. Too many times to mention. What helps to make this one a more remarkable one is (of course) the heist himself, who plays out wordless in real-time and management's settlement. Bogart would think twice before crossing this guy. The ironic end is perfectly suited to this story (it almost requires it). Everywhere, one of the better movies noir.
