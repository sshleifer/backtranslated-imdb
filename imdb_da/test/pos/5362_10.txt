It's the kind of movie they used to make, entertaining, heart-warming, worrying, authentic, with convincing notions of people without a nose job, boob job, eye job, in other words real people. Shauna Macdonald plays the female love interest and she is so genuine you will give her a pet at least. Imagine it, a real girl in a movie, anything next? Hollywood would hate her because her freshness is a sharp accusation for every fake starlet in Tinseltown. This story has the same fun feeling as Sandy Mackendrick's classic "Whiskey Galore", with the gnomic humor of remote Scottish islanders, punishing the intrigues of the invaders from outside and enjoying a good dram from time to time (the actual intervals between those times are often rather short ). Director Stephen Whittaker shows a rare skill pulling it straight out and it's shocking to find that he died before his film release, just 56 years old, which was clearly a significant loss to the screen. Ulrich Thomsen does very well by playing a German rocket researcher, who in the late 1930s goes to Scarp in the Isle of Harris to build a small rocket to carry mail packages between the islands. There he falls in love with the prolonged Macdonald lass, and she reproduces love. Some wonderfully colorful local characters decorate the tale, and the movie is pure pleasure. There is, of course, the threat of impending war with Hitler, and we learn that Hitler executed 1000 rocket scientists who refused to build war weapons, which is a shocking statistic. Tragic love is never far from the view, but the lips must remain sealed in a review of what happens in the end. This movie is a magnificent example of just the kind of movie that people in Britain have to do. But are they properly released? In a nation whose taste has been so damaged by reality TV shows, where abominable nonentities have become the national heroes, is there even a market anymore for a movie like this? After all, there is no laughing gender, there are no close-ups of restorative wounds or of any genitals, there are no drugs taken, there are no thoughtless celebrities boasting and looking at, and wondering if there is anything To interest an audience that has become so decadent and abandoned that only the most extreme sensations can briefly relieve their present-day existence. Anyone looking for an antidote to the modern UK vacuum can take refuge in this refreshing and honest movie.
