I do not understand why it is so undervalued on IMDb .. This movie is just perfection .. The better fit of all times of the myth of Tarzan! As a French, I can say that this is Christophe Lambert's better role, ridiculous in a lot of movies, but here wonderful, charismatic, incredible! The grounds are great, well told, the story magnificent, the direction, the atmosphere, the music, everything is perfect! How do these sequences with Elgar music, just simply perfect .. Greystoke is really an incredible movie, underestimated here, I don't really know why but really appreciated
