I just watched this movie for the second time with my 8-year-old daughter, and I remembered why we liked it the first time. All those people who say it's bad are too busy and critical! It's simply an entertaining little movie, it's not supposed to change the world. I thought all the actors did a good job with their characters. (Except for Jeremy Jordan as Guy - he was a maggot who so seriously needed soap and shampoo. If HE were to be the hot guy in their school, then they have slim pickins. -Drew Barrymore was lovely, as usual, and David Arquette was even entertaining, and I usually can't stomach him if only the STUPID AT&T commercials were, Molly Shannon is always entertaining and Leelee Sobieski did a good job as a tortured brain, some parts were actually painful to see On, remind me of high school, although fortunately I did not get fun, it made my heart hurt for those who do. Movies like this are actually good for kids to see - my daughter made several observations about the cruelty of some students and where This film is suitable for everyone, and a good way to stay away for 2 hours If you ever want to see a light-haired little movie with a good ending where you don't have to think much, then it is definitely a consideration.
