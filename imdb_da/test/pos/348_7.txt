What do people expect when they see an Al Adamson movie? Do you expect the classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories? You would think of some of the reviews. All Adamson's movies are sweet and blurry and cheesy, not much more so if you go into them, knowing that it already helps, and they are not necessarily taken at face value, especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value. First of all, this begins by ripping end-themed music from Outside Borders so you know things look promising. This is the story of some wacko cult living in the hills, and while trying to raise a dead body, the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital. Of course, the nurse Sherri tends to his needs and everyone, and when an operation is needed, she just hangs out in the operating room when the guy goes on, so his spirit invades her. And Nurse Sherri is starting to change. No longer the good nurse she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects. There are a few small side stories going on as people try to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star who has become the object of love for one of Sherri's co-workers who also just happens to be dabble in voodoo. It's not bad if you're a cult movie fan, but it can be bad if you're a fan of "Spiderman" because you don't like it. At times, it actually goes in the direction of "respectability" (for Adamson, anyway), but then "unruly" itself with some ridiculous event. If you enjoy Adamson's movie and similar garbage, you may like it here, because everyone else who might be looking for a lost treasure continues to dig. 7 out of 10.
