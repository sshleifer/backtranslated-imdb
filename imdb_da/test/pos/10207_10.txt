I first saw this movie in the theater way back in the 40s when I was a kid and always remembered the end. There is nothing like the first impression, but some movies are always a treat every time they are seen. Something only resonates with them. This is one of those films, and I agree with another reviewer who said that Fritz Lang should have directed more Westerners. To add to that, I always wanted Randolph Scott and Robert Young. In fact, Robert Young is what I consider my favorite movie to be, just to mention one, not an easy thing to do. The movie is Northwest Passage. It led me to the amazing historical novels by Kenneth Roberts. Western Union also led me to read Zane Grey's novel, which in this case turned out to be one of the rare cases where I like the movie better than the novel. Not that Gry's novel is a bad one; I just like the movie story better. The movie is by no means similar to the novel. It's a completely different story, one of the greatest departures from a book I've seen. <br /> <br /> I can't add much to the other reviews except to say I agree with many of them. I would also like it to be released on DVD. "What happened to Randolph Scott happened to the best of me."
