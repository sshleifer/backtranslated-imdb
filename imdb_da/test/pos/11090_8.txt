"The belief in Big Other as an invisible power structure found in Real is the most clever definition of paranoia." ?? Slavoj Zizek <br /> This is a review of "Marathon Man" and "Falcon and the Snowman", two films by Director John Schlesinger. <br /> <br /> Although Hitchcock and Lang brought "conspiracy thriller" to Hollywood, only the genre flourished in the late 60s and 70s, with films like "The Parallax View", "Z", " Marathon Man "," Capricorn One "," The Manchurian Candidate "," Three Days of Condor "and" All the President's Men ". This was the age of Vietnam and Watergate, the public deeply suspicious of all political leaders. The genre remained silent in the 80s and early 90s until the "X Files" television series was spread to life. With taglines such as "The truth is out there" and "Trust in nobody", the series represented a world of huge conspiracies and government plots, the common man with the mercy of all manners of ridiculously elaborate arrangements. The only way out of the maze? "Fight the future!" as tagline of the series' last season proclaimed. It was our duty to trawl through the labyrinth of information and to discover any elusive "truth" that ensured our own freedom. This trend ended with the Internet boom, conspiracy buckets now giving way to "conspiracy documentaries". The Internet generation launched such independent documentaries as "Los Change" and "Zeitgeist", while Michael Moore in the mainstream titled his audience with things like "Fahrenheit 9/11". All of these documentaries believed in a "secret order," a solace of wealthy politicians and businessmen, conspiring to reduce human rights and enslave the world. They struggle to create a mono-myth that connects various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single, all-encompassing narrative that explains the purpose and meaning and future of everything. <br /> <br /> This need to "streamline stories" to make them more "effective" is reflected in the scientific community struggling to create a "Grand Unification Theory" and ultimately a "Theory of Everything" "which merges everything from Quantum Mechanics to Special Relativity into a huge, all-encompassing formula. /> <br /> In the end, "conspiracy thriller" is rooted in man's desire to have control. The modern subject is one that exhibits direct cynicism towards the official institutions, but at the same time believes in the existence of conspiracies (an invisible spirit pulls the strings). This seemingly contradictory link of cynicism and faith is strictly linked to the death of the great other. Its disappearance causes us to construct another of the other (conspiracy) to avoid the unbearable freedom that its loss causes. Conversely, there is no reason to take Big Other seriously if we believe in another of the other. We must therefore show cynicism and belief in equal opportunities. <br /> <br /> One seeks to assert control over a colorless universe to create a kind of foster childhood (be it God, a mathematical formula, a conspiracy theory, an explanation of violence / conspiracy / murder / war etc.) that makes sense and symbolic order. The great one gives assurances to the believer. It is a "lifestyle choice" that is related to religion, where his place in the world relies on pure irrationality. <br /> <br /> The problem with most "conspiracy players", from Hitchcock's "Topaz" innocent days right up to modern ticket like "The Da Vinci Code", is twice. First, they are not wrong by suggesting that something is "wrong" among "elite" or "best people", but they are incorrect in individualizing and personalizing processes that are social, collective and systemic, an approach that implies that it is just a matter of personal morality rather than social structures. Second, and most importantly, these "conspiracies" ignore the fact that Big Other simply does not exist. There is no symbolic order that pulls the strings. Some modern "conspirators" ("Eyes Wide Shut", "Existenz", etc.) Recognize this with their indelible paths of lies, calamities, truths, and half-truths, nothing ever added, nothing ever makes sense, the real and the hyper-realistic, the truth and the appetite, all blurred, without any identifiable groundnap, but it is most films from intellectuals. <br /> <br /> Compared to these modern "conspirators", "Marathon Man" and "Falcon and Snowman" are positive archaic. "Marathon Man" is about a graduate student (Dustin Hoffman) who gets involved in his big brother's business (Roy Scheider), who unfortunately has to deal with spies, weapons, double agents, diamonds and evil Nazi dentists. Scheider is suave, Hoffman is excellent, and Schlesinger hits us with some nice visual images (the Eiffel Tower is amazing), but what is most interesting about the movie is the way that its different plot lines do not cross until the 1 hour mark . Even then, it takes another half hour for things to start making sense. Unfortunately, the film ends with a cliché demonstration between the villain and the good guy, everything is exactly resolved and explained. <br /> <br /> "Falcon and Snowman" are a bit more ambitious. Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton play two friends selling state secrets to the Soviet Union. Hutton works with a civil defense contractor and smuggles information out of his office and into the hands of Penn, a small dealer who has no trouble selling to the KGB. Penn makes this strictly for the money, while Hutton is disillusioned with the US government (especially his attempt to deposit Australia's leader) and then sells the secrets strictly because he hates how his country is making crimes and espionage. In other words, the film is about a conspiracy that is performed in response to conspiracies. <br /> <br /> "Marathon Man" ?? 7.9 / 10 <br /> "Falcon and Snowman" ?? 8/10 <br /> Apart from a strange slapstick car crash and its cliché death, "Marathon Man" is an effective thriller with several nice scenes. "Falcon and Snowman" is even better, Penn turns in a memorable performance.
