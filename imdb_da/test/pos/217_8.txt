When I was young, I was a big fan of the Naked Gun movies, but recently I watched the Police Sqaud show! and I think it's amazing! Leslie Nielson is great, Alan North is cool and who is Rex Hamilton? But still, it's a fat-free show. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of this show when they freeze the frame scene during the final credits. I think my favorite is when Norberg (not O.J.) enters the scene, and he tries to fit in the freezer bag. Classic! <br /> <br /> The only problem for me is that the cigarette gag gets very old (when Drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks "Cigarette?" and the person answers "Yes, I know.") I think that they used it too many times regardless. <br /> <br /> Good play, good gags, great show! 10.7
