Renee Zellweger is clearly shining as a nurse Betty, who is easy to be one of the most charming, off-beat and light heart comedies of the year. When bisexual obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore testifies of her insensitive husband's murder of two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and believes that the cast members on a cause of love are genuine. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find the famous heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a sign of the show). As the two strangely mated Hitmen, the caustic rock and the pontificant Freeman create some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona. Renee Zellweger turns in an innocent candy-coated and sometimes terribly cute nurse Betty. She radiates goodness, warmth and is irresistible. While the script sometimes feels like a sit-com, is filled with sometimes incredible characters and constructed situations, Zellweger is so sympathetic and so utterly disarming that it all comes together. <br /> <br /> With just a few splashes of black comedy to keep things interesting, a winning performance from Zellweger, a great supporting cast and a competent script, the nurse Betty is absolutely delightful. 7 out of 10
