I can't see why all people give this movie negative reviews?!?! I loved this movie! Bled is a form of abstract art, and if you don't appreciate art, I can see why you didn't like this movie. It was a good twist from the average, played vampire movie. If you are looking for a fresh, new and brilliant new vampire movie then this is for you. But if you want one of them to turn into bats, wolves, and melts in the sunlight movies, watch your old Dracula flicks. Sure, it's a little on the low budget side, but they did a good job on the budget they had. I am very happy that I found this movie because I was about to give up on the vampire genre without good. I thought this movie was brilliant! I give 2 thumbs up to the author, the director and everyone involved in the movie.
