Warning contains spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Italian sleaze movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The site has a teenage girl who is interested in occultism and has supernatural powers. He is a member of the Satanist group and is afraid of the influence it will have on the girl. No one needs to worry, the girl just knows what to do and there is no return she belongs to satan .. <br /> <During the movie, odd things are done in typical Italian way, which is not too much logic, but is only good. It's amazing how entertaining these movies are .. At last fight we see her and her mother fighting each other (naked of course) and making some mysterious rituals, you can guess who wins ... The movie's final images give your mouth open and wander Why can't there be more movies like this? <br /> <br /> There is great music throughout the movie and the actors are quite good, better than usual in this type of movie. Especially Anne Heywood looks and works well. It also has something unusual camera a sparse and things like that, so it's not boring at all. My rating is 10. <br /> <br /> Hopefully someone publishes this on DVD.
