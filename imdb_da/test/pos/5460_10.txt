Although it is made for cable film from HBO, it is an enjoyable movie and a fascinating look at TV and TV commerce. Allowing the viewer to look behind the scenes of the so-called Sennat talk show war in the early 90s when Jay Leno and David Letterman competed for the coveted position of the Tonight Show. Kathy Bates gives a good performance as Lenos Mercurial Manager Helen Kushnick, and one can feel empathy for what Leno / Letterman endured in the hands of TV leaders. It's just as current now, given the recent events that involved ABC's failed attempt to replace Nightline with Letterman. No matter how many times I've watched this movie, I still find it so much a pleasure to see as I did when it first aired. If this were ever to be released on DVD, I would definitely add it to my collection.
