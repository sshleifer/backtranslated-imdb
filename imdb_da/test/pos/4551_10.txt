Peter Segal's 1995 commercial hit and now cult-classic 'Tommy Boy' is a hilarious movie, an evergreen entertainer. Chris Farley is a talent we will never forget !!! <br /> <br /> 'Tommy Boy' is a simple story, told in the funniest and most possible way. Farley & Spade takes a journey filled with unstoppable laughter, even though the Rob Lowe section is marvelous fun. As a child, I remember seeing 'Tommy Boy' again and again and again. It has been my childhood favorites and it will always remain. Even today, when it comes to T.V., I stick to it as a die-hard fan. I'm pretty possessive of this movie. <br /> <br /> Segal's direction is super. Chris Farley could have died in 1997, but at least lives alive. What an actor! See his work in 'Tommy Boy', he is so much comfortable. He delivered fantastic performances later in movies such as 'Berverly Hills Ninja' & 'Almost Heroes', but his work here remains as his best to date! Love you Farley! Spade, on the other hand, is as good as ever. He is an excellent actor in every respect! <br /> <br /> 'Tommy Boy' rules .... 100 thumbs up from this author!
