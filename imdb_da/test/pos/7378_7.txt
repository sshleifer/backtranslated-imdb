While driving in a dangerous zigzag way on a lonely road at night, teenager Cliff (Jay R. Ferguson) has a car accident with his friends Lauren (Christine Taylor), Alex (Kim Murphy) and Eric (Christopher Masterson). As the cold stretches in the woods around a bonfire, they kill time to tell ghost stories. In "The Honeymoon" the couple Rick (Ron Livingston) and Valerie (Jennifer MacDonald) travel in their RV to Las Vegas in their honeymoon. Rick takes a shortcut to visit Clayton Caverns at night, but alien Cole (Hawthorne James) advises them to leave the site as dangerous creatures attack people in full moon. In "People Can Lick To", on the eve of her twelfth birthday, Amanda (Alex McKenna) tells her internet friend Jessica that she is alone at home. However, Jessica is actually a psychopath. In "The Locket" biker Scott (Glenn Quinn) crosses the country on his motorcycle. When he has a problem with his bike, he finds an isolated house where the beautiful stupid Heather Wallace (Jacinda Barrett) lives with his father. When the man returns from his crew, Scott finds the truth about Heather. "Campfire Tales" presents three good horror stories with monsters, psychopaths and ghosts and a surprising twist in the end. The weakest segment is "The Hook", with Eddie and Jenny, but the other stories are amazing. The plot point is completely unexpected and gives a good conclusion to this above-average horror movie.
