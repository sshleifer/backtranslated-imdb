Altogether, Elijah Wood is playing Jonathan Foer, a Jewish American looking for the woman who rescued her grandfather during World War II. In a way, the woman who saved the whole family. <br /> <br /> This is a heart-shaped tale of someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey. A stranger in a foreign country so to speak. Jonathan is not fully prepared for this adventure, he sticks out like a tender thumb in Ukraine (he would probably stand out like a sore thumb anywhere). But what he discovers is more, much more than he had expected. This movie will make you laugh and make you cry. Elijah Wood is really good at this movie, based on the story of Jonathan Safran Foer. <br /> <br /> From somebody I spoke to, this movie is somewhat different from the book. A book I collect is really good. Nevertheless, it's a good movie, it has something for everyone, and I've really enjoyed it. Can anyone say Oscar?
