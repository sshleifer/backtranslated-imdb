My husband and I saw this last night ... It was wonderful .... For once he was wrong guessing already the exciting end. It moved very fast and the actor was great. I still love Tom Wilkinson. He never made a bad movie, as far as I'm concerned. The above description of his plays hits the seam on his head ... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is fantastic. We've just finished seeing all of the Prime Suspect series, and I'm convinced that the British have a way to catch the audience. There is no doubt that I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a few hours of thorough entertainment.
