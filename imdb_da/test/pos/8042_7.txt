This is definitely a quality movie with a classic cast. As for movies about Carlos Jackal, this Bruce Willis' weak action in 'The Jackal' strikes a bloody mass and then spits them on. I'm a little surprised that this movie hasn't attracted more votes, some of a "sleeper" of course. Too bad because this movie is definitely worth seeing. It's wise and never boring. See it, 7/10
