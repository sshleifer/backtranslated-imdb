Twenty years after seeing this, I still find myself quotes from this movie as "Look between the two giant melons" or I will start singing "Pabst Blue Ribbon Theme". On the other hand, 20 years later I can now make sense of the "Meat Machine" as there are still many stereotypes like this out there that they used for this movie. It's a sign of a good movie for me. I could say that this movie is the time test I can't really say for a lot of 80 movies. I continue to say that this film is still on a list of many people's favorite films as a child growing up in the 80s. If you like games and have dreams of becoming a "Game Master" or find yourself dorking beyond those 80's movies to relive your childhood, you should see this. It is also sometimes sarcastic and fun. But one thing is for sure about this movie, if anyone ever invites you to a "Great All-Nighter", they don't mean an X or sour party they mean, get ready for something Midnight Madness! Oh you want to see. Everyone wants to die to play! hehehehheh.
