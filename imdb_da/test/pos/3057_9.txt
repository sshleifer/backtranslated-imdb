Unfortunately, I have never seen the full version of this movie. I saw the 87-minute version twice back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully immense piece, filled with sweeping traces through into Andrejew's magnificent atmospheric set. Beautiful light by photographer Andr√© Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliant bizarre, full-blooded characterizations. George Sanders gives a polished performance while an eccentric millionaire (who turns out to be a rival racket) is admired by Agnes Moorehead. Also realize most of her role, Patricia Roc. The film was made in places in Spain in 1949.
