This show is amazing. Not only is "Haruhai Suzumiya" a very well written anime show, it also reflects things like philosophy, science fiction and a small religion. It is fun at some points and "sweet" (for lack of better term) at others. In fact, this may affect my lack of experience with Japanese anime shows, but it's one of the best of its genre I've seen. I should mainly give the credit to the author. I haven't seen such fantastic fantasy drawings in a TV show since the original Star Trek. I hope the authors continue to add strange new characters and give more insight into the already great characters that have been added. <br /> <br /> 9/10
