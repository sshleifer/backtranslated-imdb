I came out of the "Dark Blue World" feeling (sigh) 'so sad', but it was definitely a movie to be made and it is really well done from the Czech Republic. It is entertaining despite the "sad" premise. It is filled with emotions, the binding and unthinkable true friendship between the two protagonists - a mature lieutenant pilot (Ondrej Vetchý as Franta) and the young and ever avid budding pilot (Krystof Hádek as Karel), the inevitable love triangle, and now and then reminders of the wicked prison situations in Czechoslovakia in the 1950s. It is all in a film composed of the father's screenwriter and the director of the team Zdenek and Jan Sverák (former performance as the lovable "Kolya"). It is not as long as "East-West" (French "Est-Ouest") 1999, which was heartbreaking, multi-layered history of a returning Russian doctor and French wife's accidents after World War II in Russia. Plot of "Tmavomodrý svet" (title in Czech) is quite straightforward and has sprinklers of light humor. Music, World War II songs, England sang in Czech, modest special effects of pilots and air craft in the sky - not extensively as Hollywood - there is no need to be bing, bang, boom all the time when showing air combat scenes. The sad was explained at the beginning in the beginning (two sections in English) and wrapped with follow-up paragraphs. The film is not completely subtitled, only when translating Czech conversations - the rest is in English, be it very British or in Czech accents. (So ​​it is a foreign language with English language and includes British actors.) <br /> <br /> The three leading performances, especially the two Czech pilots, were wonderfully delivered. There are nuances between the two of them, though it is the ever-maturing against the eager young people. I always appreciate Tara Fitzgerald: Yes, there is "Brassed Off" in 1996 as opposed to Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite; remembered her from "Listen to my song" 1991 as opposed to Adrian Dunbar and Ned Beatty; In contrast to Hugh Grant in "Sirens" in 1994 and "The Englishman Who Went Up to Hill and Came Down a Mountain" in 1995, in addition to her appearances in the PBS Masterpiece Theater mini series. <br /> <br /> "So sad" - the fact that heroes defending their country can be so insane and so long (40 years). Thank goodness for valuable memories and the unpredictable friends. Therefore, pause for a sunbeam through a stained glass window (ironic or accidental that it is of a church where the hard work took place) - symbolic of hope, never give up? <br /> <br /> Other recent films that need stories: "Kandahar" (with Nelofer Pazira as Nafas, the Canadian from Afghanistan taking a trip to Kandahar with a personal mission "in mind") more than meets the eye a burqa by the Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. "Everything put together" (with Radha Mitchell as new mother against SID - sudden infant death) insights from Swiss director Marc Forster, and his much talked about controversial movie "Monster's Ball" (I have not yet caught) with Halle Berry, Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Boyle. Watch the movies without prior expectations or comparisons with movies before. Just see it.
