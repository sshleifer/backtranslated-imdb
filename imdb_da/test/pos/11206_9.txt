When you look distant, you know that you do not see a French movie, there is little sex and it is most elliptical, and people do not speak so much here. There are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations just to make you understand what is happening. Nor does it look American, there are no car gates or shootings or violence unless you consider killing a mouse an act of blood or the daily tension of having a subdued disaster. At times, the relatively prolonged mid-range images remind you of 'contemplative' Asian cinema, but remind you, but the director does not push things into radical minimalism in some Taiwanese filmmakers, but again it is not a Taiwanese movie, it's a Turkish movie. I don't know what that means, I don't even know if it should matter. The film does not have a plot properly and yet, the few lines, the somewhat protracted durable shots and the often diminished tension gradually create a feeling of something that happens, a sense of 'plot' because a better word is missing that grows on you . At the end of the movie you can get the feeling that you will miss the two cousins ​​who have many things in common, but are worlds apart.
