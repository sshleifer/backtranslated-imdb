WALLACE & GROMIT: VÃ„RRABBITENS COURSE (2005) **** (Votes: Peter Salis, Ralph Fiennes Helena Bonham Carter) <br /> <br /> Amazing Fever of Clay: Wallace & Gromit Save the Day! Crackin 'Good Entertainment! <br /> <br /> Nick Park, the creator of the animated team Wallace & Gromit, is a genius. His meticulous art in the form of Plasitine claymation is a unique process that involves literally thousands of hours (it takes about an 8-hour workday to contribute 3 minutes of action to a movie; this foray in feature-length storytelling took 5 years!) make his lovable masterful and loyal dog team form is finally on the big screen in the duo's first full-length movie and it's cracklin good (to put together a sentence from Wallace's usual answer to all good!) <br /> <br /> Park, who starred with Steve Box and co-author with Mark Burton and Bob Baker, sending the frightening genre into this rollickingly fun and fast-paced action comedy with the geeky inventive Wallace (pronounced by British veterinarian Thespian Salis) and his mute but loyal (and sharper) mutt Gromit (all furling eyebrows and mouth-less insufficiency) has devised a service for their community: Fighting pests ("Anti-Pesto" as they are known) to the upcoming Giant Vegetable Festival, which has the whole city in the mo od for all things vegetative a gigante and the biggest pesk are troublesome rabbits who eat the scarce goods. Wallace's ingenuity has created a vacuum container that is fast, efficient and more importantly harmless to the sweet pest that plagues the estate of Lady Campanula Tottington (pronounced by Bonham Carter, making a quick break to be the first lady for stop-motion animation what With her earlier being "Corpse Bride" a few weeks ago) who is home to the competition and is a love interest for Nerdy Wallace. <br /> <br /> The only fly-in-the-ointment is vainglorious, bombastic highland and jerk Victor Quartermaine (pronounced by Fiennes, his first attempt at the animated art comes over as Patrick Stewart lunged braggard with hilarious results), a bad toupeed wearing macho moron who is planning to marry Lady Tottington for her wealth while being a main competitor for W & G's humane trials by resorting to his trustworthy guns and nasty bulldogs. To add insult to injury, the duo faces a terrible situation in the form of a big rabbit (the titular monster a good nod to bot h Universal and Hammer horror flicks) who terrorize the village and devour every veggie in sight. The two set out to trap and dispose of the creature, but there is more than anything that meets the eye as things progress. <br /> <br /> Ruthlessly fun and with such fantastic elastic and kinetic energy for its wonderful clay models, Park and Box has created a truly magical and very entertaining movie with so much incredibly detailed production design for their small world that it can Take more than one screening to absorb how much effort into their blood, sweat and tears have gone into making this instant classic for kids of all ages. <br /> <br /> Wallace, the Eastern loving balding inventor, could easily be Homer Simpson's British cousin with his rotated body and constant ability to get it wrong while trying to do the right thing; his heart is in the right place, but his head is in the clouds. His sweet crush for Lady Tottington (which resembles a pre-plastic surgery Carol Burnett), which is head higher than our hero, may be reminiscent of their first pristine love with a smile of awkward shooting. His Rube Goldberg-like gift to make the complicated relief is inspired by lunacy, which fans will remember from the earlier shorter films "The Wrong Trousers", "A Close Shave" and "A Grand Day Out". <br /> <br /> But in my opinion, the wise, silent and long-suffering Gromit, his poached egg eyes with slow burns and disbelief in what transpires, is one of the best animated characters ever created with such a fantastic Arsenal of enchanted, mouth-watering expressions and subtle nuances that most live-action actors would kill in order to attempt to convey horror, worry, sorrow, true surprise and relief. His last hunting ?? a signature of the extremely popular cartoon team ?? is brilliantly set and quickly improvised, especially his literal dog fight with the equally silent bulldog with firmness, wit and a Chuck Jones burned smartness that would have Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger green with envy. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit match the best of Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello and any other classical comedy team that comes to mind; Here, their lifetime hopes on the screen as long as their predecessors. The waiters are most eager.
