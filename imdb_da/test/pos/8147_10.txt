Honestly, at first I looked at this movie because of the free sex scenes I heard it owns, but by actually watching the movie it just made me realize that there are still good and sensible movies out there. Really, it's one of the most appropriate and touching movies I've ever seen. I'm a teenage bisexual, and the movie talked to me about my predictions - sex, religion, love, acceptance, etc. It gave me an idea of ​​how to deal with these issues by myself and others around me who love me for who i am Cox really handled the movie well by sprinkling drops of heart-radiating lines and some sexuality in it. It made the movie more interesting. Some people compare it to Brokeback Mountain, but I don't agree with myself. Brokeback Mountain has more drama, while last days are balanced.
