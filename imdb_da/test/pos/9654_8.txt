Philippe Garrel makes us breathe in the forgotten atmosphere of Nouvelle Vague, which is almost lost among its old shelves, but ready to rise again from its ashes, if it is withdrawn from the past. On the other hand, those who are a little familiar with the director's issues may well know how he is obsessed with a long-lasting sense of loss as to the fate of reality. "Les Amants r√©guliers" therefore shows us the parallel stories of an "amour fou" and a tempted revolution that has gone to ruin under the leadership of young French students. <br /> <br /> The first part of the story is about the dramatic events of May '68 in France elicited in a series of astonishing plan sequences, a kind of cinema verity style that places student uprising in anything but an enviable light against a tone white background. <br /> <There is much that can be said about the peculiarities of black-and-white photography used to describe the struggle between students and the police, where the high contrasts give an unrealistic atmosphere to the sequences and darkness closes on the excited organs that wraps them in mystery. The images, completely deprived of words, show the real consistency of myth, which is made of gross violence, more and more emphasized by the reality of the film. The individual counter doesn't matter at all here: he tends to disappear in the mass. What really matters in these battle scenes is the importance of the mass project, the blind rage of juvenile attacks, the eerie feelings of the mob's power, even though they are perceived as separate entities except for any kind of feeling, with the cold and distant appearance of an entomologist who intends to catalog his insect collection. <br /> <br /> The second part of the story is described more clearly and most intimately. Standing on the horizon, the enchanting portrait of a self-centered generation in search of its time, utterly rude to human individual values, prone to rotate on its own axis between opium gases and praise for its recent defeat. "Les Amants regguliers" seem to induce the shadow of the great Robert Bresson, who has been revised and corrected by Garrel's special sensitivity without drifting away from the main argument and attempting to broaden the overall perspective on the subject of human disillusionment which, although painful, can bring us to the truth. In my opinion, he tries to penetrate deep into the substrate of history if a man is allowed to play ear, he will probably find that he can bring the dark side of himself out with serious and irreversible consequences.
