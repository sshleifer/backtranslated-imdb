An intelligent and well-made movie worth exporting! <br /> <br /> In this exciting and truly intelligent movie fully recorded in Bogot√°, you can feel the overall meaning of the word "Bluff" (although it is a Colombian movie, the title is presented in English); ! <br /> <br /> The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who finds his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) who has an affair with her boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; Then Nicolas stands without a girlfriend and without work. Nicolas revenge for Mallarino is to follow him and get photographs of him with his new affair Alexandra (Carolina Gomez) to harass Mallarino for money change so as not to show the photographs to Margarita. <br /> <br /> The story is really intelligent and well-related to the point that you fully understand the meaning of the title, showing the movie a thriller with many comic scenes and characters, resulting in a real pleasure for anyone who enjoys the movies focused on a good script. <br /> <br /> I stand out here that this movie is different from the typical Colombian films that show some dark and violent image of our beautiful country, which is somewhat refreshing. Some critics say that this story does not show the Colombian typical way of life, so it could be kept in any part of the world I disagree with: (1) The film is fully filmed in Bogota so you can see streets, and pictures of the real Colombian capital (I hope some American people and film producers see this so they stop showing the Amazon jungle or Mexican small towns in Bogota as on some Hollywood movies), (2) the characters, the dialogues, the accented exception from Nicolas, who is from Argentina) is quite from here, Rosemary (Veronica Orozco) typically has an accent from Cali, (3) you can also see social and cultural differences from the ordinary people of Bogota. I hope all of this plus an English title moves people from other countries to see this masterpiece of Martinez. Excellent work by Veronica Orozco, Luis Eduardo Arango (Detective Wilson Montes), Felipe Botero, Excellent as Detective Ricardo Perez, and great plays by Mallarino, Catalina Aristizabal and Federico Lorusso. <br /> <br /> A movie worth exporting that people from all over the world will surely understand and enjoy! Don't miss this movie 9/10!
