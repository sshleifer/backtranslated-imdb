Being a high school student, I must take a health class. This year is the subject of drugs. We learn about the harm they can cause a person. From what we are talking about, I still think and know that drugs can really root a person up. nevertheless, my teacher would see this. Of course, we moan and start to sleep, but like the rest of my class, I actually enjoyed this movie. It was completely genuine and not sugar at all. The characters were amazing and trustworthy. even the plot was unreliable realistic and credible. What I liked about this movie was mainly how it got the point of effect drugs that can take on an addict and the consequences the person has to deal with. everyone assures themselves that nothing bad will happen to them. well can be serious. everything can happen in a small town, even to your best friend, like Sam and Chris. This movie shows it. A person can really learn a lot from seeing this. It was quite effective.
