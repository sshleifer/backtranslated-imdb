It is war-time drama - World War II, with French and Jews and Germans, but it is somehow fun, seriously it. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau wrote the script for his well-received film "Bon Voyage" (2003). Unlike director Bertrand Taverner's "Safe Conduct" aka "Laissez-passer" (2002), WD Rolf Schubel's "Gloomy Sunday" (1999), or with Claude Berri's "Lucie Aubrac" (1997), "Bon Voyage" title sounds - c'est la vie (whatever) - and we have the beautiful talented Isabelle Adjani to thank. It is her lovely performance all the time as the center of attraction (and attention), the cause and effect of everything that made the movie as fun as it is. Hell, what's another tracking of her plan and expectations - will worry about it again. History's backbone is about a few young enthusiasts: Grégori Derangère as Frédéric and Virginie Ledoyen (from Francois Ozon's "8 Women") as Camille. The incomparable Gérard Depardieu, the witty Yvan Attal ("My wife is an actress") and versatile Peter Coyote (juggling French, English and German here) are some of the star players involved. <br /> <br /> There are many characters that come and go in this plot of a movie and how it all juggled is a talented talent that requires no analysis - Rappeneau is simply a genius. The story just builds on itself, an episode after the other or even with overlapping events, but never confusing - it's the joy of it all, somehow, every detail shows up on the screen and we beat it all up As a beautifully presented French dessert, literally so. There are excitement, trills, tender hesitant moments and tight uninvited escapes that all play out in front of our eyes. <br /> <br /> From reading the director's note on Sony Pictures Classics' Bon Voyage official site, Rappeneau stated that this is his most personal and successful work ever. Depicting Bordeaux 1940 from memories of his childhood years is very close to his heart, and he "had worked and reworked the script for almost 3 years." This film is a work of love all around, the cast and the crew complement the director's passion and a formidable script of collaborative writers with the director and his son Julien - adaptation efforts by Gilles Marchand, Patrick Modiano and Jérôme Tonnerre. <Br /> <br /> Music by Gabriel Yared (varied in tone from his previous movie results as "The English Patient" or "Talented Mr. Ripley"), which provided an appropriate theme that kept the pace and rhythm of the plot gone - almost As a train that goes by, Adjani reflects Viviane's vivacious energy (even when she's tired), keeps her going when she meets what comes and goes upside down with high and stylish dress always, not looking back, let alone time for regret. <br /> <br /> Oh, don't forget the wonderfully translated, clever subtitles of Ian Burley, who also made subtitles for movies in Italian: "Bread and tulips" (2000) aka Pane e tulipani, "The Last Kiss" (2001) aka L'ultimo bacio and Tom Tykwer's "Heaven" (2002). <br /> <br /> If you find this very much for light a war-time drama drama, try Mäx Fäberböck's "Aimée and Jaguar" (1999, in German, based on a true story) with brilliant performances by Juliane Köhler like Aimée and Maria Schrader as Jaguar.
