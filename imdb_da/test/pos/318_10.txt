I saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time. I was baffled after seeing this masterpiece and despite some fierce competition from the kind of FELLOWSHIP OF the RING, this movie is still my favorite in all years almost 20 years after I first saw it <br /> <br /> This leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie. I could praise the technical aspects, especially the sound, editing and filmography, but everyone else seems to have praised (rightly so) these achievements to the skies while the performance in general and Robert Duvall in particular has also been noted, and everyone else has mentioned sharp pictures of the Dou Long bridge and mounting of the boat traveling uphill after crossing the border <br /> <br /> What about the script? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as an instructor, but at least he is a genius as an actress when he was an instructor, I said "was" in the time that had been tense because this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in the head, but his victim was worth it. In John Milius's original solo cast, we have a script that is just as crazy and disturbing as that on the screen, but Coppola's involvement in the manuscript has injected a narrative that accurately reflects the war play. See how the manuscript starts with all the jingoist and macho with a star turn of Bill Kilgore, who would not have looked out of place in the GREEN TALKS, but the more the story progresses, the more shocking and insane everything becomes so much that the time when Kurtz outposts the audience sees another movie the same way the characters have sailed into another dimension. When Coppola says "This movie isn't about Vietnam - it's Vietnam" he's right. What started out as a patriotic war to defeat the communist aggression in the mid-1960s, had changed the view of America on both the world and itself and the world by the attitude of the film (The Manson trial suggests that it was 1970). view of america <br /> <It is the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a cinema masterpiece and says more in its running time about the brutality and hypocrisy of politicians (What did you do in the Vietnam War President?) than Michael Moore could hope to say for a lifetime. I have not seen the REDUX version, but seeing the original print, I did not feel that something was missing from the story, which like all really beautiful films are very basic. In fact, the premise may allow many other genres as a Western, where a chief officer must track and kill a dismissed colonel leading an injured war party or a sci-fi movie where a UN assassin is removing a fellow UN soldier leading a Resistance Movement on Mars, although this is probably down to Joseph Conrad's original source novel <br /> <br /> My all-time favorite movie, and it is very appropriate that I chose this movie to be my thousandth review on IMDb
