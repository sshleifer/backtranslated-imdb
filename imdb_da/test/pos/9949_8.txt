I remember driving home from school almost every day to catch KTLA's channel 5 monster movies, but never brought home faster than when this movie was scheduled. Somehow, the idea of ​​being a boy and having a huge robot as a friend was appealed to me in a very unique way. Sure I was like Spiderman, Batman and other superheroes, but I really wanted to be Johnny Sakko over any of them. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie in 30 years and I still remember it alive. Who can forget the way Giant Robot shot missiles out of his fingers! Or how about the way the Ghuillotes threw their nails to get explosions! Geez, I can even whistle the theme music that plays at the end, which is so tragic that I remember crying myself to sleep a number of times! <br /> <br /> Only another movie has the kind of magic this movie does in my mind, and that is the guide of oz. But I've seen that movie many times since I was a kid. Of course, the Wizard of Oz is a true classic, while Voyage Into Space is low budget nonsense. These two films should not even be mentioned in the same sentence, but for a young boy it is not high-production values ​​or continuity that catches your heart, its flying monkeys and giant robots! <br /> <br /> P.S. My cousin uses to make a very precise impression of the Giant Robot (he said it "Giant Robot.") If you remember, Giant Robot had a certain way to shoot his missiles, and my cousin had it cold. I made him repeat the routine endlessly for my personal pleasure.
