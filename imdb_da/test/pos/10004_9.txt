I watched this movie on September 1, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges of the Heartland Film Festival, showing films for their truly Moving Picture Award. A truly vibrant image "... explores the human journey through artistic expressing hope and respect for the positive values ​​of life." Heartland gave this award to this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a story of golf in the early 20th century. At that time, it was played in upper class and rich "gentlemen", and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs. With this background, this based on-a-true story unfolds with a young working class branch taking the golf business and the world's greatest golfer, Harry Vardon. <br /> <br /> And history is inspiring. Unlike all odds, Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf from "Holes") is competing against the biggest golfers in the United States and Britain at the US Open in 1913. Francis is poorly prepared and has a child for a caddy. (The caddy is fun and motivating and steals every scene he looks at.) But despite these handicaps Francis shows courage, spirit, heroism and humility at this world-class event. <br /> <br /> And we learn a lot about the early years of golf; For example, the use of small wooden clubs, the layout of the short holes, the manual scoreboard, the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths, the terrible conditions of greens and fairways, and the game was not interrupted even in heavy rain. <br /> <br /> This movie has a fantastic filmography and art direction and editing. And without big movie stars, history is somehow more credible. <br /> <br /> This adds to the major sports movie overview in the road to "Miracle" and "Remember the Titans." <br /> <br /> FYI - There is a site with real floating pictures where there is a list of past winners who go back 70 years.
