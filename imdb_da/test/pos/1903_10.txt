Dolemite is one of the best movies with a pimp as a hero who takes down the man while he is associated with all the finest women the ghetto has to give. Remember, these women know karate and are fine foxy ladies. SPOILER - The final battle scene is pretty crazy, with the Dolemite tearing out of Willy Green. Make sure your copy is not classified. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a cast full of innovative brilliant characters such as Hamburger Pimp, Reverend, Mayor, Queen Bee and others. The garments are great and the sets are full of 70's. There are a few splits in the production, such as. Bomb mixes that happen to happen, but it adds to the charm and grin. <br /> <br /> I'd recommend drinking a 6-pack before and during this movie and keeping squares and the man far away.
