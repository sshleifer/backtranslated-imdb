To be able to draw a job like this caper in Rififi (eg Score and its opines), one must have nerves of steel. This apparently requires and commands it. Jules Dassin is the master. <br /> <br /> I was on the edge of my seat all the way through. It deserves to be better known, although it was not at the time of its release in 1954, because of it, it is believed that the director is being blacklisted in the hypocritical Hollywood of his time. I would recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't have the pleasure to see it. <br /> <br /> I can't give it enough stars.
