This movie is about a deadly poison contained in small glass globes used to kill. This is apparently done to hide a spy ring intent to steal plans for a new American bomber. Now much of this plot was repeated in other Chan films, THE JADE MASK and DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS. In addition, it was first used in MR. WONG, DETECTIVE - everyone had exploding glass globes - a plot element that has obviously been overused.

According to IMDb, Mr. Coughlan 93 years old and retired from the film industry.
