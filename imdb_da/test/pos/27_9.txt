Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are brilliant as Sir and his Dresser. Of course, the play is brilliant at first, and nothing compares to the theater's immediacy and collegiality, and I think you're listening better to theater; but on the screen we become more intimate, we are 'closer' more than we are in the theater, we are witnessing subtle changes in expression, we 'see' better as well as listen. Both the play and the movie are wonderful: fluid, intelligent, luminous - the back story of the company, the historical context, the two main characters and the parallel characters of "Lear" itself. If you can't see it in a theater (I can't imagine it being produced much in those days), please do yourself a favor and download the video.
