HOUSE CALLS was a fun 1978 comedy about a widowed doctor (Walter Matthau) who now wants to play the pitch but can't help but be attracted to a patient of his (Glenda Jackson) who refuses to be just another notch on his bed post. Matthau likes the woman, but does not really want to make the commitment she insists on, so he agrees to her only for two weeks and then decide whether or not to commit. But other complications make it difficult for Matthau to make a decision when the two weeks are up, even though he is obviously in love with the woman. Matthau and Jackson have surprisingly effective chemistry that sharpen and receive strong support from Richard Benjamin, Candice Azzara, Dick O'Neill and especially Art Carney as the outrageous and senile chief of staff at the hospital where Matthau is employed. Matthau even has a short scene with his real son, Charlie, who appears as Jackson's son. This engaging comedy is still pretty good after all these years. If you've never seen it, it's worth renting.
