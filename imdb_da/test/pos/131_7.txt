A rather interesting look at some signs from India's budding middle class. Although India is rapidly modernizing, its culture does not keep up. This film involves the patriarchal community where women are not yet really free-living. A country with arranged marriages, men who kill with mistresses with total impunity, and women who are expected to tolerate all of this will gradually come up short. I was impressed by Nandita Das, who was quite attractive and played her character with total seriousness. But I was even more impressed with Shabana Azmi, as I understand Bollywood's long-standing fixture. Her quiet beauty and low-key mental illness were excellent. The lesbian subtitle of this movie was never particularly erotic, and never titular. (Darn!) Worth looking for those interested in very different cultures.
