"Rififi" is a fantastic heist movie, and one of which subsequent heist films has been drawing ever since. Jules Dassin had a sense of the seedy underworld where these twenty live - you won't find here the Hollywood glamor of "Ocean's Eleven".

They rob to survive, to pay for their children's upbringing, to prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world. The very greeted heist scene is a nail bite, filmed in virtual silence. I had the feeling that the plot went a little longer than necessary, but the high-speed train to deliver the baby to his mother who finishes the movie is classic. Be warned-- -This movie is very bleak. But it is also very good. <br /> <br /> Degree: A-
