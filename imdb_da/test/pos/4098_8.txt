I watched this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I have searched for a video, but have never found it until now 33 years later when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it doesn't stop. This glamorized version just can't rise to the production level in 1937. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is if you listen to yourself, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it doesn't do well for this mysterious and compelling story. Just don't fit. Michael York is lost here. Sally Kellerman throws a nice performance, but Olivia Hussy is just ridiculous and not worth banging through the Himalayas. The best achievement is Charles Boyer as Lama's head.
