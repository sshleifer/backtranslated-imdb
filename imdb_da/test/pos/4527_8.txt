Murder over New York is one of the better Chan mysteries, and I've just seen it here for the first time. In this one, Charlie visits New York to attend a police convention. At the same time, people involved in aircraft are murdered and he decides to help with the investigation along with his second son. These murders turn out to be the result of sabotage on the plane's planes, and Chan helps identify the killer ... Charlie Chan plays well by Sidney Toler, and the rest of the cast includes Sen Yung as his number 2 son and marjorie Weaver. <br /> <br /> I liked this mystery and are worth having if you like this stuff. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
