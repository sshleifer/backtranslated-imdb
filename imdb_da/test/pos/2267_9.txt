2005 was one of the best film years. We had so many great movies like Batman Begins, Sin City, Corpse Bride, A story of violence ..... We also came with Brokeback Mountain, King Kong .... But if this year the only big movie that came out If everything is stated, we would not miss out on everything this year has brought. The first film as director of the talented Liev Schreiber is a lovely, heart-pounding, touching drama that also brings one of Elijah Wood's best roles. He is perfect as Jonathan, a curious man who leads Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather in World War II. Liev Schreiber, who also writes the film, performs a masterpiece with memorable scenes and (many) funny quotes. This is a true mix of comedy with drama that brings a movie that will be commented year onwards. A serious Oscar contender, everything is enlightened is a powerful, original, and why not say, illuminated movies. But there is one thing you should remember while entering the movie: Leave normal behind. This is special .------ 9/10
