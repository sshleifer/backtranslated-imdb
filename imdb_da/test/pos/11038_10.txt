This second World War Popeye cartoon had some very good views in it and it is certainly above average for its genre. It was also nicely drawn out with some great angles, good details and .... well, many interesting sights. What that means is Popeye out at sea in his little boat and accidentally runs into a small Japanese boat with two guys on it. (Why was "Japs" always depicted with large round glasses and bowed teeth?). <br /> Whatever, these harmless Japanese sailors want Popeye to sign a peace deal. Oh boy, does the lying Popeye think, "wait until the admiral sees this!" In one of the great works of art I came up to, we slowly see how the little Japanese ship is really a big destroyer ..... and Popeye is in deep .... um, water! "Why, you're crossing Yes pansies!" Shouting our sailor. <br /> <br /> How he gets out of the situation is fun to see.
