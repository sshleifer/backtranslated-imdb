My two daughters (11 and 13 years old) and I were lucky enough to watch a movie of this movie last night. We were all pleasantly surprised to see how entertaining and fun this movie was. David Duchovny was very appealing as the male leader and Minnie Driver usually gave her competent performance. Some of the scenes laugh a lot of fun - especially a stage Minnie Driver has with another "transplant" donee. I liked that it was a movie I could see with my kids and I was not embarrassed by any scene. Everyone in the cinema laughed and enjoyed himself. Thumbs up Bonnie Hunt!
