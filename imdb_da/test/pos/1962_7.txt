Less than zero could have been the 80s film that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form if they had actually attached to the horrible book. But where they did not, this film presents the presentation job and leaves you with the embarrassing feeling when it is not finished until the late nineties with Larry Clark's 'Kids' and 'Bully' movie. <br /> <br /> The socially excluded teenagers face a rather curious dilemma (they don't treat it much like one) when their alien friend (Daniel Roebuck) boasts that he killed a teenage girl near the river's edge in their suburban town. Keanu Reeves may be the only civilized character among the pile, the only one willing to show any kind of conscience anyway, while the others also do nothing about the girl's death or will help their friend hide the body. <br /> <br /> I don't know who's more ill in this movie - Crispin Glover - who is almost obsessed with being a grandfather in trying to protect a friend and hide the crime by smuggling him out of the state. Dennis Hopper, an on-edge drug dealer (who sticks to a female blowup doll), turns to teens (like a dealer of course) and suddenly gets involved in the events. Or Josh Miller, who plays Reeves little brother, Tim. He seems to be the most apathetic of them all, at least until his emotional breakdown at the end. It is clearly not the peppy 80s teenage fare. And certainly makes the point strikingly aware of the serious detachment these children deal with (despite a bizarre array of events) thanks to many amazing performances all around (even Reeves showed a certain play). <br /> <br /> Help yourself to a comedy to restore if it cuts you too hard.
