Christopher Nolan had set his goals on the following in a very narrow direction, and in that direction he took something that reminded me of the great little poverty movies that Ullmer directed back in the 40s. First of all, he is able to make touches of homage things like black and white photography (a given because of the shoe budget, but also crucial for the dark crevices, these characters reside) and the casting of the actors (John Doe lead, the smooth male counterpart and the beautiful-in-a-gritty way of femme fatale - while being kept within the underground indie of the 90s, where thousands of dollars and specific choices in places and music and such could be possible. That, and also in the film-noir mood, Nolan also gathers a clever web of a plot, perhaps even more than Memento. Where the latter was a psychological work unfolded by a plot enriched by looking past the inch empty, the nonlinear structure serves the purpose of showing how far a person like Bill can go through as dark a path as Cobb , only in an environment where you do not hold your toes to a person who is not really twisted and in the deeper mindset Cobb is. <br /> <br /> Of course, the whole act of following someone is the main driver of history and went into it, I wasn't even sure where it would lead if it were some kind of consciousness, ala Slacker where Nolan would lead his character to a by-Briton to another. But the creation of Bill's ties to Cobb is done in a quick and excellent way as we see right when Cobb approaches Bill at the cafe to ask what he's doing to him, almost everything we need to know about both, and the first robber he brings him with. What soon seems to be a good score on the horizon is really a great set-up of Cobb and his lady (just called 'The Blonde', perhaps a too obvious greeting to noir, but why carp). But this is revealed in a way that actually really made me guess, as the manipulation of the narrative worked more and more to awaken questions not so much of why, but how. The density is brought out because of the actors' understanding of their essential points as signs, where Alex Haw is brilliant as a true sociopath, who can hardly mask his' deep 'ideas of what it is to really enjoy a burglary, and Theobald with the behavior of a person who can never be as smart as he is in what he really does, but is more intelligent in the naive way that does not give any chance in the thank-you environment like this; Russell makes it almost too easy, even with a face that will send Ana Savage to shake his head. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Nolan is also on the ball with his style as a camera man and holds nothing in it that does not add to the atmosphere and excitement, with fade-in / fade-outs not too quick to leave a lasting impression, but enough to add to the "this-can-lead everywhere" logic in the script. He follows it in hand-held form as though he knows where his limitations are, yet is great to keep the essentials: close-ups when needed (one I loved is Russell's face in a small mirror) and a fairly simple techno tracks that never detract. Sometimes, as mentioned, the line between seeing something in 'present-day' and seeing something as eternal as a solid-mass story of low-lying criminals with thought-games and moral ambiguity is always never clear, which to me is almost irresistible in its darkness manner. In short, this is one of the great calling cards I've seen from a filmmaker in recent years and should hopefully be something that future fans of Nolan's other work can look forward to discovering. Or even to those who think noir has gone to the fast editing and big-gun firing dogs in the mainstream (even in independent movies) it is a sharp little 71 minutes.
