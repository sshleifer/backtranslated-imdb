For me, North and South (Books I & II) is the ultimate television series in the 80s. Just spotting all the cameo appearances was very entertaining. Gene Kelly, James Stewart, Elisabeth Taylor, Olivia De Havilland, Robert Mitchum, even Johny Cash Â¡No series have come close to this achievement. Have you ever seen someone like Lincoln? Dick Smith's dentures made Hal Holbrock's powerful performance even more. The designed costumes, jaw dropping places, everything. It is clear that today there are excellent and bright TV shows (Desperate Housewives, Lost, 24), but North and South were and still one of its kind. Do not miss it. Only David Carradine's portrayal of the ultimate villain (you can call him just a violent man) worth seeing. Perhaps some characters and situations are stereotypical, I admit it, but the positive sides clarify a shadow over them. I'm so happy to finally be available on DVD in Spain.
