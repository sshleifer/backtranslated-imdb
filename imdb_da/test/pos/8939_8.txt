It has been a long time since such an original, quite fun, black comedy has discovered. If "Eat Raoul" is on your top 100 list, do yourself a favor and find "Making Betty" right away. The subject of death has been tried before (see Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov in "Mortuary Academy"). While that movie has some amazing moments of black comedy, "Better Betty" is much more stable, with a better cast. Who could imagine that the business could be fruitful for a sincere uplifting and cordial comedy? I was surprised and you stay too. I highly recommend seeing "Making Betty" - NOTE
