In 2023, Kam (Bobbie Phillips) in a world is governed by the financial interests of large corporations (and not by the people's will or politicians) a human hybrid and IBI (International Bureau of Investigation) agent. She is referred to as a "sub" (from sub-human) and her genetic composition is 80% human and 20% animal. She has a combination of cougar genes that gives her strength and flexibility; falcon, which gives her an increased ability to see and hear; and chameleon, giving her the power of camouflage. In the first film she was a very seductive and amoral woman with sex to obtain information. I haven't seen the other yet, but in this third story is full of action. A group of researchers has developed a new and dangerous form of electricity production for fifteen years. The research is not yet complete when one of them fails the other and steals the research. The problem is that because of its molecular instability, a black hole will be created and the whole planet sucks. Comb saves Dr. Tess Adkins (Teal Redmann), the survival of the scientist's team, and trying to retrieve the dangerous invent from the hands of the 'bad guys'. There is a very strong `sub 'in this gang that causes many difficulties for Kam. This action and sci-fi television movie is better than the first one reminiscent of `The Terminator 'in some parts of the plot. Bobbie Phillips is a very beautiful actress and her outfit is very cool. I'm a fan of this great entertainment. Fans of sci-fi movies will not be disappointed. Now I'm trying to buy `Chameleon 2 '. My voice is seven.
