This is one of the few films of this type that I have reviewed and enjoyed. While Clint Eastwood is his usual self, the overall story works well, even within the framework of Washington DC. <br /> <br /> The theme: An assassin tracks the president and there is only one person who can save him. <br /> <br /> Creating a movie that the audience enjoys these days involving this arena cannot be easy. This movie succeeds on several levels. Eastwood is his usual underplayed hero who wants to save the president since the Kennedy era. He does well in this role, just like his foil, Reneee Russo (an FBI agent). 10.9.
