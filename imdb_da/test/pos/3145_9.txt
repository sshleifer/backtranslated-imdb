Then last night at the 7th annual NYC Home Film Festival - a rather tumultuous place that calmed down for this sweet and touching mistress movie. The relationship between the two and one, older and blind, the other, a fifty who helps her with her mail - is established full, and its depth is readily apparent. <br /> <br /> There are no billiards, explosions or savage special effects - Just the sometimes difficult but rewarding task that people reach out to help and be helped. See if you can!
