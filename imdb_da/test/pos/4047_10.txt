This may be one of my favorite movies. It tells the story of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, then bought by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. But on her birthday, snow queen (Bridget Fonda) arrives at the hotel her father owns and kidnapped Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to save him. <br /> <br /> I thought this was an excellent adaptation of the story with good performances from all casts. It has amazing special effects, and the story fits well and is easy to follow. I think it's a good movie for the whole family to enjoy. I have seen it every time t has been on since it came out and never tired of it, why i have given it a 10!
