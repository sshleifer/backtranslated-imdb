Leland follows the story of Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), a disaffected teen who apparently murdered a serious retarded peer, the brother of a girl he was dating. The question is not whether he did it or not ?? Leland admits it immediately ?? but rather why. Interestingly, rather than a crime drama, Leland becomes a character story in which to investigate why people do what they do? not necessarily the easiest reason to attach. <br /> <br /> And Leland has the necessary indie group of screwed people. Apart from the title character, there is also Pearl (Don Cheadle), who is his teacher at the juvenile correctional facility, and looks just like Leland is different. We meet Leland's distant and selfish father (Kevin Spacey in an expanded cameo) who never seems emotionally touched in any way by what his son did. But the right flavors come out when we immerse ourselves in Pollards, the family of the late child. First, there is Leland's girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone), a drug addict who can't stay clean; her sister Julie (Michelle Williams), perhaps the most normal person in the movie, only seeking to get away from it all; and Allen Harris (Chris Klein), a young man who lives with Pollards and is Julie's girlfriend. Finally, there is Ryan (Michael Welch) who everyone else calls goofball, who can't communicate and hardly think about his surroundings. <br /> <br /> Leland focuses primarily on its eponymous lead, but the movie slowly ?? occasionally too slow ?? Burrows in everyone's life, asking the main question, why do people do what they do? While Leland discusses it openly in a journal, Pearl allows to hold and examine beliefs about good and bad and personal responsibility, all the signs at some point in the film face for a moment, where to make the basic choice of their own happiness or a Second, perhaps the most basic choice any person can make. And the film takes a good look at what goes into these choices and the consequences of them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie you are simply hit by the depth of the casting. Spacey. Cheadle. Gosling. Michelle Williams. Even Chris Klein ?? It's people who tend to raise any movie they are in, and putting it all together makes it a boiled brew. For a space in the middle, the film appears to stand, sputtering together as it unfolds; It looks a while as if it would be satisfying to ask questions and not provide answers. But when we come home to the home and the movie starts to move and come together, Leland becomes a quiet, powerful piece of film production. Leland's explanation of the world and his actions ultimately puts all the stories in focus and all the investment you have made in the film pays off. <br /> <br /> Saying Ryan Gosling is excellent as saying a sunny day is great. At this point in his career it is superfluous ?? This is one of the finest young actors working today and it is a pleasure to see him craft what could have been an unlikely sign in a thought-provoking protagonist. Gosling uses such ease here that it hardly seems to act; He has to disregard most of the film as opposed to Don Cheadle, as we know, the goods, and he not only keeps his own, he also promises Cheadle's games. Cheadle itself is in top notch shape, imbuing Pearl with a fully rounded humanity ?? for good and bad. Spacey is a kind of note, but it is the character and he manages it excellently. I was surprised by Chris Klein; With this level of acting, I thought he would be buried in the mix, but he probably gives the career development so far. Great work around. <br /> <br /> Leland is a bit of a downer, and again it is sad in spots. But it ends strongly and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer (one way anyway). There is also a subtle comment on racism in the film (in Leland's first day in the juvenile hall class, he is the only white person in the room), much of the film is handled very effectively. I wouldn't go as far as calling this necessary view ?? some may find it too slow or too strange ?? But I thought it was one of the better movies I've seen for some time, far stronger and more satisfying than most people out there. I would recommend it ?? with the above reservations ?? If it's nothing but seeing Gosling further perfect his craft.
