This was a very good 1950's western, one of the better I've seen in a decade that featured the genre on the screen and on television. It certainly had three great actors in the selection: Glenn Ford, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. It turns out that Ford was the star of this movie, while the other two stars helped support roles. Ford had the bulk of the dialogue. He was also the "good guy" while Robinson was the "bad guy" and Stanwyck was twice as bad as Robinson. She played the right tongue in this movie, and the character she played was a little too contradictory at times. <br /> <br /> Ford handled its lead status very ably, as he usually did - especially in Western. He played a lovely guy who didn't want to fight, was a peaceful man ...... but if you push him ..... you look! <br /> <br /> The story had a nice mix of action and lulls, not overdoing. It had an expansive western setting, which was used to benefit the CineamaScope widescreen. It also highlighted realistic people in a realistic setting. The credibility of the characters, especially the supporting players, was most impressive. The men's way radiated the women in this movie, acting and characteristic. Dianne Foster and May Wynn were weak - the only negatives of the production. It is easy to see why these two actresses never became stars. <br /> <br /> Although it is over 50 years old, this Western one is still fast enough to enjoy, no matter how old you are or what you are used to seeing. For classic movie fans, this is almost a must with this cast and good story. Highly recommended.
