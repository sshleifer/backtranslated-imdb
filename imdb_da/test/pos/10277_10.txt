This is a wonderful thriller I so many times on and never get enough of. It's about the obsessive love 5 people have for each other in Paris, (un) lucky coincidences, false identities. The music makes it really poignant. There are hardly any errors in the characters, just the end is not very credible, but a certain "must-see" still exists.
