This is a funny movie, not many of them. Ok, the plot is a little disturbing, but very original. A teenager is trying to get along with dad because he hasn't been around and almost sends him to jail because she is lying to impress an older boy, how could it not be fun? Plus it's not the typical movie with teens. First remake I've seen, it's better than the original, the only problem with both: Gerard Depardieu. With another actor it would be a perfect 10 because he plays all the rolls in the same way, sucks. Another problem, it's all the women who melt over him, it's not extremely credible, he's not attractive! You had a rubber roll that was better looking than him, come on!
