The last dinosaur is a movie that has to be fun and exciting. They manage to do both. <br /> <br /> Maston is a great hunter chasing big game (go figure). He owns a company that he plans to go on an expedition with a group of people, including a photographer named Frankie, a Japanese scientist, a guy working for his company called Chuck, and an African guy who has helped him on many safaris called Bun Ta. The point is to study what is meant to be Tyrannosaurus Rex, dinosaur that killed the last expedition to the area. They come to this prehistoric area with a drilling vehicle traveling underwater called Polar Borer. After getting to the area, they quickly find Tyrannosaurus, which Maston is trying to shoot, but his gun gets stuck. Chuck immediately discovers that Maston wanted to hunt the dinosaur all the time to add it to his collection of "Stuffed Animals". When they were gone, Tyrannosaurus invaded their camp and took Polar Borer away from their camp. On return, the group realizes that they can stay in the area longer than they expected, and Maston says he will kill Tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> The story is great for a science fiction movie. Drilling to a prehistoric site is something that could really happen. The landscape is beautiful and it looks like a place where dinosaurs could still live. <br /> <br /> I also liked the characters in this movie. Maston is the typical big time hunter who wants to get something that could be a trophy kill. Also great was Bun Ta, played by Luther Rackley earlier by the NBA who really looks and works like an African tracker. Jackie is the typical woman who causes problems for the group and does not seem to belong in the desert. Chuck is the former employee of Maston who has his perception of his change of boss when he is mad with him. <br /> <br /> The Tyrannosaurus in this movie is one of the best in a movie. It's a little too much like Godzilla does, and it pulls its tail so it's a guy in a suit. But the suit looks good, especially the head and tail, and Tyrannosaurus looks good and very scary. I've seen lots of other movies where dinosaur suits look worse. Tyrannosaurus in this movie sometimes broadcast a roaring sound like Gudzilla and other times roar like King Kong from "King Kong Escapes" and "King Kong vs Godzilla". Saw a big Tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> There's lots of action in The Last Dinosaur. Of particular note is a great battle between Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops. Also a fantastic scene where Bun Ta tries to spit Tyrannosaurus. There are other good parts that I will not give away. You must see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. See it and you won't be disappointed.
