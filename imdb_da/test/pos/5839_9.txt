I cannot stand people commenting on this program or other HBO programs as "for graphic" or "unnecessary graphic" or that they contain "free nudity / violence / sodomy etc". <br /> <br /> Guess what? Prison life is not PG-13. The "gratuitous" graphic content is TRUE TO LIFE of this situation. Prison contains prison rape / killing / drug deals and showers. If you don't like it, don't look at the program. I'm definitely not a fan of the prison, but if it was left out of the show, I would be surprised and lend the show less credibility. If the prisoners were not cursed, it would just be silly. Sure it's free language, but it's REALISTIC. The view is good, some of the viewers .... not so much, I guess.
