The man behind "la classe américaine" comes back with a really fun and smart sequel to the old-fashioned OSS-117 .... Directors have a tendency to "over-actualize" successors of old classics (remember avengers, urk), Hazanavicius chose working on a really cheap hero, OSS-117, a kind of low budget French 007, and deciding to do it in an old school way ... Photography, body attitudes, choreography fights and FX are all a tribute to the way films were made back in the 50s. And it works when the film's tone and jokes are really good! Jean Dujardin perfectly designs this stupid-arrogant-macho-egotistical French spy that has been lost in a country he only understands in terms of folklore and inferiority. Yes, it is, just as the Occident uses to regard his colonies again no, I do not want to say that it has anything to do with what is happening today in the same area ... ah ah) ... He looks like just an unfrozen Lino Ventura with something like 40 pounds less, which is perfect for the role. The other cast members also fit perfectly with everything you can dream of Russian spies, Egyptian independent and former Nazis. And of course, the women who have to be "femmes fatales" in any good spy movie ... The reason is good (maybe not brilliant but really good enough ...) that takes place between actual historical facts and reminds us of a fun way how France (and the others) treated his colonies back these days. It all starts in 1955 with a British spy disappearing while tracking a Russian cargo full of weapons in Suez. Then France sends its best friend, Agent OSS-117, to find out what happened to both the shipment and the agent ... In fact, this agent is really as stupid as it can be and he slips through history without once understand it and solve it in a very clouseau-esquire way. I have to say that I had a bad sense of the movie as the public around it was quite scary and as French humor tends to be quite populist and flat (forget the les bronzés 3 or camping ...) but I was really surprised and in the good way! I highly recommend whether you want a good parody of Bond esquire movies (much more fun than in DEBS for example, but less skirts) or you are a fan of the genuine and sincere way to film they had back in 5 'er. Yes, it is wise and (really!) Fun, you probably have Mr Hazanavicius once again!
