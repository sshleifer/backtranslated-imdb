It is interesting to see what people think of this movie, as it is actually unique (although it carries some of Clive Barker's writing). Though it may seem a little cynical to say it, the movie is just intricate enough to cushion those who need standard Hollywood plot hooks and layered, so if you expect to be fed, you'll see a normal monster girl with lots of monsters and a mismatched plot. Those who need a linear, specific, and indiscriminate plot line will hate this movie because the story is like in the short story, partly between the lines or in this case, partially out of the screen, in comments and fantasy. Another possible suspension is the end, which I can say without spoiling it, that it is not quite good and not quite bad. It is really not very much defined as I know, some people send to violent tantrums that they did not know what was happening, but for me and for many others, I am sure, I just add another dimension to the story - dimension of speculation, and moreover, the point is that great disturbance tends to cause ripples that stretch quite long. There is certainly moral here, but of a rather different kind than the regular Hollywood in your face-to-end-of-the-movie kind of screen. Summary that the moral up is simple, although it is not quite simply displayed; prejudices and the human tendency to hate the different. I love this movie, though, as many reviewers have noted, the actors' expressions (with the exception of David Cronenberg, who makes a wonderful appearance) are pretty sticky. I'm not sure they are entirely guilty of their rickety appearance and lack of depth, as they are common problems in converting literature into script. <br /> Overall, this is a great movie, provided you don't expect it to be a standard horror movie.
