If we could have "separate tables" why not "Separate Lies." <br /> <br /> This becomes something involved. A housekeeper man is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleanses for. The latter had an affair with a friend and drove the car with the girlfriend in it when the accident occurred. To complicate matters further, the housekeeper worked for the guy's parents, and he had her imprisoned for stealing. Therefore, people would hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident. It sounds like she wants revenge. <br /> <br /> Everything is horrified. When our housekeeper discovers that her boss was driving the car, she recovers her testimony greatly to the disruption of the officer working on the case. As if it's not enough months later, our girlfriend (Rupert Everett) gets terminally ill and our lady (Emily Watson) leaves her husband (Tom Wilkinson) to care for him. <br /> <br /> The action is quite good here despite the endless "Peyton Place" similar theme. Tom Wilkinson, is a lawyer trying to protect his wife. <br /> <br /> The movie is a good one, but we could have done without the terminal illness. Well, the marriage ended anyway.
