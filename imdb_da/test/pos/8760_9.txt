If you haven't seen this, beware. It is available on DVD. It is a channel 4 (UK) production, possibly together with German and Danish television. If you've seen the movie, it's pretty much the same plot. Several interleaved stories are linked through drug trafficking. The story jumps between the housewife (played by the excellent Lyndsay Duncan), who tries to conclude an agreement on behalf of her husband, who to her surprise is an international drug dealer (and generally dangerous man). <br /> <br /> A minister embedded in his work to the detriment of his family examines the whole situation of international drug trafficking. He gets a few eye-openers for heroin's reality when his daughter turns out to have a 'problem'. He then officially visits Pakistan, where he apparently learns that the abuse (not just the drug or its informal use) is the problem and also tries some products (an excellent scene at which he at the same time realizes what the attraction is and why it is and why it is so a problem). In Pakistan we will see the other side. The desperation of farmers who can hardly survive turns to opium production and criminal gentlemen. The meaningless attempts at subsidies result in the system becoming rich. And a country so drenched in drugs, but only a relative part of the abuse we have in the west. Around all this, a customs officer / interpol agent is trying to catch the 'Dutch' link in heroin smuggling. Seeking justice for his murdered partner. This is truly a masterpiece. Super, underestimated performances from all the main actors in a way that only a European cinema can really do. <br /> <br /> A must see. Especially if you have seen the movie, they compliment each other and they give some subtly different opinions / attitudes from both sides of the pond.
