These were two video footage, which Troama decided, was horrible, so in a desperate move it became one movie. Perhaps the bitterness of Troama's side contributed to killing the comedy, but for some reason it is very fun thing with an inspired piece of "Oliver Stone" to comment on the movie. Lots of cameos, lots of use of the lesbian Cannibal HoeDown song add to the fun. Trey Parker, Ted Raimi, Julie Strain, etc. Etc. .. <br /> <br /> One of the best recent Troama releases. Yes it is everywhere, by entering, the production quality or the lack of becoming one of the many ongoing jokes. Join it and you will be in good time. Behind the scenes are often the best things about Troama publications also above average this time. I really believe the anger they felt about these two miserable movies helped them drive them, not greatness, but drove them to "fix" this movie in a way that is better than any of the movies would have been as they were originally planned.
