Kl. 2:37 A high school student commits suicide. Not shown who has taken their lives or causes, the time goes back to the start of the day. From here we follow six separate students; Marcus, Melody, Luke, Steven, Sarah and Sean. Each student struggles with their own moral dilemmas, all reaching boiling point and hitting one end. After losing a friend to suicide and survived his own suicide attempt, author / director Murali K. Thalluri has created a torn drama focusing on teenage life and the horrible act of suicide. Suicide has been a topic that has been held in the shadows, 2:37, Thalluri's attempt to bring it to light. If you have been touched by the act of suicide or anyone who has 2:37, it will be harder to see. <br /> <br /> Thalluri also tackles the everyday life crisis with heavy and hard work. Sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, bullying, friendship, Thalluri control and show them in an extremely realistic way. The factor of Thalluri's talent is his subtlety. He respects his subject and the problems that everyone wants to get through at once. It is sometimes near documentary, it has such a painful realism; Interviews with each character spliced ​​through the film only increase this. <br /> <br /> 2:37 has a characteristic resemblance to Gus Van Sants movie Elephant. While the essence of each movie is different, both teenagers tackle life. Like Sant using Thalluri long tracking shots, over time, jumping back and forth to show each character's interaction from different perspectives. A defining point for Elephant was its essential mood. With extra conversations, small sign development and the long tracing images, Sant created a joking and fascinating atmosphere for a forthcoming fear. While this fear lies in 2:37, when the emotional connection to the characters a higher level, Sant could not reach. As time goes by, each character creeps fragile and pulls you along their emotional roller coaster. The real hit in this movie comes with the inevitable suicide predicted at the beginning. The hard part about this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort we have as the audience who sees life end in a cruel way. Although many films have shown suicide, shine over the action or romanticize the action. Thalluri shows the pain and pain involved in this action and is not the best solution. With unknowns in the leaders and their first major roles; Teresa Palmereach, Frank Sweet, Joel Mackenzie, Marni Spillane, Charles Baird and Sam Harris all show the huge talent and promising plays. <br /> <br /> Convincing and demolished, 2:37 is an absolutely inevitable movie.
