This image was released in May 1979 with Playboy Playmate Susan Kiger as Honey Shayne, Playboy Playmate Lisa London as O'Hara and Playboy Playmate Pamela Jean Bryant as Terri Lynn. In one of the most delicious sec comedies in the drive-in story, a host of bouncing young lovers all come together in a story of fighting bikinied sorority sisters who will stop at nothing to shave everything. So what does H.O.T.S really stand for? You have to watch the movie to get the answer. You see, the girls have problems with girls on campus that make them nothing but sex-demanding lunatics. Therefore, the girls have set up to discredit the girls, whatever they have to do to get the job done. Moreover, the cut of this root is the dean of college who wants to break down the group of girls before they grow out of control. I loved this movie, especially Lisa London. I thought her plays were great, and I'm disappointed that she didn't get any other plays. Based on the three playmates alone, I give this movie 10 tissue stars.
