First of all, ignore the comment on how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone does it now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less fun than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria. But all that, this episode is just fun. Al Gore's portrayal must be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on man's opinions about the man. I don't want to give anything away, but it rolled me on the floor. <br /> <br /> There are also some of the best Cartman / Kyle moments ever. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say that this is one of the best episodes the show has ever had and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
