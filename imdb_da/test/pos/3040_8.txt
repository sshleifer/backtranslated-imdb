Just seen Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the film leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heart-rending study of a human's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a student's creativity in student despite various backgrounds and difficult circumstances . As a teacher, a teacher sees adaptation to his students and prepares them for all the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks are a valuable concept we all need to be reminded of. The thread on the Vietnam War is calling right now. Worth a visit.
