We have a sign by the name of Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She is lovely, friendly, often smiles, but is strangely brutal. Evie also has a secret. Her idiot-savant sister has recited original poetry that gets the community tense on the sisterhood. Unfortunately, it is Evies poetry. While their mother is beginning to be happy again, and the boy next door shows his interest in Evie, Evie just tries to figure out what she really wants to do. <br /> <br /> What to keep in mind while watching this movie is who Evie really is. For such a brutally honest person who does not mind telling ivy-league types that she does not respect them, it seems odd that she will be able to draw a lie. For someone so happy and cheerful, she is quite numb when it comes to some issues. They are not character errors, they are plot development, and they mean much more than they first think. <br /> <br /> Mostly, it is something of a melodrama: a sign lies, the personalities of the other people drive them through drama, as relationships are compromised. But as far as writing is concerned, it is very fresh and bold. The play helps the writing together very well (perhaps the idiot savant sister has been played better) and it is a real pleasure to see. The management and the cinematography are not quite as good. They are acceptable, and Evie's world is curled in color and light, giving some very beautiful pictures, but it is not very consistent. It is not so much a mistake as a result of a low production value, but within the same value there is a real storytelling and a genuine care for the characters. So even if it's not a perfect movie, it's definitely an enjoyable one. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
