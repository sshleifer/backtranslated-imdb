I have to settle all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I see it when I need a pickup. Granted it's not like the sound of music, but it's so much fun if you opt for movies, isn't your thing. I adored the late (and big) Bobby Water, and James Shigeta always has and will always be a favorite. I saw it when it first appeared in the theaters. I am a great musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in "The Boyfriend". It is a modern musical and should not be judged by anyone who went before. It's just the best thing for dreamers like me who want them to find this place - no disease, no wars, no drugs, all the bad things in life are gone. This is no more than a good movie. That's what all movies should be about. Shaun Phillips title song is amazing and explains the whole feeling of the movie. If the play is not the greatest, who cares. I love the idea of ​​the movie. Peter Finch, a very stiff actor, Liv Ullmann, beautiful as always, Sally Kellerman, surprisingly good voice, Michael York, typically and Olivia Hussey, stunning, convinced me all that they were normal run of the mill's people. Not one of them acted as actors in a movie. They acted like real people, just as I would act if I found this place. Turned between going home and staying there, in awe of everything. Yes, there are errors in this movie, but come over it, it's not Citizen Kane, it's a good musical music!
