This is a very good black comedy with a fantastic view of how different people have a different perception of the same situations. The three main characters each met a girl named Jewel, played by Liv Tyler, who is another male fantasy for each of the three men. Each of the three men goes through the same situations, but when they tell them to other people, their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two say. It is a very good concept, probably not entirely original, but it works very well in the film. The reason is very good, very bizarre and extreme, which makes it a good black comedy. The action is just as good, not one of the actors seemed out of place or out of their league. The comedy is very black, tone-white in some scenes, and many people will certainly be offended by it, but fans of black comedy will probably enjoy it. Overall, this movie is not for everyone's taste, but most people who like black comedy will probably love it, as it is definitely one of the better black comedies. 10.7
