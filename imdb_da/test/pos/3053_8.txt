Be aware that this movie has nothing to do with Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: Music Hall .. I know what is and what is not associated with the New York venue. The movie Theodore is only "Music Hall". No Rockettes are in the movie. Only wonderful skaters plus great actors and fun. Just thought you'd like to know. Really a wonderful movie. You will never guess who the "killer" is while watching this movie .... at last. What a fantastic plot and beautiful skating. You never see that kind of idea anymore. Roxy Theater and Center Theaters, in New York City, had ice skating performances on stage!
