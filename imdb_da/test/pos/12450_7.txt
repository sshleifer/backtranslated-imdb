I remember watching this movie in the theater in 1984 when I was 6 years old (you do the math). I absolutely loved it. I was Tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it (climbing the furniture, jumping around to make monkey sounds). It started a fascination with Tarzan and monkeys, but strangely a long-lasting love for Christopher Lambert (remember that I saw Highlander very shortly after this). 1984 was the last time I saw that movie until about a month ago. It happened to be on cable when I was ready for bed at. 3:30 and even though it was late and I was tired and I had to be at 9:00 am, I stopped to watch this movie that I loved as a child. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I realized that a movie and even otter was not so good that Andie MacDowell's voice was dubbed by another. Of course, Ian Holme was solid as usual, and surprisingly, the monkey still loves some sort of up, but it was most surprising how well Lambert was like Tarzan. He was amazing! The depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primary body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through his extremely large sheet, was just amazing. As I said earlier, I'm Lambert's fan, but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. In this movie he was really quite good, and it is a pity that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again. <br /> <br /> So to make a short story too long I was a little disappointed that the movie wasn't that good, but I was happy to see Lambert was good and I don't regret 6:00 to see it.
