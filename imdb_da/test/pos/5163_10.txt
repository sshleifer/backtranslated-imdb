A brief review without any spoilers follows. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie yesterday at the Cannes Film Festival. My first reaction is one of wonder and happiness. I am so happy movie as this is made in our time with blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Roy Andersson's new movie "You, The Living" is nothing short of a complete masterpiece. You, The Living, consist of about 50 vignettes recorded with a static camera. I do not want to give game scenes here because I hate when people destroy even the smallest details. But yes, most scenes made the 1000 people in the Claude Debussy theater completely amazed and amazed. When the film was over, we applauded for several minutes, we had no other choice. So what is the score of "You, The Living"? Hm, Andersson is not afraid to raise the heavy questions; History, guilt, gand The Holocaust during World War II are major issues (and these themes work very well together). <br /> <br /> The images created are brilliant, the depth sometimes exceeds "Second Floor Songs". <br /> <br /> Sorry for this ranting, promising review. Keep an eye on Flying House in the beginning people! 10/10 stars - A masterpiece (I never throw this class out).
