This is a true gem of corny sci-fi! Peter Cushing adds a great personality to this midnite movie classic. <br /> <br /> I especially like the sound design. The weird, choppy voices of creatures and rhinoceros all create a bizarre background (of course, the unclear dressed child does not matter either)! <br /> <br />
