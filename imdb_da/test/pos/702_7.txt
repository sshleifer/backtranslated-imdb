Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford were once banned together, but now Scott's sheriff and young Ford are still exploiting his gun. He is hired to pull a bank job, but is delayed to come to town, and those who hired him get another. It causes all sorts of complications, much for a movie that doesn't even last 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Randy and Glenn both got girls here. Claire Trevor plays his usual good time crazy with a heart of gold. And Evelyn Keyes is the daughter of Edgar Buchanan who falls to Ford's great time without realizing who he is or why he came to town that Scott is the sheriff. It is B western, but unusual for time and for Columbia Pictures it was given the full technicolor treatment. The desperate marked Glenn Ford's first film in technicolor, a process reserved only to some of the more expensive films from major studies. Harry Cohn certainly wasn't one to go for it. And certainly not in wartime. The plot becomes a little horrified as both Ford and Scott are tested on friendship versus appropriateness / duty. The plot also involves some high hypocritical skunks in Randy's Town, which are the real crimes of the movie. <br /> <br /> The four leaders are doing a good job and the best supporting performance is Guinn Williams as Ford's gracious explosive lunk head of a sidekick. The Climaxet involves a cattle herd and a shooter in the city's salon and is one of the best ever made in a Western movie. Fans of the four leaders and Westerners in general will enjoy this.
