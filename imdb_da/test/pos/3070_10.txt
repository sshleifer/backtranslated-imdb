SPOILERS AHEAD ------------------------- Mel has got it started. From the opening to the final credits, this movie just laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comic force. Cary Eewes carries the film most of the time, but the support casting fills up heavily when the plot is pulled away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning, this film highlights that it is of course not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters of modern antics you would get this movie. What makes this movie special you say? Throughout the movie you see flashes and acuhu go next to each other becoming good friends like Robin Hood's side kicks. But Blinken is never told or understood that he is black until the crowd says "a black sheriff", the flash replays "He is black". It's a timeless scene. Simple one of the most entertaining movies of our time.
