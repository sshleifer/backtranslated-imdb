This movie is the best horror movie I've ever seen. the play is terrible and the plot gives much to be desired, but the dolls gave me nightmares for weeks. Seriously, if you have small children, don't let them see this. Of course, I am a little biased because of an irrational fear of dolls and midgets. Also a body double cameo of the guy who makes my cherish troyes. And some gratuitous nudity, a must in any low budget horror movie. every other horror movie will forever be judged for this in my book.
