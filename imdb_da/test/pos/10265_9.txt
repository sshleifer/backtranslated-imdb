It couldn't have come from another country or from another time. This movie simply throws psychedelic influence on the late 60's Italian cinema. So, pseudo seriously and sexually free. Sumptuous settings and dreamy music make this a visual and responsive joy. Plus, we get the lovely Dagmar Lassander, definitely on her best look. Kinky goings on make for a wild trip and if the romps in between Mimosa towards the end seems long lasting it is but another pretty charming property of the time. You were probably expected to split the few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend, and that of course makes it a twist in the case. It might have been better if Philippe Leroy didn't look so strange with his hairy red hair and twisted facial expressions. He does, however, well and has many silent moments when Dagmar is cavorting, and he must show a mixture of love and hatred. Not an ordinary narrative movie in any way, but for those who like something different, it certainly is.
