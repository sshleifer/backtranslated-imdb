After receiving a copy of the Bostocks Cup I must confess It is not as much fun as I originally thought !! IT IS BETTER!!!!! Charlie Williams ... eat your heart. Match fixing ???? Never! Slight increase of 45%? Ronnie and Reggie Kay? George Best? The coach driver who thinks Pontefract is in South Wales (that's all Ponty this and Ponty it) Bertie Masson's (Tim Healeys) lucky Cup hat !! (not that he is in gimmicks) Sugar Plum Fairy ????? Confused ???? See it again. The innovative use of real footage with Bostock players was brilliant and the producer was proud to give us a MASTERPIECE. Come on ITV do the viewers and yourself a favor - show it again !!! Please>
