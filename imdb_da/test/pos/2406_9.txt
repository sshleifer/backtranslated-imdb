I wish the series was not completed so soon. Although the play may not be the largest in the world, it positively ends and teaches morals and values ​​to viewers. Hilary Swank did a great job of portraying a high school student who had lost her parents, etc. Miyagi was great as in the previous 3 !! If you're not in the happy end, this movie, like the previous 3 in the series, is not for you. This day, where we live, you can't see enough that the evil ones get what they deserve, and the good people come out on top. The Bible teaches that good will always prevail over evil. That's exactly what happens in this. It's a great family movie. Please see it if you don't already have it.
