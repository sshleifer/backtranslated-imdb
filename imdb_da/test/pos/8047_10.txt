Some of the reviewers here have poorly condemned this silent film of politically correct standards today. <br /> <br /> "Battle" was an excellent movie for several reasons, properly noted by more rational reviewers: Superb cast, lots of action, innovative editing and photography. <br /> <br /> Its stars were in fact D.W. Griffith Stock Company and this silent movie fan, it's induction enough to watch it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago and looked right at it again on YouTube; It was a very poor quality print, but in combination with my memory of a good print in a real theater, I can rightly recommend it to reasonable people and film historians.
