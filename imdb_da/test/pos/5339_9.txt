I was very amused to read some of the bad reviews on this movie. First, many have said that they have taken their 4-year-old daughters and grandchildren to see this and they did not enjoy it. Firstly, I don't think this is a child's movie, at least not a movie for very young children, not least 4. It has very subtle humor, but it's not meant to offer fast entertainment as seen in Tom and Jerry or something like this. Many people have also complained that it is going very slowly .... I guess these people are used to "quantity" over "quality". Although I myself have a small quality problem with this film, and it is that the film was not as detailed as the short films, I still think it succeeded for a full movie. And how can people complain about the jokes ?? The witnesses were sensible, timely, and thoughtful, never rude offensive or "in your face". Wallace is extremely smart, yet cautious, and Grommit is the most sweet, clever and sweet character that could be. This was a beautiful movie and the theme was very appropriate ... for adults who are .... especially with the increase in obesity and metabolic disease in the world, there is nothing wrong with promoting vegetables and fruits for once ... and this was done in a very tasteful way by ... while people are worried about the aspect of vegetables that does not necessarily mean they are healthier or that they eat more of them ... but just that they temper with nature, which is In fact, what caused the legend of the rabbit's product to come true. And for those out there complaining about the religious jokes, I say ... come on! are you really? Many villages are about the local church, and legends / formonitions, etc. Are normal themes, no harm is done. This movie was amazing but some people had negative comments on it and I find this absolutely absurd !!!
