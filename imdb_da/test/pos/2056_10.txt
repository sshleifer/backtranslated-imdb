I've seen this movie probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically. Anyone who calls this movie trash or awful just doesn't understand action movies or recognizes a good one. Perhaps for some, the events and the results may seem far-fetched, but in my opinion, writer Shane Black (Lethal Weapon / Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) wrote one of the most thought-out action adventures you ever come across. Over the top or not, this movie flows like clockwork, and the action just comes. The final action sequence is one of the best I've ever seen in any movie. Cast in this movie cams. Genna Davis did a fantastic performance and it was a shame there was never a "LKG" sequel. Samuel L. Jackson is fun as his sidekick Mitch one down on his lucky private eye is trying to help her discover her lost past and get a few bucks. If Baffles me, how not to like this movie. It packs so many tensions and it's so much fun. Wisecracks in this movie makes me laugh just as hard 10 years later. In my mind, the first Matrix movie and Long Kiss Goodnight were two of the best and most original action flicks from the 90s. Incidentally, Shane Black made a fortune when he sold this script. At that time it was the highest selling manuscript and it was worth every penny. It is so sad that the audience never gave this movie a chance because they would have witnessed Renny Harlin's best movie and Genna Davis as if you have never seen her before. Long live "The Long Kiss Goodnight" !!
