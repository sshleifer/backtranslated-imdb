According to me, a movie can best be judged by the number of 'best scenes' there are. There are probably at least 80-90 scenes throughout the movie that are probably rated "best" by someone or the other. <br /> <br /> This movie is a masterpiece. Period. I know many who have called it ahead of time, probably because it bombed at the box office. But I think every generation can relate to this movie and have a good laugh through. <br /> <br /> I'm personally glad Mahmood is part of the movie too. His role is not so "carnal", but it is good to see that he is part of the cast in the funniest Hindi movie ever.
