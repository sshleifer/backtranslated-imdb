A sparkling film. BB is a marvel. She's hungry. She is a feminist. She is still very much in love. <br /> <br /> The film has Paris in the 50s. It's great to look at the places the cars (DS!) And Orly. A simple but very fun romantic comedy. The music is horrible. It almost dissonises. On the other hand, it's fun. But that's the only thing going wrong, at least looking at it with the eyes of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The film comments on the French way of treating adultery. It is the sensible modern. A film that un elephant watch trompe tremendous did it in the 80's way. But the basic premise remains the same. <br /> <br /> Thanks to decision makers for providing BB with this opportunity.
