Commissaire Mattei (André Bourvil) is a single with a small gun that loves cats and his boss at the police department in Paris is a philosopher who knows that even the police will be guilty sooner or later. It's about the movie. And a jewel robbery on site Vendome. <br /> <br /> Corey (Delon) brings the plan from prison, Vogel (Volonté) joins him and helps him against two tough guys following him because he took mafioso Rico's (Andre Eycan) money while Rico already took Corey's girl friend and left him very alone for five years in prison. Corey and Vogel find a third man, Jansen (Montand), a former police officer and sniper, opening a security lock by shooting handmade ammunition in a hole. A perfect plan and collaboration, but they have to sell booty and there is Mattei in the role of a buyer in disguise. The circle closes. Running to help each other, they are shot by the cat who loves Mattei and his little gun. <br /> <br /> It took Melville 20 years, he says, making a robbery movie after he didn't get a contract for RIFFIFI. Melville wrote the script and filmed in Southern France and in Paris last year. The great Henri Decae is, as usual, the lighting camera. It's the before before the last picture of Melvilles who died after another movie with Delon in 1972. <br /> <br /> Melville actually wanted Belmondo instead of Volonté, he didn't even like the Italian, but Volonté-Vogel is an excellent refugee and gives beside Bourvil the most compelling achievement. But remember: Melville notes that Volonté is an instinctive actor, a strange character, very tired and absolutely impossible on a French set. Melville didn't like him at all and didn't want to work with him again. <br /> <br /> Melville is wrong. Volonté gives the most lively character in nowhere of not so many interesting characters. You can see what he feels like being chased by Mattei and his little dangerous gun and all the dogs in France in the winter of 70. A wild actor. <br /> <br /> Also André Bourvil, who passed by close to the time of the film. He was not the first choice either, but certainly a great replacement. He carries a lone hunter's instinct throughout the film and eventually gets his chance to be guilty again. <br /> <br /> Jansen has arrived at night at the jewelry store with a rifle and a rack, but eventually risks freeing a successful shot. When he meets Delon for the first time, we already know that the elegant Jansen has a serious drinking problem. After the robbery, Montand refuses to take his share of the dust and mentions Delon, who looks up to him, that he only entered the red circle because he wanted to avenge the inhabitants of his wardrobe. Delon doesn't catch what he thinks. The audience reminds that he has seen Montand in a big scene in his haunted house, struggling with helpless martyr creatures coming out of the wardrobe and attacking him. At that time, a very rare scene remembers a long time after. I bet it was ever so difficult to arrange and fix these things at a time, no one imagined the coming days of digital filmmaking. Great art when art was made by hand. We will definitely remember a crew like the actors, but it seems that even after 33 years the less popular of the six thrillers in Melville remains. What is wrong with that? I'm afraid you don't take much interest in the three actors (showing three criminals) and their police officer. We learn a little about Corey and his mortal 5 years away from his beautiful girl (Anna Douking). Montand is still a good sniper, but what made him become a drunkard with funny creatures in his wardrobe. Delon seems to be in a past adventure of the samurai, Volonté is the man in the trunk of Delon's American car and moves excellently and Mattei swells to look at, a great actor at the edge of his life. But how could he possibly doubt that everyone is guilty? <br /> <br /> In an interview, Melville says there is no woman in the movie. Not in the very red circle, but I remember the jolly beautiful woman Anna Douking (without future career). We are in the 70s. In fact, a woman from the bed rises from an old mafioso wearing nothing and slowly walks to the door to listen to her old love Delon's voice. Bardot did such a thing 10 years earlier. This time, Melville was directed. Well done. RED CERCLE has certainly added a few, but not many, sparkling gems to movie history. The robbery at the Place Vendome and Montands wonder the inhabitants of the wardrobe and Volonté escapes Bouvil in white underwear and wears the pants carefully over a stream. It's too little for a big gangster and robbery movie. But the 110 minutes never run you and it is a high level game. And there are probably some secrets that you learn when you watch the movie over and over again. None of the secrets is that we are all guilty and the late Francois Perier is also highlighted. <br /> <br /> Michael Zabel
