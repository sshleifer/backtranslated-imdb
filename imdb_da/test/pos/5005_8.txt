Talk show with Spike Feresten is one of the shows that will certainly polarize the audience. Either you like it or you don't. Personally, I find most of the pieces fun, but it has some "huh?" moments. <br /> <br /> Staples like "Idiot Paparazzi" are always good for a laugh, but my all-time favorite piece should be the one-time "Hollywood Douchebag". "Comedy for Stoners" is the only regular piece that generally causes me confusion (which is part of the point!) Spike and his writings ready to throw lots of fresh comedy time after time, so the show never feels obsolete. The gesture's humor may not be for everyone, but it is definitely worth trying. <br /> <br /> The masses have spoken! We like this show and want more. Please note that I am not a friend of or affiliated with any way with Spike Feresten, "Spike Feresten Talk" staff or Fox network and affiliate partners. It's simply fun!
