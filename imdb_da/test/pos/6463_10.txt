I cry a lot of movies. Call me sentimental. Call me one of the viewers who always like to see a good ending. This movie, although it has a sad ending, was amazing! Of all the actors I would love to have lunch with, it would be Sidney Poitier. His plays along with John Cassavetes and Jack Warden (of 12 Angry Men fame) are stellar. His character, who turns to a man on the run (Cassavetes) and helps him out in every possible way, is incredible. <br /> <br /> This is another of the forgotten noirs made at the end of the noirish era. It's well done, has a fantastic cast, extremely talented plays and great filmography. It's a movie worth seeing over and over again. I highly recommend this one! This is just another great movie made by Mr. Poitier and must be sold on DVD. Even though I was crying, kudos for such great art!
