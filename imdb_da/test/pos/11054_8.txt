This is an incredibly well-liked early talkie adaptation of the Eugene O'Neill game. Its biggest drawback is a static camera, and as a result it gets a lot of time as the recorded game is, which is a shame, because it is a good piece of primitive film making that was made at a time when the sound was All kinds of technical issues, and as a result, most films were experimental, whether it was their maker's intention. Garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as she was in her silent movies, and her entrance is still classic. Her voice is strangely deep, almost gory, which only enhances her already seductive eccentric persona. As her boyfriend, Charles Bickford is the appropriate virile - he was apparently born crazy - and a perfect counterpart to the divine Garbo. His Irish brogue is not bad at all, and he always seems like a natural man in the sea, much like O'Neill-like in his independent, sparkling nature. As Garbo's (very) confused father, George Marion really seems from another time. He has that kind of face and voice - open, inhuman, without a nap - that has disappeared from the ground. Marie Dressler is also in the O'Neill swing of things. Her sheer expression and intensity around the eyes speaks volumes as she plays her exuberant character as a woman at times, adjoining psychosis. Poetic license, perhaps, as this is not in the manuscript, but we can forgive Miss Dressler's profits; She's not too good at it. The story ends with a move to the next thing, then separated from resolution, which is not the author's cup of tea; And those who like their movies nicely crafted will eventually be disappointed that there is no real surprise. In Anna Christie we are in O'Neill country, a sea, storm and fog, a sense of all-encompassing and judgmental uncertainty that we would now call ambivilance or anxiety neurosis. Instead of analyzing this mood, the author simply and wisely presents it, as weather, land, sea and people mix and address each other in a unique language we feel priveleged to have heard.
