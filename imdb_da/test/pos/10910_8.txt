Howard (Kevin Kline) teaches English in high school in a small Indiana town. He is finally married to Emily (Joan Cusack), much to his parents' delight. The city is also afraid because one of his own, Cameron (Matt Dillon) has been nominated for an Oscar act. Everyone, including Howard and Emily, watches the Academy Awards on TV when Cameron is declared the winner! In his acceptance, Cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay military man, partly because of lessons he learned from a gay teacher in high school. You guessed it, it was Howard! But, Howard has never "come out"; In fact, he thinks he's right! With the whole city and media members waiting and observing the events, Howard and Emily will get married? Or is Howard really gay and aware he can't go through the ceremony? This is a wonderful, fun and humane movie about a gay man and his situation. Like the man-who-did-not-ready-he-was-gay, Kline is excellent and touching. The rest of the casting is just as nice, with Cusack a nail that mixed fianc√© and Dillon, Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck and others available to delight the audience as well. The costumes are very nice and the setting in the lovely Indiana heartland is beautiful. Then the script, the direction and the production are also very, very nice. But the insightful, humorous and thought-provoking look at the gay population is undoubtedly the best asset of the film. For those who would be offended by a gay movie, yes, just skip this. But for anyone who wants to laugh heartily and get a better understanding of homosexuality at the same time, this is definitely the best movie out there.
