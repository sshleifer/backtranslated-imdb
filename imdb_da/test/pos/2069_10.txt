I've seen every version of this game that I can think of, including more on stage, and Sir Derek Jacobi is definitely the best Hamlet I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> He has the most wonderful voice for stage play, and his expressive face will take you on a rollercoaster of emotion throughout this game. The way he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness. He (like Hamlet) can in a moment be loving, soft and gentle and in another moment raging against hell who is his life. You think he has pain, you think he's angry, you think he's not a little sour. You think he's Hamlet. Of course, some of the thanks go naturally to Shakespeare, but without an excellent actor to get the words from the side to the stage, it's not really how well written a game is. <br /> <br /> If you like Shakespeare, definitely see this version. If you don't like Shakespeare, definitely see this version. You will come away with a new appreciation for Shakespeare if you do. The sophisticated performance of Sir Derek will leave you breathless.
