With the re-experience of ADV Films, I have had a chance to see "The Giant Majin" for the first time without the deep cuts and scary words of a sennat Horror Chiller Theater. Guess what? It's a pretty wonderful movie! The sets are authentic, they act in subdued and trustworthy, and the great majin is stately, powerful and unstoppable. I loved the subtle imaginative (the enchanted tree, the lucky charm, etc.) and the potrayal of God as a little less than 'good'. This movie begs for a remake of the new century!
