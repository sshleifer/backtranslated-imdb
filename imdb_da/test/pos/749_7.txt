I found the movie Don't look in the basement to be very good, with some nice figures in it. It is about a young psychiatric nurse called the nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik), who must start working on an isolated mental asylum. While she meets different forms of different characters, including Dr. Geraldine Masters, who will be responsible for the asylum after the owner of the hospital Dr. Stephens is killed by one of the patients by hitting him with an ax. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters in the movie are Mrs. Challingham (Reah MacAdams), a very funny little old lady Allison, a nymphomaniac, and Sam (Bill McGhee) a young black guy walking around all day that seems to be in the world of its own all the time. The film was a very low budget movie, but was still a really good movie. I know it was on the "Video Nasties" list back in the 80s, but one didn't think it had a lot of gore in it, Alothough it had some disturbing senses in it. GREAT MOVIE RECOMMENDED !!!.
