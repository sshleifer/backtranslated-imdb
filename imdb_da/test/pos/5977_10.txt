Although Voskhozhdeniye was your favorite movie, it would only be possible to see it at most every ten years. It's just too emotionally strenuous. It is considered Shepitko's finest movie, ASCENT is the story of partisans operating in the Byelorussian forest in the winter's death in the German occupied Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Whilst attacking the audience with the pure physical trait of science, especially the penchant of cold and snow, the real struggle to survive both nature and fascists, there is always a subtle, barely derived subtitle of moral judgment and the question of whether a man can be moral or immoral in a context, but otherwise in another. A partisan group hiding in the woods is being attacked by a German patrol and losing their food supplies. Two men, Rybak, who knows the area, and Sotnikov, a Jewish teacher, are tasked with going to a small village for food. They find the village burnt to the ground with nothing edible and nothing more than charred timber and foundations, where in a cubbyhole is a child's mirror hidden. The overwhelming feeling is that the one who brings the war brutality to a country and a people is really cursed. I was thinking of the war that the Americans and British brought in Iraq, and how the war graves are brought to humans is a degenerate nation's action. The two move on to a nearby larger village, where they get a lamb from the co-director under coercion. The Germans arrive and the two partisans escape under fire. Sotnikov is hit in his foot and loves the Germans when Rybak gets away with the lamb. Sotnikov becomes so desperate that he is not ready to live, he removes his boots to put a ball in his head. Right then Rybak moves back and pulls Sotnikov out of the fire. <br /> <br /> Rybak draws Sotnikov through the woods, bloody meters by meter all finished in a long roof. Each meter is a pain, and yet he still draws him through deep snow, up his back, across depressions, over black bush stumps that break when they slip under the men's weight. There are more similarities to Tarkowsky's movie word vocabulary - the long-running documenting process, the effect of using repetition, and the emotional emotional stress that builds up the longer the shot continues. In the background, unnoticed because of the action, is there a question - Rybak commits an immoral act by going back to Sotnikov? Whether it was under the moral standard of Marxist-Leninism or just the common imperative of the group's survival, was it not his duty to get the food back to his starving band and leave Sotnikov to cover his escape? To sacrifice a man for the group to survive? Which leads to the question - Can a man who is immoral under a philosophical system be expected to be moral under another moral system? The partisans come as another curse of war for a farmhouse containing a woman with three small children. She is cursed by the scourge of war and barely connected to her three children. They almost do not rest when several Germans come up. They make their way to leave and are directed to the ceiling to hide. <br /> <br /> Sotnikov's cough gives them away. When a German pops his head in to look and no one responds, he threatens to shoot over the ceiling, and Rybak's nerves break and they are trapped. Now who has moral responsibility here? Sotnikov for coughing or Rybek for cracks? The two partisans and the mother are driven up and taken to a nearby town that passes carefully under a wrought iron arch at the entrance. They find their head and a little girl already in custody. They are interrogated by a turncoat byelorian, played by the Tarkowsky favorite Anatoli Solonitsyn. Sotnikov holds his head under interrogation and torture and asks only what the interrogation profession's interrogation was? He does not answer, but from his ease behind a desk is the likely answer "school teacher". Rybak on the other hand asks for his life and even offer to join the police. The formerly unnoticed character error, making a 'wrong' moral decision, where the ambiguity (like the feeling of it) hid it from judgment, now becomes blatant, disturbing and very ugly. <br /> <br /> The five are in a dark cell. They are all scheduled to die the next day. From here, the elements of a Christian parable become stronger. True Rembrandt lighting and compositions are used as other ancient master bags of Christ are represented. He decides that he can save everyone if he blames everyone. He must be kept alive until morning so he can save everyone. He asks the mother for forgiveness, and the protagonist by knowing what is happening does not feel such despair by dying uselessly as he did before. <br /> <br /> Tomorrow is coming. The Germans don't care if Sotnikov takes over all his or her sins. They will all be hung. They climb a steeply sloping street, which is a virtual Via Dolorosa. A bench is taken up to the execution site, which is the gateway to the city. Five ropes are hanging from it. The bench stands only three, so Sotnikov stands on a tree stump, which Rybak kicks out from under him. They all hang. <br /> <br /> As Rybak down the road with the Germans, someone in the crowd calls him a Judas, an unnecessary manifestation, Shepitko's only mistake. Rybak imagines several times to be shot in the back, tries to escape, dies an honorable death and tries, without luck, to hang himself in the shithouse, but leaves with the Germans as the beaten dog he is. But if Rybak was morally right to go back and save Sotnikov's life, is he wrong trying to save his own life?
