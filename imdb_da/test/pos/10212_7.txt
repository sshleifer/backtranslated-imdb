"Western Union" is something of a forgotten classic western! Perhaps the reason for this is in the lack of availability on DVD in the United States. But everything is not lost, as it has now appeared on Region 2 in England. This - as a blessing in some ways - is not only unnoticed, but completely ironic, when one finds that a film depicting the creation and creation of such an American organization as The Western Union Telegraph Company is beyond Region 1- release. It begs faith! It just doesn't make sense! <br /> <br /> Produced by Fox in 1941, "Western Union" was directed by Fritz Lang. It was only the second time the great German director undertook to lead a western one! He had done an excellent job the year before with Fox's "The Return Of Frank James" and would only have a more western excursion in 1952 with the amazing "Rancho Notorious". Long was no Ford or Hawks, but with "Western Union" he turned into a fine, solid western that holds very well. Beautifully photographed in early three stripe Technicolor by Edward Cronjager boasted well of Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The female management is taken by Virginia Gilmore, who really has little to do in the picture. An actress who has never done any of her career. Her presence is only cosmetic. It's curious that Robert Young has top billing over Scott! It is definitely Scott's picture from the beginning when we first see him in the movie's amazing opening scene being chased by a pose over the plains. Young does not have much to do throughout the film and works out of place in a Western. He just looks stupid and goes up against Barton McLane in a shot! An actor who never really distinguished himself - except perhaps with "Crossfire" (1947) - Young appeared in a series of unforgettable romantic comedies in the eighties and fifties, culminating in his greatest success when he was television for seven years, "Marcus Welby MD "in the seventies. He died in 1998 at the age of 91 years. <br /> <br /> "Western Union" tells the connection through the telegraph wire of Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays a reformed ban, employed by Western Union chief Dean Jagger, to protect the line from marauding Sioux and also take on McLane and his gang trying to destroy the line of their own wiped ends. Robert Young is the young engineer from the back east who joins the company and is devoted to Scott for the feelings of Miss Gilmore. Some cartoon help is provided by - and annoyingly, some say - by Slim Summerville and John Carradine appearing in a poorer role as the company doctor. <br /> <br /> All in all, though a spanking good western, albeit in Region 2, but in sparkling good quality, fans will be happy. My only cot is that there are no extra features, not even a trailer and the awful cover with the stupid graphics. UGH! Footnote: Interestingly, the associate producer of "Western Union" was Harry Joe Brown, who later along with Randolph Scott would create a partnership that would produce some of Scott's finest Westerns in the 50s.
