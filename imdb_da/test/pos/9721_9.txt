It's been years since I've seen these shows. I have been looking for years for someone else who has seen these or knows something about them. I thought I put them up. The one I remember most is the soldier and death. I would ask movie fanatics if they had seen these and mentioned it to a Jim Henson, and people didn't know it. These are amazing fables. I was very young when I was these, not even 10, and it left a lasting impression on my life and beliefs. I would recommend anyone to watch these, just remember they are from the 80s so they don't look like the movies today. just give them a shot. Jim Henson was far ahead of his time and died prematurely.
