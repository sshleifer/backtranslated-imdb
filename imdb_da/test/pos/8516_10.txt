There are many similarities between Never Say Never Again and Thunderball, not just on Sean Connery, but also the story and plot. Apart from the actors all others are the same as hijacking atomic bombs, who request ransom, trade in nukes in a ship, etc. Only difference is occurrence in thunderbolt plot it is in the Bahamas in Never Say Never Again it is over North Africa. And in thunderbolt, NATO / RAF loads itself nukes into planes and in Never Say Never Again it has been changed by a "rouge arm of axis" and the air fell over the US and stolen in the Caribbean. Almost 99% are the same. If anyone wants to contest this, they are very welcome.
