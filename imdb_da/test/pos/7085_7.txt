"One True Thing" puts Zellweger in the midst of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to take care of his dying mother (Streep). Summers and plodding study the film the adult child who is expressed with the adult perspective of the parents, as they are slowly being revealed to be less than the ideal she grew up to know as a child. An excellent character study and a small production error "OTT" offers three good performances by a trio of top actors and some clever reflections on life and death.
