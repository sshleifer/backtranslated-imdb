Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur is not one of his best-regarded films; Made between two much more popular and critically acclaimed images, Suspicion and Shadow Of a Doubt, it is generally considered a minor effort. I agree that later film is groundbreaking and draws Hitchcock all the way into the US mainstream for the first time, but Saboteur is at least as lively as Misunderstanding; Its main failure is its smaller than charismatic star players, Bob Cummings and Priscilla Lane. <br /> <br /> In Saboteur, we find Hitchcock to feel around America, literally, as its main character travels from California to New York in search of an arsonist whose crime he was accused of. Cummings is very youthful here and very engaging. His generosity (but not immaturity) fits perfectly with the character he imagines and seems appropriate as the director, although middle-aged, was reinventing himself and an older, more established star could have thrown things away. Priscilla Lane's spunky heroine, which was not a typical type for the director, was very much a common type in American films at the time; and she and Cummings provide an openness and a youth that the director needed both in his life and work at this time. I can't imagine older, more solid types - Cooper and Stanwyck for example - doing something better that they wanted between them, bringing good, too much luggage. <br /> <br /> As the norm in Hitchcock's movie is nothing like it seems. Where Saboteur differs from his better-known movies, it is that the audience gets hit on the game early. Although Cummings is an accused fire officer, we know he is innocent. The villains become apparent very soon; and the film hangs more on its plot than its irony. What pleasures are random, and the master does not disappoint. There is an interesting, Tod Browningish interlude with some circus freaks that help Cummings elude capture. In another scene reminiscent of James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein, Cummings spends some time in a blind hut, as it turns out is Lane's uncle. Was the instructor perhaps studying key American films from the previous decade? Whatever the case, these and other creepy and discursive aspects of the film give it a playfulness and variety that, when adding the very youthful leader, make the image seem like a youth's still-learning job crafts. <br /> <br /> The movie's later stages, in New York, are more exciting and typical of the director, as the image gradually becomes more Hitchockian as it moves along. Finally, I find it a satisfactory job; And since neither Cummings nor Lane has a dark side as an actor, the film does not have one either. It is deliberately lightweight and I suppose to be semi-experimental; an attempt by Hitchcock to see if he could retire into an American setting, which story he had done so well in England. He managed admirably. The next logical step: Shadow of doubt, a movie where the main character travels east to the west and with a completely different set of values ​​and plans. <br /> <br />
