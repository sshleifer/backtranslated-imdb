Where do I start? I was ready to laugh a little and I was blown away! This movie is just perfect, it is indescribable. Jackass number two in honesty was coarser, more obscene, more fun and entertaining than the first. It was just what I needed tonight. <br /> <br /> There are so many scenes in this movie that make you say "Oh My! No Way!" or "Ouch!" Perfectly mastered and created, each event and scene was coordinated before and thus made it even more perfect. I loved every minute of it! I just want to say that there was even a scene where it was necessary to censor certain footage to prevent an NC-17 rating! It was so fun that they had to put it in anyway! Incredibly good. <br /> <br /> 9/10. Incredibly fun, don't miss out!
