Tromeo and Juliet are perhaps the best Shakespeare modernization I have ever seen, not that there is much competition, but yet ... Tromeo and Juliet are certainly one of Troma's better films, one of the little gems hidden in a towering pile of fertilizer. It's a fun, action-packed, gory take on the world's greatest love story, but still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as you can except from this kind of movie. Well, except for the end, where Tromeo and Juliet kill Julie's fierce father and live happily together in a sun-drenched suburban area for the rest of their lives with their disgusting mutated children. This is the movie high School literature classes should show instead of getting poor students to read through hundreds and hundreds of pages of Shakespeare's scripts. Thumbs up!
