Just looked at this again. I would show it to one of my friends and we had the best time. That's why these kind of movies are made to entertain people, and Zombie Bloodbath 2 does it for me and for everyone I've shown it to. The story relates to a group of teenagers in a van driving into a group of escaped prisoners who have taken over an old farm. When a scarecrow (which is actually a demon I think) is disturbed, it comes to life and re-animates dead bodies from the local cemeteries. This leads our heroes to flee only to land in arms of two crazy kills who are torturing some people in a deli in a small town. Almost soon it's a showdown with people fighting with zombies. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie! From it's different formats (black and white movies, video and digital cameras) to the very fast pace and the good music, there was always something going on and it never bored you! Sure, it's cheap, but you can tell that a great deal of care and hard work went into this movie. I have read other reviews and all I can say is that these people have missed the point. If you want 35mm Full Moon fluff, or if you are into modern things like Urban Legend, then I say pass this on. If you like low budget stuff like Gates Of Hell and Evil Dead, I say buy it now. <br /> <br /> Make-up and gore is very good, the play is uneven at times, but everything is pretty good and editing is very impressive. There are enough to fill two movies! It's actually one of the better b movies I've seen in ages.
