Ever since I first played it in 1998, GoldenEye has been one of my favorite video games. In fact, I recently purchased an N64 only so I could own it and play it more often! The game is basically almost perfect: single player mode makes a fantastic job of immersing yourself in Bond's shoes, with varied mission goals, compelling weapons and high-level designs. Although the enemies' artificial intelligence is quite fundamental in today's standards, it only adds GoldenEye's appeal. The cheating method (completing levels within a strict deadline) was also innovative when the title was released, and even now I still haven't blown any of them! <br /> <br /> The game comes with a wonderful multiplayer mode for up to four players, and while this is not as advanced as the Combat Simulator in the game's sequel "Perfect Dark," it is still incredibly satisfying to blast your opponents into forges with a barrier of RC-P90 fire! ;-)
