Before this was shown on MTV or VH1 it was at my local theater to play just before the main movie. I remember this short movie more than the movie I saw that day. It was the first time I had ever had a music movie like this, but I will tell you that looking at the big screen from a 35 mm print in a darker theater gives it a much better influence than seeing a cropped pan and scanning version on VH1 on Halloween.
