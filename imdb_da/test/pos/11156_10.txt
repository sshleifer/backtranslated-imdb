The female housewife and perfect mother, Donna Reed (like Donna Stone) could do everything. Put the spats between the kids or the neighbors, grab her hard-working pediatrician husband Alex, Alex, and still have a stack of pancakes, three types of breakfast flesh and a tall glass of milk and OJ ready for the kids each morning before breakfast. Over the past fifty years, we have lost sight of the idealistic home-based mother, family meals together at the kitchen table, and preparing the dinner for hard-working man when he comes home from work. <br /> <br /> I want the show to be available on DVD - I would stop my cable altogether!
