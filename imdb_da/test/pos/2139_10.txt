I saw the longer version and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. 219 minutes passed and yet it seemed that only one hour had passed. The characters were very trustworthy and entertaining, and the photography was excellent. the story drew me in and kept my attention. I will definitely see this again and again. this true story tells it's best ... not Hollywood's usual cheap excitement and skin deep glitz. I've seen a lot of reviews on this movie. Most seem to pan the film or give it a faint praise. Basically, it is a great movie that received unreasonably tough reviews. see it yourself with an open mind. If you like westerns, historical period pieces, albeit historically inaccurate you will enjoy the movie. Superb !!! 10.10
