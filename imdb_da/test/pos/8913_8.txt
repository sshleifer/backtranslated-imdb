There's more to this movie than to meet the eye. If you are looking for groundbreaking originality or light comedy, you will be disappointed. But for an entertaining 90 minutes it's just fine. <br /> <br /> The camera is careful and precise. The gender scenes that a commentary states as free are anything but - every gesture contributes to the development of the characters. Yes, some of the protagonists are not exactly lovable people. But the film makes an honest effort to show their interactions in an honest light without being sensationalist (at least not to the early 21st century city standards). And there are many very fun moments.
