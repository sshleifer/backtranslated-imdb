Join The Story of Sweeney Todd ... The Strangest, Most Deterrent, But Most Wonderful Broadway Musical. It is chilling, fun and moves all at once through Sondheim's most memorable and incredible score and sharp performances. George Hearn is unmatched in the title role and brings a strong voice and death (no saying calculated) imitating the legendary demon shaving, while Angela Lansbury gives it comic relief as she pleasantly strikes her victims in meat pies. If you just allow yourself to enjoy it, "Sweeney Todd" is a real treat.
