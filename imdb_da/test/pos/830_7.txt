I enjoyed it. You go there, I said it again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a couple of times. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer movies like this to run like Die Hard 4, holding up the box office and getting critical recognition just because you have some old guys saving America. Van Damme moves well to a guy of his age (47 I think), delivering kicks reminiscent of one of the Kickboxer. If you like old school actions and explosions, it's the movie to watch. This is one of Van Damme's best works. <br /> <br /> Van Damme and Steven Seagal movies are released theater-wise where I live, so I never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen.
