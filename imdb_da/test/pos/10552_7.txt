This is another case of Hollywood arrogance that supposes to presume French style. The original Mon Pere ce heros was one of the most charming films in 1991, so of course the Hollywood accountants thought they could hire Depardieu and call the rest. However, they took caution by hiring Francis Veber to write an English version, although one uses virtually every word in the original. Depardieu brings his gallic charm, and Katherine Heigl shows all the promise that now pays. The thing is, when the French make a kind of Lolita little, they get away with it because the 'dirty French postcard' thinking works to their advantage; here is the Hollywood idea of ​​lightweight having Depardieu (totally unaware that his daughter has let it be known that he is actually her lover), has the power to play and sing 'something French', launch in a lively version of the sky too little girls. See the original.
