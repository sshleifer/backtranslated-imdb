This is a very noir kind of episode. It begins with Jim returning from a weekend flight with a new boyfriend, the recently divorced Karen Mills (Pat Delaney - John Houston's daughter who knew a few things about noir film) and her daughter. When they arrive, Karen enters the house while Jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and leads her up to her room. He then discovers that Karen has disappeared without a trace. Of course he calls Dennis, and when the police arrive, they do not see any signs of Karen, but find her neighbor's neighbor murdered in the bushes. So of course it makes Jim an immediate suspicion. <br /> <br /> This is a good little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by Rocky and asks Jim to go over the story again. Rocky suggests that Jim telling him the story that he might remember a little detail that he didn't think was important at the time, but now could lead to a clue what happened. It is a really well-written scene and completes the transition from Rocky character from a chorus to an affected parent. It also goes a long way to show that Rocky is not just some clueless old man. As he says, "You come to me because I am your father, and I am smarter than you!" This is one of the times when we see where Jim got his smarts. This episode also has the look of hottie Lara Parker, who played Angelique in the series "Dark Shadows" and continued to play Laura Banner, Bruce's wife in the "Incredible Hulk" series a few years later. She looks great here. <br /> <br /> This episode also marks the first mention of the Minette Crime Family, a name that would keep up with Rockford files almost every time they needed a mob family. This time, Vincent Minette as Rockford helps understand. <br /> <br /> Lt. Diehl (Tom Atkins) makes his first appearance on the series, and Dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he was in the previous season an episode to a policeman Sargent. I suppose they figured it would be better to have Dennis less powerful and add some conflict between Jim and the police. Frankly, they were right even though I prefer the later Lt. Chapman to Lt. Diehl. <br /> <br /> Not much of the typical "Rockford" humor in this episode, but a good mystery with a lot of heart.
