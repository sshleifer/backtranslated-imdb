Jack and Kate meet the doctor Daniel Farady first and then the psychic Miles Straume and they demonstrate that they have not come to the island for the purpose of saving the survivors. Locke and his group find anthropologist Charlotte Staples Lewis and Ben Linus shoots her. Meanwhile, the group of Jack pilot Frank Lapidus, who landed the helicopter with minor damage that can be repaired. Jack strengthens Miles to tell the right intention why they have come to the island. <br /> <br /> The second episode of the fourth season returns to the island with four new characters, stopping the confusing "flash-forward" and it seems that it will finally be the start of the explanations that I ( and most fans and viewers expect to be delivered in "Lost". Why the government's interest in Ben Linus and how he is informed by the boat are some of the issues I expect to see in the next episodes. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
