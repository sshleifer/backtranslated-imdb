I have been looking forward to the release of this DVD (and it is follow-up {Female Prisoner Scorpion: # 701's Grudge Song}) for some time. I very much enjoyed the first two films in this series. After just watching this movie, I would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three. <br /> <br /> All three of these films were directed by Shunya Ito. What is good about them is that, although they all have the same main character (wonderfully played by Meiko Kaji), each one is very different from the others. <br /> <br /> The first movie (Female Prisoner # 701: Scorpion) is more or less a typical Women In Prison movie. But the character of Scorpion is very exciting - much reminiscent of anti-heroes from many spaghetti westerns. And the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material. <br /> <br /> The second movie (Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41) is a real turn-the-force. Not so much a WIP movie, as most of the film has Scorpion and six other liberated inmates on the lamb. <br /> <br /> This movie (Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable) is the third in the series and the last of Shunya Ito's ranks. This plays so much more of a crime drama. Once again, our heroine is on his way. But this time, she has managed to maintain some degree of normality in her life (relatively anyway). She gets a job, she finds a place to live, she makes a friend on the outside. But of course, everything must ultimately arise. FPS: Beast Stable has a fairer story that is told at a more relaxed pace than its predecessors. But I found it to be engaging from the beginning to the end. And don't worry: there is still plenty of depravity to walk around in this movie! But I think these movies exceed most of the exploit films, because the more disturbing elements are played in a right tone, than in being exclusively used for in-your-face shock value. Yes, there were certainly moments in this movie where I crawled mightily. But I did not feel they were deteriorating the value of the story (well, maybe once or twice). One thing I have enjoyed greatly about these films is the continued build-up of Scorpion's myths. With this entry, the character development is used much more widely than in the previous two. We're going to see that she's much more than just a rock-hearted revenge badass! As I mentioned earlier in this review, a fourth movie followed. It also contains Meiko Kaji as Scorpion, but had another director. Without giving anything away, I would like to mention that FPS: Beast Stable ends in such a way that a successor becomes completely unnecessary. The fourth movie is still pretty good, but it seems to be a superfluous footnote to a thought-laden trilogy. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in out-of-the-ordinary movies. FPS: Beast Stable can be enjoyed as an independent piece (like the first two films), but I would also recommend seeing the others first if you haven't already done so.
