Human traffic is a view of an average weekend for a group of friends, it is a fly-on-the-wall display in their lives (and minds) that will show you how this group of friends relates to each other. There are many moments in which everyone can relate, like being out of your skull at parties and talking completely rubbish to strangers. The characters are all people you can relate to and they are credible in the roles they play in the movie. The situations they are in are all situations that we have all found ourselves in, and this is where this film succeeds. The issues of sex and drugs are handled excellently, so you don't get in the way of the character's relationship to each other. The story of the movie isn't all that, but it's not a criticism. This is a movie about people. This is a well-written movie, with a soundtrack to die for. D.J's Pete Tong has put together a fantastic selection of tracks for this file, which everyone goes to make this one of the best movies I've seen in 1999. After watching this movie, I felt like I had been out to party all weekend. Great film! Well Brand as Reality - May I say more! <br /> <br />
