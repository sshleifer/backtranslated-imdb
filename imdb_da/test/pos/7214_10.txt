I think it was Fran√ßois Truffaut who said that the best movies either involve the joy of making movies or the pain of making movies. This flick is definitely the first type. Tromeo and Juliet are a pleasure to see from start to finish. The zany zeal that burns this Shakespearian shenanigan is contagious. I don't think I've been laughing so hard since I saw Monty Python and Holy Grail. It's so good!
