I have to admit that I know some of those involved, I was in the forerunner of The Planet, Evil Unleased, but it was more than 10 years ago and I had since lost contact with them. I happened to see BBC Scotland News and a bit about Scottish Cinema, this mentioned and showed clips from The Planet and comments from it's director Mark Stirton. This prompted me to order a copy of the movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie is the level of shopping, writing, steering and sfx up there with some of the best around, ok it's not Star Wars, but I've seen many a Hollywood product that is far inferior. It is very strange to see a movie spoken in my local North East Scotland accent, but it went soon. <br /> <br /> ^ Mild Spoilers ^ <br /> <br /> The planet draws on several sci-fi classics; Star Wars, Alien, Pitch Black, Forbidden Planet and Predator, a handful of traders on a deep spacecraft survive their craft are attacked and destroyed by unknown ships, escaping on a deserted desert plane, one by one they are killed by invisible attackers, the ship's only one Passages, a mysterious prisoner also makes it to the planet, a battle follows as the crew battle to survive. <br /> <br /> Planet is a brilliant piece of sci-fi movie that definitely hides the limited budget, well done to Mark, Mike and everyone involved, I'm looking forward to your next job.
