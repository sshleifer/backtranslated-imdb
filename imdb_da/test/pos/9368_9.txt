A movie like Crossfire puts another movie that spreads around its social consciousness - that is, the latest movie Crash - almost to shame. Not necessarily because one of them makes its intolerance-the rat more significant (though I would bet Crash throws the hammer far more thickly compared to this), but because of how the story and the stories never get much in the way of Crash . Perhaps it is not really necessary to compare the two, since Crossfire is in its core quite deep into the film noir vein as going out of style. It was interesting to see what the director Edward Dmytryk said on the DVD interview, where he mentioned that the photograph for the photograph was significantly lower (intentionally) so that more could be used for the actors, and the chart went through a very fast, fast pace. But then what comes out is amazing to look at the picture that you would think of looking at many of the lighting settings that it required a lot to do. Just for a small scene, which when Robert Mitchum's Keeely first advocates questioning Captain Robert Young - the contrasts of the shadows are seamless in the living room exquisite. That there are many other lighting setups that go even further with so little marks this as something important within the very look of the noir period. Just take a look at the signs of a stairwell, the columns silhouetted against them and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> But back to the substance part of the movie - it's really a story that consists of a murder mystery, but one that we as the audience don't take long to find out the answer. It is more about something other than a murderer's mind and soul that would not be found in a common crime picture, as there is really no "criminal" for the most part in the movie. There is a very calculated risk with this, so signs can be too thin just to cope with the (worthy) message against anti-Semitism. But Dmytryt's direction of his top shelf thrown together with a really great script by John Paxton throws out the characters, at least for what they shouldn't seem too thin along with the message. And what would a noir be without any attitude to follow? Mitchum helps it together, even in scenes such as between him and Young, where much is based on the moments of history (ie, a detail of the plot) by injecting a little sly into some of the dialogues. It may already be there in the lines, but he helps make the character a good edge for his scenes. Then there is Robert Ryan, who is distinguished by Montgomery as a man you know you don 't like much first, just through his bs Demeanor, but you are not quite sure either. Then once it begins to get clearer - ironically through a subjective point of view of the suspect Mitchell (George Cooper) in the occasion of the soon-to-dead Samuels - his performance becomes a great balanced act of being full of shed and also quite scary in his blind way. It is a good performance when you also counteract Cooper who has actual personal problems that he is facing and comes up with regret and humility. It is really after the movie ends, as one thinks of much of this, and while watching the movie, it is more about getting into dialogue and the stage of the scene, and in the sometimes sharp, overwhelming camera moving on actors, so the message is in a way secondary. Not that it is not important, especially for the time period (coming straight out of World War II), but years later they see the actors, even those who do not get the high marking status as Gloria Grahame as Ginny (the femme fatal of the picture if it could have had time for one that it does not) and William Phipps as Leroy ("hick") who work from each other, sticking very strongly in the compressed manuscript. <br /> <br /> Dmytryk is also very wise in choosing to limit musical score is also powerful, because in very long stretches we hear nothing, and mostly when it comes up, it is random for the character's surroundings. He might as well have gone with added musical notes about some dramatic scenes for weight, especially opening audience-grabs in the movie. By keeping it free and getting the right attitudes and nuances in the camera and cast, it raises the standards of genre material to a very fine, memorable level. My favorite scene would probably go to Finley's story of an Irish immigrant, he tells Leroy, where all such elements come in handy. It may not come very high at the top of my favorite noir - and I still want to throw Murder My Sweet as the director's masterpiece in this kind of picture - but it's probably higher in quality than any of the B levels as well.
