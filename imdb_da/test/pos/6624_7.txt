After seeing Ingmar Bergman's Shame, I had many feelings, but especially I felt dissatisfied. I've heard so much hype about this movie, but I came to find it missing. Don't make me wrong, I can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a movie, but as far as depth and emotion are concerned, I wasn't so impressed. I found the signs to be unpleasant and unrealistic, which detracted from the dramatic effect. In addition, the fact that the war was false led me to feel that the feeling was not genuine. Dramatic war films are, in my opinion, much more effective if the events (not necessarily the story itself) really have happened. I find it out of all the movies trying to show the brutality, this falls in the middle as far as efficiency.
