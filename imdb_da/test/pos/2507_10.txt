I'm a big, beaten up heterosexual male ex-bouncer, ex-rugby player and ex-boxer, and I love this movie. There is no "Mystic River". It's a piece of fluff. But there is room in the life of fluff, and when it fluff is engagingly shot, well-traded by attractive, sympathetic people, wisely plotted and full of good dialogue, there is even more room for it. <br /> <br /> I'm not the biggest Tom Selleck fan. But he is good at this. Then Julianne Nicholson (loves her bald head and fringe), Ellen Degeneres, Kate Capshaw and even Tom Everett Scott. It's great, the atmosphere is optimistic. heartache and wistfulness and farce and even a little redemption. <br /> <br /> Any (male) reviewer who's this movie is, let's say, not quite self-confidence in his masculinity. Meanwhile, I will continue to capture bits and pieces of it without excuse when it turns out on cable.
