I watched this movie a week ago and I had to persuade my friend to come with me because this movie seems to have such bad reviews. Sure it's not 'human traffic' or 'lock, make ...' but is not a flop at all. I think there are so many big budget movies at the moment, it's been ignored, but it shouldn't be. It expects me to do what it will do - entertain us for an hour and a half and let us feel satisfied and satisfied. I'd much rather go and see it as "The Mummy" that looks boring. And no, I'm not a teenager. Don't listen to the critics, Star Wars fans didn't. This movie is worth seeing if just to see the beautiful Luke de Lacey and Rupert Penry-Jones. Go see it!
