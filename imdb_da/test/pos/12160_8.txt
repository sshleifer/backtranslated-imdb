With the whole of mainland Europe under his control, Hitler prepares for the last obstacle in the way before going to North America, Britain. With an overwhelming edge in flight, Goerings Luftwaffe sees unstoppable on paper. Once in the air, however, the RAF disturbs the paradigm by blowing the enemy out of the air with a seven to a speed. The battle of Britain rages for over a year as the island nation is the blood but uninhabited, giving time for their American allies to produce more weapons for the inevitable battle. <br /> <br /> By using more staged recordings than the three previous documentaries in the Why We Fight series, the Battle of Britain has a more propaganda like feeling it with the dramatized (some with unmistakable Warner music scores) scenes that is obviously obvious for unexplained. In an ironic twist in the midst of the destruction caused by German air strikes, Beethoven's seventh symphony is employed to emphasize the visual distress. The story itself is a remarkable courage of a defiant nation who refused to undermine the devastating attacks brought on so far into an invincible war machine. It is the 20th century version of the 300 Spartans. There has been more exhaustive and better-looking commercial efforts on this battle since this film, but the immediacy and motivation of the Battle of Britain will always make it a more valuable document of England in its "finest hour".
