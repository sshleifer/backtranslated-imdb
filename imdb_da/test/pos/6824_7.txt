The problem with the movie is simply this, Conrad's prose is highly verbose and cannot be adapted to a movie. Marlow's story in the story captures you from the first sentence, and you only "see" what Conrad writes about. In movies it is different, you see the visual, but the description and reflection, which really creates the novel, is horrible. But as far as an unadaptable book has been adapted, it is of a good standard. There are exactly the same scenes that are accurately designated, but they never have the same effect as in the novel. The reason in the film has been improved and it seems very good to make it more interesting. The references to ancient Egypt were carefully inserted. My tip, read the book and keep it the way there are better movies out there.
