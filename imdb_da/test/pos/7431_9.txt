This movie is based on the game series: Final Fantasy. This is mainly about FF7 or Final Fantasy VII. I loved the game and I was very happy to see it turn into a movie I loved CG, it was great. The party's great fighting scenes, actions and characters to make the movie memorable. If you are a drowsy fan of the game, you will love this movie. Personally, I'm not a deadly fan of the games, but I'm starting to become one. My favorite character out of Final Fantasy VII besides Cloud should be Cid. I love Cid, I think he's sweet. I was amazed at how real CG images were, it was great, it's played in 3D. I had a good time watching the movie, and by the way I love the islands, especially Bahamut, he's great! Overall I gave this movie a 9 because yes, I loved it. I thought it was a really good movie, and yes it is on my list of movies to get. The characters were amazing, beloved CG, the story was wonderful, with many actions and fighting scenes. All in all, it's the best movie I've ever seen based on a video game.
