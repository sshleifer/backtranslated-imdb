Cool action - yes the premise has been made - but not so - that's the trick. hi people - SHOCK - it's an X file. For me - it is cool that Scully / Mulder hardly have scenes together - they have to adapt, rely on each other's real sense of what really goes on - and each other's adaptation skills. They read into each other's movements and get the work .... (kind). Oh yeah --- really good acting - are these people paid to do this? Or a slow day when the grocery store doesn't call them work. (Hi - Duchovny - where are the day-old donuts ?? Malcolm - come to school ...)
