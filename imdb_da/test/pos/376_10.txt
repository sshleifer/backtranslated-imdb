I have never seen this in the theater, my second view tonight was on the big screen DVD as opposed to the old VHS tape from the rental store. <br /> <br /> Saucey for it's time, and I'm sure the Hayes code was pushed to it's limits. <br /> <br /> The Hitch pallet here is "game play" between two combatants. And yes, if Guy calls the police immediately at Bruno, the movie is 63 min shorter, HELLO people always make you the best or most logical choice. How many times have you been in both people's shoes and made the right choice? For God's love, it is called a poetic license. But as Guy sees the situation, he has found himself, he takes it on himself to correct it. He does not ask for help, nor does he lie to his being a new wife. Her defense of him puts the playoffs with Bruno that he has a card to play. <br /> <br /> For the policeman, an innocent person shot in pre-chamber days and before the engagement rules kind of thing happened. In the post of Rodney King World, a presidential candidate supported police sending 43 bullets to an unarmed man. If you have not seen or witnessed outrageous police behavior, you are blind or have an application waiting for the academy. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie ... <br /> <br /> Watch it. Try and use a post-WWII filter and pretend to see a great thrill movie that many did for the first time, and surely it has been copied since, but you are looking at a source of inspiration for many who followed .
