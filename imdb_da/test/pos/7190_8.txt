I don't know about the English version of this movie, but the Norwegian translation is the funniest movie I've seen for many years. The characters say so many fun things and make so many odd references to current events that I am amazed at, they held several options like the architect who can never properly say the name of the Miraculix Wizard. There will be things like Malcom (i) X and "foreign", which is Norwegian for foreign affairs. <br /> <br /> Like the word foreign, many of the translations make no sense in English and probably not in French, so the translators must have made their own jokes and done so well. Of course, they have a very good base to build on, with a movie that is simply comical from start to finish! Recommended in all languages ​​with a good translation!
