This one-man show can be the most amazing show I've ever seen. To call it here is a stand up act to make it a great injustice, there is a particular reason why this was a Broadway show. John Leguizamo is a master to make people of every culture feel at home and listen to his story of growing up and dealing with his family and life in general. I would recommend this show to anyone as long as they can handle the language.
