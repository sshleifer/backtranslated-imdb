Just finished this impressive nutty affair, and while I can't say it was as good as I had hyped it up to be in my mind, it was still an effective and sometimes beautiful creepy piece of brain creep and misogyny burned J-ratchet. Its story tells of a bad gal who is searching for her sister, who turns up to be raped and killed by Yakuza scumbags and the helpful lady doctor who puts her head in, makes it bizarre cruel after a similar violence and rape. Oh yeah, and there is also a bit of sex in it too, unfortunately it is all its soft core, as per. Japanese disapproval under belt nudity, but pixelation is minimal, in fact, only really noticeable in a hilarious blow job scene. Although the writer / director Kazuo "Gaira", Komizu fails to create a particularly convincing tale, it is at least beautifully creepy things that dive into the dirt well early with a rather unpleasant rape (exacerbated by the fact that crazy looks a little young, though I'm pretty sure she was of age. Also, for the most part, it's pretty professional looking stuff, maybe not stylish, but it has a certain flair, and the content is handled fairly well, with special kudos too largely to avoid using much pixellation. Things are mostly sex / rape based on about two thirds of the sharp runtime, and it is beautiful to see if you are tracking such danger, it becomes a little numb after a while, but the ladies are easy on the eye and it is sometimes quite hard. The music from YÃ´ichi Takahashi is occasionally effective, although it is hardly an important part of the show that does it in a few points, complementing the action nicely, at least enough for me to notice it. More important are the effects of Nobuaki Koga, which packs an impressive splattery blow when they look, aided by the tonic nature of the climatic shenanigans. Things even draw a curious influence, it is certainly not a laugh or something, but for a movie so boys level for most of its runtime it is relatively exciting. All in all, this is a pretty entertaining diversion for average ghost fans, especially those with a Japanese rapeseed flavor. I could really have done with a longer revenge section and more gore, maybe even more of a point / brain, but hey, it kept me looking and it's pretty neat stocked with memorably wtf moments. So if you dig this kind of degenerate junk, probably worth it, you just can't expect the second coming.
