If you have never experienced what is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu zinger! In 1933, Mae Questel Pitts voice to the character Olive Oyl of Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the comic book Popeye. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) makes his best "Olive Oyl" imitation, wandering around calling her hands or attaching to the policeman's laynard. I waited for her to say "ohhh myyyy" but instead it is "something always happens to someone." The first time I saw this movie I loved Zasu and found her character really fun. I have since seen her in other films where she does the same whining, tight, fragile flower routine. So by looking at this movie again, I started to get a little annoyed with the constant whining and near hysteria over a piece of dust. But there are some funny comedy bits here, and it's also a mysterious movie too. It's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that actually works. Mysterious plot holds together well through the camp of Zasu Pitts and James Gleason, who plays Arthur Crimmer policeman. The Haunted House is fun with many a secret passage and even a skeleton in the ceiling! Well worth the watch. Read more public domain movie reviews at: http://pdmoviereview.blogspot.com/
