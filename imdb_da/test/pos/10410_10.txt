I remember a show where this overweight lady had a pair of glasses that let her food talk to her. Needless to say, she couldn't eat her friends so she starved to death. Another episode had an accountant visiting an underground sewer & metro security department. The auditor wanted to close the funding for the project. As it turns out, the security department was underfunded to fight the cannibalistic creatures that lived in the dark. www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html
