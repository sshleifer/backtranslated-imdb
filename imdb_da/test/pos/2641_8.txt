While keeping her predecessor, "The Fast Times At Ridgemont High," as a standard by which other teen competences are to be compared, "The Wild Life" is one of the better-known films of that time - and a worthy successor, If you can call it that. I think its tagline reads: "From the creators of FTARH, something even faster." This certainly applies. Although it may lack the depth of the former, tackling issues such as first dates, teen sex and abortion, "The Wild Life" is nevertheless a good flick. It's pure chaotic fun, especially because of Chris Penn's over-the-top character, Thomas Drake. If Spicolli was high on cola instead of weeds, he would be Drake. Eric Stoltz, in his first major role, is great as the straight-laced Bill Conrad. The two characters work well together. Think of a younger, hipster Odd Couple, complete with 80's sheen. Outside of them there are so many other great things about this movie worth mentioning. Lea Thompsom has never seen cuter, especially during the scenes in her work at the donut shop. Jenny Wright is just lovely and fun to watch. Rick Moranis plays a big geek / perv who dies to get in his pants. Thomas Drake's wrestlers are hysterical, especially Benny, the little Portuguese guy who says some pretty memorable lines. One especially that he shouts out during a night out at a strip club had me on the floor the first time I saw it. It says something! Finally, the film ends with one of the best 80's party scenes on film, ever. Watch out for special performances by Ron Wood of Rolling Stones, Leo Penn (Sean and Chris Penn's father), and a random Michael Jackson look-like at the party. Throw a score of none other than the man himself, Eddie Van Halen, and you can't go wrong. For Van Hagar fans, keep your ears open to riffs found on such albums as the 5150, OU812, and For Illegal Carnival. <br /> <br /> If something interferes with the flow of the movie, it is a small subplot involving Randy Quaid as a widespread Vietnam veterinarian. It just seems out of place and unnecessary. Other than that, it's almost perfect. If you're a fan of mindless but fun 80's movies and haven't seen this yet, you're aware of something special. Rent it now !!! <br /> <br /> The credits say Cameron Crowe has a cameo as one of the police in the movie. He has his back turned under his scene because I have not yet found him. Someone please help me.
