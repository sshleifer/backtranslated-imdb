This is a good movie that is deficient in many ways with low production. Martha Coolidge herself said she only had $ 350,000 to work with. This is a movie I loved growing up in the Midwest. I remember friends and I have the nostalgia tour of this movie 10 years ago. Great stuff about this movie .... Fantastic cast with hungry actors and a hungry instructor. Bad points in this movie .... Too little of a budget requires too much improvisation. If Martha Coolidge had received more money and time on this movie, the results would have been even better. They should have taken the story from an early 20-year prospective and not from a 15-17 year high school standpoint. Most of the actors / actors were in their early to mid 20's trying to play 15-17 year olds .... (move on) The music is extremely memorable and the two soundtracks are played all the time in my car. The best scenes in this movie take place in seedy Hollywood clubs by Nicolas Cage's character. I gave this movie a high rating of 9/10 for five reasons. Nicholas Cage's on-site improvisation works; The camera's work and angles are excellent considering the budget they had and only being able to have a slice of each scene; Sytles, music and lingo are recorded perfectly and forever; Again, the music is incredible and carries the story together from stage to stage; And finally ... Martha Coolidge could turn a weak manuscript, unknown actors and a very very low budget and 20 days of shooting the whole movie into such a good and memorable movie is amazing!
