What kind I say about this movie. good for starters, i thought this movie was okay, not the biggest not the worst. I said because I thought the script was big and original, really different and refreshing. Now I don't want to say that this is the biggest movie I've seen cause of the actor. The actors who played every role think they played them without emotion, as if they were killing them. When wife laughed or cried, it didn't work for some reason, it's just an example, but sincerely all the signs didn't seem right. I wish I could say more positive things about this movie, so you can see it at least once, but how can I do it when I know I'm not going to watch this movie again. I rented this movie from my school's library, without hearing anything about the movie itself or the director. I took a chance because the story described at the back sounded very interesting and it really was.
