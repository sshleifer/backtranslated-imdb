It may be the most thrilling movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's so nerve-racking, I haven't been able to see it again after seeing it two years ago, but I want since I have the DVD. There were a couple of scenes in there that are almost too much to see .... so if you have trouble and need to "escape" for half an hour and a half, this movie will put you off something else. <br /> <br /> Russian actress Marina Zudina did a great job alone in the facial expressions she was supposed to do when her character in here is a dumb. She plays a sweet and healthy makeup artist for a sleazy movie maker. After today's recording is finished and "Billie" is leaving, she hears something. She looks into the room where they filmed and discovers that they are now shooting a "snus movie" and actually killing someone. Billie's eavesdropping is discovered and she runs for her life, as the killers are searching for her in this large warehouse. <br /> <br /> There are two extended scenes where our heroine runs for her life and both of them will carry you out. The first thing I described above. The second scene, the climax, continues for too long and is not as good as the first. In fact, the film should have been trimmed a little, but generally, as it is so good to keep our attention, it served its purpose as entertainment.
