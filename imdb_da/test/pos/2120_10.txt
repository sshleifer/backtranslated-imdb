My kids, DD 7 and DS 10, enjoyed the movie so much that they jumped into their seats. It was good, old-fashioned, rated G, family fun. This movie was made for kids .... someone really understands them. <br /> <br /> Watching Julia Roberts, Brice Willis, Garth Brooks and the other stars was fun. <br /> <As someone living in the city, the fictional "Big Texas" was modeled after I could say they did an honest and accurate depiction. The kids looked like children, not superstars. I hope everyone supports this movie to send the message to Hollywood that we need more movies like this. Go see it and then spread it!
