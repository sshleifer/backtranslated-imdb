I used to see this also at junior school in Petersfield Hampshire around 1975. The odd thing is that from time to time I think about it (I'm now 40) The big question runs through the length of the series (no idea how many episodes 6? ?) was the identity of the person driving the motorcycle! "I have previously asked friends about this series, and they have no idea what I'm talking about and think it's a kind of strange dream I've had. I never understood this day the educational benefit of this but thought about the time it was great but a little scary. I seem to remember that there was a break in the middle of each episode earlier. No idea why. Would love to see it again. Got a short clip through the BBC cult site.
