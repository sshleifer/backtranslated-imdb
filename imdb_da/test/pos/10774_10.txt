This movie is completely mindblowing. It manages to be thoughtful, funny, tragic and cinematic, but claustrophobic. <br /> <br /> Although flashbacks are unnecessary, the film maintains a pacifist, tight grip, and the show is excellent, especially Alec Baldwin, and the fascinating Eric Bogosian as the film's anti-hero, Barry Champlain.
