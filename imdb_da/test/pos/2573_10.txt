This if the first movie I have given a 10 to this year. If there was ever a movie that demanded mouth-to-mouth to promote, it is. A $ 4 mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's all about. If you have any appreciation for Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, this is the only reason to see it. How many people knew that Jackson could sing, and that was fine too. You hear books and movies talking about being about salvation. Having seen this, you will never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word. Yes, it is gritty, sexy, down home truth, bizarre and in your face real. Isn't it the best reason to watch a movie? Those who get my opinion will not stay away from seeing this second week.
