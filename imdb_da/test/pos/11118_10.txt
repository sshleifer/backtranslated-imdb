This film tells the story of nine ambitious teenagers trying to follow their dream at the infamous New York High School for Performing Arts: Coco, singer Bruno, the modern Mozart, Lisa, Leroy and Hilary, the fighting dancers Ralph, the comedians, and Doris and Montgomery, the actors. While they all believe they have what it takes to really achieve their goals, they will need much more than just their talent. They must handle rejection, heartache, education, pain and love to achieve their fame. <br /> <br /> "Fame" is one of the most entertaining, classic and inspirational films from all the time. It has everything a teenage drama / musical should have: extremely captivating, entertaining, Oscar-winning songs performed by the amazing Irene Cara, amazing dance tracks, a very attractive cast that makes you believe in the characters and a great story including the heartbreaking scene when Coco meets the camcorder. <br /> <br /> As I said, the cast is amazing. Irene Cara can really act and it's not just her song that makes her shine here as Coco. Lee Curreri is very good as Bruno. Barry Miller brings a lot of humor to Ralph. Maureen Teefy is great as they excluded Doris and look up close and you'll see Paul McCrane of "ER" like Montgomery. This is really a great movie. "Fame" really raised me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer. Any movie that moves me so much is a winner in my book. A must-see! The movie really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer.
