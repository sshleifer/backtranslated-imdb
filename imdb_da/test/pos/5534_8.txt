Strange but acceptable mob comedy that has an undercover FBI agent (Matthew Modine) flirting with a mobster's worried widow (Michelle Pfeffier) ​​to tie two murders to an elusive bully (Dean Stockwell). <br /> <br /> The movie shows it doesn't have to go over the top just to be fun, and director Jonathan Demme ("The Silence of the Lambs", "Philadelphia") keeps the movie from looking like it was detained. It's good and it avoids being predictable.
