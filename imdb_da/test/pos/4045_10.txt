People who compare this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie appeared. Although it is lacking in the large specialty department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful merger of two ancient folk tales here. The working talent, but not the A list, is still fantastic, and the interaction between the characters may be more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My special favorite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as Snow Queen herself moved completely, was hugely helped by a fantastic wardrobe and makeup. She injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the nature of the fallen season destroyed by the devil's evil magic. Fonda aside the actor was not what we expected from Hollywood, which I think is a good thing, as Hollywood apparently has run out of ideas on how to train his actor talent to portray roles and so they have become obsolete and dependent of CGI and other special effects to take us away from the actors, who all use the same tricks on us. Instead, it shows new ideas, some real thoughts from the actors about how they can find new variations on the old themes of love and danger.
