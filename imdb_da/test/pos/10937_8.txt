This splitting of THE SEARCHERS is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen filmed by a Brit in a strange, unknown Mexico. It is often said that the best films about America are made by foreigners who can turn to what is known about an outsider's eye. But this crackpot movie is something else. Although apparently shown in post-civil war America, it is not an America that is recognizable from myth, cinema, television, etc. The film has an air of timeless fable about it while specifically dealing with Western mythology. <br /> <br /> Director Harvey uses the title horse as a focus for linking stories, all dealing with the traditional western clashes of primitive and civilization. The former seems to have the upper hand. The huge scrub and desert in the film's landscape is unbroken, ripe for the allegory of the mind. The only short places in civilization are a scene coach of missionaries and landowners, and their hacienda, who both have behaviors other than civilized. <br /> <br /> The basic story cheats three stories. In one, a speechless descendant, Pike, has lost his trading partner, stealing a miraculous horse, Eagle's Wing, so-called because of its grace and speed. In the other leader an Indian, White Bull, owner of this horse a stage coach and kidnap one of his female residents. In the third, the Spanish men sent to find her ignoring this quest in favor of a murderous raid. <br /> <br /> Although it is a revisionist western, the treatment of the Indians is problematic. Unlike Pike, his character has never been explained, forever inevitable, denied a voice, except for a creepy snoop. When he is not a strange other, he is a symbol whose role is not entirely worked out - at one point a wild brute, on the other he embodies nature and freedom. <br /> <br /> But Pike initially notes that the film will take part in primitivism's period before civilization. In many ways, the movie looks like 2001 - A SPACE ODYSSEY, especially its opening sequence. Part of the film's power lies in the connections between the three different characters that force us to see the mythical struggles and tasks in another light. Indian culture and Catholicism are associated with superstition, ritual, greed, and murder. Both Pike and White Bull are musical and alcoholic. White Bull is demonized by both Pike and the abducted as a "bastard", who unknowingly revealed the illegitimate activation used by colonizing whites infantilizing the natives and becoming their "necessary" fathers. <br /> <br /> Unlike a traditional western, dealing with history, civilization, and progress, this film is a dual detective story that interrogates the past, tracks, remnants. <br /> <br /> What gives this movie its remarkable uniqueness, I believe, is, despite Malta's racism, its British. The climatic stand-off is more like an Arthurian joust. The movie itself largely displaces the dialogue for the most part, creating the kind of visual and sounding tapestry Malick missed in THE THIN RED LINE, and a few Hollywood directors would have dared. The existential doubling and quest motifs are more European myths than American ones (resembling another British Harvey Keitel movie, THE DUELLISTS). The most amazing thing is the use of nature. Most Westerners use the landscape as an awe inspiring background: there is little feeling of living in the west. In many ways, EAGLE'S WING as a Powell and Pressberger movie, with nature a strong pantheistic character in itself - living, dangerous, hostile and beautiful. There is a sublime scene reminiscent of a CANTERBURY TALK when leaving jewelry as a trap of White Bull in the trees is suddenly blown in the wind: there is a joking, tingling, magical and exciting effect reminiscent of the Arabian evenings than a horse opera. Cardiac arrest.
