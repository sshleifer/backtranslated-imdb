This is a plot driven movie and extremely entertaining. Nothing scary or original within the plot, but crucially, it moves together at a great pace and therefore keeps your attention. I didn't really notice the play I think is a good thing. John Mills was fine, but seemed to take everything in his steps, considering how his life was falling apart around him. He would be lumpy on his head, stand up 20 seconds later, push down and continue as if nothing had happened. A lesser stranglehold in a movie with a strong history, authentic sites and a plot that keeps you guessing all the way to its conclusion.
