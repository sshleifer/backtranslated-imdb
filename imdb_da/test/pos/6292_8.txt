I love it! I love Pauly Shore. It seems that some people do not agree. It's humor, and he's not like everyone else. The movie is amazing. I love the story and most people in the movie. It's fun from the first time she meets him at school. I like the fact that she chooses him over the guy home. I like that Tiffani Theissan is not a bad girl in the end. All the secrets are out. Only the people you want to see are left behind in the end. (except those who don't like Pauly Shore.) Even if you don't like him, there are fun parts, and her family tortures him most of the movie. She's a country girl gone wild and must be heard. She does it finally. It has just the right amount of love and romance. I give it an 8 out of 10.
