This is a great movie! It makes you think of your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them unless we really make an effort to know who they are as human beings. And just as importantly, we must open up and show them our real self, not just as we think they want us to be. Certainly see this documentary! IMDb makes me write more text before they will write my comment how strange. Usually, online comments should be short short, and here I am asked to write more! When I went to watch the movie with my parents, I thought later that they would talk about their parents, but my father stopped talking about himself and things in his life, he feels screwed up, which was unusual, my Dad is not a reticent man, but I was surprised that he wanted to talk about mistakes he thinks he made. Mike and Kitty came to the movie to do a Q&A and there was a fun moment afterwards when my dad spoke to Mike while my mother talked to Kitty! Really just ignore my last few sentences to subdue this comment and just remember '51 Birch Street, 'watch it!
