Large Businesses Vs. Conscientiously Do good. We seem to witness events (both real life and wheel life) of this kind all the time, and most of the time greed wins by using all means (dirty) necessary and truth being suppressed. At least in this movie, Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) got his points across and paid a lot. We've seen several more films of the kind made in recent years, the most memorable of which was 'The Insider', where Russell Crowe played a tobacco industry researcher who tried to blow the whistle claiming that the industry added more nicotine to cigarettes make smokers addicted. There was also this reporter protagonist angle, where the reporter searches for his dreams, and the protagonist faces this moral dilemma where he / she must choose between justice and his livelihood and sometimes his / her life. Jane Fonda played reporter Kimberly Wells to perfection. She plays a rep that wants to pursue serious news, while her bosses appreciate her more as an 'Eye-Candy'. She and her crew (the cameraman played by the post-'Coma 'Michael Douglas, who is also the producer of the film) testify to an accident in a nuclear plant while they were visiting. Cameraman Michael Douglas gets small / illegal recordings of the event on tape despite being a no-photography zone and smuggling it out of the station. The station refuses to fly it and informs the company that owns the nuclear power plant. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, engineer Jack Godell is launching his own investigation and discovering many irregularities in the equipment used for the reactor. This all begins with the dirty policy of corruption and greed. <br /> <br /> This is a good thriller and managed to create a lot of tensions in the audience to the end and the fun was that there was no background score to suggest all the scary moments. Now it's great and unusual in movies. Performances were all good and I love Jack Lemmon. We know him primarily for his comic roles, but he is just as good at dramatic roles. I give this movie an 8/10.
