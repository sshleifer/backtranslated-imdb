Despite its New York setting and New York sign, 'Summer in the City' is not an American movie, it's better than that. The most unusual is the mix of styles and genres. Director Niami shows a deep touch with combining comedy with tragedy, pathos with drama. <br /> <br /> The secret of Niam's success seems to be a large-scale smorgasbord - each could have their own film built around them - and then fill them with beautifully realized performances from one of the most wonderful eclectic casts one would struggle to find in the same country let alone in the same movie, from Bai Ling to Ornella Muti, Robert Burke to Peter Stormare, who reveals that he has much more in him than the bad first-ever he plays in Hollywood pictures . Even Sandra Bernhard is fun here! <br /> <br /> An extra bonus, cream on the big cake, is John Cales soundtrack.
