a great movie with a rather unclear political message. It's shot in a theatrical style, i.c. most of it takes place inside. Mayor Surov and Diana Ashcroft seem equally suspicious to each other. Feelings run high as Western tourists and businessmen seem to be unwilling and unable to give the mayor's eastern Russian charm, though he does everything to understand their point of view. The two opposite world views are clearly marked, but the film also shows that human emotions cannot be governed by politics. its powerful act and has a high emotional influence on a 50's movie.
