A good movie. Every moment masterfully led by Toyoda and his crew. The actors provide credible performances all around. The picture players are scary, beautiful and at times ghostly beautiful shots from the Japanese country and urban landscapes. The sounds, with Japanese tapes 'Dig', are never too sharp as one might expect from band-made soundtracks. It is oddly atmospheric and suitable for the scenes they are on. All in all, everything worked out perfectly ... Well, if they were to give justice to the story, perfection is the only thing that anyone could have accepted. <br /> <br /> The real grandeur of 9 souls is the compelling story. The prison breaking film is perhaps a lost genre these days, and road trip movies lose their appeal because of the way the world gets smaller. But this story easily mixes something fresh with these two genres. 9 prisoners get freedom and possibly the opportunity to regain their places in society. will society accept them? Will they be truly free of their dark past? and can they stay together long enough to stay alive and find out? <br /> <br /> Every judge has an interesting story. Their crimes are as varied as their apparent destiny. A sense of brotherhood among them keeps the story high on drama and delivers it with hilarious comic situations. And because of the nature of their backgrounds, violence is always something that is waiting to happen. <br /> <br /> After all, all I can say is go and give it a watch.
