This movie was fun from START to FINISH. Everyone in the cinema laughed aloud throughout the film !! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, The Girl from Will and Grace) and Tanya Manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, the best attitudes, etc. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was really fun, she really played it well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the movie was that the other two main characters were not so funny, even though the film focused around them ........ All in all, it is a great movie to go see with your girls (yes boys , it's a girlie movie through and through!). Enjoy!!!
