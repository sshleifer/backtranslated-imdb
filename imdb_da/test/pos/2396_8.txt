No doubt that indie girl Eddie Monroe is one of the better independent movies I've seen for a long time. The highlight for me was the performance of Paul Vario. I saw Paul first, or "Big Paulie" as he was called in Danny Provenzano's hit indie, "This Thing Of Ours". Fortunately, the "Eddie Monroe" movie maker (s) did the same and exploited Paul's undeniable skills in a principle (leading role) role. Out came with a performance (on camera and voiceover utilization as well) that shows worthy studio roles in big budget in the near future. It is refreshing to see a trained actor engaged in commerce proving the same to the public. Keep up the good work of Big Paulie and we'll soon be in Hollywood! Not bad for a child from Canarsie, huh?
