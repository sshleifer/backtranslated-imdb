It's hard to put Traffik's devastating estimate on words, partly because I still understand to understand it even hours after my second viewing. Firstly, Traffik has some of the most incomparable and unforgettable scenes I've seen in a movie or television production. The action is excellent, especially Bill Paterson as a British minister who breaks with his heroinaddicted daughter and a drug-related aid agreement to Pakistan. Another plot line describes these drug problems at a base level in Pakistan and is about a struggling opium peasant and his interaction with a successful heroin smuggler. The third main story involves the prosecution of an importer in Hamburg, and his wife and two German detectives' conflict efforts while he is in trial. It is a profound review that the interplay between these stories feels natural and transcends the forced plot disturbance often found in Hollywood movies. It is even greater that a work spread over three countries and a half dozen main characters can be so focused and enthralling without oversimplifying. It is devastating - gloomy and brutal, but never apathetic. In short, Traffik is a rare film work that handles challenging issues with unmatched compassion and clarity.
