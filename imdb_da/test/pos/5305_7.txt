As a prolonged fan of Studio Ghibli and especially Hayao Miyazaki films, I went to the movie right on the opening day. When I left the theater, I had this strange feeling that something was missing. This "magical" feeling I experienced in all Miyazaki movies before, but I couldn't say why this time. After thinking about the other Ghibli movies, I can tell the reason: this movie had most of the elements of a fantastic Miyazaki anime: sweet characters, wonderful key animation, a great soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi and the hot story telling you the sense of seeing a high quality Japanese animation movie. However, two elements were missing: a deep history and dramaturgy. The purpose of this movie was, of course, to entertain small children with a simple storyline as in the case of "Totoro", so a complicated story that has been told in "Spirited Away" or "Princess Mononoke" is not really necessary but on the second This story was simply too superficial. I could not connect the protagonists because there was no sign development, dramatic scenes were only limited and did not last very long. I really hate giving only 7 stars to a Miyazaki movie because I wanted to give 10 stars to all previous movies right away, but this time it was simply not this wonderful "ghibli experience".
