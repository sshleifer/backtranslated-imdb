This hard to see little picture played at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival. It is a wonderful and loving look at Harry Nilsson, who uses many famous faces who sit for interviews, rarely seen TV shows and behind-scenes recordings of Nilsson in the workplace. There are even a few shots from "Son Of Dracula". This film is the final and appropriate tribute to one of the finest voices, the most clever songwriter and the funniest man in popular music. It is a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and / or performed. His friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented Hulk with a subconscious desire for self-destruction. As a bonus, you even get Eric Idle to perform the song with written for Nilsson's last album under final credits. It's funny, it's boring. It's not in regular release. If this picture plays anywhere near where you live, see it!
