(Some Spoilers) It took 19 years that Bruce Campbell finally put his masterpiece "Man with the Screaming Brain" on the screen. But Campbell had to change his story by having it because of financial problems taking place in Sofia Bulgaria, not where he originally wanted the film in Los Angeles California. <br /> <br /> In the movie Burce Campbell, the US plays pharmaceutical tycoon Willian Cole, traveling with his spoiled rat wife Jackie, Antoinette Byron, to the former Communist Republic of Bulgaria. It is there that William will help finance Bulgaria's almost non-existent mass transport system. It's Wilhelm's accident to get involved with both gypsy woman Tatoya, Tamara Gorski and her boyfriend Yegor, Valdimir Kolev, an ex-KGB taxi driver. The two, William & Yegor, will endlessly cut their brains inside the Williams skull because of Tatoya's envy and revenge. After Tatoya murders both William and Yegor, their bodies are delivered to the wild scientist Dr. Ivan Ivanowitch Ivanov, Stacy Keach, of his loyal assistant Pavel, Ted Raimi, to get their brains experimented with. Dr. Ivanov has this theory in that two heads are better than one. And now with the material that William & Yegor is available to him, Dr. Ivanov finally finally prove it. What Dr. Ivanov will find out that by melting the two heads or brains together, their brainwaves will overlap and cause them not only to function but to face each other! <br /> <br /> William with Yegor's right wing melted in his damaged brain is out to find Tatoya and make her pay for the damage she caused both to him and Yegor. Yegor for his part is stuck in Wilhelm's head, if one likes and dislikes, in both food and drink, is quite the opposite of himself. This causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains of those struggling for control of the Williams body! Things are getting even better when Jackie finds out that Tatoya murdered her husband William confronting her in the dangerous and high crime section of Bravoda calling Gypsy Town and ending up being murdered. Back to Dr. Ivanov by his assistant Pavel, it is certain, without having any body available, to plant Jackie's brain inside an experimental robot, which Pavel has been working on. The operation is an exciting success, but the only drawback is that Jackie, with his brain inside the robot, must have his brain recharged every couple of hours! Or as a true brain lacking oxygen, she will die along with the robot's batteries. <br /> <br /> The combination of the 1930s-like helicopter comedy and horror flick with both William & Yegor turns the Bulgarian city of Bravoda upwards in an effort to find Tatoya and make her pay with her life for the sad state of existence, they both set them in. *** SPOILER ALERT *** It's Dr. Ivanov, who actually saves the day by discovering how to keep the two brains in battle and thus cooperating with each other! This is done by him instead of melting the brains together. Dr. Ivanov keeps them independent by implanting a neutralizing cell wall between the two non-cooperating globs of gray matter.
