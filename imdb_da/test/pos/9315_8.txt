I have heard a lot about Porno Holocaust and its twin file Erotic Nights Of The Living Dead. Both films are interchangeable and were simultaneously recorded at the same venue with the same actors who change clothes for each movie (and take them off). If you expect the D'Amato genius to appear in movies like Buio Omega or Death Smiles on Murder, you won't find it here. Nevertheless, this movie has a charm that exploitation fans will not be able to resist. Where else will you see hardcore sex mixed with a zombie / monster and his huge penis curling and killing women? Only from D'Amato. There are a number of ways in which many of the men are bludges to death. The movie is set on a beautiful tropical island. As far as I know, there is no subtitle version, so if you don't speak Italian, you don't know what's going on ... but who cares right? To a large extent, Gore fans will probably jump through hardcore sex. And if anyone actually sees this as sexy, it will probably be offended immediately. I can only imagine that modern porn movies trace back through D'Amato's production and come across this cruelty! Out of the two, I find Erotic Nights Of The Living Dead far superior. But don't bother to look either if they're cut. Porn Holocaust is extremely low budget as expected. Even the monster looks no good as George Eastman's character in the Anthropophagus. The movie is worth looking for laughs and to complete your D'Amato movie quest.
