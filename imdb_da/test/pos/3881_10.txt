For those out there who seem to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent people who love movies, pay close attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with a fun and smart writing dialogue, this is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> For those with little attention, high expectations and no brains. Well .. um .. you can get bored and find things that pull at times. <br /> <br /> This is a charming, modest and successful movie with the actors giving a true sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I chuckled at me almost all the way through. <br /> <br /> This movie is a little gem.
