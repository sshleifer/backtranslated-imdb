Hammer House of Horror: Witching Time is set in England at Woodstock Farm, where stressed musician David Winter (Jon Finch) lives with his actress Maria (Prunella Gee) and currently composes the music for a horror movie. One night, while looking for her dog, Billy David finds a mysterious lady in her barn, calling herself Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn), claiming to be a witch who has transported herself from 300 years into the past. Clearly, skeptical David finds it hard to believe in her, so he locks her in a room in her farmhouse and calls his doctor Charles (Ian McCulloch) to come and examine her, but when he arrives, they come in. in the living room. Lucinda has disappeared. Charles puts it down to David to drink too much, but over the next few days strange and disturbing things begin to happen to David & Mary ... Witching Time was episode 1 from the short-lived British anthology horror series produced by Hammer Studios for TV and originally broadcast here in England in September 1980, the first of two Hammer House of Horror episodes to be led by Don Leaver (episode 13 Satan's Mark is the other), I actually liked this. As a series, Hammer House of Horror acted on various different themes and were all interconnected, with the exception of name and surprise. Watching Time is a scary and effective little tale of a witch, the manuscript of Anthony Read benefits from the small 50 odd minute duration & move along with a good pace. The character is pretty good, like the dialogue, there are some nice scenes here and I liked the way it never completely reveals whether David & Mary become crazy or not. I think it's a well-structured, entertaining and reasonably scary horror-themed TV show that I enjoyed more than I thought I would. <br /> <br /> Being made for UK TV meant that the boys in Hammer had a lower budget than usual, if possible, and as such there are no beautiful period settings here as in their most well-known Frankenstein & Dracula film, although the modern English setting gives it a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a little more. Another TV-based limitation is that the utilization levels are lower than you might hope there is some nudity and do, but not much, even though I don't mind what the story here is pretty good. It is well made for what it is and Hammer's experience on their feature film has probably helped make these look pretty good, and the play is also good with the genre favorite Ian McCulloch who does a little look. <br /> <br /> Witching Time is a great start to the Hammer House of Horror series, as a 50-minute piece of British television is pretty damn good, now why aren't they doing this more?
