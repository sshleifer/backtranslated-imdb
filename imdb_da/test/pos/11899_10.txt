I finally see the El Padrino movie, from what I can see, it's an incredible movie, and lots of action Damian Chapa is a good director, but I have to admit that I love to perform the best. <br /> <br /> Also I looked behind the scenes, it was edited by a lady named Kinga, she has to go back to school and learn to edit. <br /> <br /> But the movie El Padrino is a pure 10-action epic. Why can most people who directly film movies keep you in doubt about what the plot is? I'm so happy to see someone I know to be a really good actor, also becoming a great instructor. <br /> <br /> I am one of those people who love to see artists do it. <br /> <br /> BS
