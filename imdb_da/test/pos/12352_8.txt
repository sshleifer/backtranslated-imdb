Pistol packing Pam Grier takes names and kicks ass as the hero of "Asylum of Satan" director William Girdler's entertaining blaxploitation actioneer "Sheba Baby", contributing to D'Urville Martin and Austin Stoker. "Sheba Baby" is one of several hard chickens that Grier appeared in the 1970s, including "Coffy", "Foxy Brown" and "Friday Foster". The short-lived Girdler wrote this thoroughly routine private eye potboiler with producer David Shelton in one night, and it has a heady female shamus who refuses to trust a man to help her take care of the business. Unfortunately, "Sheba Baby" is not as good as the blaxploitation films that Grier has made under the supervision of Jack Jack. Hill fucked the African-American North Carolina native in "Coffy", "Foxy Brown", "The Big Bird Cage" and "The Big Doll House." Anyone analyzing images of African American women in the cinema should be familiar with these epics. The main problem with "Sheba Baby" is that our heroine gets too many practical breaks. Of course, the secondary crooks are triggering happy clowns that could not hit the side of a stable with a housekeeper. As the most important antagonist, Dick Merrifield qualifies as both selfish and smarmy villain with electoral lines such as: "Everything worth having is worth stealing." In addition, the composer Monk Huggins gives a strong, atmospheric orchestral soundtrack, and the best song, with Barbara Mason telling it, is "Good Man Is Gone." "Sheba Baby" throws Grier as a stylist Chicago gumshoe Sheba Shayne. She leaves the windshield to return to her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, to help her father. When she arrives in Louisville, Sheba learns that her father Andy (Rudy Challenger from "Detroit 9000") has problems with a local black gangster named Pilot (Cigar-chomping D'Urville Martin of "Hammer") who requires Andy sells his loan business to Pilot or die. <br /> <br /> Initially, the pilot sends a goon squad to Andy's office garbage can, but our heroine danger captures them in action. They turn Sheba's father into a shock bag. Interestingly, during the battle scene, Girdler rarely shows fists that smash meat. Previously, Andy's right hand, Brick Williams (Austin Stoker of "Horror High") had sent Sheba a telegram requesting that she return to Louisville, but she did not receive it immediately thanks to her lazy partner who did not know where to she finds her Brick and Sheba hangs together, revives their romantic flames and shares a night in the bag. Bricks spend most of their time calling on Sheba to remain calm in the face of adversity. As former Louisville, Kentucky, political woman, Sheba prefers to shoot first and ask questions differently. After returning home, Sheba borrows her father's car and barely escapes. As she walks out the door to get into her father's car, Andy receives another harassing call from Pilot. Previously, Andy had refused to discuss the prospect of selling his loan business to Pilot, but Andy changed his mind and advocated talking to hoodlum. A satisfied Pilot warns Andy about the dynamite that has been linked to his ignition with a delayed functional assurance. In other words, the curvature of the car will not trigger the explosion; The explosion comes ten seconds later. Andy and Brick save Sheba before the car blows up. Previously, Sheba had agreed to let her father handle her problems without her interference. "Dad, I know you think I'm doing a man's job, but I don't want to sit on the sidelines just because I'm a woman," Sheba says. After her near-death experience, Sheba promises to learn who sabotaged her father's car. She grills an old contact from her days as a policeman and threatens the guy with his gun to extract the information. Only after Sheba has painted the guy's face in a forest chlorine dust, he relates and tells her about a paid amount at the city's railway museum. Brick accompanies Sheba and shoots with a confused pilot coming off the skin of his chin. Later, the pilot sends a quintet of out-of-town contracts armed to the teeth of Andy's office. These gunsels ignore their no-kill orders. Not only do they shoot the loan office's office, but they also blow Sheba's father with a shotgun. Sheba claims in short order. Using her nickel-plated revolver, she kills three of the four attackers Dirty Harry style. The last hitman discards his weapon and asks for mercy. Sheba has his finger on the trigger when Homicide Detective Phil Jackson (Charles Kissinger from "Abby") and a uniform policeman arrive on stage. In the hospital, Andy Shayne dies with his daughter's hand. Pilot is, of course, furious with this revelation and his rage limits on stroke. Then Sheba jumps down a loan shark, Walker (Christopher Joy of "Cleopatra Jones"), and pops information out of him about the pilot while holding him in a rifle in a car wash. This is one of the better staged scenes with lots of creepy shots of car wash equipment swirling and humming. Walker warns Pilot about Sheba. Pilot and his henchmen confront Sheba in a parking lot and switch lead. Sheba is flying on foot to a nearby carnival. While the police are turning one of the pilots' men, she is acting with the others. Pilot accidentally shoots one of his own and Sheba drives him down. She points Pilot on a roller coaster and threatens to keep him there until the runway cuts off its head. Pilot manages to escape after he has wasted Sheba on the identity and phone number of the great man Shark (Dick Merrifield from "The Hellcats") whose reputation is so immaculate that Detective Jackson describes him as "the guy with all those real answer. "" Sheba Baby "is not first-rate Pam Grier. But the idea that our heroine can handle everything without himself, helps the boys, makes it interesting and entertaining chick flick.
