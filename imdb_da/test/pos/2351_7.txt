"Hollywood Cavalcade" is a mildly entertaining two-staple 1939 movie by 20th Century Fox roster Don Ameche and Alice Faye and features a couple of jokes. The film relates to a Max Sennett type, Michael Connors (Ameche), who brings an actress to Hollywood, Molly Adair (Faye), and makes her a great silent comedienne who eventually moves her into more dramatic roles. He becomes extremely successful with her as her star. Obsessed with his work, he is completely shocked when she and her leading husband (Alan Curtis) run off and get married. He is so shocked, he dumps her. She and her husband go out and continue to become more and more popular, while Connors' study begins to lose money at an alarming rate. Before you know it, he's through. Molly wants to help and asks that Connors fix his next movie. <br /> <br /> There are lots of Keystone Cup type recordings, which is quite fun and some amazing slapsticks by Buster Keaton, which is wonderful. The movie also has a scene from "The Jazz Singer" when talkies take over. Of course, the in-joke has to do with Rin Tin-Tin, for whom Zanuck used to write. In a scene, Rinny's coach brings him as a potential contractor to Connor's study. Connors throws them both out of his office. A few scenes later, Rin-Tin-Tin is shown to be the # 1 box office. The famous German Shepherd's role in this movie is played by Rin Tin-Tin, Jr., father's gone into Jean Harlow's arms in 1932, a month shy of his 14th birthday. Fortune smiled at him at the end. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye is very handsome and does a great job, just like Ameche, who gets an energetic performance. J. Edward Bromberg and Stuart Erwin provide very good support. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not quite sure what it is - history, comedy, romance or drama. But "Hollywood Cavalcade" is still quite visible.
