Imagery controls this movie. The signs, although interesting, ultimately take a back seat. The first scene I remember is a framed black and white shot of the sea, which then opens up to full screen and color. The bubble of the water provides space for a small coffin that breaks the surface. The theme of the movie here is that death can be accepted and brought into the realm of life's life. Water as an ultimate consciousness, as a tool of God, is accustomed to forcing people to force people to get their "houses" in order (doomsday). The dead must be counted and lifted to a better place. Whatever you have left undissolved or undisturbed, it will be washed away. There is no clinging on the past, to a buried memory of what was. <br /> <br /> This movie has been compared to O, Brother Where Art Thou and the threat of water and its use as a purge is similar to that of the movie. What is different in this film is that the water's coming is known, and then there is again emphasis on what to do with here and now. <br /> <br /> I agree that some of the scenes are reminiscent of a David Lynch work. Take e.g. The dinner segment with the deeply voted and androgynous waitress. You get the same surreal feeling from the setting and strange character as you do with the backward talker in the scene from Fire Starter. The difference is that Lynch attacks us with the image to express the psychological processes of an uneasy character, while this film seems to use surreal elements to create a moral message. The men in black suits cannot have anything they want - they must be patient and accept what is available.
