I just watched this step for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it. It makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate. <br /> <br /> I wrote a letter to Bonnie Hunt to tell her how much I love it. David Duchovny's sadness is so flippin right !!! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite line is when Duchovny says "I miss Elizabeth, but I hurt Grace". Oh man! I just cry thinking about it. IF ... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are sooooooooooooo the perfect Chicago area couple !! I know them, I swear! I'm related to them, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> This movie is in my three times a year rotation !!! I would see it once a week, but I'm afraid I would get used to it !!! I will always make it a special day when I see it !!
