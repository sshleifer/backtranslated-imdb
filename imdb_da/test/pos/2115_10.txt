This is the kind of movie I grew up on. It's great family fun that kids love and parents enjoy. I want more movies like this was made. It's a great story about a little boy traveling a Bull with his mother and sister, and showing it right up to the National Grand Championship where he wins! Then he is afraid someone will grill his bull so he kidnaps it and heads home with it. I was very excited when I first saw this movie in the theater and was surprised to see George Strait, Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis in this little movie. The music was amazing with all sorts of great country names like Willie Nelson and Dixie Chicks. Anyone who does not enjoy this movie has no children or never was a child himself.
