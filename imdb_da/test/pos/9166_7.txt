This movie was much better than expected. After a couple of movies by Will Smith, which wasn't as big as I, Robot, he's back to being sympathetic and fun in this one. Smith plays, hitch, a date doctor The majority of the film centers around him and teaches Albert how to be herself and date with Allegra Cole, a rich famous celebrity with whom he works. Albert is a klutz and goof and always stumbles on his feet or whatever. Hitch makes him learn how to act more coldly and not be so nervous about Allegra. During all of this, Hitch meets Sara, a gossip colleague who has sworn by men. Hitch charms her, so of course they go out. But Hitch can teach other guys to make the girl fall for them, he doesn't believe in love himself. He never really had a girl when he was dumped in college. But he likes Sara, so she continues after her. Sara's friend is hurt by the guy she thinks went to the date doctor. Then Sara tracks down the doctor just to learn her Hitch. So of course she thinks he's a pig. Then it is up to Sara and Allegra to explain what he does so they both end up forgiving. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Good, has some laughs and is entertaining. I recommend it.
