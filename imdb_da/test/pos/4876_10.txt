I also participated in the RI International Horror Film Festival, and I can easily see why this movie won best. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST is a wild reel of Horror, Comedy and beautiful scenes. A back in time tale of strange goings on. An increasingly widespread disease with an overwhelming annoying side effect of peoples heads explodes, bringing a young professor apprentice; Stefan, to investigate. Along his travels, he briefly decides to detour and asks again for his long time the hand of love in marriage, to only be sent packing of his extremely stubborn father? Along the way "out of town" he comes across a sick girl on the road and delivers her to Dr. Maitland (brilliantly played by and upcoming Vincent Prize as actor: Edward X Young.) Who fills Stefan in the evil of a foot. Only Dr. is offended that he had called on the professor and only received a boy in training? However, Stefan turns out to be much more than an ordinary bystander. Horror icon; Tom Savini portrays the ultimate religious tormentor; Priests John. Scream Queen; Ingrid Pitt comes out of retirement to give a fantastic performance like Anna. Many beautiful and talented supportive actors put together the story and helped effectively move it to climax. <br /> <br /> Dark Religion and over the top, but fun and sometimes very original doing scenes play a lot in this Hammer tribute flick. This stylish movie goes back and forth between flashbacks, surreal worlds, dreams and the reality of the character. <br /> <br /> Horror and Gore aside; This is also a very fun movie! Slapstick, tongue and cheek humor and dark comedy raise their heads among the dark story line. As others have said; This is really like three good movies in one. Very entertaining and original.
