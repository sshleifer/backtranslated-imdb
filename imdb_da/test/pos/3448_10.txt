This movie is great - especially if you enjoy visual arts. The landscape, which the two daughters paint and photograph, is beautiful. The story is also fun and exciting at times. <br /> <br /> People who like European movies and "art films" will like this movie. This is really an art movie - it actually has a lot of art in it. Go rent it. <br /> <br />
