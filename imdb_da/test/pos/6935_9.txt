Just complete the Zombie Bloodbath part 1 on the amazing Zombie Bloodbath Trilogy DVD from CAMP Motion Pictures. Zombie Bloodbath 2: The Rage of Undead is Next. Now, this one left me a little confused because of a few plot holes and some confusing twists here and there, but it's a better movie on many levels. Director Todd Sheets really shows a great leap in style and talent between the two films. Again, it is not for people who want shine and Hollywood-style Horror movies, it's for people who like their zombies bloody, raw and grainy. The story as far as I could tell was about two robbers, who in 1945 tried to steal from an elderly couple to find out that the couple are members of a cult. A guy is simply killed, and the other, the person responsible, is basically transformed into a scarecrow and crucified, and they are standing in the nearby field that is still alive, but dies. Cut for the present, and a van with a college child breaks down near a farm. At the same time, a group of prisoners flee from a nearby prison. Both groups end up in the same house. The house was the older one who joined and where one of the prisoners knocks down scarecrow and takes the jacket, it makes scarecrows wake up, and he returns the cult members from the dead. Wow. And that's all in the first half hour. There is also another plot that also takes place in the city, where a few serial killers have taken some workers on a deli hostage. However, this actually works when the people caught in the house finally escape and end up in the same Deli. Most of the twists seem quite good, but it is obvious that the film was just too complex in some spots for its own benefit. It all ends in a huge showdown with the remaining heroes who find a delivery trolley or something that is filled with meat bottle bacteria. Of course, they throw it on the undead and cause a greater melting and a few heads to explode, and then we get an odd, thought-provoking ending. Let me first say that while it wasn't always easy to follow, I still had a great time with this movie. It was fun and the play was pretty good for a low budget effort. It was obvious that Todd Sheets was really trying to bring more to the table than a typical zombie movie, and in that respect he has succeeded. It had better special effects than the first movie, great pacing and some cool music and visuals, plus there is a true show-stop of a shot from INDEIDE a mouth when a knife is stuck in it. Care was taken here and it shows. The weakness lies in the writing and in some of the lazier performances. Again I recommend listening to the commentary track. It was even better than the first, and I learned a lot. Like finding out that some of the scenes were shot at Super 8 movie for effect and that the movie came back destroyed by the lab and they could use it. And they had already edited the movie when they got the movie back, so some of the confusion comes from a couple of scenes that are not in the movie. I also learned that Todd Sheets really has a passion and love to make Horror movies. It shows. The movie is a good example of no budget cinema that could have used a new rewrite, but still shines with more style than most DV movies I see. Not quite as fun as the first movie, but a better movie technically. I really admire Sheets as one of the true innovators and trailblazers within the DV cinema ... and this is a great addition to the cheapo zombie genre!
