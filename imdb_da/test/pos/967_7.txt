Big Fat Liar is a pretty funny movie. But when I looked at it, I thought of something. Some of the events in this movie are incredible. So really, the movie is kind of a big fat lie. There is no way he could have gotten away with all this. Here are all the incredible things. <br /> <br /> 1. When he falsified, his father had cattle a meatball and seemed to be a father. Jason (Frankie Munez) couldn't have been away with it. Well, fortunately for us, he didn't. So it didn't stick to it, the scandalous. <br /> <br /> 2. Even though Grandma was blind, she could still have figured out that it was not her grandson. <br /> <br /> 3. They couldn't have been on the plane, flown to LA, acted like they were coat dealers, sneaking into the studio, and then and then ... Well, some of the movie is a bit incredible . But it doesn't hurt to tell a little white lie. Trust me, I do it all the time. <br /> <br /> Big fat lies, though incredible, are fun. It is also very fun. But let me just say one thing before continuing this review. If Paul Giamatti wasn't in this movie, it would really suck. It would be terrible. Big fat lies are also pretty fun, though corny at times. I give it my thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Big fat lies: *** / ****
