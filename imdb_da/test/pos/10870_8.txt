The screen this morning to the press at the Roma film festival, "N - io e Napoleone" is easy to love. First of all, one can count on great production values, which very few Italian films today can with wonderful settings and costumes. Cast is also great. Director Virzì is constantly talking about the young leader Elio Germano as "a young De Niro". Now, of course, he must go too far, but sure the boy can act. I loved his performance and he did a good job with the (Tuscan) accent. Daniel Auteuil is a great actor and did very well as Bonaparte. It's great to see him perform in Italian, I hope to see him work in Italy again very soon. The support aids also worked well - people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore may seem unlikely to make choices, but they all provided fine performances. Even Massimo Ceccherini, best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy television reality shows, mounted well and was actually fun. The low point of the casting was "Diva" Monica Bellucci. Well, she was a little better than usual, but she managed to see (and sound) quite unnatural even in the part of baronessa Emilia, where with a good dose of selviron she used her own umbro accent. The script, by veteran Furio Scarpelli and Virzì themselves are clever, with lots of laughs loud and also a few emotional moments. Sure the end left me confused. The message is kind of ambiguous: the whole film says that political ideals can bring you blind hat, but if you get closer, you learn that the purpose of your hate is a little man like everyone else, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes pathetic so it's suddenly hard to hate him; so it says in the last few minutes that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning. Personally, I do not like this performance very much. "Io e Napoleone" is still a pleasant movie, the best presented at the festival so far (the other is Fur and Hoax). My rating is 8/10
