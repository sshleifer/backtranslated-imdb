My favorite movie this year. Big figures and plot, and the direction and editing were smooth, visually beautiful and interesting. <br /> <br /> Seen in Barcelona, ​​the film follows a year in the life of six foreign graduate students and various others. Cultures and languages ​​collide, but hearts and lives mix. The leading role would never have been thrown into Hollywood, but he brought the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interaction was honest and accurate. There were two particularly remarkable scenes, the climax really inspired. The movie is sentimental, and the last ten minutes could have been cut, but it was wonderfully entertaining. <br /> <br /> I almost didn't see it, but just did to see Audrey Tautou. Her role, though billed second or third, was smaller and was overshadowed by several other signs. I want more movies like this was made. It was thinking of The Big Chill or The Breakfast Club. Don't start this movie late if you plan to go to bed 1/2 way through.
