Although the plot of this movie is slightly removed, it is worth seeing just for the performances of Michael's Caine and Gambon. The latter delivers a truly wonderful Dublin accent. Caine pours it up ... which is exactly the character he must play. Entertaining and fun, it's an hour and a half easy to see.
