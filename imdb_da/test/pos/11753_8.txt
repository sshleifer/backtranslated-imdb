Holden and Jones SIZZLE in this movie, but not in the way we think of sizzling today - it is very subtle and under the surface - yet palpable. Especially Jennifer Jones is so sexy in this movie (much more than a caricature that Monroe ever was) because she creates a real woman - with all aspects of femininity: she is intelligent, intuitive, graceful. She wants and desires. <br /> <br /> There is a scene on the famous hill where she is lying on the grass and looking up at Holden, and the expression in the eyes is X-rated, but in the context of the stage and character, you make full sense. You don't have to say it all in the dialogue - spelled out as the raw openness of most modern films. It's all there in the face - sexy but elegant. What an amazingly understated actress she was. (I saw her MADAME BOVARY for the first time recently and was just blown away.) I take her over Bergman, Davis or the two Hepburns any day.
