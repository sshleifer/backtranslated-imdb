This all-but-ignored masterpiece is about Monkees becoming aware that they are fictitious characters in a movie (Head), and that everything they do or say has already been written in an (unseen) script, they think to follow. Head was written by Jack Nicholson, Rafelson and Peter Tork during a three-day LSD trip in a suite at an expensive Hollywood hotel. The other three Monkees have only traded in it. <br /> <br /> They fight it any way they can by making things that are not in the script. They deliberately let go of their lines, move away from sets, tear up in the landscape and beat other players for no reason. and eventually commit suicide by jumping out of a bridge. <br /> <br /> In the quick flashes of a psychedelic party scene, for example, one can see Rafelson sitting next to the camera and the camera man, who deliberately shoots into a mirror. He reveals that the party is actually false and is shot in a studio of actors who suddenly fall out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the director shouts "cut!" <br /> <br /> Monks, however, never fall out of character because they are also the ones they really are. It will be the core of the revelation that will soon come. <br /> <br /> At each turn, they understand that their increasingly bizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the written movie, they can't escape being You say they were crazy and went through the sky ( which turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the background of the set)? No problem! Hey, hi, they are Monkees, and those cool guys just keep monkeying around! <br /> <br /> In the end, even their death did not set them free. This is how the movie should end, and their motionless water bodies are fished out of the river, put into another box and stacked in a movie studio store until the characters are needed again for another studio production. <br /> <br /> This is made even more exciting by the fact that the monks are really fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world. They did it through their music. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Peter Tork has what he rightly sees as a hugely deep revelation that solves their problem, but unfortunately no one listens. <br /> <br /> Peter realizes, "It's not possible if we're in the box (the movie)". He means that it does not matter if will is free or illusory, and that "the only thing important is that you just let the present moment happen and occur ... just leave" now "HOPE as it happens" without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is "valid" by an abstract definition. <br /> <br /> If you can't even tell the difference, you want to be free or not, doesn't matter if you are the "real" you are just a pointless waste of time. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at a very important time in my life. I tried to figure out how to escape being just "the miserable, creepy nerdy" by thinking of it intensely rather than just having fun (ie sex) like everyone else did. But the revelation in the Head broke my self-imposed recursive trap and helped me more than Rafelson or Nicholson or Tork will ever know. <br /> <br /> For decades I've seen "Head" and wished I could thank Pete. <br /> <br /> Was this a good movie? <br /> <br /> Uhh, what about, like ... <br /> <br /> == <YES> ==
