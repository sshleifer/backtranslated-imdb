Wayne Wang's direction may be the ingredient that made this movie much more impressive to me than "Slum of Beverly Hills" which covers remarkably similar reasons. The interaction between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is nonsense. Real chemistry there. This movie managed to bring me into these two women's dysfunctional lives without dragging me into depressed frustration. Susan Sarandons character hammer in all nerves, as a narcissistic parent is able to touch an insecure youth. She manages to do this unbelievably without getting so crazy or intentionally sadistic. And Natalie Portman deflects every attack on her character's ego with the dismissed grace of an intelligent cognitive child, untouched by the Natasha Lyonne character's odor cynicism in "Slums of Beverly Hills". Portman's character is a young man with dignity under stress, an unusual being in modern films. The film reaches a very satisfactory resolution without trying too hard. I highly recommend this movie to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained.
