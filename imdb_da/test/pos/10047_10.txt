I watched this movie over Christmas, and what a great movie it was! It tells the story of Custer (played by Errol Flynn) during and after his graduation from Westpoint. Even though I have heard that the movie is not very historical accurate (Hollywood is never), I still enjoyed it as I knew a little of the real events. I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favorite actress! His plays with Olivia De Havilland were brilliant and the ending was amazing! It brought me close to tears when he and Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) rode to their death on a little big horn. <br /> <br /> I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor when he was my father's favorite player, and I grew up watching his movies as a kid. But it wasn't until I watched this movie that I realized how great he was. <br /> <br /> I want to give this movie 10 out of 10 !!
