It's one of the best movies I've seen this year! I do not agree with the person who said it is boring. Of course, some people may not find this movie scary at all, but personally, I spent a very good moment. This movie changes very well sex scenes with scary scenes. There is also a good touch of humor. For example, when wife tells her husband that she was abused by her father in childhood, then her husband says "how can anyone abuse someone like you" and then he tries to attach her to the bed for sexual games: D Very fun! I recommend this movie to everyone and by the way, my poor English regret (I'm from France).
