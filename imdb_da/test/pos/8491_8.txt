Jamie Foxx does a great job of publishing the famous blues / soul / country singer Ray Charles. For the film's credit, it shows both the good and the bad with regard to Karl's character and the choices he made, both personally and professionally. <br /> <br /> This is a slick-looking movie that gives you a rich sense of the times when the story takes place. It doesn't just look good, it sounds good. I only wish there was more music in here. Once inserted, it is fabulous, but not enough. <br /> <br /> Provided the story was true, I was impressed and disappointed by Charles, which means that history left some memorable impressions since I write this 16 months after seeing it. The main impressions are: <br /> <br /> GOD - Relive Ray's immense talent and foresight to step out and take chances musically, for example, to go "land" for a while. The man had great confidence in himself, but did not come across as arrogant about it. Also memorable showed him hitting his heroin addiction - without help! It's just amazing. <br /> <br /> BAD - I also remember through this movie how easy hooked Ray initially got and disappointed that he was so unfaithful to his wife. One really sad thing was that his wife was more upset about missing his child's Little League game than she was for all the cheating he did on her, even fostering a child with a member of her singing group. <br /> The only negative I had with the filmmakers was overemphasis on his problems being blamed on an early childhood event, his brother's unfortunate death. This tragedy was used as a cop-out for all of Ray's failures as an adult, another example of a culture where people refuse to take responsibility for their actions. Note: There is an extended version with the DVD but the word has it that it is so poorly edited that it is not worth watching, so stick to the "theatrical version."
