Haven't you played the game? Do not want to. This is for Final Fantasy VII fans out there who beat the game and no one else will appreciate this rare gem of a movie. Want to see it and love it? Buy the game, beat it and then watch it. When is the last time you've seen an excellent movie based video game? Now it is. The story takes place two years after the game, and no brief summaries are given to update your memory (although I doubt many would forget), and go straight into one hour and forty-minute minute adventures. <br /> <br /> All your favorite people are there, even Cait Sith. The voice action is amazing in the Japanese version, each character is thrown perfectly. Cloud sounds hard and broody, Tifa sounds friendly but strong ... Aeris is also perfect, she sounds exactly as I imagined. Cait Sith sounds less sweet than I imagined, but worked very well. The character models are spectacular, beautiful textures and lighting. The environments are breathtaking and the fighting is choreographed in a way that makes The Matrix blush. The amazing camera work comes through in the bike hunt, for example, where your eyes just scream in satisfaction, and your lungs breathe heavily without consent. <br /> <br /> The music is typically Uematsu quality, which means it is top notch. Well-known tunes are restored to accompany Advent Children's Graphic Jumping, which fits well with the visual aspects. There is even an inside joke for the fans that involves music, it makes you smile safely. <br /> <br /> I didn't see subtitles since I'm half Japanese so I can't say the subtitles are good. In Japanese, however, the dialogue is very good, and every word sounds like it comes from real living beings, not just actors. Impressive. I see it once again with subtitles to see the differences since I have played both Japanese and American release of Final Fantasy VII. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Final Fantasy VII, buy this movie the day it comes out or pre-order it. If you haven't played the game but want to watch this movie very badly, don't play your time: buy the game, beat it and then come back to this DVD. I will not tell you not to see it but play the game. It will make the experience much better and will not leave you in the dust with scratches your heads. <br /> <br /> Come back, old friends - it's time to go on an adventure again with your brave buddies!
