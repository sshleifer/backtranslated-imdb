I was very disappointed when this show was canceled. Even though I can't vote. I live on the island of Aruba. I sat down to see the show on Tuesday. And was very surprised that it was not aired. The next day I read on the Internet that it was canceled. <br /> <br /> It's true, not every one was as talented as the other. But there were very talented people singing. <br /> <br /> I find it very sad. <br /> <br /> Working so hard and dreaming came tumbling down. <br /> <br /> It's a shame <br /> <br /> Ariette Croes
