This is the last episode we deserved. At the end of last season, things were left in a life course that was almost not the wrapping that this realistic series deserved. Although it was not a good show, this series was always one that made you think (a rare thing on TV) and that is no exception. "Is death justified by reason?" "Is morality reflecting on society, or is society shaped by the morality chosen by the few in power?" "What is a dead death and can it exist?" All these questions, and more, are asked by the authors of this show each week, and this is their final thesis. Fine acting, great writing, wonderful camera work, brilliant editing, clean direction. If you've seen the series and you've missed it when it first ran, take a copy in some way. If you never looked at the series as it ran, then it will stand up itself, but it may be difficult to try to keep track of who all the characters are and what they highlight in their varied past. For those of us who were keen viewers of the series in the past two seasons, this is very satisfying viewing.
