I saw it last night and again this morning - that was how much I liked it. There's something about this movie ... When the movie was almost over, I was crying. I would highly recommend "Last Days" to my friends - it is definitely worth a look! I agree with those who say some parts of the movie don't look very realistic. For example, both main characters are quite sweet and in perfect physical shape (although round is also a form of shape :)). I rarely meet people like this as singles and I have never met anyone in pairs. Other parts of the movie, including all these "coincidences," do not look very realistic. BUT it is after all a movie, not a life story.
