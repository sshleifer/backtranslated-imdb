* POSSIBLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I thought Pitch Black would be quite fun, with some nice effects - I liked the bigger animals, even though they aren't a patch on Alien series aliens. It had a quite good atmosphere, which I felt Vin Diesel helped contribute to. <br /> <br /> One thing that blunted me was how it rained. If the planet has three suns and is in almost continuous daylight, where did the humidity come to form clouds and therefore rain? I liked the fact that Fry died at the end - it reminded me of the New Hollywood movies of the 1970s, where the main heroine didn't make it to the end.
