Everything is enlightened A young Jewish American search for the woman who helped his grandfather escape Nazi persecution while he embarked on a cruise with some unlikely associates. <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber makes his direct debut with a hilarious anxiety usually associated with his functioning ethos. When successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair, we usually get a biographical insight into the souls of the actress mask-check. We usually get a mishmash of genres check. But what we usually do not get is an insightful original film that is credible, intelligent and moving. Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, a curious young boy who collects pieces of life as he walks. He is on a mission to find a woman on a photograph. The sepia image carries its grandfather (a creepy resemblance to him) and the woman. To help his journey, he addresses the help of travel guides consisting of a hip-hop loving breakdancer, Alex (Eugene Hutz), his apathetic and perma-vexed grandfather (Boris Leskin) and his dog Sammy Davis Junior Jr! What follows is essentially a comedy. There is an un-patronisingly simple introduction with voice-overs. Alex is especially fun when he educates his younger brother in the year 1969, showing how popular he is with chicks and breakdancing, thus setting him up as Jonathan's antithesis. <br /> <br /> Schreiber begins breaking down the characters as they evolve and the comedy acts as a deliberate veil to what is a story of three people associated with the Holocaust, who do not really know themselves. All three hold the film of tenderness and authenticity something that Schreiber probably would not have wrong, and as enchanting and amazing as the movie is, the horrors that are allowed to break through, ie. The past is presented in an almost blessed tone (random music, filmography) which makes them more disturbing. When the unlikely group finally finds the city, they seek to learn from the true atrocities that came up and find out a lot about who they really are. <br /> <br /> Elijah wood is as authentic as usual and brings his usual innocence and strength to the screen. Formally a resident good in the Lord of the Rings and a resident evil in Sin City, he plays Jonathan with Aplomb when he is bombarded with culture shock and a quest for truth. Boris Leskin as grandfather also delivers his fear and frustration with the young with great humor and conviction, as his own past is unraveled. But it is Eugene Hutz who Alex does the show. The director uses the old trade of translation misunderstandings to create and maintain a humor that is actually fun and not gimmicky. Schreiber has delivered an enchanting debut that has both heart and soul. The continuous score and beautiful photography create an adventure blowing around a story of identity, truth and family. If there was a complaint, it would be the rate at which the film changes direction; Although this could have been intentional, it may not be good with everyone. Nevertheless, this is a sterling effort that delivers great comedy and bondage between an unlikely group while dissecting another aspect of the horrors of World War II in a wholly fresh way. <br /> <br /> -Chi & Ojo
