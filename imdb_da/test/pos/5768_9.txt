I saw it when it first came out and found it to be a work of some genius; but I have to admit that I was clearly in the minority at that time. <br /> <br /> For me, the progressive lunacy of Guest House Paradiso holders is just getting better and better throughout the movie, with one of the most fun climaxes for a movie ever. <br /> <br /> But I wouldn't recommend it to Mom. <br /> <br /> Lovers of widespread cartoon style humor will appreciate this movie; There are bad jokes hidden away, but they are usually quickly flattened by a comedy frying pan. Rich Mayall and Ade Edmondson are amazing, and deadpan, unsuspecting guests are also excellent.
