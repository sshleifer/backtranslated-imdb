When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another "fat guy, skinny wife" show that seemed to expand the network at that time. It was just "okay" at initial views and I didn't see it again; But when it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was twice that night), and I tell you the more you see this show, the more fun it is. When you see how all the major supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh aloud. Every new episode I see is more creative than the one before - people who only see this a few times will not notice this. The writing and story lines are much more sophisticated than they first appear (this is far from "according to Jim"). First of all, Kevin James is hysterical, incredibly charming, and a talented comic actor as it also supports. Leah Remini has excellent timing, and Patton Oswalt's Spence is one of the more fun characters on the show. And of course Jerry Stiller is brilliant as Arthur. I was shocked to read comments that he was the worst part of the show - he is a gigantic part of why this show is so great - his delivery of these ridiculous schemes (rounding off the crazy father's character) is beyond hilarious. And yelling - the best episode is when they show him as a kid shouting "Lemon Icee !!". The episode where Carrie takes him to a therapist hoping to get him medicated (to make Doug less stressed) recognizes the guest star William Hurt that Arthur is shouting because he has never been validated. The last part of the episode, where Doug beats his childhood even in a therapy session, is beyond fun, it's one of the most creative scenes I've seen on sitcom. I feel the strange need to defend this show because it is heavily undervalued - while "Friends" was sometimes fun, and "Raymond" has some amazing episodes and characters, they both lacked the creative touch of "King of Queens" . In an era where most sitcoms have canned jokes and overall are mediocre, "King of Queens" continues with the sitcom envelope and shows true comic genius. Critics of this show, of course, do not get it - or have not seen the show enough to give it a try, for anyone with real comic and creative feelings must laugh aloud as they look. It is quite on par with my other two favorites, "Seinfeld" and "The Office" in its ridiculous tone. It's Arthur's, Kramers, and Michael Scotts's television that keeps us looking and laughing aloud.
