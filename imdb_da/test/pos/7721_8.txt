For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job !! We must support the new industry, especially from the north. It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and lots of laughs. It's a feeling-good movie, and so I felt when I got out of the cinema! It has northern humor and positive about the society it represents. The movie is just opened, I hope it goes well - people need to support this little movie. I think this "vinny ..." person is very bitter about anything! And being too personal ??? shame!! I say well done to all those involved? Have a drink on me !! I'm looking forward to you next venture.
