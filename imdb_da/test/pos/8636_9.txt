There is a bunch of movies that we say should be seen twice. In most cases, this is essentially a recommendation: You still understand the movie after the first impression, and when you see it for the second time, you help catch the plot turns you just haven't noticed. But for Mulholland Dr. It's different. The order that worked for me was: see it the first time - spend a day on the internet trying to figure out what it was all about - and then see it the second time. Otherwise, you will most likely not be able to enjoy this movie. Then you begin to understand that this piece is brilliant, the camera work is great and the aftertaste follows you for weeks. <br /> <br /> 9/10
