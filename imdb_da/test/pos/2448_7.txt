There have been many films about people returning from wars and have to cope, but the "war at home" is worth seeing. Portrait of Vietnam veterinarian Jeremy Collier (Emilio Estevez) has trouble connecting with his Texas family, much of the movie is very likely to buckle up. But nothing can prepare you for what ends up being revealed. <br /> <br /> Part of what makes this movie so good is how it gives the viewer the feeling of both Texas and the generation gap. Jeremy's parents Bob (Martin Sheen) and Maurine (Kathy Bates) obviously have a problem with their son's attitude, both about the war and his rejection of Americanism. His sister Karen (Kimberly Williams) is unsure of who aside. But after dinner there can be no neutrality. So, we as Americans must never be able to fully overcome the Vietnam War, but this movie can probably help us look seriously at how it hit many people. Emilio Estevez certainly did a good job. Also with Corin Nemec and Carla Gugino.
