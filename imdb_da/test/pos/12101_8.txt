Believe Akin has made me once again aware of the depth of my passion for this city called Istanbul. Faith Akin has been addressed as a city of cultural mosaics, and has helped address through the mosaics of music performed in the movie. In addition, the climax of the film is, in my opinion, the scene where Muzeyyen Senar (a Turkish music diva) sings at the age of 86, as she had done in her younger years and rolls the raki glass in the air without pouring out a drop which is a traditional action in raki culture. She is just wonderful. Sezen Aksu (a Turkish pop singer) with his mysterious and meaningful look at the end of her song, which gives the film its Turkish title, makes the scene no less than a climax. Last but not least, the wonderful nature of Istanbul can make you feel nostalgic if you are away. Beware!
