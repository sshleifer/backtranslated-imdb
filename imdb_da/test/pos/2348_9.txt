I liked this movie, the other Naruto movie. I enjoyed one in the snow a little better, although I found the story here a little different, since I wasn't sure where certain things were going to happen or when. Nevertheless, the same film as the first film also has a good maturity of an hour and a half, plenty of time for a nice well-developed film with some really great matches. The story begins with the ninja from the village hidden in the sand in battle with the unknown attackers. It then pushes Naruto, Sakura and Shikumaru in search of a fritter for what they believe will be an easy task. They quickly find out otherwise as they are also attacked, and Naruto is separated from his friends after he has a fight with a strange young warrior dressed in armor. They are both wounded and taken in by a caravan, and soon after Naruto is invited to join this strange organization who wants to create a utopia. Of course everything is not as it looks and there are plenty of battles to walk around. My favorite was the one who involved Garaa fighting this strange woman who takes him very easily, which is a very big mistake. The final match is also good for involving Naruto and this strange man, who is a better villain than any of them in the previous movie.
