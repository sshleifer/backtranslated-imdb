For me, "Late Chrysanthemums" was interesting not only because it was my first film of Naruse I totally enjoyed, but because it was technically as modern and innovative as his 30-year-old work I have seen. This does not mean innovative editing in the way Godard introduced it with "Breathless" in 1959, but the opposite. Editing was as fluid as in the best Hollywood movies from the 30s / 40s, yet incredibly fitting to the way he told his story. Unlike them, it never focused on anything or tried to make itself "invisible," but with the filmmaker I felt that I was on a gentle stream, constantly feeling the waves beneath me, like a gentle blow in my hand or The almost imperceptible rocking of a cradle. In this sense, the film was comparable to the work of Ozu and Mizoguchi, but somehow even more subtle. <br /> <br /> What was so modern was the fact that editing seemed almost a sign in itself, like the remarkable camera work in the Dreyer's Word (1954) or the Day of Wrath (1943), which reveals a deeper understanding of the movie and its characters rather than just showing them to us. <br /> <br /> I feel that Narusa's editing and film is the most interesting aspect of his film that raises the significance of history beyond the obvious. The wonderful sets and options should also not be forgotten! I found the story itself to be quite conventional. The story and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way, and I thought the first half of the film was creating a delicate brilliant spectrum of emotions and interrelationships. Unfortunately, the second half of the film and its resolution was quite didactic and and formal in relation to the lineup (although it would have been perfect adaptation in any other - less complex film). Somehow, I felt like he failed a little in trying to dissolve the many layers he had woven. Perhaps he should have kept them intact. This criticism may seem a bit harsh to a viewer of this movie, especially as the procedure again reminds of how Ozu deals with the plot of his films. Unfortunately, I do not yet have the feeling that Naruse could raise the story and its characters in the conclusions of his film in a similarly sublime way. The best effort I have seen to date - Ukigumo (Floating Clouds / 1955) and Midaregumo (Scattered Clouds / 1967) - maintained the energy he had built up throughout the story while delivering exciting and resonant conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is already more than most directors are capable of doing and, in my opinion, the basis for real mastery of the cinematic medium. In that respect, and given the resonance of the last two movies I've seen of him, he may already have become one of my favorites. The only problem I currently have is where I want to see more of his movie on the big screen.
