I watched the movie at the Nashville Film Festival on May 1, 2003! It was amazing! All the things I had read about Stuey were uttered incredibly well by Tony Vidmer (author, director, producer, editor), Michael Imperioli (incredible work as Stuey) and all the others involved in this. I'm glad he (Vidmer) didn't go down the "Leaving Las Vegas" routine with Stuey's bad habits, but instead puts us into his life, family, and his gift. Tying the whole story from the motel room where he died was a great vehicle and showed his screen writing skills. A great "thumbs up" on this one!
