In Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, the owner of a cigarette factory Louis Mahé (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is engaged by correspondence with Julie Roussel and he does not know her. When Julie arrives at the island to marry Louis, he waits for her in the harbor, but Louis does not recognize Julie in the passenger ship and finds that she is quite different from the picture she had sent to Louis. They get married and Louis shares her bank accounts with her. When Julia's sister writes a letter to Louis asking her sister to write to her, Louis discovers that the woman is not Julie missing. In addition, he finds that the woman has cleared her bank accounts and left the island. Louis and Julie's sister hires an effective private detective, Comolli (Michel Bouquet), and Louis travels to France to find the woman, but he has a nervous breakdown in Nice and is being subjected to intense sleep in a clinic. He restores and finds out that the woman, in fact Marion Vergano (Catherine Deneuve), works in the Phoenix Club Private in Antibes and lives in the low-budget Monorail Hotel. Louis goes in her room and when she comes from the club, she tells her she was happy with him, but her formerly dangerous girlfriend Richard had harassed her. Louis is still in love with Marion and escapes with her to the country. But Comolli is chasing Marion in France accused of killing Julie. <br /> <br /> "La Sirène du Mississipi" is a film noir by the great director / writer François Truffaut with an unconventional love story of passion, murder and love that hurts. Femme fatale Catherine Deneuve is astonishing, probably at the top of her beauty, and is delighted to see her face and the topless scenes on the road and in the living room. Jean-Paul Belmondo is very athletic, and the sequence when he escalates the wall of the hotel is impressive. Catherine Deneuve deserves this movie and gives credibility to Louise's passion and desire. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Sereia do Mississipi" ("Mississippi Mermaid")
