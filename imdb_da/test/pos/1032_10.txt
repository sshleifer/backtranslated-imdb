President Harry S. Truman once said that the only thing new in the world is the story you do not know. Seven years before Richard Rhodes' amazing Pulitzer award-winning "Atomic Bombs Making", BBC produced a seven-part miniseries, "Oppenheimer", which was a character study of the people who designed and built the weapon that heralded the atomic age that permanently joined. science and technology to the state (and especially the military), not just to make history, but to change the world forever. <br /> <br /> Production is impeccable, it supports nothing less than miraculously; Not only the protagonists, but even secondary characters, carry scary similarities to the people portrayed. In particular, Sam Waterston is in the title role of US physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the Manhattan Project, based at Los Alamos, NM, the laboratory (the place he personally chose); Manning Redwood as General Leslie R. Groves, overseeing the entire Manhattan Engineering District (project's formal name); David Suchet as a physicist, and ultimate nemesis of Oppenheimer, Edward Teller (who nearly whispered to Ronald Reagan's ear and brought us the strategic defense initiative - "Star Wars") and Jana Sheldon as Kitty Oppenheimer. The attention to detail is uniformly excellent throughout. <br /> <br /> Share thriller, some love story - and ultimately a tragedy, this series faithfully restores a chapter of world history - and that of science - that we dare not forget. Highest recommendation. <br /> <br /> (NOTE: Viewers enjoying this series will also enjoy Jacob Bronowski's 13-part series "The Ascension of Man" and BBC Frayn's movie "Copenhagen".)
