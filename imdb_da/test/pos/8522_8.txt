You are not reviewing James Bond movies you rate them, judging by how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has expected, even demand from a Bond movie, and every single bet delivers either, or it doesn't. So here are ten elements that make a Bond movie a Bond movie. And although it has never been said, it is not technically part of the official Bond filmography, but the only presence of Sean Connery returning as 007 makes it more than just an honorary member of the series. Anyway, here's how it bets on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Title: NEVER NEVER AGAIN: The wise title has no apparent link to the actual story but is instead an in-joke reference to Sean Connery's promise to never play OO7 again after being lured back once before DIAMOND'S FOREVER. Whatever it is, it's a captivating title. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Pre-Credit Teaser: Perhaps one is trying to avoid any obvious parallels with the official EON Series Bond movie, there's no Teaser; The opening scenes just appear behind the credits. And even that is disappointing: another "oh-no, Bond has been killed" fakeout. 4 points. <br /> <br /> Opening credits: Aside from a screen full of small 007s, they didn't even try to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 point. Theme Song: As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall "Never Say Never Again" would make a perfectly comfortable part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, it's just okay. 6 points. "Bond, James Bond": With this movie, Connery is being lured to service like Bond after a decade of hiatus, the story begins with 007 facing the question of whether Bond / Connery is still up to the job. Fortunately, Connery is more than ready for Bondage again. Although slightly lighter, has a little more circumference and has a slightly more obvious toupee, he has no trouble slipping back into action. All in all, it is one of Connery's best, and most relaxed, turns as the character. 9 points. Bond Babes: Even in the best Bond films, the female characters are not given much dimension; they exist virtually as necessary props for Bond's use. Future Oscar winner Kim Basinger gets great living space to create his character of Domino Petachi, and the film benefits from this. She does a good job - and she is not bad at looking at either. 8 points. Bond Villain: The reports of his death are, of course, exaggerated, Blofeld is back - at least for the moment - showing that he has more lives than his prized pussycat. Once Jesus exhibitor-turning stereotype villain, Max von Sydow is not much to do in the role, but is a silky presence anyway. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a series of banal Bond villains it is so refreshing for Brandauer to give a performance that is both subtle but colorless evil. Fun without being campy, inconsiderate without seemingly cartoonish; his Largo ranks right there with Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond's best villains. 10 points. <br/> <br /> Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? As the game with the bold style of a particularly flamboyant dragon queen, Barbara Carrera bursts through the movie and shows a mix of self-disrupted evil and more than a little pure psychotic insanity. Bond has crossed paths with a number of fives fatales, most of which have been so easily disposed that they existed more as entertaining eyelids than as signs. But dare to expose such a flare to the dramatic or so hard determination. Even her unforeseen death is spectacular, even by Bondian standards. 10 points. Sinister Plot: As a remake of the kind of THUNDERBALL, the film looks a bit like that: that nuclear missiles are stolen and larger properties will go kaboom if all the countries in the world do not pay a solution amount in several casinos. But at least, producer Kevin McClory was fortunate enough to have to recreate one of the weakest Bond adventures. In comparisons, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the lack of many Bondian trademarks, the movie only succeeds. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Production Values: The movie starts with a restless style, like a television movie trying to be more than it can. But as the story progresses, the film gets speed and a sense of purpose, making it a superior adventure. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Bonus Points: There are several odd changes that put this Bond movie apart from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly recognized; as played by Edward Fox, "M" is a rubbish old grouch with no respect for "Double Os", a foreshadowing of how Judi Dench would later play that part; and "Q" suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy with Bond. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film, such as replacing Bond's Astin-Martin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance song that is wisely inserted in history. And a great rescue near the end is for horseback, a tribute to THE LOST ARK, which itself was a tribute to the Bond movies. 5 points. <br /> <br /> Summary: NEVER SOMETHING is a mixed bag. In the very important areas, it is more than fortunate thanks to the hero Connery, the villain Brandauer, the assassin Carrera and the lady-in-distress Basinger. But the devil is in the details; as seemingly insignificant as opening credits, theme song and such, the film lacks because of their absence. It all comes as a faux bond film; a very good replacement but a replacement anyway. Bond-o-meter Rating: 78 points out of 100.
