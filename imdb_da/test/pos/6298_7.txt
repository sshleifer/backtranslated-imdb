I have read that Paolo Sorrintino's inspiration for Love's Consequences came from simply observing a businessman alone in a Brazilian hotel and wondering what he might do there. The film unfolds in a similar way. We see the existence of Titta, who has lived alone in a hotel in Switzerland for 8 years. He is secretive and avoids friendship. His life is dominated by orders and regularly. Eventually, his life's truth is revealed to us until his world begins to fall apart. <br /> <br /> The mystery of Titta is central to the consequences of love, and it works largely thanks to the excellent performance of Toni Servillo. His character becomes even more exciting for us, as small details are revealed - that he injects heroin once a week that he has no imagination. Although some here criticize the dialogue for not being naturalistic, it doesn't matter in my opinion - it's not that kind of movie, and I think the manuscript is amazing. The camera's work is also excellent. <br /> <br /> To criticize, the movie loses its way into later scenes, as Titta's existence mystery is revealed to us, and when his world begins to fall. However, the tragic end scenes are as good as the previous build.
