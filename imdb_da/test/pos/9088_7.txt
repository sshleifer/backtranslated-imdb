Countless TV screens and the memorable appearances of 4 of today's mega stars (plus Hope Davis's screen debut) still keep Flatliners in caution. The reason is about a non-academic study of the five drug sub-grades, which pursues its crooked idea of ​​discovering the secret of death and learning what is after death, then coming back to life again. But the story is not designed as fascinating as the idea of ​​the plot. There are popular stereotypes to develop a common teen slasher script in Flatliners. There is Nelson who creates the idea of ​​decoding dead, beautiful but introverted Rachel, David, who cuts the Gordian knot on fortunately not being dismissed from school, ladies Joe and finally the smart guy Randy ("I did not come to medical school To murder my classmates, no matter how worried they were, they are all in the hands of an attempt where Nelson's heart is stopped and rhythmic, and then they decide to continue this experiment in strict self-confidence at night on campus. Experience starts all over having the wildest and longest death experience that risks their lives one by one, but soon they realize that their daily lives are influenced by the experiences they had. The visit to the afterlife brings their criminal feelings back from their Depolarization of their deep unconscious surveillance, they begin to have somatic delusions and visual hallucinations, when the point comes to explain none of the subconscious, director Joel Schumacher leads that every humanity has a subconscious personality that they are not aware of. This inner personality prevents one from changing to identity loss. If you lose or you depolarize this subconscious personality, you will certainly lose your identity instead of refreshing childhood memories. I would like to add this as a movie bug that has already been mentioned through film critics in the past 90s. Of course, here in this movie, Schumacher made the actors the least affected. So why do they hesitate to continue on the experiment after learning their lesson as if death was designed undiscovered by God? David had been introduced as an atheist, now he turned to believe in God as he recalled a feedback from his childhood. Having seen this 180-degree change in David, it is evident that Schumacher's film was so conservative and lily-delivered; It is ultimately therefore never classified as a work of science fiction. Alas! It had a good potential. It even tried to tell the unconscious maturity of having a death experience and began to believe that death is so simple and natural, and it is only part of a human's life. More than what is in the movie, it was also memorable to remember what is with the movie. Jan de Bont as film photographer, who had worked almost every time with Schumacher, creates a dreamy atmosphere as if it were a gothic horror movie. The blue color schemes of the walls, reflecting the actors' faces, deliver first-class lighting that fits perfectly with the movie. Close-ups of gargoyle statues in the campus buildings, Catholic frescoes in the walls, stop cameras and the dynamic camera speeds were all associated Bontt's skills. Flatliners became a cult movie in time with the sociological pen portrait of the X-generation juvenile, especially through its futuristic editing style with storyboard connection sequences as being part of a video clip so much aesthetically. These were the times when fast and multi-sequenced video clips were on the rise. This style was very rare to come across in those years after his pioneer Tony Scott's "The Hunger (1983)".
