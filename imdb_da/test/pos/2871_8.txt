There is a whole new killer on the loose, and he does God's work. Yeah right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump, and Freddy Krueger looks like a rag doll against this guy. He is Jacob Goodnight (WWE's Glen "KANE" Jacobs), a 7 'monster using an axis and a hook and chain. These weapons are not for him, his real finisher ripping out the eyeballs from the victims. It's completely methodical! When the meeting happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a newcomer policeman and met the veteran after putting a bullet in his head. How on Earth did Goodnight survive after 4 years? Now he is in the damned hotel called Blackwell. And this hotel got many stories to tell. I thought this movie was joking and interesting. I liked the part where Goodnight checked one of the girl's tattoos on her back. And good night itself is really scared thanks to its maniacal mother. If you think Friday the 13th was something, you think better again. This movie will leave you on the edge of your seat. And I think the eyeball rip was bone-chilling. This movie shows it and it wasn't a waste of my time. I enjoyed it. The title doesn't lie! Rating 2.5 out of 5 stars!
