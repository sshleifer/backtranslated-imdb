Halloween 666 (1995) Manufacturer's cut review! Halloween 666 begins with a recap of the horrible ending to Part Five. If you thought the last chapter was dark, it would really blow you. A mysterious "Man in Black" has ridden the Haddonfield Police Department free of Micheal Myers. In the process, poor Jamie Lloyd was abducted by strange cultists. What do they want with her? Who knows, but let's just say her long suffering will end soon. Doctor Loomis worships the rest of his twilight years trying to stop Michael Myers from killing more innocent (good luck). A friend of Loomis, Dr. Wynn comes back after a four successor hiatus to help the good doctor. Another old face from part 1 guest stars too. <br /> <br /> This dark and boring sequel was dismantled during post-production editing. For some reason, the distributors felt that the final product was not the host of the average horror movie that time. So they decide to stupid it down. So after having the film sit on the shelf for several months, it laid an egg at the cashier's office. Whatever they did to the movie, they made it worse. They should have left well enough alone. Hey, the movie company knows better than the filmmakers now .... don't they? <br /> <br /> Manufacturer's cut: Highly recommended <br /> <br /> Release version: Not recommended
