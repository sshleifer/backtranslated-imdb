Wow! What a lovely, warm, rural movie! The story focuses on Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney), a young male wanderer whose journey takes him to a quiet, rural coastal town. There he remains with the Brown family. Velvet (Liz Taylor) their youngest daughter, whom Mi subtly turns to, has a passion for horses and wins one at an auction. This horse is a beautiful, maroon stallion; referred by his former owner as a "murderous pirate", but Velvet transforms him Pie. Not much later, Velvet proposes to enter the Grand National Race, Mi and her family are against the idea, but soon agree, and Velvet and Mi began training him for Britain's most famous horse race ?? This film is a beautiful example of how British movies are. I remember first seeing this when I was eight and on my summer vacation. My parents taped it off the TV and I instantly lasted it ?? see it on most days instead of the big collection of Disney movies I owned. <br /> <br /> I think it was one of Liz Taylor's first movies and a good one! Her character is naive but sweet ?? Her plays are extremely convincing, especially when she portrays her love for horses. It's also a good chance to see Angela Lansbury in one of her early roles; Who co-stars as Velvet's older sister who spends most of her time in the movie is beaten with a boy in town! I must say she was a beautiful lady when she was younger. Beautiful blonde hair and a rosy cheeky face. Although she doesn't have a big part in the movie, she has a series of scenes - so don't disappoint her fans! Parents read this, I need weight? if you can get a copy of this you must do! If you are kids love animals ?? I strongly recommend that you show it to them! They can find a few scenes boring, but you can see Velvet riding the horse on many occasions throughout the movie and would most entertainingly entertain children! A nice and nostalgic movie. I can just walk away now and put it on!
