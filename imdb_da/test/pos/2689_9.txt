I'm not really a tsv. watcher - except between 6 and 8 years and "General Hospital" still had Luke and Laura - but there are a few exceptions and I certainly believe that "King of Queens" is one of them. Every decade it has classics, and I think this show will (or amazingly) be among the best of this decade. Its comic timing is amazing and can sometimes be just as weird. On a more serious note, the actors more than succeeded in conveying subtle - and not so subtle :) - complexities in their characters without being too hokey. One comment wrote that it may take a few episodes to get into it and I agree. It's certainly one that grows on you, but when you're in, you're pretty much connected. And with good reason!
