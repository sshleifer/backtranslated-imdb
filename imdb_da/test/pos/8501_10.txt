Denis Leary can actually be funny and clever at times and is always sympathetic, but it takes the cake! This show showed Leary's genius. <br /> <br /> The job is set in New York. Leary plays Mike McNeil, a stubborn detective who is married, has occasional drug problems and has a boyfriend. McNeil has a serious attitude. He drinks so much in it. The store is filled with fun, interesting and sympathetic characters besides McNeil. An excellent cast too. All the episodes in this show are really fun and addictive. The one liners in this show are everywhere. You will be on the stitch after hearing them and still laughing about them a few minutes later and seeing some. The issues that the sermon is about are something else to strip nuns, a bathroom runaway and more is over the top. This show was too good. Could have grown bones to hold many more seasons. <br /> <br /> The last word: A fantastic, amazing show. I miss this show expensive. All episodes of this show are great. You even get belly-laughs ... much. ABC made a big mistake by giving this ax. Too bad Leary did not revive the show for cable TV. Nevertheless, I give this show one of my highest recommendations. Really a great show.
