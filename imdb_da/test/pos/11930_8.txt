Imagine this. Someone makes a movie about the Columbine or Virginia tech massacre only the movie is directed by the guy who did home alone (I just don't know just me) and stars Sean Astin off of Goonies !! The image of the terrorists is being overcome by watering the top of the doors and marble, and so you have to watch the movie. Unfortunately, it's not quite about actually having the skateboard on the floor for the evil Mexicans to travel on, but halfway you have to give it over 7 for it, but not a 9, because it wasn't wild enough. Too bad, it seemed to be comical cheesiness, well worth a cult status
