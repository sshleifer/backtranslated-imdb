I found this movie pretty brilliant. In the beginning, I wished that "when animals attack" flattered in line with "frankenfish" or even "rogue", but was delivered a truly awful trial that was not devoid of humanity. Having been to the areas that were made (including croc farm at the start of the movie, even sharing the same guide!) It added to the fear factor. These crocs are really everywhere up there, though I don't think they had the "attitude" of this beastie. Yes, there were some melodramatic moments, but they contributed a little distracted from the whole atmosphere. I really used the characters and shook contemplating "what would I do?" in their boat. Not knowing where your enemy shabby or the sound of the hook chaude down at night was really scary. I would argue that this flick is one of the best horrors I've seen this year (coming close to the descent). I give it four alligator handbags.
