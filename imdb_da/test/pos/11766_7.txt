Not your regular movie, but a good one. Billy Bob is very funny in this movie, the way he talks about what he says, etc. I was a little surprised when I saw it because I just thought it was a normal comedy, but it was more than that. It had a very good story, beautiful figures and a good balance. <br /> <br /> Favorite Part: Probably when Billy Bob runs around in his robe shooting at rippers
