I don't like Jackass second. No one should. There is, and has never been, any particular redeeming thing about Jackass. And yet ... it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen - and I simply can't explain why. <br /> <br /> This new movie leaves the first in the dust. It's so much fun, so terrible and so wrong. The whole team is giving their all with Jack's Chief Knoxville, who heads the charge. He's nuts. I love him, but he's crazy. And more power for him. With his burgeoning film career, he could have sat down and just let everyone else do the dirty work, but the fact that he almost literally threw himself back into the 'Ass' world makes me totally odd to respect him. More kudos have to go to Bam Margera, who previously seemed content to sit back and just make sure everyone around him did pretty much what he wanted. Here Bam is not the pain, but it bothers and is better for it. <br /> <br /> I simply can't say what my favorite part is because I laughed all the way through. I have seen a lot of the movie from my fingers, but there has not been a "real" movie I have seen for a very long time, which made me feel as refreshing as it did. Love them or probably hate them, the Jackass team has delivered beyond my expectations. But I agree with Bam. There can never be a Jackass number three, because somebody wants to die and I want these guys to hold on.
