Susie Q is a wonderfully romantic film. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great actress. I think she did a good job. I hope sometime that Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's a bit cold and a little fun. It's a little boring when Susie Q dies in a car accident at first, it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle, when no one suspects Susie Q, it becomes a little fun and surprising. There is a little mystery in this movie, but not much. But I still recommend this movie to the whole family if they enjoy comedy, mystery or romance type movies. It is well! I think Amy Jo Johnson as Susie Q is Cute.
