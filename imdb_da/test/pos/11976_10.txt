If you want a good time then this is the movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Take the Prerequisite - There is this college that grants people with minimum qualifications for BA, B.Com, M.Com, MA, MBA, MCA, BE, M.Tech and BCA. So you have to take into account the time taken and thus it is obvious that all students are 40+. Also the school allows students a "heavier" exemption and has a course of P.Hd in weight loss and the only student who has failed this course is Manisha Koirala. Only she was a snake in the past life. Still not convinced? OK read on. <br /> <br /> Here's a scene. Akshay Kumar, a college student, is being chased by Arman and he takes a bazooka out and shoots him! Then throw grenades. Then one of the grenades hits Akshay. But don't die and continue to fight, Arman snakes hit a half-foot dagger into Akshay and stumps on it, but Akshay is still there. Then comes Akshay on a jet ski and follows Arman. They fight and Arman chokes Akshay underwater and finally Akshay is dead. So we think as soon as Arman is out of the picture, Akshay swims away to Raj Babbar, Principal for this college + Boxing Refree + Parapsychology ka professor + mumbling priest. <br /> <br /> But no one I repeat no one takes the cake but one particular Mr. Nigam. You look to learn more. :-)
