I have seen this movie several times over the years and always find it an entertaining experience. As a retired airline pilot, I am interested in most aviation movies and this is one of the better ones. I know Lindbergh was only 25 years old at the time of his historic solo flight to Paris and that James Stewart was nearly 50 when he made this movie, but I can overlook the fact because Stewart has always been one of mine All-time favorite actors and make one of his usual excellent performances as "lone eagle". <br /> <br /> There is a good mix of comedy and drama throughout the movie and a good use of flashbacks. It also helps that James Stewart was a real-life pilot in both military and civilian life.
