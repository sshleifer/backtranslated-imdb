This is a great show that makes me wonder why it was pulled out of the air so many times. But I think it's here to stay! This show cannot be compared to others until the Simpsons were right "on the edge" and even came Family Guy and they stretch it out to get out of the "edge". The things this show comes with are incredible. Totally work the clock! If you like Simpsons you will love family guy!
