My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself through the legacy of his famous architect Louis Kahn, dead since 1974. The film is slowly but perfectly built and what begins as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful story with much deeper meaning in terms of the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, the work of our lives. I had never heard of Louis Kahn before this movie, although I was vaguely aware of some of his work. Through the words (both good and bad) of Louis Kahn's colleagues, you get a very good sense of what Nathaniel must have felt like recalling and telling stories. Sometimes it seemed that these people told Nathaniel how to feel about their father. As I listened to every memory, my own opinion of this man would range from beautiful to horrible, sometimes in a moment of moment, so you get a good sense of slideway that Nathaniel's feelings must have run. <br /> The final sequence in Bangladesh completely made the movie for me. The reverence that Bangladesh's people spoke of Louis Kahn's work tied all the loose ends together nicely for me, and hopefully for Nathaniel. I think Nathaniel Kahn finally found what he was looking for.
