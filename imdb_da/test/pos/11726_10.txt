Dirty Harry goes to Atlanta, what Burt called this amazing first-class detective thriller that borrows some of his plot from the venerable Dana Andrews movie "Laura." Burt Reynolds is not alone in this amazing saga, but he also killed it, and he does not make a single mistake either to act or to casting characters. Not a bad performance in the movie, and Reynolds does an excellent job of managing it. Henry Silva is really ice cold as a hitman. Detective Tom Sharky (Burt Reynolds) is in a drug case in underground Atlanta when everything goes wrong. He wins chasing a suspicion and shoots it out with the gun on a bus. During melee, an innocent bystander dies. John Woo's "The Killer" replicates this scene. Anyway, the Atlanta Police Department breaks Burt down to Vice and he takes orders from a new boss, Frisco (Charles Durning of "Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?") In the basement. Sharky wins in a real cesspool of crime. Sharky and his co-detectors Arch (Bernie Casey) and Papa (Brian Keith) watched an affordable call girl Dominoe (Rachel Ward of "After Dark, My Sweet") who has a luxurious apartment she shares with another girl. <br /> <br /> Dominoe sees a local politician Hotchkins (Earl Holliman from "Police Woman") on the side fighting for governor, but the top villain, Victor (Vittorio Gassman of "The Dirty Game") wants him to close the case. Hotchkins is reluctant to accommodate Victor, so Victor has cocaine snorting Billy Score (Henry Silva from "Wipeout") terminating Dominoe. Billy blasts a hole the size of a twelve-inch pizza in the door of Domino's apartment and kills her. <br /> <br /> Sharky has made the unthinkable. During the surveillance, he has been happy with Dominoe to the point that he is hopelessly forged with her. Sharky's mission in life is now to bust Victor, but he learns that Victor has an informant inside the Atlanta Police Department. The reason really warms up when Sharky later discovers that Billy shot the wrong girl and that Dominoe still lives! Sharky takes her into conservation and things become even more complicated. He gathers his "Machine" of the title to deal with Victor and his caps. <br /> <br /> William Fraker's widescreen lens of action is immaculate. Unfortunately, this very underrated classic is only available as a full movie. Fraker certainly contributes to the atmosphere in the picture, especially during the mutilation scene on the boat, when the villain cuts off one of Sharky's fingers. This is a pretty cruel scene. <br /> <br /> Burt never made a movie that exceeded "Sharky's Machine."
