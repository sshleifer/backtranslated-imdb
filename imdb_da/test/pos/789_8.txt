Saw this for the first time on British television with good musical accompaniment. The elevator scene is class, especially when he starts in the phone box, and then one flips with the yellow window. Hope through the transom is really impressive and there is so much more. Apart from all the things mentioned before, there is the fight with the man who has bullied the woman with the dog - it just looks so simple. The only drawback is the plot - he is mixed with Dead Eye Dan, who then escapes, but does not reappear, although some more gangsters are involved later. The scene where it looks like he is shooting at the fat inspector is fun, but it would have been better if Dead Eye was the one who took the trigger.
