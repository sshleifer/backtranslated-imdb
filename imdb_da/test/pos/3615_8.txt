At first I didn't think I liked this movie, but as it evolved, it got better and better. I love music, and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also likes the movie a lot for his music and the story and the way the story unfolded - slowly showing how Corelli won the girls' heart. The story and story were both well done and orderly. First, Corelli's bravado was annoying, but soon he grew on you. The twists in the plot were fascinating especially the relationship with the Germans. I would like to see this again to follow all the pages. I also want to buy the soundtrack to hear the music again.
