spoiler-- <br /> In 1993, African American instructor / actor Mario Van Peebles followed up on the hugely popular urban action movie New Jack City with "Posse". The film was written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the protagonist, Jessie Lee. <br /> <br /> Plot: The movie begins at the beginning of the 20th century when the United States was involved in the Spanish-American war. Apparently, Jessie Lee seems to be a time when the US legal system could send prisoners to the military service, an involuntary man serving a completely black cavalry group in Cuba. Some of his compatriots include Little J (Stephen Baldwin), Talking Weezie (Charles Lane) and the towering but simple Obobo (Tiny Lister). They find a hidden gold chest on a reconnaissance race and decide to keep it. However, the ambitious, colossal Colonel Graham (Zane) finds out of the gold and is apparently willing to kill Jessie Lee and the company for it. A shootout between Graham's forces and Jessie Lee leaves the colonel blind in an eye, and his forces retreat. Jessie Lee's ragtag crew manages to smuggle himself (and the gold) back to New Orleans, but it turns out Graham is not far behind. Jessie Lee and his allies are forced to go on the road, heading west, to a town called Freemanville. Apparently, Freemanville was founded by blacks in the years following the Civil War. Jessie Lee's father, "King David", was the charismatic preacher who starred in the city. But as it was revealed in intermittent flashbacks, King David was soon brutally murdered by a white mob in parallel with the Ku Klux Clan terrorist campaigns that began around the same time. Jessie Lee and Company eventually find their way to Freemanville, only to find out that the city's people are not exactly happy to see him, especially when Sheriff Bates (Richard Jordan) in a nearby white town makes it clear that he Want Jessie Lee and his partners dead or alive. Carver (Blair Underwood) is the sheriff and de facto mayor of Freemanville, and his own agenda must not be squared with having Jessie Lee around. Analysis The action sequences are all very credible, and Mario Van Peebles turns to a good performance as the breaking hero. Following on from New Jack City's success, it was almost expected that Van Peebles would demolish a successor or at least a similar follow-up to city action. Instead, Van Peebles saw 100 years in the past and created a mainly black western (effective 'update' of the black-themed westerns of the 1970s) and continued the legacy of virtually forgotten black-themed cowboy films from the beginning 20th century . Unlike New Jack City, the film was independently funded and originally released through Gramercy / Polygram Entertainment. Apparently eksecs on the big studios balked when Van Peebles pitched 'Posse' to them. Some of the more "curious" casting at that time involved rappers Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc as Father Time and Angel respectively. In some interviews, Mario Van Peebles said he often likes to throw at type; Over the years, the trend of beating rapeseed in non-musical films would be almost commonplace. Keen viewers will see more comos of various entertainment personalities: Black Action movie veterans such as Isaac Hayes ("Truck Turner"), Pam Grier ("Foxy Brown") and Larry Cook ("The Spook who Sat by the Door") appear just as the resurrection legend Nipsey Russell, not to mention television producer Stephen J. Cannell (who hired junior Van Peebles to star in "Sonny Spoon" years earlier). The film is posted with Woody Strode ("Spartacus") in a key role.
