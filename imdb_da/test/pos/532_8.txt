I'm sorry, but "Star Wars Episode 1" did not do justice to Natalie Portman's talent (and undeniable cuteness). She was totally underutilized as Queen Amidala, and when used, her makeup was terribly horrible. For "anywhere but here" she blames her god-horrible makeup and she works normally. And not only can she act well, she looks good at doing it. I'm a little older than she (she's only 18) and I have little or no chance to meet her, but hey, a guy is allowed to dream, right? <br /> <br /> Although Susan Sarandon does Take a good trip in this movie, the whole movie belongs to Portman. I've been watching Portman's "Beautiful Girls" page (where she was younger, but just as sweet). There are great things for her in the future - I can see it.
