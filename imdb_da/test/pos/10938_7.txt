I enjoyed this movie okay, it could just have been so much better. I was expecting more action than what I got ... which was more of a comedy than anything else. Granted, it was serious in parts, and it had a good fight scene here and there for the most part it was more romance and comedy with no action and no fear at all. It's hard to do with a vampire movie. A vampire hunter loses his partner and has to train another, his sister goes through a difficult break, but she is pursued by a vampire of all things. Granted, this vampire is pretty nice and not in sucking blood. So that's all there is to it except for a plot of another vampire after some royal vampires so he can achieve ultimate power. Some of the problems with this movie are that its plot went here and there, and the movie had a very rough stream to it, and it also seemed to change genres a little too. One minute's action, the next pure comedy. The girls, however, were nice, there is good action, the comedy was worthy of a chuckle or two and Jackie Chan makes a pretty energetic look or two. This movie probably just needs more development in some areas, such as the villain who is essentially not really explored at all. So for a movie with a couple of good games and a chuckle or two it is pretty good ... but why was it rated R? I've seen things we've made that are PG-13 that is much worse than this.
