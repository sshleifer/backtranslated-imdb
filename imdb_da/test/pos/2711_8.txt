There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing to the studio's owner. <br /> <br /> Richard chooses the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen sings over her natural selection. You can see a look at the bemusement on the owner's face; He shows that she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in another key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner makes an invaluable double trip. Well done! For some reason I have never forgotten that scene. Karen Carpenter Story chronicles the carpenter's meteoric rise and Karen's struggle to overcome anorexia. A lot of things shine over. This is not a documentary, and the film left me with many questions. Very little is mentioned by the Karen solo venture (the CD was only released a few years ago. If you buy it, you will wonder why they were waiting. It is some of Karen's best work. The songs are not as timeless as her work with Brother Richard, but it was a great recording, in my opinion). I've heard it said that you can listen to a cheap, time-consuming little radio in the middle of the third world, it seems to produce more static than anything else. But when a Carpenter song comes on the radio, you think you were listening to a $ 1000 Hi-Fidelity device. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie!
