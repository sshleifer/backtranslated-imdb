I love the Ln Chaney version of "Phantom" and I greatly appreciate Webber's version, if only for the growing interest in the book, I want to find more of a mysterious slash with the romantic aspects dimmed. I do not endorse the fact that Andrew Lloyd Webber made the relationship between Raoul and Christine less reluctant. Ever since this is a comic card with only Erik and Christine, this version doesn't even have to disturb with other characters. I thought I would still wait for another version that matched Lon's performance. I was dead wrong. Leslie Nielson is fabulous as Erik of course, it is of course a spoof. It's still brilliant. <br /> <br /> I especially appreciated that Erik looked more like a living body than an accident victim. I still have not yet seen a Phantom like that other than Lons. <br /> <br /> However, I do not recommend this card if you do not like spoofs. Because this should in no way be taken seriously.
