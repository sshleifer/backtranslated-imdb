Soul Calibur is more solid than ever ... with the new character creation and the heavy fashion chronicle of the sword state of the home version. <br /> <br /> The arcade version is more complete, although the characteristic is less than the home version, this version is certainly the more beautiful of the two, eliminating all the "goofy / unrealistic" fighting styles found in the home version. If you were in any way disappointed with the home version, or maybe thought it was "too much", you might find a much more sympathetic and straightforward play of Soul Calibur in the arcade. Do you think you have what it takes to become a legend?
