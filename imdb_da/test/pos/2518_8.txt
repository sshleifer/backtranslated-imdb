Drive was an enjoyable episode with a dark end. Basically, a man and his wife are infected in their inner ear by a loud sound wave emitted by some military equipment. Some of my favorite parts of this episode are the Mold's dialogue in the car and the scene where Scully enters the Hazmat team and finds the little old deaf lady totally unaffected by what they thought was a virus. The conclusion is, of course, tragic in its realism, because it causes the viewer to believe that they will actually be able to draw the elaborate plan to save the victim, but when Mulder arrives, the man is already dead. 8.10
