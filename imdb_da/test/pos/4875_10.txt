I saw the SEA OF DUST at the Rhode Island Horror Film Festival in Providence. It was the festival's featured films and won the best picture of I think a few hundred entries. The manager and a couple of the stars answered questions after the show. One star, Suzy Lorraine, was even warmer in person than in the movie, and she was an eye-catching movie in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is independent, but it has many cinematic features that give it a quality feel. It's even an original classic style musical score. <br /> <br /> I'm a Savini fan and he's the star villain in black cape, he's more of a vicious force than a real person I think. He sucks the souls out of humans and uses them as soldiers in a twisted attempt to establish his version of God's kingdom on Earth. In his view, Christ revolved around suffering, and Savini intends to make everyone suffer. <br /> <br /> The main storyline that holds your interest is about a young doctor, Stefan, sent to investigate the strange events Savini causes in an isolated city. He suggests an aristocratic chick on the road, but her SOB father tells him to get lost. Then he meets up with a strange obsessed but prominent maid. I think she falls in love with him, but she also tries to kill him, like a number of hot women in the movie. <br /> <br /> I found the scenes shot in the woods to be the strangest and most conspicuous with weird people along the way (the evil little twin girls scared hell out of me). <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot to do with it, too much to list. There is a lot of blood, torture and gore. Hot chicks licking blood out of boys' fingers. A scared girl's head explodes. It was unexpected. Throats get slit. Some brutal stabbings. <br /> <br /> Sometimes they play it laughing and throwing some fun on the entire evil black forest genre. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Hammer movies and Ingrid Pitt, it is fascinating to see her in this movie. She offs one of the leaders by crossing his skull. Excellent. The guy who played "Multiple Miggs" in the Silence of the Lambs is fantastic in an ax battle. <br /> <br /> The movie is surreal, and in the end I'm not sure the events were happening or if they were in Stephen's head because of his rejection of his wild fianc√©. He returns in revenge, and that scene is brutal. <br /> <br /> The director also spoke on the theme of religion, which is being abused to reverse wars and killings. I can see that Savini's view of religion was frightening. <br /> <br /> This was a weirdly unusual movie with some stars like Savini and Pitt, a lot of great supports, including hot babes, great-looking scenes, action, and constantly wondering what the hell is going on, and what will happen next time. <br /> <br /> This deserves ten stars because it is an outstanding independent film effort, I don't think it was a low budget, but it had to be less than a large study budget, and yet they managed to do something really attractive, unambiguous and thoughtful.
