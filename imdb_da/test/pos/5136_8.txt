I highly recommend this movie to anyone. My son and I read the book first and watched the movie. While the book was better (in my opinion) the movie was still great. My son and I agree that while we like the book version the best, we liked to join the movie better than the book ended. The scenery is just amazing and the soundtrack is a must. The fact that Jimmy Buffett has a small role and gives music is an added plus. Luke Wilson does a decent job in his role as Officer Delinko and is basically what I had mentally imagined that Delinko would look when I read the book. I'm surprised it didn't do better in the theaters, and I'm waiting for the DVD to come out.
