This seemed to be an unclear movie for me that confuses a low budget with poor filmography and not so much an editing work. It may be interesting for those who know something about submarines in World War II era, but I recommend that everyone else beware. Many of the scenes in this movie were flat, and some of the actors were a little weak. The story of the men being called back for service during a short vacation seems realistic enough, but there is no real pacing or tension in history. I also had a hard time understanding what the actors said, partly because of some strong English accents and maybe some due to a poorer audio recording job. I give this a 55/100. Most would like to "steer" clear.
