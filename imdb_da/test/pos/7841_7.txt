"The Beguiled" is a strange work among Clint Eastwood's oeuvre. In 1971, he became known as the star of action movie, not only Western (the genre where he first made his name), but also war movies (like "Where Eagles Dare") and cop thrillers (like "Coogan's Bluff"). Yet, although "The Beguiled" takes place during wartime (the American Civil War) and was made by Don Siegel, who had previously directed Eastwood to "Coogan's Bluff" and later was the same year leading him in "Dirty Harry", It is not an action movie in the traditional sense. In most of his previous films, Eastwood had played an active role, but here his role is highly passive. His character, Sergeant John McBurney, is a wounded refugee forced to rely on the woman's charity to survive. Even while serving with his unit, McBurney played no active role in the conflict; He is a Quaker whose religious principles forbid him to carry weapons and served with EU forces as a medical order. <br /> <br /> The movie is set in Louisiana towards the end of the war and starts with the injured McBurney, discovered by a young girl named Amy and brought back to her boarding school. The school is a small, with only two teachers and a handful of girls. Although some of the girls are diligent supporters of the Confederate cause and want to persuade him to the authorities, the capital Martha Farnsworth decides to adhere to him and tends to fear that his injuries are likely to prove fatal if sent to one of them. Confederacy's notoriously hard prison camps. <br /> <br /> Although McBurney carefully follows the teachings of his religion with regard to pacifism, he is not so careful about following his teachings about the adultery of sin, and when he begins to regain, he makes full use of his opportunity to exert her charm on both the employees and the older girls, and he wins the feelings of the number of them, including Miss Farnsworth, her assistant Edwina and Carol, one of the older girls. Even twelve-year-old Amy seems to have some kind of infatuation with him. In the sexually suppressed atmosphere of the entire female school, his presence causes jealousy and hatred, and Miss Farnsworth, rejected in favor of the cold Carol, draws a terrible revenge. (Interestingly, one woman is resisting McBurney's mixes, Hallie, Miss Farnsworth's black slave, though he tries to win his round by pointing out that he is fighting to free people like her). <br /> <br /> "Beguiled" has been described as an anti-war film, but it seems to me to be a misunderstanding. The film is not just about the rights and injustices of the civil war or war in general. The only acts of violence we see are committed by non-combatants, and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge, not for the sake of the Confederate cause. It would be more accurate to see the movie as a drama about the psychological stresses that may be due to the particularities of the war. <br /> <br /> Initially, the school, located in a beautiful old antebellum mansion, seems like an island of peace in the midst of the war. The building is in classic style associated with order, harmony and restraint, but the story unfolding within its walls is one of suffering, passion and violence, qualities associated with the Gothic writing school, which in the 19th century often became regarded as the classics' antithesis. The film can be seen as falling within what has been called the "South Gothic" tradition in American film and literature. <br /> <br /> The movie wasn't a good hit at the box office, possibly because Eastwood was thrown so much against the type. It may not be his best movie, but it showed he could expand his reach and play something other than action heroes. (In "Play Misty for Me" made his first film as a director the following year, he was again playing a "passive" character at risk from a vindictive woman). There are some very good performances from the struggled women, especially Geraldine Page like Martha Farnsworth, outwardly a respectable middle-aged spinster but inside a woman with strong passions. (There are hints that she might have had an affair with a man as she passed by as her brother). There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Hartman as it shy, suppressed Edwina, who falls in love with McBurney and rejects the idea of ​​revenge and of young Pamelyn Ferdin as Amy. (Amy is a wildlife - a key moment in the movie comes when McBurney kills his pet turtle - so it's interesting that Ferdin later became an animal rights activist). The one sign I was less interested in was Jo Ann Harriss Carol, who seemed too modern, like a swinging seventies that was transported back in the time to the 1860s. The film is known for the emotionally intense "hothouse" atmosphere that Siegel brings to it. This will not be a movie that is to everyone's taste; some will find it too exaggerated and melodramatic, and some have found it misogynistic. (Judith Crist called it a movie for "women hate and sadists"). Others may find it a compelling psychological drama. 10.7
