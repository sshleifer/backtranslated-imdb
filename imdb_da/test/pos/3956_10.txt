I had the chance to see Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it immensely. I thought it was one of the most captivating movies I had seen for a long time. One of the best points in the movie was to meet new fresh faces and amazing actors behind them unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great places. The three heroes share a chemistry on the screen that runs across the film, making it so exciting. They're put on excellent landscapes spotted by such an original eye (DOP's work is just amazing) that makes you feel like you're discovering them for the first time. The wilderness's mood is flooded everywhere, and even the scenes recorded on the streets of Los Angeles or San Francisaco seem to be a natural extension of it. History rides you evenly through all those beautiful settings to lead you to a bittersweet end, which is the perfect climax for this perfect journey. The construction of the film itself is a championship. The skillful use of innovative resources (like still images that sew Danny's memories in the movie) will compare with the handmade pieces work so rarely and so much fun. Blind Spot achieves the essence of the desert that takes you to a universal common ground where some of us may feel both discoverer and native.
