I love this show. I hate when it comes to season finals because it feels like always until the season starts again !! I've been following this show since his pilot so all the way threw away from where rusty college starts and see Casey his sister for now where he dates Dana .. love this show can't wait till Monday night !! Also I am so happy that cappie and Casey finally came together again who drove me crazy !!! As for Evan and Rebecca, I hope they will come together again, as it just feels like they will at the final. I just looked up on the main part of the cast, and I am so thrilled that Casey Cartwright (Spencer Grammar) is Kelsey Grammar's daughter !!! It surprises me just as much, and the other one that is a big SHOCKER is that she was born the same year as me and that she was born on my baby brother's birth date with my year and I had looked at her all the time and had no idea !!
