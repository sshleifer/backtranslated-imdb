The Andrew Davies adaptation of Sarah Waters novel was excellent. The characters of Nan and and Kitty were decorated by Rachael Stirling and Kelley Hawes respectively. The whole series was a total joy to see. It captured the imagination of everyone across the table, whether straight or homosexual. I wish there could be a sequel!
