The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting and I was really sold at the mother-daughter relationship. It is a family history that is not dulled by frills and special effects; a story of how it really is. I couldn't help but sigh at the end of this movie, unfortunately it is a well-told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating to family and friends. The action was pretty exquisite, and I hope we will see both Portman and Sarandon in familiar roles on the road ...
