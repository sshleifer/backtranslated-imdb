I've always seen Sean Connery, but as James Bond I've always favored Roger Moore. Still, it was Connery who set the Bond standard, and while he had established himself in 1983 as something other than James Bond, the money must have been irresistible to him to make a look more like 007 and save the world from Specter's evil design. <br /> <br /> And what designs they are in Never say never again. SPECTER using a stupid young air force officer who happens to be Kim Bassinger's brother, stole two nuclear missiles during a war game exercise and now SPECTER led by Blofeld played here by Max Von Sydow threatens extortion of the world. <Br /> <br /> Von Sydow's operation man is Klaus Maria Brandauer, who also hips Bassinger and is a bit on the crazy side. And he has a female assassin working for him in Barbara Carrera, who does Angelina Jolie when Nora Croft looks like Mrs. Butterworth. <br /> <br /> But before Sean Connery can get himself started, he'll have to deal with a new 'M' run of British intelligence. Edward Fox thinks Connery is old fashioned in his methods and costs British taxpayers too much money with his violent ways. I really enjoyed Fox's performance, he is like the great grandson of Colonel Blimp. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed Carrera, she is something to look at and quite resourceful in her methods. When she shows up with Connery in the Bahamas, notice how she sets Mr. Shark in 007's case. Will Connery make James Bond again? He was very quoted as saying who would they throw him as at this time, Roger Moore's father? But I think Connery would still be formidable in a wheelchair.
