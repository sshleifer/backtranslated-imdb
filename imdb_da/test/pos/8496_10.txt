This is one of the best movies I've seen this year. I took myself to a new time and place. It was like I was there with Ray through his many trials and triumphs. Jamie Foxx turned to Ray. During the film, he was Ray. Also, Kerry Washington, Sharon Robinson and Regina King were excellent. The movie was well thrown and fixed, the music was amazing. I've seen the movie four (4) times with different people, and the last time was just as entertaining as the first time. I will buy the DVD as soon as it is released. This is a movie that is seen over and over again in the coming years. <br /> <br /> Thank you for a great experience.
