(Some spoilers) Because of a life crisis and received his marriage with Cindy, Teddi Siddall, who seemed to have more to say about what he was doing and where he stayed then when Air Force, USAF elite Red Beret Sgt. Major Davis Bay, Gary Cole, decided one morning just to get away from it all and start a new life as a civilian. <br /> <br /> David first got this idea when he met at a Halloween party sweet and adore Alyson, Karen Sillas. Keeping her background secret from her by telling Alyson that he is in a secret military outfit, was the perfect cover for him. Back at Jackson AFB outside Austin Tex, David begins to review his life's abilities with Cindy and USAF and decide to change his identity by running away from it. David then calls Alyson, who only met him once and makes a date with her. Before you know, David, now using the name Haywood, is engaged to married her. <br /> <br /> Faking his death in a bicycle accident Dave deliberately leaves his wife and children in the cold and deserts his military commitment to his country. It didn't take long for Dave to find out that civilian life just doesn't appeal to him. It's too late now, because Dave goes back to his first wife Cindy and his two boys with him to the brig and a military court if he comes back to the USAF. Dave takes the only work he can do to support him and Alyson and their infant Chris: by means of his abilities he learned in Red Berets to rob banks. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story "Lies He Told", Dave Bay / Haywood has live three, not two, different lives. One of a hardworking family one as a ruthless bank robber and another as dead and very decorated by US President and Prime Missnister of GB, American hero. Gary Cole is very effective as both Master Sgt. David Bay & husband David Haywood. David's actions, while unforgivable, are understandable in the event of his depression over his marriage to Cindy. The pressure from her nagging him came to the point where he just wanted to get lost and away from her and the kids. But he should have sought professional advice from the US Air Force, which he would happily have had, instead of choosing the easy way out. Which ultimately leads him into Levenworth Ferderal Prison. It might have been that the excessively macho Dave thought it would have been a bad sign of his career as well as his ego getting help on his problems. Karen Sillas as Alyson is the glue holding the movie together with her initially along with her new husband's explanation of his frequent disappearances, some in as much as two weeks, as he conceals action to keep the country safe from domestic and foreign terrorists. The real reason for his long absence was the result of planning and robbing banks. Which was the only way he knew how to make a living for life from what he learned in subversive actions, all these years in the elite Red Berets. <br /> <br /> Alyson tracks down Dave's mother Carolyn Bay (Linda Goranson) whom he told her was dead since he was a little boy, in Portland she finds the truth about the double or triple life he has been leading since he married her. This led Alyson to find out about her marriage with Linda and the two sons he had with her as well as his fake death, and now AWOL from USAF. Being it is a true story, the end was something that you would have guessed to be in a standard Hollywood, or made for television, movies. That's what makes the movie "Lies He Told, Much Better Than You Would Expect to Be.
