This is ten times better than "Who Wants To Be A Super Model" in Bravo I think it's more true for the company. Tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and is able to make the most of every aspiring model. The images look for depth in each of the models, in personality and beauty, strength and demure attributes, and the ability to endure and work for what they want. I enjoy watching Tera's personal experience brought into the photo shoots and on the runway. I do not always agree with the judges' decision or Tera's comments, and at least one of the winners I feel does not deserve to win. But this is just a show, and every girl who is very lucky to have this chance.
