I loved this movie! Markie Post is really good at it. I saw it all my life and it is in the same entertaining class as movies like: 'The Betty Broderick Story', 'Locked Up: A Mother's Rage' etc. .... (which, incidentally, is also very good, entertaining movie!} It's an over-the-top drama about a single mother trying to break away from her middle-class predictable personality. This movie is just plain entertainment! It doesn't have to be a realistic look at heroin addiction, but it shows how every "regular" middle class person can (and they do!) become addicted to heroin Junkies are not just homeless untrained people on the street. {By the way, if you look at it, check out how the child bosses his mother around! Spoiled!} 8 out of 10 stars.
