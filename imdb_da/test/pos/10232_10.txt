Why didn't this movie criticize ?? I do not understand it. This is easily my favorite Clive Barker bet. "Hellraiser" is a bit too rough around the edges (the film never leaves the stupid house) and let's see, "The Lord of the Illusion" doesn't even move !!! I have loved Barker's writing for years, especially his "Books of Blood". Terrifically entertaining. He has a vicious side to him that is quite unlike a Stephen King. He freely interferes with his own homosexuality and odd religious and occult elements. I love love love love it. However, I am also aware that Barker is as much a dark fantasy writer as he is a horror writer. And imagination is just not my bag. Sets me the right to sleep. Always have. I also think that Barker works best with short stories. His novels tend to wander a little. It was my experience when I tried to read "The Damnation Game". It started well. Then I thought about 100 pages on "where is it going?" because it didn't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> I read "Cabal" (the book Nightbreed was based on) and thought it was good. I am thinking in particular of the deepening of Decker's character. The way the mask spoke to him and controlled him. I like the way Barker simply presents it. Black and white. There it is. He gives it a simplicity that is attractive and trustworthy. When asked why Decker is killing, he says (simply) "Because I like it". Probably something Jeffrey Dahmer said at some point. <br /> <br /> But I really liked the movie Nightbreed better than Cabal. I love the visual attention to detail that Barker gives to his films. ADORE IT. I think it's just beautiful. The Lord of Illusions also had some of this. Some of the drawings in the beginning, under Nightbreed's credit sequence. It's like a whole vocabulary, Barker just dreamed of the Nightbreed world. I would be curious to know how very clean his design was. I know he is an AMAZING artist who has his own style and language as an artist. Nightbreed is also (I think) BArker's most entertaining movie. It moves very quickly. Well edited. It does not draw as the Lord of Illusions does a little bit. Very fast. Everything in it is just perfect. It also seems like a fantastic and scary little slasher movie. Things with the killer in the beginning to kill the family and later plague the old man in the shop are really scary things. The mask is scary. I would be curious to know if Barker designed it too. It's not just a hokey Jason or "Scream" type mask. Something about it is really disturbing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a good flick. Check it for sure if you haven't seen it. Highly recommended. One of my favorite horror movies all the time. In my opinion, Clive BArker is the best. However, it is scary and violent, warned
