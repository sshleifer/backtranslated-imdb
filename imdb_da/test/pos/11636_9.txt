Okay. To enjoy this silent comedy card, you must suspend disbelief with the great starting point of the movie. If you can't then you will probably be more likely to score this movie much lower. Charlie Chase has a big overbit and his wife has a nose big enough to have her own area code. Unknown to each other, they both saved to get surgery to fix these errors. Apparently, plastic and dental surgery was better back in the 1920s because it also didn't seem to need to recover from these major surgeries, and they just saw dandy right away !! Okay, remember I said ignoring this, right? Okay, you must also ignore the hard-to-believe that both could meet and have no idea, the other is their spouse. Okay, now that you allowed yourself to accept these two stupid premises, the movie really gets really good. Charlie makes a passport for her and she makes a passport for him. Both are shocked and excited because no one has ever seen them attractive. So because of this new vanity they agree to go on a date. But they both sneak home - not wanting their spouses to know! In any case, they meet later and are attracted to each other. But what about the poor spouses supposedly at home? Well, they both learn that the other is married and both expect their marriages to result in divorce because they really want to be together! Recently in the movie Charlie draws out that the woman really is his wife, and he goes through a very fun sequence where he plays both the boyfriend and the old man - by changing clothes and putting false teeth when playing her hubby! It is really a ridiculous uprising to see him jumping in and out of space as he seems to be fighting with another person! You really have to see it to believe it. However, the wife sees an ad with Charlie's before and after pictures and knows what is happening. Eventually they both feel pretty silly!
