Without a doubt, GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of "AAA" level stars and musicians ever gathered for a fun, "G" -shared family adventure. This is a MUST BUY for every video collection! Director BARRY TUBB skillfully combines the rodeo / 4H competition for the "GRAND CHAMPION" cow with a touching and fun story of endurance against difficult challenges. Joey Lauren Adams delivers its typical solid performance as the well-meaning mother, but the star of the show is the 12-year-old EMMA ROBERTS whose presence on the camera is glowing like her famous aunt, JULIA. You can expect much from this young Roberts protégé 'who is already appearing in his new hit Nickelodeon series, "UNFABULOUS."
