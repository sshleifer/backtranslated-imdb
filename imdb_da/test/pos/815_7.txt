"Blind Date" is one of three stories-made-in-movie by author Vida Hurst. Lots of familiar faces in this 1934 oldie. Mickey Rooney as a cheerful little punk. He seems to be in the movie for comic and domestic "family values". Jane Darwell again plays the strong wild mother, just as she was angry with grapes and Oxbow Incident. Ann Sothern is Kitty who has been dating Bill (Paul Kelly), but meets with rich Bob Hartwell, played by Neil Hamilton, who may or may not be better for her. You can definitely tell that this was made right at the beginning of Hay's production code - at one point Kitty says she can't be up there alone with him if there is no one else in the house ... what a change from just a year or two earlier when everything was ok. Good solid plot, but a lot of conversation and green love conversation. It raises the question of what a girl should look for in a man; should she stick to a man of integrity who treats her lovely, or just find a man with big bucks, as most of the films from the previous 20 years had spoken for ... and how do men change when their situation changes? Beware of some violence in the strange dance marathon scene. Television viewers from the 1960s will recognize Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon from Batman ..... Also, some weird dramas on the screen live for some of the casts in it - Paul Kelly was imprisoned to be an accessory to murder in a love triangle . Mickey Rooney had an affair with Norma Shearer, who was 20 years older; Rooney ended up getting married eight times. Tyler Brooke (Emory) and Spencer Charters (Pa) both settled in real life. The title "Blind Date" has been reused many times, for movies, TV shows and even cartoons, but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one.
