While driving on a highway to his beloved Betty-Ann's wedding, Adam (Eric Jungmann) is surprised by his former schoolmate Harley (Justin Urich) in the back seat of his car. Adam has broken the harsh and moron Harley because of Betty-Ann. Along their drive, Harley makes fun with some rednecks in a bar and later their car is chased by a huge monster car on the road. After some incidents, they give the lift Sarah (Aimee Brooks), and before that the trio is terrorized by a scary monster running the monster wagon. <br /> <br /> Despite having one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a horror movie, the annoying Harley, "Monster Man" is a surprisingly good garbage comedy. The story is a collection of clich√©s that begin as "Joy Ride" or "Duel"; then it becomes one of the countless rip-offs of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"; There is a surprising twist that ends with a hook for a sequel. There are hilarious scenes, Aimee Brooks is extremely sexy, and this movie really entertains. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Monster Man"
