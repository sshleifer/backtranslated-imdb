Kite Runner is undoubtedly one of the most amazing books I've read in recent times. I might have very high expectations from the movie, but nevertheless the movie was good, the whole setting seemed realistic. nothing was done to make the dialogues not very attractive or powerful, they were just right. The movie was not a bad experience at all, especially in the last 15 minutes, when it became really emotional, and even the hardest man would cry. But my imagination was far better than the movie ... I shouted more after reading the novel than watching the movie. but generally a good movie to watch for those of you who are not readers. but the readers - the short story would be a better experience, so if you want to see the movie at all, read the short story first and then compare it to the movie.
