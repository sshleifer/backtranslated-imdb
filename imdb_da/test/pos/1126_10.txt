... I can't believe I was hooked on this show immediately after seeing the first scene I was in it deeply. <br /> <br /> Still, guys are mostly hot, Cappy, Evan, Calvin, Fischer, Cappy, Heath, Cappy etc. <br /> <br /> Second, the girls are cute, sexy, smart and are not afraid to be called bitches. I like that. Which at the same time does not make them bad and greedy, just realistic. <br /> <br /> Third, conditions are so great, especially Casey and Cappy. In the end, each show is very far from the original path, and people end up with someone who wasn't even in the first season. Cappy and Casey's relationship is true love, a kind that lasts. They loved each other over the years and it did not end when a guest star appeared. <br /> <br /> In today's world, it may be a little incredible for two people to love each other for a long time, but it happens. And people define each other in college so I knew exactly who I wanted to attend college. Like Casey and Cappy. <br /> <br /> I hope there are many more seasons in this show and I hope we can see the relationship between CASEY and CAPPY NOW that they will stay safe together at Thanksgiving ... Love this show
