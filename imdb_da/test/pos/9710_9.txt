Yes. Bam cried a few times, and Englund did too. And probably you will too. The whole cast is back in action, and Knoxville is stepping up to become the true leader of this gang of spoiled retarder (I mean this in the best possible way). I thought at first, maybe Bam or Steve-O were the most important go-to guys .... no, the principal is now Johnny. Don't make me wrong, everyone, and I think everyone is good in this flick! Right from the get-go, you laugh and believe in me, don't plan to rest your smile on you. Personally, I think the movie certainly has better moments than the first. You know when you go into a theater and you kind of won't have high expectations for it ..... Well, this movie blows away all expectations. If you love Jackass, you can go into this with gigantic expectations. Whatever you want to laugh at your ass. If you don't laugh, the reason is probably someone who has a gun in your face that tells you if you laugh or you're embarrassed by the sound of your laugh or the highest probability is that you ate Jack sh! T for breakfast and Jack left town. All I have to say is prepare yourself to have a tender face after the movie. :)
