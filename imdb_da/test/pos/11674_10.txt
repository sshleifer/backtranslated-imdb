Spheeri's debut should be one of the best music documentaries from all the time. And as far as I know, it is also the only one focusing on L.A. Punk Explosion from the early 1980s. It's all: Not just big, big bands like black flag, fear, x, germs, whose names might not mean much to you today, but whose influence on today's alternative rock music cannot be overlooked, but also the promoters, the media and first Mostly the audience - the punk - all portrayed in a way that makes you laugh, shake and forget the astonishment of energy, anger, and rage that these young people put into their music. Where is it today? The 80s may have sucked great time as it cames to mainstream music, but the underground rocked. If you need a proof of that, see Fear's performance in Decline. Unbeatable. Great film! How is this not available on vid, LD or DVD? P. S. Follow-up Reject Pt. II is also fun
