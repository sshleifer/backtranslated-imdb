What is there to say about "Pink Flamingos"? It's without criticism or even explanation because it doesn't really strive to be like any other movie you've seen. You will either get it or you will not laugh at it or roll your eyes in disgust (or both). John Waters is a strange filmmaker (puts it mildly), blends both innocent, childish humor with shocking offensive moments meant for ... who knows what his intentions were. It's like a form of assault, albeit a fun one. The thing that makes Waters humor so contagious and effective is that his character resides in a world that can seem alien and completely known to the viewer, as the petty rival, who plots the "Pink Flamingos". Certainly everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point or another, but almost certainly the matter was not at stake "The Filthiest Person Alive". What makes the movie convincing to me is the way Waters creates spooky, self-contained environments and doesn't take you into the joke right away. The people in his film are completely in line with each other. For example, when Cotton tells Babs that she doesn't want to accompany her into the city because Crackers brings her "lady friend" out on the trailer, Babs reacts with a familiar smirk and says to her in a conspiracy page: "Little shed is just perfect ... "At this point, we do not yet know that Crackers is planning to take his" lady friend "out to the shed to put live chickens in her naked body, while Cotton looks orgasmically through a window, but this wonder is quite common and understood by the characters of the fictitious degenerate world that Waters creates. <br /> <br /> Another example would be the talks between the girls in the basement and Channing, Marble's deviant butler. The first time we see them, Waters sharply cuts from a scene in Connie's cozy office to Channing into the basement, where we see that there are two women down there, one dead and one very alive and dead. Susan is not a cowering victim, but is furious and insulting to Channing and jumps up to launch a full-blown verbal attack on her prison. They both have a strange understanding of the bizarre situation, and she is not so scared of her kidnapping as she is violently insulted and justly furious. She does not charge for a second while Channing is in her eyes, and the two scenes that have their frightening banners are two of the movie's comic highlights. Later in the movie, when Divine and Crackers break into the marble's home and discover their crimes of keeping abducted women in their basement, it represents the total lack of support that divine and her family have for the brand of corruption that marbles pander - There is something divine unknown to, a corruption conceived by her newfound rivals, and she despises it. Moreover, while kidnapping does not resemble anything that divine would think twice about, she is worried that the girls are being held down there and delighting them freely and restoring the raising they take on Channing. The other end of the filth spectrum reminds Waters of the line between his winding fantasy world and the "real" world. The first time we see Connie, she is a small person named Sandy Sandstone who has never heard of divine. Cookie, on the other hand, reacts with a hilarious appraisal of the divine title as the "horrifying person alive" and reveals that she resides in this world of unspoken and understood lunacy as well. <br /> <br /> Something must also be said about how players are in contact with their respective roles, especially Divine, who does not miss a note. Not even does he fall into the ridiculous rattle and character he's got, and it takes "Pink Flamingos" to a new level or weird. In fact, people believed that Divine was like this in real life, and it is easy to understand why, because while watching the movie, you are not really thinking about the movie you are thinking of those people who did it. As they really do the outrageous things in the script, you start to think it may not be a story but a bizarre documentary. But even more, "Pink Flamingos" is not as much a movie as it is an event or something that happens to you. Although its shock value is mostly gone for me now (I say mostly because a ** -hole scene and the chicken scene still make me hint), I still find this movie to be fun and habit-forming.
