The book is better than the movie, mainly because of the author Ondatjes prosa. Before I saw this movie, someone who had seen it says that the love depicted in this movie is not right. After watching this movie, I can see how her suspension of disbelief in this regard could have been distracting to other movie guests. Frankly, some of the intense love pictures were frightening and appear to be on the verge of parody. But in the end, everyone must realize that this is a great message of work of art. It is not specifically about love at all; it uses "love" to dialectically reveal the human divide or the arbitrary boundaries of countries that help justify wars and hatred. It's about misunderstandings and the blind sequel to the things that seem to separate us. The critical scene of the real theme of this movie is when the hero or anti-hero's reasons for helping his stranded lover in the desert are ignored and ignored for the reasons shown in that scene. This film is also about hope and forgiveness, hoping the epitome of the interracial relationship between Binoch's restorative character and the Indian minesweeper (echoing in Sikh's buddy friend's relationship with his white colleague who ends up dying mortally) and the forgiveness epitome of the Caravaggio character's first quest and then forcing out what he believes will be the heroes' confessions of his war "crimes" (treason of land). I think the movie could have been made even better than it is. I do not know if a more realistic depiction of love's circumstances would have made the real themes and points of this movie even more obvious or not, but I agree this movie is not about realistic romantic love, as the people behind this art or movie involves an early stage when the final lovers first meet. The hero tells about how a new car, used car, fast car, etc. (I switch) is still a car, no matter what adjective you put in front of it. She responds, but the parents' love, platonic love, romantic love, etc. Is very different kind of love. This is ironic because this film is really about the one love that all people must have, which is love for (or for) peace (not materialistic things, which are usually the real causes of wars, the epitome of something that most of We want as "cars", let's say). Otherwise, we may be left to die in a hole in a large desert with antiques and swimmer drawings, suggesting that the seas and the life-supporting waters that once existed have all disappeared. I think "The English Patient" won the Oscar because of these great messages, not specifically for its depiction of romantic love. Prizes tend to go that way. The relationship between the hero and the heroine was necessary to attract the audience. Unfortunately, this love vision can be obsolete in the age of divorce and so many singles who cannot seem to come together in so many levels, so ridiculous versions of mythical love are hard to get into even in daydream, which love of film has always been, especially in good old Hollywood. The movie may fall below what people expect, but a 7 out of 10 movies are worth watching, regardless.
