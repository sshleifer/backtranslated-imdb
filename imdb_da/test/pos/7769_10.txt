Love Jones is one of the best movies I've experienced. <br /> <br /> The main element sticking out to me is that it is very well run. I have studied this movie in its entirety - watching movies more than once, starting some things on you unknowingly - the direction of this movie as well as the letter is chic, hip and artful! I'm in love with the direction. The scene in which Larenz Tate and Nia Long drive the motorcycle through northern Chicago at night is amazing. The director of this movie deserved prizes for his great work. <br /> <br /> Love Jones is a stylish and sexy movie. It highlights the fact that we can be people who love who have mistakes who love to live, learn and just be us without hype. Being our natural self. The poetry is wonderful, but the story line, the dialogue and the scenes really make this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves to be seen. It's a great movie for lovers and friends to sit back and watch, or the hopeless romantic (like myself) to sit back and enjoy alone on a Friday or Saturday night. Every day of the week where peace, loneliness, and a little entertainment are needed, love Jones is what I recommend.
