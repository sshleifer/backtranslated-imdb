I don't think I've ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is crazy. Every time I see it, I find something new, and it makes it even more fun than before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a large and unexpected ending that leaves you blowing. Each character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed all the way through and will never get tired of it. See it !! <br /> <br /> If you liked the Cary Elwes in this movie, definitely see The Princess Bride.
