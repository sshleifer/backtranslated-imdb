I stumble upon this movie by chance. I traveled a few years back and this movie was on a channel on cable at the hotel late one night. Not much else and I expect to see it in approx. 20 to 30 minutes until I decided to go to bed. Needless to say, I stopped and saw the complete movie. The reason was very interesting and makes you wonder if there had been no SS who did this or at least thought about doing it. I've been watching this movie. I even sent an email to the production company, but they were not sure it would ever make it to the DVD, but said there was always hope. If anyone finds this movie, drop a note here where you found it that I would like a copy a day.
