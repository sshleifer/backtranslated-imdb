I play this game exactly when I see the trailer in the old magazine, advertise the CD ... It's very interesting and dark atmospheric (missing games / movies today). The game is set somewhere in the mid 90's in the spooky mysterious mansion. You play as Adam Randell, and your quest is to free the soul of your deadly father. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the game is doom-like but very different type of game. A lot of action, different puzzles, quests, mazes and many more interesting places and characters are featured in this ancient classic game. The game will only run on Windows 98 and there is no patch for Windows XP.
