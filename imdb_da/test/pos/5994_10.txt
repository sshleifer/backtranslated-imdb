I walk slowly through as many Hong Kong action movies as I can get my hands on and come across this gem - mainly because of Ching Wan Lau, who is one of my favorite actors. It's a big action movie, but not like the OTT that the title might suggest. It moves at a great pace and is really fun. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise of this movie was the soundtrack. It seems that Rob Dougan - the guy who made the 'Clubbed To Death' song, which was popular in 'The Matrix', has lifted the soundtrack from Big Bullet and put it in one of the tracks on his 'Furious Angels' album ; the song in question is called 'I no longer run' and is also the opening for the TV series 'Law and Order' AND the opening track on 'Matrix Reloaded' DVD menu teaser! It really surprised me because of the sheer coincidence!
