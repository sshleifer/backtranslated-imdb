The "silver screen" is freshly polished with this beautiful film of aging happily and enjoying the rainbow of life. There is plenty of silver hair on this silver screen, but the film's namesake is more like 85-on-25 with its energy, humor and desire for life. The story of the entertainer's extraordinary uncle Frank, his devoted wife Aunt Tillie and the zippy residents of the local area nursing home inspire us to "live every day as if it were your last" and bring a glimpse of hope to the often terrible golden years. A great movie for young and old audiences!
