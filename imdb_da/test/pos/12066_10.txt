This show is widespread in brilliant. It is a modern day married to children. The scriptures are witty as they are sprinkled with clever sarcasm. They are also realistic, dealing with issues facing many parents of teenagers today. In addition to the ongoing burden, you may not be the world's largest parent and how is the best way to do it? But at the same time, it succeeds in remaining light hearted and fun. Which with all the drama and actions on television these days is a very pleasant and welcome change. It's something you can sit in front for 30 minutes and relax, laugh and relate to. It's not the world's most hilarious comedy. But still you make fun of at least a handful of times an episode. Michael Rapaport is brilliant in the lead as Dave. He fills the big shoes that the highly sarcastic script requires, and then some. He and Anita Barone (Vikki) have fantastic chemistry and jump off each other very well. This show has a strong future if it is marketed by the right audience and sets the right time slot. Also, if Fox releases it on DVD, the following becomes stronger and bigger. (As is a classic example of Scrubs.)
