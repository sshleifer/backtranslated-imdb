By watching this movie I didn't expect much. I was wonderfully surprised. Although the writing was unpolished, as some of the dialogues seemed drawn and constructed, the script had shining moments. (My favorite line, "Life is like a rich meringue, one - and I'm diabetic, so I can't enjoy it ...".) The reason was new and refreshing as opposed to some of the more recent "main" streams As most of us are (unfortunately) accustomed to. I think some of the scenes could (should) have been longer (and perhaps some shorter). The redundant use of blood was campy, but seemed to make sense in the end. ... Oh, the end. The end would have been a little better if they had explained why what happened was happening. (I don't want to spoil it.) It could also have added the movie time that is in the area "it's just one How long could it be? "Answer-quite well.
