I caught this movie on the Sci-Fi channel recently. In fact, it turned out to be pretty decent, as far as B-list horror / suspense films go. Two guys (a naive and a loud mouth a **) take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a lunatic in a freaky, make-shift tank / truck hybrid decides to play cat and mouse with them. Things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously hitchhitch hitchhiker. What makes this movie unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually works in this movie, unlike so many others. The two guys are sympathetic enough and there are some good hunting / excitement scenes. Nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than acceptable for horror / slasher buff. Definitely worth checking out.
