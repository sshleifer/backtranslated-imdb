Isabelle Huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. "La Pianiste" really confirms it. As if it wasn't enough, Annie Girardot's mother plays and Annie Girardot is one of her greatest actresses or any other generation. So, as you may well imagine, the pieces of casting are worth the horror we get put through. Isabelle and Annie play characters we've never seen before on the screen. A mother and daughter yes, but with such virulent fearlessness that I sometimes couldn't blink or breathe. Personally, I do not believe in the director's intentions, I do not think they (the intentions) go beyond the shocking anecdote and the end made me scream with frustration, but I was riveted by the story written in the face of sensational Huppert and the strong Girardots strength. I highly recommend it to movie lovers anywhere and to the collectors of amazing performances like me, you can't afford to miss "La Pianiste"
