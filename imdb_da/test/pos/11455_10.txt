This movie surprised me. The open credit sequence contains nicely finished animation. Then we are thrown into a semi-cheesy production that betrays its low budget. The characters, typical American teens, are introduced slowly, with more personal details than usually found in movies like this one. When the shlitz hits the tab, we know each of the characters, and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities. It's a slow uphill, like a walk up a slope of a really high slide. Luckily, when the action kicks in, the full blown old school is HORROR! Steve Johnson's make-up effects are awesome. Right in quality for much larger budgeted movies. And the scares are jolting. Kevin Tenney delivers his best movie ever, with heartbeat surprises and spooky thrills. The tongue-in-cheek, sometimes cheesy, humor marks this movie as the horror of 80's, as opposed to the expensive tone of previous genre ticket like "The Living Dead" or "Hills Have Eyes". But for real horror fans, it is worth checking out here. Play it as the first entry on a dual bill with the 1999 remake of "House on the Haunted Hill." The set-up and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what movie they actually referred to?
