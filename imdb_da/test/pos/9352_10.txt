What a great movie! Unfortunately, in 1947, the screenplay could not have followed the book from which it was adapted, but the murder of a homosexual would have been too hot to handle in that time. <br /> <br /> I thought all the performances were excellent, as well as the manuscript, the direction, the brilliant black and white filmography, the music and the film noir atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I understand that in 1947, the film could not portray racism against blacks or prejudices against homosexuals. (Robert Young's account of prejudice against his grandfather, who was Irish and who endured this racism 100 years ago, was rather paralyzed, but times dictated that the film avoids a further study of racism.) <br /> <br /> I have an observation and a question to ask the viewer: 1. Have you noticed that Robert Young did not measure his gun when he shot and killed Robert Ryan, who ran fast in the dark and Young shot from an upper story window into the dark without aims? 2. If Robert Young's grandfather was killed 100 years ago in 1847 (the film was made in 1947) and Young was 40 years old, the timeline would not be logical. If the grandfather had been killed 50 years ago, the time frame was realistic.
