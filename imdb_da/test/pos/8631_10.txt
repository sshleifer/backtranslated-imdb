Although copies of this movie are hard to find if you can find it, get it !! !!! I think this was, except I Navy, Abbott and Costello's only musical. Although they twisted the plot a little, (I never heard a version where the butcher goes up with him), you still enjoy the antics of the somewhat idiotic, but lovable Jack, and the greedy butcher, Mr. Dinklepuss. A little reminiscent of DuBarry Be a lady, this incredible movie will make you roll on the floor - just to get up and dance as Lou Costello sings. (I don't know why they didn't do it in other movies.)
