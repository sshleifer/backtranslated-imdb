It's the promise of the trailer I saw and where I rented Hitch. Exactly, a serious filmmaker must not expect much further from this title, but surprisingly, Smith, Mendes, James and Valletta managed to reach a theater performance that could be metaphorically summed up in their rap dance yellow routine before the end of the movie: their characters formed a effective combo that can give more than a good laugh with this Sunday afternoon DVD, as your date is not an exquisite French-Swedish-director-of-the-60s movie fan. <br /> <br /> PS: The techniques to score are all TRUE, especially the "cocktail girl" routine!
