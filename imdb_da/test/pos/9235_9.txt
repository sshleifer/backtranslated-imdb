This movie shows you don't need a Hollywood budget to do something fun to watch. What stuck with me is how the crew from different places were able to pull together without the promise of wealth to do something just because they believed in it. I think anyone making low-cost movies can relate to certain scenes like actors who just can't get one line, get alarmed by the police, and make most of the crew disappear after the first week. No one was paid for this, which says a lot to the people who had to travel across the country and for the long hours spent editing. Having seen Stuie selling his personal property, using his own money and waste his house to make the movie, I'm a little curious how close his wife might have left. Good work for everyone.
