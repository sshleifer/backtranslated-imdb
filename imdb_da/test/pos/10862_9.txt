This wonderful 3-piece BBC production is one of the sweetest love stories I've seen for a while. The actors show a very high level of talent, especially Rachael Stirling as Nan Astley. She is fun, seductive and sweet. The love of making scenes and close-ups is very erotic, regardless of their sexual preference. <br /> <br /> The characters are well-defined and very credible. I think it's a by-product of a good fit from a well-written novel. <br /> <br /> A truly remarkably well-functioning drama that quickly picks up after a few boring (but necessary) scenes in the beginning. <br /> <br /> My vote: 9/10
