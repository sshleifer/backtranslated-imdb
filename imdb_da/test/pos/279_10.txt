In moments of desperation were willing to do all that is required to win. I loved how Maple Leave's futility was used as a metaphorical basis for Bobby and Tessa. The action was much better than the hogwash intake given to the film industry. <br /> <br /> Great editing! At the end of the short I felt it was a bit incomplete, but it is life, and it was life and art selection in a film work. <br /> <br /> Excuse me while rinsing out the cheese fish, but I guess it's acceptable at certain times. <br /> <br /> Two scenes that I must point out are: The bathtub and the sofa. The sofa for Tessa was a crucial moment and 360 of the human condition. Through the short I experienced her as a brutal, but now we see her true reality. Her mind spoke to her heart. Do I need to say more about the beach?
