This is a video version of a stage production with additional recording for the video edition. The result is both the stage drama with the effect of well-produced film. The set of George Tsypin, with sculptures and masks by Julie Taymor, is amazing. Jessye Norman is amazing and you hear (and see) the young Bryn Terfel. This production is fantastic, emotional and majestic. If you don't see this, you've missed it.
