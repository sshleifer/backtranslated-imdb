I have to say that I didn't expect much about this movie, but it didn't seem to be bad at all. Most striking was, of course, Aidan Quinn's performance. I would never expect to see this fine actor as a hero of action. The great thing about it is that he really builds his character (Annibal). I mean, it wasn't like Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis would do it, he was sensitive and modest. For example, he is really sad when he kills someone. I also noticed that some clich√©s were avoided. When Annibal gets her training, you would easily expect him to be rebel and act like any average American would in such a situation, ask what is going on and refuse to cooperate. But Annibal is a professional marine officer, he does not give up, and he does not try to lose his courage where he succeeds quite well, except for a brief crash on Christmas Eve, which I think was very realistic. I am glad that Aidan Quinn made this opportunity to show another side of him (actually two because he also plays the villain), even though the film was not so successful.
