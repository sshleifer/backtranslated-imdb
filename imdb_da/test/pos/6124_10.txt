You know the pun "the curiosity killed the cat"? Now I have heard so much about this movie, from a magazine called this of the most shocking movies from time to time, my 1001 movies, you must see before you die, my sister who saw this at a film festival, and I love the 70's show on VH1. I just had to watch this movie as it was called the biggest movie all the time, and well, having seen this movie last night, I have to say it really lived up to the title. My God, this movie was so weird! I thought I really saw it all with some of the sick movies and TV shows I've seen, some things I think will always feel like a shock. Well, Babs Johnson, aka Divine, has been named the most beautiful person alive and a jealous couple named marble competing for that title. They will take divine out and be named the destructive couple alive by kidnapping women, raping them, impregnating them, and selling their babies to lesbian couples. But it seems that divine and her family are well ... I do not know, seems to keep the title by having sex with chickens, synchronizing lips, eating dog sledding, filling meat on their skirts, incest, and it just gets coarser and coarser. <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos are terribly acted, terribly made and good, just horrible. The reason for the 10 rating I have to give is due to the fact, how could you judge this movie? I always judge, so I just count on what the heck? Through the gravity of the movies, do you have to give John Waters some credit, which the deed would ever think of this movie over 35 years later? To the cast and crew that worked on this movie, you are just pretty vague! <br /> <br /> 10/10
