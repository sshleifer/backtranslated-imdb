John Huston, actor and director, better known for more robust fare like "The Misfits" and "African Queen", instructs his daughter, Angelica Huston, in what would be his last movie. In fact, the film was released after Houston's death. Based on James Joyce's novel of the same name, "The Dead" tells the quiet story of a New Year's celebration in 1904 Dublin. Huston, his cast and his writers, including his son Tony, have created a gem of a movie. Novella is among Joyce's finest works (as well as being the only one to be filmed). The film is a tribute to Huston's genius. He has taken a small, beautiful story and made a small, beautiful film. Donal McCann and Angelica Huston shine (though "shine" is too flashy, too flashy a word to describe their silent, discreet performances). "The Dead" reflects the Huston family's love of Ireland and is, in its own quiet way, an appropriate final film for a legend.
