This movie is good. It seems that they used Tyrannosaurus Rex as a blown balloon, just as Gudzilla, perhaps back in the 60-70 days, the scientist has not received enough info. on all possible dinosaurs. Back at the time scientist is still doing dinosaur, I think this movie was based on a Tyrannosaurus Rex movement back in the 60s-70s. There is even a part where a giant stone, fired by someone at Tyrannosaurus Rex, damages Tyrannosaurus Rex and it struck out for a while. At the end, Tyrannosaurus Rex went back to search for food. There is also something wrong in the movie, like a rifle, how can a rifle kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex when it can be 1,000-5,000 stronger than we are. If this movie is going to make a remake, I suggest doing it more well and excitedly, because fortunately it looks like an old movie as a remake of it.
