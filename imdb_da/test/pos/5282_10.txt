It is rare for a movie to sweep you away in its world and let you have more when the credits roll. Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo is such a movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is the story of a young goldfish named Ponyo who wants to be human. She swims to shore and is found by a young boy named Sasuke, who promises to take care of her. Course Ponyo's father, an ecologically occupied wizard named Fujimoto, tries to keep Ponyo from becoming human in order to maintain the balance of nature, which eventually arises when Ponyo is finally transformed into a little girl causing a massive typhoon. <br /> Ponyo is a very rich film. It is full of wonderful imagination, lovable characters and true heart. What director Hayao Miyazaki has done here, tells a simple little story, while creating authentic film magic. Ponyo is an enchanting experience. The love between Sasuke and Ponyo is very clean and true. Also the environmental activist within Miyazaki is still so evident in this film as in all his previous works. Miyazaki shows dirt and dirt falling into the sea in an almost spectacular light, not to mention Ponyo's father is on an obsessive mission to clean the world's oceans. While the story is simple, Miyazaki manages to add this extra layer to provoke thought with expert knowledge. <br /> <br /> The film is a beautiful work of art; each hand-drawn cell resembles a wonderful pastel painting. The film looks much different than many other Studio Ghibli productions, but the artistry is still as spectacular as ever. The underwater scenes are simply beautiful to see, Fujimoto's underwater sea fortress is very inventive, and the order in which Ponyo runs over bouncing fish in the typhoon to reach Sosuke is iconic. <br /> <br /> The course is thanks to its wonderfully executed characters that make this movie a memorable experience. Sosuke is a young boy who seems older than he actually is, and the energetic Ponyo is a laugh for a moment. Each character is just so entertaining and very memorable. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ponyo is a wonderful experience, enchanting in every way. While the movie can be sold as a children's adventure, I think many adults will be swept away in their amazing world with their children. Although the movie may lack the density of some of Miyazaki's earlier works, he keeps it clean and simple, to be true to himself, to deliver a movie that is fun, cordial and entertaining all in one. This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I give Ponyo a perfect 10 out of 10!
