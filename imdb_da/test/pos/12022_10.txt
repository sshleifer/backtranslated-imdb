When commenting on this film, one must realize that it is based on a true story and must therefore be evaluated for the quality and accuracy of its depiction of events and its entertainment value. It might be impossible for Jack Shepherd to surrender twice to Jack Wild because Wild had caught Edgeworth Bess. Nevertheless, it happened. It should also be noted that the director was young and inexperienced, which explains why he trusted trusted techniques. There were occasions where Clavell did not trust to follow the script as written. The movie would be better if he had. And yes, I used to have a copy of the script (Stanley Baker's copy - one in five) that I recently returned to my father, Rafe Newhouse, the author.
