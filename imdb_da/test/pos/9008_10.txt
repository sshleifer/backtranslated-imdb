It helps that the characters on which this show is based are among the best Disney ever to be featured. Scripture is what really makes this show. It's a total classic. Given, you must appreciate the kind of humor to enjoy it and it's hard to explain. The mood is akin to the old school scenes from the 40s and 50s Disney, with modern spins. It never breaks down into free acts or anything of that kind. It's not sandal humor, even though I've had it. It is exactly the same humor in the movie, only extended to the time a television program allows. So if you didn't like it in the movie, you won't like it here, but the IMO Emperor's new track was the best thing to get out of Disney since Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> A +
