Like many situations, comedies become "The War at Home" better with each episode. The characters are starting to become real, and I believe them as a family. I agree with many that the first few episodes were not so funny; I thought the show would be canceled for sure. But with the absence of "Malcolm in the Middle" and "Arrested Development," "War" provides the much needed live action comedy to FOX on Sunday evenings. And compared to the rest of sitcom's airing right now, "war" is an even better choice. Her appeal, at least for me, lies in her real situations. Teenagers have sex. Not all parents like how their children look. Parents fight and call each other names. But instead of relying on being "average" as many shows, everything is fine at the end, which is the first rule in a good sitcom. A rejection from the show is the story during / between scenes. The "Arrested Development / Family Guy" style of flashbacks works well enough, but the story can be too much. So anyone who needs something to watch on Sunday evenings should check out "The War at Home" especially considering what's on the other big networks at that time.
