Excellent entry into the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, great management to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the stream constant and good acting. George Sanders is suave and witty. Jonathan Hale is simply Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he can't take the pressure. He returns in a later entry into the series. The story begins on an ocean liner heading to the United States, where Saint encounters, but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie. She eventually succumbs to Saint's charms, but she eventually breaks her heart. Saint Helper Inspector Fernack clears his name from a frame. A few bodies fall along the way. Good entertainment and above average for this type of movie. See it.
