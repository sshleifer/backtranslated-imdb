The first Disney animated movie without the strong involvement of Disney itself, suffers from this movie that the story is not particularly original or interesting (that is, I think, the only animated Disney movie since the 1940s that is not based on a previous book or other work, but is rather an original story). As others have noted, the plot is essentially a cross between the romance of Lady and Tramp and the kidnapping / travel home of 101 Dalmatians. <br /> <br /> But to overcome this error, filmmakers have successfully used many of the better features of most of the previous 10-15 years of Disney animated films: Phil Harris (from The Jungle Book) voiced one of the main characters, his duet with Louis Prima follows the previous movie with another here with Scatman Crothers. The quality-visual look of this film is largely transferred from the "Dalmatians" (with some fine nodes to French impressionism, it seems), and the villain here (the butler) strongly resembles the handlords of that movie. (This is probably one of Disney's least memorable villains.) The main story goes back and forth between the cats and the butler's ongoing difficulties with two nationwide dog dogs (with great voice work by Pat Buttram and George "Goober" Lindsey "). known to those who have seen "Tramp" and "Dalmatians." The cat owner who bears a striking visual resemblance to the evil stepmother of Sleeping Beauty, does not carry any of this ugly character of this character and comes across as very warm and generous. Strength of the movie is voiced. After being used by the most famous actors in The Jungle Book, the tactics continue strongly here with Disney veterans Harris and Sterling Holloway from The Jungle Book and Eva Gabor (who would make a very similar character in the later movie The Rescuers), as well as Crothers and Nancy Kulp, all of whom are excellent here, especially Harris and Gabor in the leaders. and shows many different emotions. <br /> <br /> Smaller children may be disturbed by a few short episodes (an escape from the road to a speed track, an almost drowning at one of the kids), but these are not presented in a particularly scary or dark way and is over very fast. All in all, there are very few such scary scenes that are found in many other Disney classics. <br /> <br /> A minor marvel is the way some visual aspects of the 60s culture are depicted among the jazz-performing cats in allegedly 1910 Paris; One cannot wonder why the story was not laid down in the present, except the great Paris, Paris had changed much of its appearance in the intervening time. It would really have made more sense that way. The songs, while comfortable and sometimes very pleasantly done, are not very memorable. Nevertheless, the general energy used here contributes the excellent speech and fine animation to overcome the relatively few and minor weaknesses. Far from the magnitude of the classic "10" s such as Pinocchio or Aladdin, and not quite up to the 9 "s you can give to Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians, this is probably a fairly marginal 8 out of 10; 7th
