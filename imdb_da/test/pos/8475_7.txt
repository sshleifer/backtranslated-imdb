In recent years, a number of biopics of famous singers have been seen, and "Ray", the story of Ray Charles, has much in common with "Walk the Line", which was made the following year and told the story of Johnny Cash. Cash and Charles were exact contemporaries, both born in the early thirties and died in 2003/04. Both grew up in poverty in the American deep south. Both lost a brother in an accident in childhood. Both achieved success in the 1950s. Both experienced problems in their marriages, and both were addicted to drugs. All these issues are underlined in both films. There are also similarities to Ron Howard's "A Beautiful Mind". Although this film was about a mathematician rather than a musician, it emphasized, as both "Ray" and "Walk the Line," the role played by her professional to help her husband overcome her problems. <br /> <br /> Ray Charles was born to a single mother in a poor black community in Georgia in 1930. (His original name was Raymond Charles Robinson, but when he began his career as a musician, he dropped his surname to Avoid confusion with boxer Sugar Ray Robinson). Somehow Charles had an even harder time than Cash, and he had to face two further disadvantages in terms of his blindness and racism, which hit all black Americans, especially in the South, during his lifetime. Charles had a particularly traumatic childhood that witnessed his younger brother Georges death in a drowning accident and went blind in a year or two later. He seems to have been haunted by nightmares and guilty feelings about George's death throughout his life. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is quite slowly moved and is a standard filler for riches showbiz biopic, telling the story of how young Charles is taught to play the piano, become a nightclub artist and then rise to fame as a magnificent artist who falls in love with the beautiful Della Bea. The best scenes in this part of the movie are flashbacks to Charles childhood. There is an effective recurring image of colored glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of his house; Perhaps this was one of his few visual memories of his life before he became blind. There is also a memorable scene where teenage Charles shames a prejudiced bus driver to let him stand on the bus pretending to have lost sight of Omaha Beach (in fact, he would only be thirteen at the time of the Normandy landings). The other half of the film becomes more interesting as it moves into a more controversial area focusing on Karl's drug abuse, the problems of his marriage, due to his affair with Margie Hendricks, one of his backing singers, and his struggle against racism. . In the early 60s, Charles created a sensation by refusing to play in front of a racially separated audience in Georgia (although contrary to what is stated in the film, he did not result in his being banned from performing in the state ). He also fought against racial parts within the music industry itself and performed not only traditionally "black" styles of music as gospel and rhythm and blues, but also traditionally "white" as country and western (considered by many black Americans as the choice of Redneck community music). As Peter Bradshaw, film critic of "The Guardian", "Ray" noted a sunny film that diplomatically turns away from the darker side of things. It omits any mention of matters such as Charles's beloved mother, Aretha, in his teens, his short-term marriage to Eileen Williams in the early 50s and his possible divorce from Della Bea in 1977. The number of his illegitimate children. There are similarities here with "A Beautiful Mind", which also omitted a number of controversial details about its professional life, including a divorce. <br /> <br /> Fans of Ray Charles will undoubtedly enjoy the movie for the music, but it's worth seeing for those who don't know much about him, mainly because of Jamie Foxx's Oscar-winning performance in the title role. and reproduces Karl's ways so precisely that we think we actually see a blind man even though Foxx himself is the sight. (Unlike Joaquin Phoenix in "Walk the Line", however, Foxx didn't make his own song - no doubt Charles was the singing voice too difficult to reproduce). He receives good support from some of the other performing artists, especially Sharon Warren like Aretha and Kerry Washington as Della Bea. The film is uneven and long, but nonetheless rewarding. 10.7
