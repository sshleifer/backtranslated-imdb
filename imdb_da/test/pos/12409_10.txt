This image has no major explosions or expensive chase sequences. But it has truly wonderful performances and an extraordinary script that puts this at the top of my "indie-must-see list". Taylor Nichols and James Remar are great together. The young thrown surprised me with really consistent action. Usually, indie images have some weak links, but there are no weak links here. Impressive. Join it here.
