I loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. Several classic sci / fie / Horror movies should be restored to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard that you waste it all over yourself. Can we expect more? Lets hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic movies. He made some very strong contributions. A picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion. I hope some manufacturers or instructors can get into the idea and bring us new comedy to our screens. We need a good upbringing of comedy to keep our level of laughter higher than ever before. A good comedy FIX.
