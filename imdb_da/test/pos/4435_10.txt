This is an in-depth and moving work on the creation of art, that which is unique human being and cannot be produced by nature, the cost of genius and the search for transcendence and what ultimately constitutes family, ie. we all. I was very moved by the family discussion that Nathaniel had with his sisters about their father's flaws when it was put in a beautiful home that seemed to radiate warmth that Lou had created. And even though Esther seems so cold in her discussion of Lou's inability to make money, you can appreciate how she has, in many ways in her life, been a counterweight to his impulses. Nathaniel did a great job of showing how all the people of Lou's life fit in and finish it and became so much a part of his work as his own genius. Yes, or perhaps our fault, gives us who we are. And of course there are the buildings. I only knew Lou Kahn by name and didn't really associate his name with his work, they are signs of grace. Maybe one day there will be a building where we all fit, and it will surely look like a Lou Kahn building, perhaps the unbuilt temple in Jerusalem. Maybe there is salvation
