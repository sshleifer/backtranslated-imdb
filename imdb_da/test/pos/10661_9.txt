Eisenstein created the Russian assembly theory, and this film is his best example. It took years before anyone could exploit their ideas and make them work (The Limey, 1999). Nevertheless, the pram scene really demonstrates the discombobulated nature of the RMT. Given, like most movies, it gets long in some parts, the beauty of the movie is amazing. One of the best quiet movies I've ever seen.
