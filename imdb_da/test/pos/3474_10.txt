Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this movie he handles a very sensitive subject with sensitivity, but does not control letting the film turn into schmalz. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, it's funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to see it now - FANTASTIC! <br /> <br /> The action is excellent and Dublin plays a leading role. This movie will change the way you look at people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining evening at the cinema. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.
