"The Journey" is a very good movie. Produced in the spring of 1958, in Vienna, and released in 1959, this film was quite popular in his early years. In spite of the political problems affecting the success of the movie (because the story goes on during the Hungarian Revolution, the Cold War), "The Journey" is a very good movie, but not known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD, because most of the people who have seen it so far want it at home. One of the film's most important qualities is the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, their intense relationship. All their scenes together are very important, but they also reveal the strong feelings, the great passion and love between the characters (Major Surov and Diana Ashmore). Another quality is the script, which is very well written. It was even released as a novel by actor George Tabori. The film keeps its excitement from beginning to end. First, we didn't know if Diana and the other travelers could leave Hungary because the Communist major discovers that Diana's friend, Paul Kedes, is Hungarian, and he must not leave the country. The Major falls in love with Diana, and that's actually the true reason why he won't let her go. But after he embraces her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on the screen and she kisses him, he lets her go. And the end of the movie is one of the most dramatic finishes ever filmed - Major and Diana say "Goodbye!", She comes to the limit with all travelers, including Paul, while Surov has been shot several times by some Hungarians so he dies. Yul Brynner is very, very nice and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful, charming, refined, like an English lady. Yul and Deborah are perfect together. They are one of the greatest couples in the golden Hollywood. A real movie gallery should watch this movie. "The journey" has everything a good movie should have - a great captivating story, interesting characters, a wonderful direction (Anatole Litvak is in my opinion the best). Finally, I will give a message to Warner Bros. Studios or those who restore and release classic movies: Please drop "The Journey" on DVD as soon as possible.
