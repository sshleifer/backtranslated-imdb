Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from the criminal drama to the romantic goofball comedy and back again so fast all the way through it seemed to resemble two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined the end again. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be fun too. I almost asked, but I think it's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor. He has the ability to perform over dramatic soap scenes with just the right facial expressions and voice intonations. His scenes with Betty seem like something out of "Sleepless in Seattle" or another romantic comedy as such. You almost forget that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are looking for Betty down. Morgan Freemans fascination with Betty was pretty scary considering that he could almost be his grandfather, but the scenes where he speaks to his photograph are definitely worth a laugh. Chris Rock's performance seems pretty wood, but he has his moments. Renee Zellweger is as sweet as Betty, the beloved waitress with the raw, incredible man who treats her like dirt. It's very unlikely that she would actually have got a job in a hospital without any real credentials, but hey, it's a movie, just go with it! Her roommate, Rosa, also shines like a woman who cares about Betty, but does not quite know how to deal with Betty's disease. And finally there is Crispin Glover. As a fan of his, of course, I thought the movie could have been more fun if he had been in it more. No one else has the same style that Crispin has, and the argument between Chris Rock, Crispin and the Sheriff of the soap opera is fun. I guess I say I liked this movie quite a bit! If you can stomach blood, violence and a lot of foul language, it's worth seeing and giving you lots of laughs!
