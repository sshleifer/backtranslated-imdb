All the characters in this cartoon were fun. Norman Viking guard had some memorable phrases, and the skull master, the bad guy, would always vowing to kill Max with some crazy tiling. Scripture is the best. <br /> <br /> I was glued to the kit as this would come on when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they did, I'd be forced to buy it. This and a Conan's barbaric cartoon are the ones I miss most from childhood. I think these cartoons are most unworthy of all the big cartoons. I used to watch these cartoons on Channel 13 in the Los Angeles area. <br /> <br /> I remember the owl was always afraid to warn Max that he was having trouble and that he was the one chosen. Max did not believe he was the one chosen and always gave the owl problems. Norman was less talkative, but his simplicity was fun. He would say things like "I eat monsters for breakfast" when he fights them. And when he fought against zombies, he would say "I eat zombies for ... memory." Classic comedy comedy and action. <br /> <br /> I agree that they re-air Mighty Max.
