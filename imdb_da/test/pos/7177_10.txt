In 1968, when "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" was released, it came from nowhere and beat like a psychedelic thunderbird. The African American actor and filmmaker, William Greaves, aimed to change the "news rule" style of documentary filmmaking, and to this day there has never been anything quite like it. The film is a film about the 'production of a movie' and intentionally written and directed to create as much controversy and contradiction as possible. Seen in New York's Central Park, the action and scan dialogue is a couple struggling and bitter about homosexuality and abortion. The woman wants out of the relationship and the man wants an explanation. At the end of this interaction, a drunk homeless man interrupts the case and gives his comment and personal back-story. Then, after the principals have been shot, the movie staff adds their own views on the filmmaker and what they feel is his outrageous handling of the movie. And throughout the film, several cameras are employed to record the action within the scene and alien comments from the cast, crew and spectators. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone interested in Avant Garde filmmakers such as Andy Warhol, John Cassavetes or Jim Jarmusch. William Greaves tries to show that one thing cannot really be observed and understood because the view itself will change reality. "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" can be seen as a cinematic representation or application of the uncertainty principle. This is only a possible explanation, and Greave's true intention is certainly open to speculation. Above all, this movie seeks to confuse, confront. and stimulate and undoubtedly succeed admirably.
