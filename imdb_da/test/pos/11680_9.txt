Absolutely one of the 10 best music movies ever! An absolutely crucial educational experience for any music fanatic - especially young rock / punk fans today ... understanding the beginning of a particular "artistic" movement requires absolute understanding of the roots of music, as well as the thinking and musical environment in times ... Not to mention the political and social factors involved at that time. And besides all that, this documentary flattened rock-n-roll F U N !! Do not miss it!!! That said, anyone can tell me when, if ever, the "decline of Western civilization" ... part 1 (not part 2, the metal version) will be made available again ... fortunately on DVD?
