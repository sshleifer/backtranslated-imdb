Sharpe is the honor of the uninitiated, is the fifth recording in a series of television films focusing on an English army rifleman during the Napoleonic Wars and based on the books of Bernard Cornwell (which I strongly recommend reading). If you were to begin to see this one yourself, you would get the impression that Sharpe is not as much a soldier as the very centrifugal force that the rest of the army revolves around. If so, I would recommend beginning with previous chapters like Sharpe's Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but this is a valuable choice for another view. <br /> <br /> The story this time is about espionage side of things. With the French Army back in disarray from Spain, Major Ducos, the slimy spy master sees an opportunity to turn the situation around. By linking the murder of a Spanish marques on Richard Sharpe, the British Army hero, the fragile British / Spanish alliance will begin to crumble and things will return. However, when the Spanish nobles come to Wellington and cry for Sharpe's blood, the English general is less than willing to hang his best soldier so that he is due to die, and soon he is out on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out of who mastered the plot. Surprisingly enough for a Sharpe movie too, there is a beautiful woman to be saved along the way, well. Of course, <br /> <br /> is a more adventurous state. The concentration is less on the English military's work with Sharpe as the figurehead and concentrates more on his escapades in the countryside, dodging French patrols, hobs snapping with the Spanish guerrillas, and becoming involved in bold flushes from fortified military posts. Sergeant Harper, his loyal right-hand man naturally accompanies him, but the rest of the rifleman remains in the camp unaware that their leader is still alive. Strangely enough, but they actually get more attention than usual, as they come up in their own subplot involving the delivery of Harper's baby. This slightly different approach makes it an exciting episode, but it is only a good thing in the long run. And should anyone be concerned that there will not be the standard battle on the climax, not because the poor old French again get a real kick. In addition, Ducos makes a great sequel to Obadiah Hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate. He is a rude, malicious and absolutely evil son of a dog dog and also reminiscent of that guy in black out of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman stands out as he gets the chance for more screen time and crosses like the kind of man you want to deliver your first-born, even though he looks like a member of Iron Maiden who was catapulted back in time by accident. <br /> <br /> In short, another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as ever, but considerably more bitter and sour this time given the events of the previous film. It is not the best introduction if you have not seen any of the other chapters, but it does show a page to Sharpe, which we usually do not witness: action hero rather than the professional soldier. And if that's not enough to get you tempted, it's also worth looking at the rather surrealistic view of a furious Sean Bean swinging a live chicken in a group of nuns.
