An interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very strange pictures. <br /> <br /> I was drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily traveling to America. I imagine much the same as my grandfather did at that time. Traveling in control to give ballast to the ships, I can't imagine it was very pleasant as seen in this movie. Legislation limiting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were stricter on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free of infectious diseases or hereditary diseases. In the film we see physical and mental exams, the latter because of the belief that low intelligence is hereditary. Single women could not enter the country on the assumption that they would become prostitutes, so most married single men already in the country as previously arranged on Ellis Island before entering. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a British immigrant (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who arranges to marry a poor Sicilian (Vincenzo Amato). He tries to get his family through with a son who is dumb and a mother (Aurora Quattrocchi) who is considered weak. She was amazing in the role by the way. <br /> <br /> You'll also see character actor, Vincent Schiavelli, in his next to last appearance. I don't know if his last movie has been released. He plays a matchmaker and it is also very good. <br /> <br /> It was a strange but funny movie. It is not for everyone when I imagine that those who have no interest in the immigration experience find it rather slow.
