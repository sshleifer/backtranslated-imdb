For some inexplicable reason, Jerry's films often seemed to come in for diatribes from certain quarters, even though they were rarely disappointed in the cash registers. It's one of life's great mysteries to me, because his film has always had a "feel good" factor about them for me. But this movie is not only bad: it is an extremely good and smart comedy. For those who become the source of "modern" raw or cruel humor, you cannot see this movie: There is nothing in it and you are wasting your time. <br /> <br /> I only watched this movie once on TV. I have been waiting ever since to see it again and it has been quite a few years. You would think the idea of ​​an arrogant millionaire businessman heading to win the war against the Nazis with his own little private army of entertaining employees would be boring would you not? Well only Jerry Lewis would dare try such a plot for an out and out comedy, and it seems I must say brilliantly. <br /> <br /> I think, as with 'The Nutty Professor' and most of his other films, this film is testimony to his comic genius, both in concept and performance. I think Buddy Love may have said, "You know, true comedy can't just make a six-year-old hysterical, so does his father." Maybe a few nutty Nazis generals with monocles and a limp didn't like this movie, honestly. If you only see a more comedy in your life, watch this. Be careful though, you can die laughing. And I'm not fun!
