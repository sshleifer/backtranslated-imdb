Lamey kids were a short legend legend. He was quoted in an interview and said, "Some days I suppose it is possible for someone to be a better No Limit Hold'em player than me. I doubt it, but it can happen. But I swear to you , I do not see how anyone can ever play gin better than me. "There is a gin rummy scene in this movie that is so amazing that you could have plopped it into 'X-Men' as a showcase for a super hero mutant force. It was so incredible this man was. <br /> <br /> I have some minor issues with this movie. just as dark as this movie was, lame's real life was darker. poker pro todd brunson said: "During the last series of poker, Bob Stupak, Mike Sexton and I had a drink and talked about Stu. Mike told us how he could hardly talk, hadn't gone for weeks and how his fingers were burned kind of a cracker pipe. "In the film Michael Imperioli seemed too healthy to be students in the last years of his life. when he won his last wsop, he looked like a skeleton, but let's see it. This production lacked both time and "deniro" to make that kind of change. My other problem was that I wanted more poker to play with real hands and situations. Sure it could have bored the average non poker enthusiast, but it would have been good for hardcores. too bad the movie was not 6 hours or so longer. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie with 3 non-poker players, and they all thoroughly enjoyed it. just as you don't have to be a former colonial army member to enjoy Gibson's "patriot", you don't have to be a poker player to see this gem. can't wait for the DVD.
