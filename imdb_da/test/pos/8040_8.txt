It worked! Director Christian Duguay created a very smart action / spy thriller. The actors Donald Sutherland and especially Aidan Quinn gave a superb performance. It was a pity we couldn't see Aidan Quinn in other films like this so far. He was simply the best in the role of Ramirez / Carlos for what he should have earned Oscar. The picture was very nice. The scenes are fast from the beginning to the end, and the story doesn't give you a chance to get bored. The movie is too underrated and I recommend it to anyone else you will miss something good. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. That's why I give it 9/10.
