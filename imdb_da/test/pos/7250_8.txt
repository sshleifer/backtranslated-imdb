Plunkett and Macleane are an entertaining, fast and refreshing movie. Refreshing, because unlike most other period films, it does not strive to give the audience a history lesson or preach pompous - in fact, historical accuracy is anything but ignored. This movie does not take seriously, and seeks to entertain rather than enlighten. Plunkett and Macleane are set in the 18th century, but director Jake Scott offers a thorough 90s roof. There is action, sex and swords aplenty, and in the inevitable ball scene the aristocracy is dancing to disco beats. Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are brilliant as always, and the rest of the cast, especially Alan Cumming as a flirtatious joke, is also very entertaining. The film is visually spectacular in places and is a blend of comedy, action and drama, with a love interest provided by Liv Tyler with an appallingly English accent. In short, if you're looking for an entertaining couple of hours, this is the movie for you. It won't make you think, but it could put a smile on your face.
