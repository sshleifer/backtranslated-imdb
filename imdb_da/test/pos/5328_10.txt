I am looking at the external reviews (Ebert, etc.) for this movie and they were all pretty much negative. But after reading many of them I noticed that they all did the same point. Critics were disturbed that the film centers on what seems to be a meaningless murder of an autistic child. It is certainly a disturbing picture. Critics like Ebert will have a traditional detective story that reveals why the killing occurred and the square puts the blame on the guilty. They will be blamed for being thrown and solved. Well, the status quo theme is a little what the movie is parodying. Like society, critics wanted a very quick resolution so they could move on to their next tragic opera. Perhaps there is no simple question to answer here? There is much more to what happened on the surface. The film does not seek to rationalize what is happening, but understand more why. What also bothered me so much about these inane reviews is that everything they look at in the way of performances is Spacey and Cheadle, both of which were great (and generally are). But there are other good ideas at work here, except just the two current icons in Hollywood. Gosling provides an incredible performance that only one of his extreme talent could deliver. Somehow, Gosling is able to make the killer of an autistic child sympathetic. This annoys many, I'm sure. But if you see the movie, they see what Leeland's motivation is, it's wrong, but it's not evil. Malone is also on top of her game as yet another confused young character. Basically, the killing of the child in this movie is not the main theme of the movie. The main theme is life itself and how people go about managing it, heights and lows, and how they try to sometimes help others manage their lives (which do not seem to work really well). There is very good and bad in this world, and how we handle each has a direct influence on how much more good and bad will happen, and sometimes a confused attempt to do well can lead to a whole lot more badly. I think this is one of the more memorable films of one time and has an end that is as touching as anything in the latest movie story. I strongly believe that people should watch this movie with an open mind.
