Having learned that her sister Susan is considering divorce, Kate decides to travel to distraught woman's remote home and spend some time with her. However, when Kate arrives, Susan is nowhere in sight. It is because someone has murdered her and filled her body in a suitcase in the basement. When a storm rages outside, Kate tries to find out where her sister could have gone and put her own life in great danger ... the killer is still in the place! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance. Merwin Gerard's teleplay is based on a short story by McKnight Malmar. Malmar's story was first brought to television in 1962 as an episode of Boris Karloff's THRILLER anthology series. THRILLER sat very close to the story, which is a bit of a shame because it could have used a little slaughter. Granted Malmar wrote a moderately eerie figure, but Gerard (creator of the ONE STEP BEYOND show) adds more clever ingredients that increase the excitement and excitement.
