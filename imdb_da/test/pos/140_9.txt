The definition of a vampire is an inhuman body that must leave its grave at night to drink the blood of the living. Bakjwi almost negates this concept upside down minus the clich√© of punctual fangs and neck biting. Being an R-rated movie, I knew this would actually mean that vampires were actually vampires. Which means the characters in the movie should do what vampires actually do without restraint and rightfully lacking glamorous moments compared to Twilight. Having seen Chan-wook Park's former Oldboy, I had very high expectations for Bakjwi. I expect some awkward plots with our anti-hero, known as the priest song hyeon, and was very impressed by his performance as a sanctuary forced into this dilemma to be human and obey his thirst as a vampire. (SPOILER) Following the first condition that he survived the defective blood transfusion, he begins to demand blood and discovers his superpower and flying ability. The screenshots make their transition phase without indulgence on the exhibition. He begins to drink the blood of the dying and those who want to be euthanized for moral reasons. The often tragic and dysfunctional love affair priest has with the manipulative Tae-joo is very nickel when played by the host's Kanh-ho song and actress OK-wine Kim. The special effects are correctly placed in the background, and although it does not give anything new in the form of stunts and CGI, it was not imposed on the plot-driven and character-developed premise. History and key points are very perverse and grotesque, yet very original in their own Korean style. <br /> <br /> There are not many negatives I can say about Bakjwi. Sometimes I wonder if the priest's transitional phase could have shown that more of the pastor had an emotional crisis with his transformation, but then it would again have made the film 3 hours long. The movie was long to begin with. Likewise, vampires really do not have much in the way of expressing emotions at first. As mentioned earlier, this movie is very tragic, so don't expect any hope while watching this. <br /> <br /> All in all, Bakjwi is very dark, morbid and original. I highly recommend this movie to serious viewers who are past Twilight's teenage phase. This is certainly the Korean answer to the Swedish lad the right one, which is also a good movie.
