One of the Message Board threads on IMDb had two women talking about Colin Firth, how they saw the movie only because of him. It was clear that they were two young women; But what struck me is how little this movie has been appreciated by the audience in general. The brilliant, and I mean brilliant, performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange were hardly noticed, not only by the audience but by the academy and most critics. <br /> <br /> I think I know why. First, the plot - or actually just the set-up - is a form of bastardisation of Shakespeare's King Lear with the dying, crazy patriarch and the three damn daughters who will inherit. Their names even begin with the same letters, Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia - Rose, Ginny and Caroline. And I think "Larry" (Jason Robards) is working for "Lear". The apparent idea that Jane Smiley had imagined in her Pulitzer award-winning novel was to tell a Lear-like story from the daughters' point of view, and to tell the kind of late-century century's realistic way Bard did not consider. The problem is in Smiley and Moorhouse's story that the two older daughters are very human with strengths and weaknesses, while the father is a most despicable character without much in the way of redeeming qualities. His only strength was his ability to make agricultural economic success; But we can even discount it when his father and grandfather built him the farm and inherited it. <br /> <br /> The second problem - and I cannot personally witness this without reading Smiley's novel - is that the film is only a limited and partial interpretation of the novel. Nevertheless, it is almost always the case that an excellent novel, especially a long and ambitious with many psychological nuances, cannot be faithfully transmitted to the screen. The vision and sound requirements of the film extract the notifications in a narrative, while the time constraints do not allow full development of character and motivation obtained by the Romanist. Within five or six hours, Moorhouse might have made a movie more in line with Smiley's novel. <br /> <br /> A third problem is one that may be Moorhouse alone. She began her instructor career with the very well performed Aussie film Proof (1991) with Russell Crowe. She follows it with how to make an American quilt (1995), which celebrated women, especially women of a certain age. But it was a bit heavy-handed and clear and definitely a chick flick. In a way, a thousand acres take out and not only show us the point of view of women, but do so in a way that can be politically motivated for some. Larry Cook is clearly a bad, bad father. He beat his daughters and he had carnal knowledge about them. He ran the household with an iron fist. Jess (Colin Firth's character) seduces the inexperienced Ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a little fun, it seems to work. And then he goes to Rose, who will clearly be the power behind the new ownership and is associated with her while she randomly evokes her husband to end his life in a drunk accident. The rest of the men are one-dimensional figures with no shade, as they often appear in Romanesque novels. I think most audiences were discouraged by the violent incest, adultery, and sexual fraud woven into history. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, I think the critics and the public are wrong. I think the direction was biased towards men, but in this story it had to be. I think Moorhouse did a good job of making an emotional and engaging movie about family dynamics that wasn't too beautiful. And the actor of Pfeiffer and Lange was nothing less than sensational. They seemed to feed each other in a way that I found completely authentic and profound. In particular, pfeiffer became riveting when she projected her bent anger and hatred. The way Moorhouse allowed her character to be revealed to us gradually is a tribute to her ability as a director and to Pfeiffer's outstanding performance. And the skill that Moorhouse steered the change in Ginny's character as she walked from a "ninny" she called herself to a self-conscious and understandable bitterness was also excellent. The fact that she left her husband was so much out of shame as anything else. He had to take her and forgive her and bring her back. And Robards in his intensity and madness were also very good. <br /> <br /> I predict that this movie, which bombed in theaters, will be better appreciated in the years to come as people watch it on DVD. My question is what happened to Moorhouse? Her talent is obvious, but she has not yet directed her fourth feature film. When she hopes she remembers going with what she thinks, but also being fair. In fact, I think she was fair to the two main characters in this movie, but didn't pay enough attention to the others. In addition to the untapped father, Jennifer Jason Leigh's Caroline was unfinished and left us wondering why she did some of the things she did. And the husbands should be something more than mannequins. They should be engaged and engaged.
