To begin with, this is my favorite in ST OS. <br /> <br /> In addition to StuOz's critical comments, I throw a little more: Technically, when Enterprise burns it, photon torps are at a blind target, they should be mighty close to direct hits (I think) to disturb much less damage to the Romulan vessel with the room vacuum cleaner to contend with. <br /> <br /> I had something of a problem with the Romulan Commander who questioned his belief in the Romulan protocol or their leadership unless it was about attacking vulnerable targets (outposts in the neutral zone) who are not at war. I also don't think Commandant would fall to the basic or simple tactic that Kirk played, "to live dead" or fall to the lump that the subordinate puts on him whether he or she should attack the Enterprise when it is playing death. <br /> <br /> On the Enterprise: I'm surprised that after seeing the Romulan vessel's attack method earlier, Sulu would say, "Do they surrender?" when it attacks the Enterprise for the first time. <br /> <br /> Funny how Spock can only get the repair done on weapons control when the emergency is over. <br /> <br /> Also in the last attack I thought the Romulan vessel was too slow (as long as Spock could run down a couple of times and back to the armory and activate and burn off the photon battles. have used phasers at this time, but I'm sure had to do with technicians and budget). On the positive side: It is a good drama played on the Romulan vessel, where we introduce ourselves to the romulans. Big scenes with Stiles tell a good deal of Romulan's human knowledge. Also his conflict with Spock is right up there. I wanted Stile's character to have been on the show for a while, if nothing but the energy he added. <br /> <br /> It's only fun to point to negatives and goofs (I'm sure there are more). But for me it is as good as it gets !! "Balance of Terror" is always the one I place at the top of my ST rankings.
