A hilarious comedy by the best director ever, Oz Scott. The list of eighty TV icons goes on and on again. Milan (Family Bands), Stone (Mr. Belvedere), Robinson (Night Court), Jackee (227), D'abo (Wonder Years), Walston (Mr. Hand !!!). It's one of the funniest movies ever. Big lines, meaningless subplots, cheesy, bad action. It is a group of high school children who have to pass motorists. The Night Court Mac needs them to pass their final exam or he will be fired. Great performance by Brian Bloom as the stupid / kind cool guy Riko Conner, but is nothing compared to B.D. Wong's Kiki (pronounced kee-chee). A great movie for all ages, so bad, it's good.
