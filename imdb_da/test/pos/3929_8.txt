While the HOUSE OF WAX will never be mistaken for Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or HALLOWEEN, it attempts and eventually manages to be a worthy addition to quality film production. There are enough tensions and probably implicitly do in here to satisfy today's young audiences, and there are probably explicitly pleasing some of the purists yesterday. All in all, it's a pretty good movie that should be okay on DVD. Six kids on their way to football matches are stranded in a DELIVERANCE setting, and what ensues looks like it might have been taken out of a discarded Deilverance sequel and backwoods hicks seem to endure the group. Eventually, the group has to break up, and half of them go into the desert town to get some car parts. The other half of the group stays at the camp and this sets the other half of the film. <br /> <br /> The House of Wax has many strengths. The first is that it is blessed with a very sympathetic cast. Paris Hilton is fine in its role, but she is far from the focal point. Chad Michael Murray, Elisabeth Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt are three very charismatic actors, and their presence in the film adds some panache, some credibility and some flair. I had never really heard of Chad Michael Murray, only that he was a pin-up type teen heartthrob. But he has a presence for him. He imbues an intangible for him who seems to translate into his performance. He is instantly sympathetic, and he possesses a strong trait. I enjoyed his performance much more than I expected, and when he was on the screen, the movie flew. The question now becomes, "Is this movie a worthy horror movie?" And the answer to this is a resounding YES. As I mentioned from the top, it's not in the same class a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or LAST HOUSE on the left, or even THE RING, but it's relatively tense, pretty graphic and there are some very inventive death scenes. This is not the HOUSE OF WAX that your parents told you about. Vincent Price is nowhere to be seen, and when you begin to see your fingers cut off and hot wax covers the comatose bodies, you realize that this film is a bit on the edge. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see an uncut director's X-rated version. I bet there is a place out there that would be much more violent than this. Be it possible, it's a very good entry into the horror genre, and it's head and shoulders over weak movies that I know what you did last summer and dark water and a few others. It is definitely worth a visit. <br /> <br /> 8/10
