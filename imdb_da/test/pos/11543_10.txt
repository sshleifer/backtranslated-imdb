A genius. My genius I remember the exact second in 1994. I was in a pub in Shropshire, England. I remember the exact seat. "Bill Hicks dies of cancer" said the headline of NME. I felt somebody had hit me in the stomach. Buy this DVD. If you don't find anything in it somehow, I'll be astonished. RIP Bill, I want so much that you were still here.
