Many people do not think that Dan Aykroyd is fun. This movie otherwise proves. Aykroyd is brilliant to deliver his one-liners in this comedy. The only major problem with this is that it wastes too much time near the end, jumping back and forth from Aykroyd's character and the doctor who persecutes him to prove he's a fraud. The doctor will need to be a doctor Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) in "What about Bob?". The scenes where the doctor desperately tries to get back to Los Angeles are stupid, incredible and unfunny. Second, this aspect of the movie is really fun, especially the first half.
