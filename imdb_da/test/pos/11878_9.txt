What's not to like? <br /> <br /> I caught it again tonight and marveled at Hugh Bonneville's capture of the essence of Philip Larkin without resorting to tics and caricature. There are many layers for the depiction of the protagonist's complexity and Hugh brings them to life. His prudent mother, his unsolved problems with his father and his inability to commit to a woman. <br /> <br /> His poetry is interlaced through and some scenes are trapped in his story of them to a friend of a friend whom he later speaks, but rather randomly, almost innocently. It is not difficult to see where his attraction lies with the many women who fell in love with him (and knew each other, to start up and continued to see him!) <br /> <br /> Cerebral, fun loving , jazz aficionado, loyal friend. It is always more than appearance, women moved beyond his baldness, deafness and short-sightedness. And a beautifully nuanced performance by Eileen Atkins as his mother is an added bonus. 9 out of 10.
