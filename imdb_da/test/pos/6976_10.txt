In some scenes in the Rain People, Francis Ford Coppola's sequel to his 70's anniversary, there is a similar situation to 1969's Easy Rider, but not in the same frame of reference. Here we have a drama of disconnected people from society, in some ways alienated by elections or borders imposed by someone. It is one of the rare original dramas where some scenes stand alone as total knockouts. Even with such a low-string budget and a lot of freewheeling, so to speak for filming, Coppola can capture everything that has to be said through these clearly defined characters and the curved, unexpected degrees of a sign relative to helplessness of another, vice versa, or both. And as one might tend to see how much about the cuts of suburban life in the 1960s, it has the escapism of the previously mentioned film, but of a more concrete, near timeless quality with the drama and the underlying problems. In a way, if Bergman was on the road as a quasi-guerrilla's 20-something filmmaker to get the strange truths of everyday outsiders, it could be. But along with all the very direct and sometimes self-conscious photography (although also with a more documentary approach at times, like its undeniable characters), the actors all fit together. Shirley Knight, an actress I am not too familiar with, has a complex, divergent role as a pregnant wife who runs into a kind of existentialist event of what life is there to have. There are moments of something awe-inspiring that works by her, and one of my favorites (if not my favorite) is when she's on the phone and calls her husband the first time. Such a tense scene at both ends and in every little gesture and bend of a word so much about her is spoken to so little. It is extraordinary in ways that reflect others in Coppola's film. Then comes the character "killer" played by James Caan. This is also a dangerous character to take on, as it is a mixture of childish confusion and amusement with scars. Think Forrest Gump if he didn't make it past football and white. It's one of his best, in fact, being the most minimalist - for a guy who usually plays hard guys in movies, here is one who is also part of the core of history and the knight's character. Also very good in a supporting role is Robert Duvall as a policeman with a hard side and rather checkered past; kind of an early test of other defective characters he would play later in his career. So the characters, and what Coppola risks having an unrest running in them, is really what constitutes the movie, as any story there is, it certainly is not solved in the usual way you might think or expect. The last ten minutes, like others in Coppola's work, where the specific tragedies on all sides are undermined by the emotional and psychological consequences that this will leave the principles, are amplified to sublime and sad. This is for his time brave of the part trying to be represented (both the freedom and the mistakes and the ambiguities) in the subject. And the style of the picture gives a fragmented view of the whole with fast flashbacks that are graphic and self-contained in contrast to the longer shots in some crucial scenes. It's a roadmap from its period, but it has also gotten much more work than it would during another movie maker with less chance of taking on the character of these excluded characters. One of the best films from 1969.
