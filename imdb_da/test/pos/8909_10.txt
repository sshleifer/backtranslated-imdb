In fact, the whole series character is annoyingly fun! But not always fun ... there are moments of extreme poignance, as the deeper aspects of human feeling are touched. <br /> <br /> The series over and over comments the human nature's scams and lifelong or, in this case, eternal struggle to overcome them. Monkey is both smart and stupid at the same time, his arrogance and addiction to his own fighting skills leads him to trouble in almost every episode. Pigsy is simply rough. Sandy has a philosophical state of mind. He has many of the wittiest lines. <br /> <br /> The English translation is a pleasure. "Ignorance can always be improved," pulls Sandy in his backward way, "but you can't do anything to help stupidity!" "Who are you?" The group of travelers is asked. "We are three kings in the Orient," Monkey says. <br /> <br /> This is not just for kids, it's a magic romp for anyone who can suspend reality
