I have to say that some of the other reviews of this movie I have read show little understanding of the original TV series (s) it came from. Father's army was a sitcom and therefore had a sense of humor, and then it must have put a smile on the serious situation. The series, however, brought many serious messages, such as the episode 'Branded' about bigotry and ignorance linked to conscientious objectors. The film was true to the series and was simply an extended episode. So I'm afraid the reviewer who claimed that Columbia's enhanced humor was pretty wrong and let's see it - the BBC's sitcoms of that time struck something that came out of America's hands down. Also comments on propaganda were also far from the mark. The homeguard was people considered unfit for front line service who still wanted to serve. They were very brave men who knew they were sentenced to death as soon as they joined, when Hitler announced that everyone who did so would be executed if and when Britain was invaded. Thank you for allowing me to put the post straight, as it is always good to actually speak and comment on what has been seen, rather to make it up as you go along, I find.
