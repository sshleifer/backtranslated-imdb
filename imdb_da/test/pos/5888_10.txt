In a movie that is as successful as this, it is difficult to exclude a single factor. All departments work in perfect union to create the most moving human dramas ever put on film. <br /> <br /> Production is a tribute to the ensemble effort by writers, producers, cast and crew. To name just a few, Hugo Friedhofer's magnificent score is a subliminal wonder, the subtle yet striking photography by Greg Toland and the incredibly effective direction of William Wyler combines everything with an ideal throw to create an American classic. <br /> <br /> The DVD format version is a special experience to see. What a pleasure to see "The best years of our lives" so beautifully preserved for generations to enjoy.
