"Nobi" or "Fire on the Plain" is a film that is so excellent at so many levels that not enough good things can be said about it. My only regret is that I couldn't see this 1959 movie earlier. <br /> <br /> Being part of a movie tourist, I tend to watch movies for their artistic benefits based on dialogue, recording, photography and even efforts to remain true to the costume period. In the end, I want to know if the movie is "truthful" enough to reveal the human condition to make me think without suppressing me with what the director wants me to think. "Fires on the Plain" is a great movie because it crafts a portrait full of realistic human reactions to the dying fires in a major historical disaster. Ichikawa film is a condemnation of war at all levels - as any good war movie should be. War is horrible, bloody, destructive. It's also murderous on the psyche. But what is fundamental about "fires on the plain" is its invisible look at the Japanese soldiers. It shows that they slowly collapse under the weight of superior American firepower and their country's inability to wage war for their own production. A fatalistic code that encourages death before the surrender is at the heart of this frenzy. I was amazed to see such an honest and brutal close look at the bitter fruits of Japan's military misadventure, which was made only 14 years after the end of what the Japanese call "the great Pacific war." Ichikawa reveals what the Germans called "the life of the war," the common soldier's situation. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is interesting because even today Japan has difficulty in expressing its fanaticism's renunciation of conquered people, racism in its war against the Chinese and war crimes involving cannibalism of soldiers and officials, not only practiced each other, but against allied prisoners of war. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa produces a strong representation of the soldiers' victimization by blending bad political decisions and cultural pressures. <br /> <br /> This sharp study is cleverly portrayed by depicting the convicted soldiers as humans displaying various crowds, fears, excellent laconic humor, dialogue enriched by its sparseness, and a plot whose complexity is covered by the wicked , wilderness surroundings. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Ichikawa is a creepy and painful loss of defeated men. The tuberculous Tamura, played as a woebegone and gentle soul by Eiji Funakoshi, is a good soldier who cannot give up his humanity even though he is as scared and lost as his comrades. Before going to a hospital that will reject him as too healthy, Tamura gives a hand grenade of a superior who, by acknowledging the hope of their situation, advises Tamura to kill himself. <br /> <br /> Why Tamura is hopelessly ill - Delivered and military incapacitated unit was not ordered to surrender at the beginning of the film telling. Ichikawa makes it clear that the war is over and everyone is just waiting to die. When Tamura leaves his unity for his hopeless quest for physical and spiritual salvation, he sees his comrades effortlessly digging an air strike. They look like bodies that look up from their own mass graves. <br /> <br /> Later, as the overworked hospital medical staff surrenders the dying patients to an all-inclusive American artillery block. The pathetic patients who crawl from their huts in a vain attempt to survive seem pathetic, slang creatures that withdraw from an all-powerful force. You know they don't survive. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa makes it clear that the only thing worse than a defeated army is one that has lost its honor by abandoning its humanity and its peers. As Tamura stretches through Leyte's jungle, we encounter the noble, the dying and the exploitive. Cannibalism solves its ugly head as soldiers begin to eat each other instead of surrendering to American "corned beef". When the men talk about surrender, the propaganda is counteracted by how the Americans kill prisoners, by a secular -and soldier who reveals that nearby Americans feed and care for prisoners of war because, unlike the Japanese, they respect courageous soldiers who have to give up. <br /> <br /> It is the Japanese who intend to die for the emperor long after opposition has lost all meaning. Those who are willing to fight death will be killed. That is the calculation of war. Having shot a murderous and cannibalist comrade, whom he previously offered his own body for food, the fatalistic Tamura's careless surrender also seems to be a deliberate form of suicide. His death is a lonely picture. Was Ichikawa trying to tell us about the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live, but who is still trapped by his country's suicide cultural codes? <br /> <br /> If anyone sees this movie carefully, he or she will see that absolutism and fanaticism are the enemy. The Americans are portrayed as a technologically advanced people who are willing to use this technology in the form of indescribable military power - a lesson that transformed the Japanese post-war community. Ichikawa's film is not so low that it suggests America. Ichikawa sets the sedimentary layers of Japan's destructive policies that created the war and then continued when everything was lost. Ichikawa does not mention nuclear weapons fell on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. He doesn't have to. The slow-moving destruction of the Imperial Japanese army in the Philippines reveals the seeds of Japan's immolation.
