Sea INSIDE (2004) **** Javier Bardem, Belen Rueda, Lola Duenas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Joan Dalmau, Alberto Jimenez, Tamar Novas, Francesc Garrido, Jose Maria Pou, Alberto Amarilla, Nicolas Fernandez Luna. : Alejandro Amenabar) <br /> <br /> An inspirational story of a living death; Bardem is fantastic <br /> <br /> The true life account for Spanish quadriplegic Ramon Sampedro and his claim to fulfill his desire for euthanasia in the right to die cannot be considered a source of inspiration, but this film is just that. <br /> <br /> Sampedro (the game outstanding by Bardem) was a virile, energetic young man when he lost the function to his limbs after a tragic dive accident (told terribly in flashback with a visceral shot to the senses) and for almost thirty years lay paralyzed in bed, while his loving family suited his every need. Though his ability to move was zero, his mind was very active and proved skilful as an inventor, poet, writer, and artist who stopped recording until he could no longer live in his stunted condition. <br /> <br /> Enter beautiful but also afflicted by a paralyzing disease attorney Julia (the ethereal Rueda who matches Bardem beautifully as if they were really soulmates) is employed to look through Sampedro's last wish to end his life and Once again, it becomes an aid camp when he begins to open up to her like no other ever. Not too long has time gone by, and Julia is beginning to examine her lawyer's past and discover many letters hidden by the family. When Julia confronts Ramon with this, he is initially reluctant to discuss anything with her, but eventually he agrees with her that this can help his cause and the project becomes a book in making ?? a memoir / biography in the form of free style poetry and prose. The film is a heartbreaking tale of the human spirit and how love finally triumphs over heart pain in many forms, including for Ramon the unlikely love he shares with a complete stranger named Rosa (Duenas) a single mother who sees him on television day and inspire her to cycle to his remote farm in Spain to get to know him and possibly. change to end his life. <br /> <br /> Filmmaker Amenabar, who wrote with Mateo Gil the fascinating manuscripts allows for some imagination in the mix when Ramon imagines that he magically leaves his bed and flies over the beautiful landscapes to the possible sea. where he suffered many years ago for the cruel fate that has imprisoned him for three decades. The movie is not a complete downer with a blurred white and occasional humorous tone throughout it that does not dilute the impact of history's final action. Kudos also for the remarkable make-up work by James and Jo Allen is doing a tremendous amount of work to age the vibrant Bardem into an aging man of full power who should bring them to an Acadamy Award node. <br /> <br /> Bardem and Rueda deserve Oscar nominations as two people with so much in common, and despite the fact that Ruedas Julia is married to a loving, affectionate man, a few people made for each other , it is quite impossible they were never together to begin with. It is just one of the atrocities that call true, but it is not by definition of the movie as a whole; it is a must-see and one of the best of the year.
