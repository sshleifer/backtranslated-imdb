"The Cell" is a rather difficult movie to classify. If you read the plot overview, "a psychotherapist travels in a comatose serial killer hoping to save his last victim", you might think it's a thriller with a hint of science fiction. But it doesn't really make this movie fair. There is an imaginative aspect in the sub-conscious minds that are great, with lavish visual and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama like the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez before becoming a single romantic comedy component) contacting the child and witnessing his frightening upbringing. And there is certainly a horror facet because of the sickly actions of the serial killer's evil persona. The film tries to operate at many different levels and crosses genre boundaries on will. Although I feel that it ends up being a rather bizarre experience, I find it absolutely fascinating. <br /> <br /> From the start of the credit, with Lopez running a horse through the desert, stunningly dressed in a white dress, knowing that you are in for a visual treatment. Every time the audience leaves reality and follows her into its "patients" subconscious depths, they are guaranteed a feast of visual and responsive. The costumes are wonderful creations of angles and color. The camera leaves regularities at the door and crosses a world where up and down are the same. The characters become rulers of their own domains and are transformed into beings worthy of such stature. If you don't enjoy anything more about "The Cell," you will surely be impressed by the work done in these scenes. The casting is also in top class. Jennifer Lopez is in her element here by taking advantage of her natural, compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities while combining her own striking look with the lush surroundings, makeup and costumes. She is incredibly sexy, and I personally want someone to find another role for her outside the rom-com world, she has been typecast in which would allow her to experiment further. Vince Vaughn is quite convincing as an FBI agent who will do anything to save the life of a young woman. But it is without doubt Vincent D'Onofrio, who has the greatest impression here. It is an extremely difficult role as he is obliged to produce more emotions within the viewer. We are disgusted with his actions, yet sympathetic to him because of the trauma he has experienced in his life. He looks magnificently strong within his rich, but uncertain and vulnerable in the real world. It's a great achievement from an underrated actor. <br /> <br /> Although "The Cell" doesn't work so well at all levels, it tries ambitiously (some of the characters' characters are not credible) and while it is All based on some pretty slender scientific logic, it is an occasional shock , visually stunning trip that rewards more impressions.
