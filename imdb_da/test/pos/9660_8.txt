This is probably the best film from 2002 about Romanian cinema. I recommend being an intense drama without any action and excitement. The film concentrates on teen life in Bucharest suburbs through the protagonist, not focusing so much on the character's form or definition, but more on the anger that he and other characters feel. The title "Furia" means rage rather than anger, but can be seen in the film in both senses from the actors' behavior. The rather weird love story (not a typical romantic, but rather a modern suburban) is well-formed to the end. It's a captivating image, and cinematography is pretty good at capturing the suburban nightlife and making it a great movie to watch and see. You won't bore me for a moment, I promise!
