Some time ago I watched a video by Paul Thomas Anderson, expressing the great interest he has in porn movies, and how this industry could have produced better movies and, consequently, a complete genre and not just sex video tape. Paul Thomas Anderson put his own faith in the porn industry in the character played in a great way by Burt Reynolds. His name is Jack Horner, an instructor whose biggest dream is to make a "real" movie that can keep the viewer in excitement because of the great dramatic story and at the same time thrilling with the beauty ?? and with the "big cock and breasts". Soon as he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Walhberg), he believes he has found the new star for his films. And so begins the story of the young Eddie in the porn industry. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a sequence inside a nightclub where we can see all the people who will be part of Eddie's life and later we can see them outside the porn industry and live their daily routine. But soon we can see them in the porn industry, and after only a party begins the story of the new Eddie, the story of Dirk Diggler. Everyone will taste the right success with Dirk as the star, win lots of prizes and help Jack make his biggest dream with a series of movies about Brock Landers, Dirk's new character. This kind of movie is a great success and Jack is his first "real" movie. But here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the "terrible 80s" when there are going to be $ ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll for Dirk and friends. But we all know that the excesses can destroy any person, and the erectile dysfunction can ruin any porn star, and here the film focuses on their overall success and how everyone has a really bad time with many problems due to the bad appearance of the porn industry in society. and for a period of many profits. In Dirk's decadence, having tried and failed in the music industry, there is a brilliant sequence that can resume in a perfect way, how things go to Dirk and his friends. That sequence is the first of his first drug deal, with the appearance of Alfred Molina, ending in a total mess. Is fun for us and a terrible experience for Dirk and friends, but there is always a solution if you come back in what you know and when Dirk is back, Brock is back. <br /> <br /> Now, I haven't mentioned most of the characters in my summary, but I have to say that everyone is incredibly well-developed. Cast is just amazing with the best performance I've seen by Mark Walhberg. Julianne Moore has a strong performance in a truly moving character; Reilly, Macy, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman, etc. Are just memorable, all their characters with fun and sad moments. Finally, I really love Anderson's amazing movie style with an outstanding view of the porn industry in the late 70's and early 80's. I used to say that "Magnolia" was my favorite of Anderson, but right now, having seen everyone except "Sidney", I can't say I have a favorite because I love them all! <br /> <br /> PS: A place I read that this movie is Anderson's "Scorsese movie", so I'm more than sure that if you love "Goodfellas" and "Casino" you will also love this . I f * cking love "Boogie Nights"!
