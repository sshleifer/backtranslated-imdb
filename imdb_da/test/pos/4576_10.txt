I recommend Idiocracy to everyone. Luke Wilson is very funny, the film is insightful and made me laugh so hard that I had tears running down my face several times. Finally, when I took a breath and realized how close we are to Mr Judge's vision of tomorrow. Watch for a cameo by the guy from the Mac commercials (Justin Long) as Dr. Lexus. I found his performance Oscar-worthy, especially considering what Oscars has been awarded lately ... Besides, he's sweet. Idiocracy is a bad fun insight into a possible future where people are named by product names (the president's middle name is mountain dew), hospital visits cost $ 5 billion, which are garbage mountains because no one is smart enough to find out what to do with it All, and no one cares about anything but money. Everything because only stupid people breed. Sounds familiar to me somehow. Oh yeah; That's what I'm thinking of seeing professional wrestling ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, watch this movie. It's a good laugh and it will make you think.
