This film is primarily based on emotions and interactions of people. There are only three places (school, shop and coach house) that are really used. However, it is primarily at the coach's house. A movie does not need special effects or amazing views to be great in itself. <br /> <br /> Four friends who had tied up during their basketball days meet. One is rich, important and has no true love outside of money. You want to be mayor again, but his competition makes him angry. You want to be superintendent in school and take care of your family. One is a travel alcohol. <br /> <br /> First, I love the actors in this movie. They have all been house names for me. They proved their worth here. <br /> <br /> One of the most crucial moments is when Tom, played by Gary Sinise, blows up the coach. He yells and yells at how the coach cheated in the winning game. His breath blows the trainer's whistle and shouts his catch phrases - "Forgive me Father, for I have sinned!" It is great to see with energy that just cools you. <br /> <br /> Recommended for anyone who understands human feelings and does not have shining effects to interest them.
