It is a very sensitive depiction of life with undiminished or limited desires. What do you do with desire in a culture and a society with rigid standards? A man finds expiration with the immigrant - as immigrants do not belong or are not accepted, they do not have to adapt and dampen their desires. The other man seeks comfort in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothing. Of course it fails - and he breaks down in the last scene for several reasons. Sita still used enough for him to find the moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant exit to his blocked desires. The mother in her still couldn't find the strength to destroy her myth. She sees him as a child who glitters in her mood control, but should she allow him to finally grow up? Both wives find courage and unity through their joint rejection of their husband. <br /> <br /> But the final act of rejection was of grandmother - she couldn't break free of her equipped mindset to accept Sita's desire. A decade and more to receive care was not enough to destroy the culture of its culture. <br /> <br /> It seems as if it was easier for the housekeeper to let his wishes flow - as he is still cursed by his culture - at the bottom of the hierarchy. Since there is no respect and expectations, one might as well taste sin.
