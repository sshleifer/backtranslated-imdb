I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say bad about this movie ... because it's a really good part of Samuel L. Jackson, and mostly by Christina Ricci !! I'm a big fan of her ever since I saw her in Addams Family ... trying to see all the things she's doing, and it's definitely one of the best parts she played !! I love her appearance (though people say she is not beautiful ... I think she is ... and I love her eyes) !! The movie is about many things ... people say it's religious ... people say it's about racism ... people say it's about drugs ... people say it's about nymphomania .. Well ... maybe a bit of it !! But what I really feel is that this movie has a high eye opening for what the blues are ... what it stands for ... and mainly where it comes from: life ... heart ... pain ... grief .. and above all ... spontaneous feelings !! I hope you see it ... if you are the kind of person who likes a movie, not just from the pictures or the story it tells ... it's a good movie to watch ... if your not ... good ... see it anyway ... can't hurt so much and you get to see Christina Ricci, who seems so horny !! She is a fox !!
