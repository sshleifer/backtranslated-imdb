I can't see how some people can't find this movie fun, I saw the end of it at Sky Movies in 2001 thought I wanted to DVD since then I've laughed my balls with lines like Rich Mayall's laughing "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA" and Eddies " Hello evening gates "when they never get any phone calls in general, I think this movie is very much fun.
