People say this movie is a "typical teenage fear movie" ... well it's a horror movie with a teenage girl in it .. what do you expect! It's a good movie, I counted on 3 actual screams in the audience while the movie was on, and it was a very jumping scary movie. I wasn't bored in the movie at any time and I was even on the edge of my seat at some point. The only thing that was a little bad was that it was a little slow to get into the story itself, but it all led to why she was where she was and why, what happened, happened. The action was good, the scene was good and the story was good too, I hope to see a 'When a Stranger Calls 2' in a few months! Good movie!
