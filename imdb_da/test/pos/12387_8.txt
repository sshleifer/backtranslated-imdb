I suppose this movie is not your typical Spanish thriller, as it is based on a real story that took place abroad. The film is based on the true story of the French man Jean-Claude Romand, and the real case is much more gory and scary than the movie. In the real story of Mr Romand, the family did not escape, after many years of lying he decided to finish everything by killing his wife, two children, parents and dog, and even though he tried to kill himself, he did not seem to do it. try very hard as he survived I saw the movie with people next to me who talked about how it could never happen in real life, that all those lies were undiscovered, I laughed when I had read the book about mr. Romand, and knew it happened. I like Jos√© Coronado in this movie and he offered us a good performance like the rest of the crew.
