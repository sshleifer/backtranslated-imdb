Ted Danson was a great choice to play Gulliver. Although his background was mostly comedy, he shows here that he can do drama as well or maybe even better (though there is a lot of humor in this). It's hard to blind his American accent, especially because his character has to be English, but that's just a minor thing. All the bad guys are just as well thrown: James Fox, Edward Fox, Peter O Toole, Warwick Davis, John Standing, etc. Although most are either small people or giants, they are 100% credible in everything they do and their motivations are very clear eg. The Lilliputians' incessant suspicion of Gulliver, the Grignig, the (giant) dwarf's hatred of him to exploit his position as hips, Dr. Bate's attempt to get Gulliver turned out to be insane so he can marry Mary. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen is great as Mary Gulliver (another English-speaking English character with an American accent but never minded). She is a deeply troubled character because she has been waiting for nine years for her husband to return home, and when he finally does, he speaks of small people, giants, a flying island and talking horses! Mary, despite the strong fantasy element in history, is a very credible sign. <br /> <br /> The special effects are breathtaking, especially when one believes it was recorded on a TV scale at a time when CGI was in its infancy. It looks very realistic when we see a 6 foot tall man walking through a city filled with people who are 6 inches long. The comos are also good: Omar Sharif, Richard Wilson, Sir John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ned Beatty. All the great actors who create a strong support that complement Danson's outstanding plays. <br /> <br /> Houynhnhms and Yahoos are probably the most effective element in the story of the satire side of things: a society of talking horses that does not possess any of the vices that humans have while Yahoos is primitive disgusting people who strengthen strongly and appoint their leader depending on how disgusting he is. Gulliver and Mistress's study of them is also very well done and shows the differences and similarities between humans and Yahoos. <br /> <br /> The best version of "Gulliver's Travels" is one of the best mini-series ever.
