Interesting history and sympathetic treatment of racial discrimination, God's son is rather too long and contains something hammy, but on the whole it remains a fascinating film. History of a Chinese Transient as White (Rchard Barthelmess) begins as Barthelmess leaves college after being offended by a trio of brainless co-eds. He begins a world tour to discover and end up as a secretary to a British playwright (Claude King). In Monte Carlo he meets beautiful Alanna Wagner (Constance Bennett) and they fall in love. But when she discovers that he is Chinese, she goes on a memorable scene. <p> <p> Plagued by guilt and love, Alanna enters a mental spiral and makes a few attempts to contact Barthelmess. After his father dies, he takes over the business (bank?) And drones Chinese garb as a symbol of his hatred for the white race that has asked him. After a San Francisco detective, he tells the truth about his birth, barthelmess making the decision to honor his Chinese father and mother. <br /> <br /> And I agree that one reviewer here never saw this movie. Alanna declares her love for Sam before telling her about his latest discovery. And that makes all the difference in this movie. <br /> <br /> Barthelmess and Bennett each have a couple of scenes where they chew nature, but it is a solid and interesting drama. Frank Albertson is good as the nice college, Claude King is solid as playwright Bathurst, Bess Flowers has a scene as an Oklahoma Indian, and E. Alyn Warren is the Chinese father, Dorothy Mathews is nasty Alice. Not so good is Anders Randolf as Bennett's father and Mildred Van Dorn as Eileen. Also note the beautiful blonde to the right of Barthelmess on the roulette table. What an amazing one she was!
