I could see this movie all day! I love it. Probably my favorite movie ever. But by the way "badger1970" there are a few parts with bad language, not too bad, but it's not exactly G-rated. GREAT movie !!!!! I recommend it to everyone. Any way it makes me write 10 lines of text so I will continue to write until it will let me post this comment. Okay ... still writing ... it gets annoying. Ugh. I still have four more to go. Anyway, SEE THIS MOVIE! Even if you have already seen it. I don't usually! Have there been 10 lines yet? Nix. Only 2 more lines left. I don't even know why it wants me to do this. I think I'm done. Wait a minute, I'm NOT finished, SORRY, people. I know torture is listening to me. I think you shouldn't read this comment ... But you have to, because I wrote it. I've probably done it now. Finally goodbye.
