Being both a Dario Argento fan and a Phantom of the Opera fan, I die to see his first take on the story before the so-bad-good "Dario Argento Opera's Phantom of the Opera". The film is just amazing, even the plot, which is one of Argento's best in a coherent story. The way he transforms a classic novel story into a creepy slasher is just amazing. The film has a very nightmare feeling that helps keep you on the edge of your seat. The colors have never been better in an Argento movie since the falling "Suspiria". The murders are clever and wise, everything is done in Argento's trademark style. Things with the eyes of this movie are just disturbing and made some much better than in Fulci's splatter. The play is half-bad, but once you've seen the movie several times, you understand the characters' motivations better and you get used to it. My two biggest complaints about it are the use of rock music. I think it was a smart idea to mix beautiful opera fragments with heavy metal, but it is not done so well here. The end is very disappointing, which is the worst thing about the movie, which seems to echo Argento's former "Phenomena" but done terribly, it just didn't have to end that way. The same thing happened in the director's cut of "The Exorcist". I wanted them to keep the original end. But it's still a great movie and really a must-see if it's only for Daria Nicolodi's memorable kill sequence.
