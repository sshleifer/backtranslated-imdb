It seems that Hack has been described as unrealistic ... but that's what TV is. TV is meant to give an escape from everyday life, and I feel that Hack does a good job in that regard. Add to this the slow process of revealing its past and engaging / interesting plots; You just can't seem to get enough. Plus, with such great actors as David Morse, Andre Braugher, and even little Mathew Borish, what else can you ask for. So, if you are looking for an engaging experience and feel like "underdog" characters, I suggest giving Hack a chance, especially now that it finally comes out.
