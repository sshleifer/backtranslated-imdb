This movie is an excellent example of what an independent film can be. The director does an excellent job of driving the line between emotional and physical violence. But in the end he remembers what so many indie films forget - he tells a good story. When I looked at this movie, I was reminded of how oblique and everyday the greatest budget Hollywood movie has really become. <br /> <br /> Particularly noteworthy is the unusually strong performance of the movie's management - Jorge Cordova. As a vicious gang (on the way to the top of the crime heap), Cordova plays a connected, brutal, astonished, rude and blunt S.O.B., but he's so sympathetic that he keeps you entertained all the time. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that these guys were part of New Wave of Latino Filmmakers in Los Angeles - called La Nueva Obra, or something. In any way, this movie makes you enjoy watching more of their work. <br /> <br />
