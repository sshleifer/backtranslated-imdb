I very much enjoyed MUPPET MOVIE. It was the first of the Muppet films and is by far the best because it is so creative and fresh. With later movies, the ideas did not seem as original. But here we come to see Kermit and Miss Piggy riding bikes (an incredibly difficult scene), an excellent ensemble cast and just a lot of fun. I loved every minute the Muppets played, and I would have rated the movie much higher than a serious problem. In this and the subsequent Muppet films, some powers felt there needed to include many non-Muppets - especially many, many cameos from stars. Some worked fine (like Charles Durning's), but many just seemed irrelevant and slowed the picture to a grinding stop. Probably the worst of Edgar Bergan. Yes, he was a wonderful man who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his crew, but the little scene he was in was just not needed or was most of cameos. Yet, despite this great complaint, it is a great movie for the whole family - from the kids to even the most demanding adults.
