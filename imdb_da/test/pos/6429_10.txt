When, when will someone like Anchor Bay or Blue Underground release this on widescreen DVD ??? Le Orme, which I only know because of my rare / vintage video collection habit, is a movie in my collection that I would not only review but actually enjoy watching. The fact that Klaus Kinski is top billed but only in small parts of the film means a little to me. (Although several comments expressed disappointment in his rather limited screen time.) I can't say that this is a good scary movie, a good mystery, a sci-fi epic or something of that kind. It is simply unclassified in the "genre" sense of things. It is more like a confusing, scary (but not particularly violent or bloody) dream filled with great visuals and mysteries. It relies on visual and emotions, like Bava's "Lisa and the Devil". Both films are beautiful in almost every sense, but almost impossible to describe in a logical way; they both occur in such a dreamlike atmosphere. Not deterred by Force Videos synopsis on the back. It is infinitely more complex and exciting than that. Although the Force Video release from 1986 (the only one in the US that I know) is cropped to fullscreen on tape, even in that format, it's still great. Releasing it remastered and / or letterboxed would make it magnificent (hint, hint ... DVD companies).
