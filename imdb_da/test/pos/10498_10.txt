I watched this movie a while back and can't seem to track it down. Does anyone know where to get it? I feel worth seeing again. I'm sorry to say that I had never heard of Chloe Nicholle until this movie. Yes she can act. When I first started tracking this movie, I lost it to another of her movies, Sex Spa. The reason is like me, but the roles are the other way around. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I've seen Dru Berrymore. I watched some of her other movies and I feel she looks better like a blonde. <br /> <br /> I agree that this is a good introductory movie. Not too soft. Not too hard. You have to start somewhere.
