This movie is the most traumatic and painful horror movie I've ever seen in my life. Knowing that this movie is based on a true story and watching Jeffrey Dahmer (Carl Crew) brutal murder his victims is enough to get a tear for my eye. I admit this was a low budget movie with no the best dialogue, but it explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a psychotic maniac. When he was so selfish / inwardly emotional, his emotions and selfishness went so deep into his brain that it resulted in him becoming a killer. Every person whom he lured back to his apartment was attracted to and had feelings for, and the reasons he murdered them were not only the thrill of killing them, but because he could not cope with the fact that they left him . On the scene when he killed his first victim by basing an object on the back of the boy's head from what I noticed, it was not because he wanted to kill him, but because he was destroyed by the thought that the guy left him. It was from the moment he needed the homicidal behavior and killed his hobby - both for evil and emotional reasons. <br /> <br /> The scene when he spoke while he was crying on the phone with his mother and told her how much he loved her and the love he showed to his grandmother and how he would not move out of her house showed that he had love in his heart. One scene I found scary and weird was when a priest overheard Jeffrey in a pub that invited a guy back to his apartment and then Jeffrey phoned a phone box in the pub so the guy would lose patience and change to go home with Jeffrey. When the guy left the pub, the priest then hung the phone and was laughing at Jeffrey. I also found that Carl Crew played a remarkable performance as Jeffrey Dahmer. His evil and cold-blooded facial expressions before killing his victims were so real, I shook my seat. His facial expressions reminded me how Vincent D'onofrio (Private Pyle / Leonard) in the movie 'Full Metal Jacket' looked just before he slammed into the general in the toilet barracks. <br /> <br /> If your an emotional person, I would not recommend you to watch this movie, but if you don't, go ahead and see it.
