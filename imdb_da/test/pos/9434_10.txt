The evil Professor Moriarty discovers control of both SHERLOCK HOLMES and THE SECRET WEAPON, who could win the war for the Nazis. <br/> <br /> Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce return to the screen as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's beloved detective and sidekick, Sherlock Holmes & Dr. Watson, in this entertaining little mystery. Universal Studios wasted no money on either fancy production values ​​or a sensible script, knowing that its two stars would be all that an audience would need. In fact, Rathbone seems like the brain ego and Bruce as the bumbling id to actually become the characters they create, pleasing to keep their faces straight while they are involved in the most incredible nonsense. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hoey makes his first appearance as the hired inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard; In fact, with Bruce, the two kindhearted but pedantic fellows actually save the intellectually superior Holme's life twice. Lionel Atwill, an eerie champion who deserves more recognition for his talent, does a fine job as Moriarty, making the evil rascal an enemy worthy of Holm's steel and recreating the scenes where he gets to cause torture and pain. /> <br /> William Post Jr. and Kaaren Verne plays the Swiss scientist and his girlfriend who are in the heart of the mystery, but they do not get much to do. Sweet Mary Gordon makes a token look like Holmes' hostess, Mrs Hudson. <br /> <br /> Rathbone spice up his already classic interpretation of Holmes by appearing in disguise three times during the story and thus revealing the viewer the great lock was a bit of a ham actor at heart. <br /> <br /> This movie - based very loosely on elements of Sir Arthur's short stories 'The Dancing Men' and 'The Empty House' followed SHERLOCK HOLMES AND TERROR VOICE (1942) and preceded SHERLOCK HOLMES IN WASHINGTON (1943).
