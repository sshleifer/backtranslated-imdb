Punishment Park is a pseudo documentary produced by Peter Watkins. The premise is that the nation's dissidents (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) are rounded off and tried by a tribunal and then given prison elections or run during Punishment Park. It is a 52 mile grueling trek through the desert to an American flag, with the police, the National Guard and various other government figures in the persecution. The idea is that if you make it to the flag, you are free. The Tribunal consists of a lot of conservative types, all of whom condemn any behavior that is not their own and there is no result except a prison sentence or the possibility of "Punishment Park" for any of those who are trying. There are many things in this that are still poorly true today, which is quite disruptive in itself. The people who run the course are promised water at the halfway point, which is not true, and the previous officials are mostly a sadistic bunch just out of a bit of practice. This is not a very graphic movie, but it is more shocking in its ideas and themes than anything else. The scary thing is, it could happen. Not a very optimistic movie, but definitely worth seeing. Warning: It can make you angry. 9 out of 10
