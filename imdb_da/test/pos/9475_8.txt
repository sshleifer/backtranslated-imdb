This is the first James Cagney movie I've ever seen. I was never interested in his movie before, because I figured I didn't like anything in the style of cinema, and because I've heard most Cagney movies are the same. I have to say I really liked it. With today's standards of film, it wasn't special, but I found it surprisingly entertaining. Cagney didn't have a hard guy's appearance, but he played the part very well.
