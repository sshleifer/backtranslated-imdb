This is a very unusual movie that starts with a rich guy who gets a brand new sports car exam and decides to take it to a spin in the local city. Real boy meets poor girl in 'Mabel's Diner'who is a waitress, and the local boy's friend gets very sad and a fight begins. There is a car hunt and all sorts of problems seem to take place, and the rich boy and bad boy ceases to do community service as ordered by the judge. Rich boy and bad boy just do not come together and the rich boy wins heart and soul of the poor boy's girl friend. There are plenty of walks in the woods and poetry is quoted and some very deep thoughts about life. Poor Girl says, "Some people go through life and never find love, I can say I found love and hold on to it". You need some tissue if you are sensitive, there are lots of romantic scenes, and I doubt very much whether you will guess how this image will end. The producer and the director came up with a good idea and finally put a film at stake. If you like true life stories with poetry and very sensitive issues, it's your movie.
