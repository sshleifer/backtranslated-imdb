*** Spoilers ahead *** My late childhood had two cinematic icons: Star Wars and this movie of Czech genius Karel Zeman. A Jules Verne Encyclopedia, where XIX century illustrations come to life in exquisite black and white photography combined with stop motion and conventional animation. Verne's fairy tale spirit is fully present throughout the film, as well as a very modern question of the moral boundaries of power and advanced technology. In fact, it brings atomic energy to Verne's universe in a very elliptical and elegant way. Also elliptical and elegant is the destruction of the villain, with a (probably nuclear) explosion that sends his hat flying over the sea. The movie's resolution is symbolic and very satisfying, something very rare today, as many movies do not seem to know how to end. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to catch this gem in reruns on local television in the late 70's: it increased my enjoyment of Verne's fiction and cinema. 10 out of 10 to Karel Zeman, underestimated fantasy master.
