I finally managed to watch this movie ... after so many years of expectation ... I was so curious to see if this movie is as bad as some say .. <br /> <br /> And my opinion is that this movie it was not bad at all, on the contrary it was AMAZING ... I enjoyed every second from it ... from the beginning to the end ... The actors were great, they sent me the feeling that I was living the story while filming played ... The landscapes were so beautiful the movie was shot ... and it charmed me .. Also the music was extraordinary and I have nothing <br /> <br /> to blame .. <br /> <br /> I think the plot was very original I don't think I saw a movie like this ... It's a shame that it's not recognized all over the world .. to bad for those who didn't get the chance to see it. I give this movie 10/10
