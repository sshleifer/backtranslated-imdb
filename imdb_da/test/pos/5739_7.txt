Paul Naschy as a ghostly security guard in this is frightening than most of his fur shoe polish wolf. The story is not unknown, a bunch of children going to the party at an abandoned school. The case is that one of these children's fathers did the same year ago, but he is now deceased and the last group of children seems to relive an event 23 years ago. This is quite well done for movies of this type, and there is an air of mystery for what's going on, because apparently what happened to the kids before is something of a mystery and perhaps the truth was not revealed. So no, not just your standard dial and dice. This moves along with a pretty good cut and doesn't let you lose interest as a lot of movies do, and the oddball story is convincing enough to keep you interested too and there's excitement missing in many movies these days. The ending is quite abrupt, and I assume that it is left to your imagination, but it does not make it welcome either. 7 out of 10, check it out.
