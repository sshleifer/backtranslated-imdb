I watched this movie in Wales in July. It's about the Czech pilots flying many missions to the RAF after their country had been occupied by the Nazis. In this film, the action takes place both in the early 1950s, when these pilots are beaten in political prisons in Czeckoslavakia and during World War II in Britain. They were imprisoned after their return to their homeland because the Communist regime considered these warriors a threat to their occupation of Czeckoslavia. The pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during many air battles against Nazi pilots. This film contains a love subject that makes sense because it helps us understand that both civilians and soldiers have made great sacrifices to preserve democracy. The end of this movie indicates that the hero of these Czech pilots were finally recognized in the early 1990s after the restoration of democracy in the country, which is then called Czeckoslavakia. This powerful and moving film was made with financial support from the Czech Government. I highly recommend this movie.
