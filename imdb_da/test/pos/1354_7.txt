If Sicily is a baroque area, with its doubling of perspective, it is part of the realism of this movie's challenge. And this is an exciting pleasure here, exaggerating Fellini with not one but three movie directors, plus of course the actual Bellocchio, who has made some really good movies and should not be careful with his honor. There are a variety of take and casting improvisations on Manzoni's "I promessi sposi" with, a place there, the actual marriage. Sicily is also being a territory of skulduggery (You already know this version of the island, so there is no spoiler involved), a cartoon version that makes the picture worth seeing for Sergio Castellito's watchdog work on the floor of the big hall of a palazzo.
