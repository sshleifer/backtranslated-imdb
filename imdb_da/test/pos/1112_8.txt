We see a man moving from town to "out-back" and changing dramatically - his family is asking questions, but he is getting angry. <br /> <br /> Strange screening movie here in Israel. Amazing places, amazing actors, a movie that masks like a "thriller", but which is more a case study of madness in the lead. <br /> <br /> The film was far beyond the other films that were screened as part of the AICE festival here in Israel. Good luck to the team that came to this movie. It is a Grand Guignol, a small masterpiece of noir. My only criticism that prevents a "10" is that the sound and music are overwhelming at times. It tends to get in the way of the pictures that speak for themselves.
