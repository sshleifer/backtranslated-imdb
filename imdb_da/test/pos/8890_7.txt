A delicious spooky black comedy about a middle-aged schlub (Danny DeVito) who wants to encounter her mother and smells a plan to do so with a bitter divorce who wants to encounter her former wife. The film is totally inappropriate in its cynicism, and gives us no one to suffer, but for once it works in the favor of the film rather than as an extinguisher. Anne Ramsey, as DeVito's mass of mum, steals the show in a grotesque fun performance. Although she is a horror, you end up blushing for her, as she seems to be able to kick both the DeVito's and Crystal's donkeys at the same time with both hands tied behind her back. <br /> <br /> Degree: B +
