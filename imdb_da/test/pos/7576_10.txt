Glenn Close is back as Sarah Plain and Tall, a woman who holds a family together through the good and bad times. The action is amazing - Christopher Walken (exceptionally non-spooky), as her husband once again delivers a leading performance. It is good to see young Christopher Bell all adults. too bad we didn't see much of Anna (Lexi Randall, also a few years older), but the new addition to the Witting family (played by Emily Osment) was very welcome. And finally, Jack Palance, as the far lost Witting patriarch, is as good as ever.
