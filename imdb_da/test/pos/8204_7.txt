You could get into the nitty gritty of this movie and say how it couldn't happen or how could the protagonist just go into offices and start using computers etc. Without anyone noticing and really choosing the movie for bits ... or You could just sit back with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the actor. Personally, I prefer the latter, I live real life and look at the news with everything that is stupid and gloomy, and it will be much more entertained by my movies and watch the evil get their equal rewards. Don't take it seriously and you can thoroughly enjoy this movie.
