Everything about "Select Connor" was top = drawer, especially the manuscript and the highly skilled work done by the 21-year-old director, author, producer Luke Eberl. . . a talented young man from whom to expect great things. All the play was credible, the dialogue smart, the theme important. Loved it !!! <br /> <br /> Looked at the 2007 Woodstock Film Festival where it was screened twice and walked enormously with the audience. It is more than just a movie in the future - this child learns a hard, heart-breaking lesson on trust, politics and the "system" - how things really work to fit the personal agendas of them in powerful positions. <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone with a working brain.
