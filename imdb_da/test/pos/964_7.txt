I don't expect much of this story about a child whose journal is stolen and turned into a movie script .. who then travels to Hollywood to be just .. but .. hey .. it's still a funny movie. Frankie Muniz from "Malcom in the Middle" celebrates stars as the child and is pretty good, and Amanda Bynes as her friend is also very good. Yes, the film seems like an advertisement for the Universal Studios theme park and is really quite a stupid kids movie .. but I enjoyed it anyway. GRADE: B-
