Sixth (and last) movie in the boxset. Well, look like I've saved the best at last. Ghoulies IV. I originally made a review for this back in February, but I decided to make a new one. The Ghoulies series is pretty amazing. I know there are some people who don't like them and that's fine. This happens to be my favorite in the series. Yes, I know the actual Ghoulies are not shown and replaced by 2 guys in costumes, one of whom is Tony Cox from Bad Santa. Now on the movie. The film centers around Jonathan Graves, the protagonist of the first film being played again, by Peter Liapis, who is now the police officer of the LAPD and has laid his occult behind him. During the first part of the film, we meet Alexandra (The Game of the Very Warm Stacie Randall), who communicates with a demon from the other than Faust, who is the dark side of Jonathan. Faust asks Alexandra for a red jewel, and something goes wrong, so the ghouls release from beyond. <br /> <br /> I think Jim Wynorski did a good job of steering. And the music of Chuck Cirino is also fun. (SPOILER AHEAD) At the end of this movie, Ghoulies says there will be a Ghoulies IV, Part 2 or Ghoulies V. I still hope the sequel will be made, and I especially hope Jim Wynorski returns to live. I agree with GimboTheGhoulies about it.
