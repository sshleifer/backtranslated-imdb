I'm not really sure what to do about this movie, especially after watching a great movie like La Notte. Unfortunately I saw this in German during an Antonioni film festival at the Frankfurt Film Museum, so I couldn't hear Malkovich's big voice. He is supposed to link four stories of couples in Italy. But as good as an actor as he is, Malkovich cannot save the most ridiculous of the four stories depicted here: A woman coming up to him at a waterfront cafe near a shop she owns and knocks out how she killed her father nearby. Then they go home, have sex, and he leaves. It looks as if Antonioni had lost the subtlety that had been in previous films (like The Passenger) when it came to sex and replaced it with blatant nudity. <br /> <br /> But inappropriate is the story, the movie has two things that make it visible: the eye and ear candy. The actors and actors are all beautiful people, and the cinematography is wonderful - scenes in ancient Italian cities contrasting slightly in a high rise apartment overlooking a town (reminiscent of La Notte). Ear candies, but it's really worth the film. U2 and Brian Eno collaborated on "Your Blue Room" and "Beach Sequence", both of which set the mood perfectly in the movie. The songs are available on "Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1."
