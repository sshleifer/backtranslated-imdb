I just watched this movie at an advanced screening. I had not read the book and knew nothing about the story, but went because the book was voted "Book of the Year" by two local colleges. So I can't compare the book with the movie, as others have done. <br /> In short, I thought it was an incredibly moving story. The action was credible, and insight into Afghan culture and political history was both interesting and shocking. My eldest friend is Iranian-American, and so I felt an affinity for certain Middle Eastern values ​​and traditions depicted in the movie as they reminded me of the times I spent with my family. <br /> <br /> The themes of friendship, family, human values ​​and courage under fire are universal and well developed in the movie. I do not want to disclose the plot details, as these can be obtained elsewhere. But based on the film's technical aspects, the play, and above all its heartbreaking story, I would definitely recommend this movie.
