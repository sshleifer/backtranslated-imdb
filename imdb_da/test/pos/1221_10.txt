This movie was amazing! Tangi Miller and Flex did a good job. They both look good together and they both pulled it off. Tasha Smith was as fun as the cousin and she couldn't stay out of her business. Esenence held down for her girl when she needed her. Aloma was sweet and played a dear grandmother she really reminded me of my grandmother. And I can't forget the strip, he was so find, and I didn't know if I should cover my eyes or smile while I saw he reveal his sexiness on the big screen. The lady! he was fine! Tangi looked flawless and sexy, and she went up a notch since Felicity. All over the film had a lot of "A" List actors and actress. It was fun, sexy, crazy, touching, loving, emotional, and wonderful. This movie is a must see! Take it to DVD now if it doesn't!
