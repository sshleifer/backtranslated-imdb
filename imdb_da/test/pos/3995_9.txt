It is not surprising that this movie was made by I am Kwon Taek at the time it was. He examined the early beauty and tragedy of the Chosun Dynasty's life in Seopyonje, and explored a well-known Korean folk history in Chunhyang, and included his last two films. What is most surprising is that Chi Hwa Seon, his 2002 offer, is not presented in the pansori style of the two previous films. <br /> <br /> I have come through the experienced hand. We examine together the life of a real person: a nineteenth-century song, the Chosun dynasty that rides on the edge of modernity but which is not noble, and which, because of it, creates a stir in modern Korean society with its fame and his public and artistic expression of contempt for the old Korean noble class and his contempt for Japanese ruling colonies. The painter Chang Seung Up, popularly known as Oh Won (performed splendidly by Choi Min Sik, the famous star of Park Chan Wook's already legendary "OldBoy") is becoming increasingly influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film. Modern Korean audiences will return a hero like this despite the fact, or perhaps because of the fact that he was so excluded in his time. I am a sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remain intact. I am a champion to capture his country's past idiosyncrasies, and in this movie he is almost incapable. As expected in a movie, the cinematography is breathtaking, editing is accurate, and the story is central. Plots are set against Seung Up, family ties are being tested and broken, scandalous behavior allegedly (and sometimes right), all to bring that man down as "painted fire." However, against all the difficulties that I have been detailed, but sometimes negligible, of Seung Up's life, Seung Up manages to survive in some way. He becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after just one look. Art dealers and agents defeat him and try to make money from "Oh Won." In other words, peoples who want to exploit the real Seung Up, an artistic star, begin to form. But he refuses to be manipulated. His wisdom, which saves both the massive hordes and the imperial shortcomings, impresses the audience if not cast. <br /> <br /> What does Seung Up think? He has strong feelings and opinions on painting, such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and never completely finished. He despises those who would try to make art a profit. And he doesn't care for politicians who use their power to bring artistic beauty around them and then throw the artist as treacherous. But he also believes that painting plays a role in the upcoming upheavals. Horrid scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented. I am the signature historical epic motif, and his influence in the kingdom remains on prominent screen in this multi-million dollar epic. The protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care about him when he refuses to paint. It is here that history takes a whole new meaning, one that is not only political but social in nature. I take on the problems in legally realistic fashion. <br /> <br /> He, Oh Won, becomes a Jesus figure. The people believe in him capable of artistic miracles, and the government feels that it needs his artistic support, but the protagonist remains immensely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or be. Eventually, both government and people come down to Seung Up in a way that is taken straight out of the Bible. His holiness becomes human; His humanity is not accepted; He dies for (or escapes from) the sins of sinners, the art critics, the politicians who hire him. <br /> <br /> But does he die? As with most of my movies, there is still a question. In this case, Seung Up really becomes an immortal hermit? The film does not address this issue; It presents only one possible end to the real man of Chang Seung Up or Oh Won. No death is depicted because no death is known. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find fault with this movie, but I've become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in its culture that when it does, it no longer surprises. As usual for movies, movies, editing and writing are all first rate. It is a well-designed film that is imbued with being an eerie story-telling ability. Granted, he can do best by doing this through the ancient Korean musical art of pansori. The film nevertheless contains stretches of this admirable art form, and in the end the viewers feel as if they have become a great, incredible story. And they have, because it is precisely I am a gift.
