A young Frenchman raises himself as he becomes an Erasmus exchange student in Barcelona and comes back to a better man. Sounds boring? No way! The film is filled with colorful people, all stereotypes (the British twat and her racist brother, the sexually liberated Dane, the ultra-organized German, ...). In this case, however, the stereotypes are excellently done. You want to know people like that (I know an arrogant doctor and his wife and wife, and they are like the characters in the movie!) You feel like real people! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and enjoy the subtitles!
