The performances of the male leaders make this long-lasting travel interesting throughout. The soundtrack of the pioneers' sons is one of the most beautiful I have heard. The journey itself is somewhat episodic, and Joanne Dru is badly mistaken. All in all, this is a very cordial and cordial western.
