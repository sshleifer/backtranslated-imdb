I love this movie. The chemistry between the two leads Miller and Carlisle is amazing, they spark so well out of each other and create an unlikely comedy Duo. Alan Cumming is funny, his enthusiasm for the role is clearly evident when he camps it up. The action is amazing, and it's a really entertaining and touching movie. Not the greatest movie ever made, I admit, but it's a lot of fun and I would recommend to those who enjoy other gritty Brit flicks. Includes some of the best British actors, including Michael Gambon, so you can't go far wrong. Watch out for cameos from David Walliams and Matt Lucas from Little Britain and Rock: Profile Fame.
