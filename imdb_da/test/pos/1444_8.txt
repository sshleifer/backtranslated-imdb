Lots of scenes and dialogue are flat, but when you add it all, ie. The machine's daily cycle from depressing walkup to depressing bar to depressing burlesque halls to depressing smoky poker games and home again, gives you a weird sense that somebody somewhere is trying to give a faithful portrayal of the junkie's life around 1955. Whether it's Sinatra, which of course would have bumped up against this type of character grows up in Hoboken and works in many bands, or Preminger, who uses the soundtrack and the Frankie-Zosch subtitle to release the abuser's inner world view past the Hays Code cage, you get a good companion to On the Waterfront, which was filmed almost exactly the same time. Kind of a faux-realistic work that leaves you realistic to wonder how deeply the drug culture is embedded in American life.
