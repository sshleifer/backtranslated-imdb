I really enjoyed this movie. For them, they did not have the corny special effects that the big budget films have. The action was decent in this, only you can tell from bats that it is dubbed, but when you come across that fact and you can't change language on the DVD version, it's cool. The baseline was very unique, you take a situation like a heat wave that is very common around the world, especially in Frankfurt, which I have been to many times, and you take a waste strike, which often happens enough in this country and you have a recipe for disaster. I loved how the rats' hordes just went everywhere and how the idea that if you picked up the rubbish is the last thing you want to do, you get it, the rats don't get what they want, they are essentially after the waste. picking up so you wonder if garbage men are on strike, who picks up the garbage, private contractors, yet military wants to quarantine out of town, inappropriate things to do, then you would get all the rats to take over the city, then throw in A mayor who wants to keep a cover on the budget and line his pockets, you have a realistic movie, and the female leader is also a pleasure to watch on the screen, a very decent movie I thought would wish more was made as This, another little nitpick is the exhibition of Frankfurt could have been done a little better, but for the average viewer who has never been to Frankfurt ... I was born in Germany and been in Frankfurt many times .. it won ' no matter, m An all in all a big big thumbs up.
