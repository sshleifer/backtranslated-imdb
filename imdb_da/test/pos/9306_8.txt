Fat Man and Little Boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs that were dropped in reverse order on Nagasaki and Hiroshina. How this came and came to be in American hands is the story of this movie. For example, the terms are codenamed on two bombs burned with plutonium and uranium. Fat Man was the plutonium bomb, and one was dropped on Nagasaki, and Little Boy was the one used on Hiroshima. The film is primarily a conflict between General Leslie R. Groves of the US Army and physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the team of scientists who developed the bomb under Grove's direction. With two men from so divergent backgrounds as these, conflict was inevitable. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, whose entire life has been a disarmament activist, plays General Groves. For his credit, Newman does not play a man whose views he had very little in common with any kind of caricature. Groves is a military man primarily with a technological background. He wanted a combat command as trained military professionals would naturally have in this greatest war. But due to his background in the engineering business, Groves got the head of the Manhattan project, which was what the effort was codenamed. Then, Newman is determined to make his contribution to the number of war efforts. <br /> <br /> Most of us first became acquainted with Dwight Schultz from the A-team as H.M. The Murdoch pilot, whose grip on reality at best is foolish. If you were only familiar with the A-team, you might think that Schultz had a great future in comic roles. <br /> <br /> Instead, Dwight Schultz is one of the best actors in the English-speaking world with an amazing range of dramatic parts since leaving the television series. J. Robert Oppenheimer in life was a complex man who recognized the dangers and benefits of nuclear energy. The problem also challenges him. Later, Oppenheimer entered a true volume because of his left-wing political views and contributors, all of whom knew how to enter the Manhattan project. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller roles that stand out are Bonnie Bedelia as Mrs Oppenheimer, Natasha Richardson as Oppenheimer's Communist mistress, whose affair with Oppenheimer got him in such a jackpot later, and Laura Dern as a nurse on the Los Alamos site. <br /> <br /> But the best thing is John Cusack, who, like Michael Merriman, is a combination of some real scientists who might be exactly like the first nuclear fatalities in the nuclear age. His scenes with Laura Dern, especially with what happens to him, take a real poignancy. <br /> <br /> The debate on the bombs as their use is still a matter of fierce debate. Fat Man and Little Boy present the facts and let you decide what could have happened if an alternative use had been made of them.
