Bug Juice changed my life. I know it sounds strange, weird, weird. But it did. I'm from England, Bug Juice never aired there, but five years ago I went on vacation with my family and saw it on the Disney Channel. When I saw this television series, I was hooked, I would go. It took very convincing for my parents to let my brother and I go to Waziyatah. I have been since I was 12 and it was my first year this summer. If you are a teenager, reading this coming to this camp, it changes your life. you make lifelong friends on the wazi. It doesn't matter who you are, or if someone at home doesn't like you, everyone likes you in the camp. You have so much fun. To look at, go to www.wazi.com and check it out yourself. It's so much fun I love it there It's my home away from home
