Johnny Knoxville and Jackass's boys cross the top to "Jackass's second." At a press screening, the laughter was so loud and raucous that it was difficult to hear the whole dialogue. The stunters are over the top, and the pranks are more fun and outrageous than ever before. <br /> <br /> All the guys put their limbs on the line to make a good movie and they succeeded. If you like this genre, you will love this movie. If not, don't bother. <br /> <br /> Some of the funniest bitters are the spears that guys play on themselves and they have no regard for what's happening to them. They will do everything possible to do a stunt job. <br /> <br /> Many critics pancreated Johnny Knoxville for a less active role in the first movie, but didn't worry, he was in front and in the middle of number two, and they had enough footage in the can to be halfway through a number tree. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for fans of this kind of humor. <br /> <br /> Chris Sansone, entertainment editor, Fort Bend Herald
