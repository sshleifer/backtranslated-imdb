I own this movie on DVD and I've seen it about 10 times and it's still fun. The witnesses never get boring, and I often like to laugh at inappropriate times, just thinking about them. The principle is that Richard and Eddie of Bottom Fame own the cheapest hotel in the UK next to a nuclear power plant. They desperately need cash, and when a movie star in hiding comes to be lucky, they may just be in. To watch this movie and not become completely bored or disgusted, you first have to be humorous. Some will say that only hardcore fans really enjoy watching it. But in general it's a good movie.
