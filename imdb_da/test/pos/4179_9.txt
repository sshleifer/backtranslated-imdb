That this movie flopped in the cashier's office and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today is a great shame - yet quite appropriate. The commercial suicide Monkees committed by making this film is reflected by the metaphorical suicide they commit on the screen. To ruin so brutally, their carefully constructed image as a healthy American alternative to the Beatles is brave for rashness, as is the ability to be no more than a peasant in the entertainment industry, captured (in the film, literally) in their own artistry. Monkee's TV series was not that conventional, but HEAD is completely plotless ... although it is finally a kind of circular logic for everything. On the other hand, unlimited of a true story, the surrealistic sequence of events is fun and quite disruptive. The biggest irony is that the monks effectively signed their certificates of death as a commercial force at a time when they reached their artistic peak. Their exploration in psychedelia reached its zenith with the soundtrack to HEAD (all the songs are noticeably woven into the film), which is one of the landmarks of the 1960s. The monks began to disintegrate after the cashier competition in this movie, but HEAD serves as a noble heritage.
