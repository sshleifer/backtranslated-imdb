Wealthy businessman Bill Compton (played by Dennis Patrick) accidentally kills his daughter's hippie girlfriend. Panic-hit, he retires to a bar and meets Joe Curran (played by Peter Boyle): a noisy, angry, bigot, bitter about how his beloved country has become. Inadvertently, Bill allows Joe to find out that he has just killed a hippie. And that's just the beginning. "Joe" is a classic movie of an unlikely friendship. A bond between two men, one of a white collar background, the other of a blue-collar background. Bill & Joe have one thing in common, they are horrified at how crazy the world has become. Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle have both given very realistic portraits of their characters. Director John G. Avidsen with this "pre-rocky" effort leads this low-budget gem with the same finesse as a $ 100 million budget movie. The script is read with excellent character development and very snappy, realistic dialogue. Despite its strengths, this film has its weaknesses. The manuscript falls asleep about 3/4 of the way through, but it wakes up in time for the crushing climax. This film also features a very early and uninspiring performance by a 24-year-old Susan Sarandon, as Bill's daughter Melissa, along with her hippie boyfriend Frank, very gently exhibited by Patrick Mc Dermott. One could only be grateful that he was killed early in the film. Despite its few flaws, it is one of the forgotten movies of the 70s that should not be. Although "Joe" is very dated to today's standards, chemistry between Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle is quite relevant today, and it's the glue that holds the whole movie together.
