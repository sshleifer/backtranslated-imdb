This is one of the better-sensitive movies in 1999 with Kate Capshaw, who heads an all-star cast for a small town and a love letter. First, nature is beautiful, and anyone who sees this movie and does not want to move to this location is crazy! For the role, Capshaw is great as the leading actress who captures the emotional rollercoaster role. Tom Everett Scott is charming as the "author" of the note throughout the movie, and the always lovely Ellen Degeneres is fun! Blythe Danner and the actress who plays the bookshop's saleswoman are both fantastic. Although not successful, the film is great, as it is both short and sweet and very romantic. 10.10
