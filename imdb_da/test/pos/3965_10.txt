If I had seen this movie when I hit the bottom, I would probably have sunk into my life's deepest depression and perhaps have been almost desperate enough to try it out, the only thing in the real world when you rob millions of dollars unsuspecting individuals do not all come up with praise (unless you are an investment banker or government affiliate) so how does it matter? I was rejected from school after school and it closes so it is a brilliant subject for a movie and when you give yourself to the imaginary to let you watch the movie without using real world ramifications it can really touch anyone In that situation, let them know that they are not alone. Exaggerated soliloquy completely destroys the established education system as we know it. The only thing I can say is that as I am in college now, looking back at where I was and looking at this movie, I can really appreciate it in a way I would never have otherwise. it is juvenile and brave yes, but it is an emotional and uplifting fantasy of freedom, and I cannot think of a better way to end my night.
