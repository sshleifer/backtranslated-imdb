Co-directed by and starring Rutger Hauer, this movie card was based on a short story by Dutch author Harry Murlisch. <br /> <br /> In the 10 minutes of the movie's length you will see a lifetime as 'Harry' unravels his long-term fascination with a room he is constantly passing through in his youth. Back to the city many years later, he finds that he has rented the same room. <br /> <br /> Using black and white film, the textures are accentuated in this delicate story of a story. The voice of 'Harry' draws you into his world. <br /> <br /> A subtle, tight performance from Rutger Hauer and 2 non-speaking characters. Wonderful soundtrack by the Dutch musician Dyzack. <br /> <br /> Currently, this movie is hard to see as it is only available on DVD region 2 "L'infidele" (Liv Ullman) as a bonus slot. But due to being on the re-released DVD of "The Hitcher" - another tight but very different performance from Hauer! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you can!
