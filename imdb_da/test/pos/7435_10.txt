I really love this movie !!! I haven't played Final Fantasy VII, but I still loved the movie, it's really fun, and I love the job the voice-over actors have done. The visuals are so amazing, and all the lines are so well done. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have a pretty good imagination so I could fill most gaps that the movie was presented and I suggest you see it twice because many things "suddenly" make sense . <br /> <br /> Also (this is quite fun) you have to look at the subtitles because they say and what they say is sometimes quite different. It's really quite fun, but sometimes it helps you understand what they say better. <br /> <br /> See it !!! love Marnie
