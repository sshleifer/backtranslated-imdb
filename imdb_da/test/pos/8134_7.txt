This was Laurel and Hardy's last sound film for Roach Studios. But since the public had a real thirst for "talkies", the same short was restored by the team just a few years later with only a few small plot changes. LAUGHING GRAVY was pretty much the same plot except that Stan and Ollie tried to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlord - not a goat as in ANGORA LOVE. This whole goat's angle is the worst part of the movie. While you could understand the boys who want to keep a cute little dog (after all, it's snowy outside), why exactly they bring a goat home is just constructed and pointless. According to the plot, the goats followed them home and then they were tired of shooing it away and holding it. Huh? It just doesn't make sense - if it had been a giraffe or a cow, would they have done the same thing? Apart from being a compelling plot, the film itself is pure Laurel and Hardy, with a well-known plot and known roles for the comedians. This movie contains a few laughs, but unfortunately it is not one of their better movies to pack up in their quiet career. This aspect of their career just seems to have ended with a nap.
