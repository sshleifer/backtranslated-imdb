A fun romp ... many good twists! (and we weren't even baked!) <br /> <br /> Didn't know that this movie even existed until we saw the extra trailers on a Monty Python DVD ... (oddly, along with The City of Lost Children and Baron Munchauhsen's adventures <br /> <br /> The plot keeps you wondering all over. <br /> <br /> The action was amazing ... Hank Azaria shows his talent again, Bill Bob is Billy Bob ... (wecis?) Definitely worth seeing.
