I'm not sure how the IMDb "weighted average" came up with such a low rating on this movie. It is in my opinion and of all other accounts an overlooked gem of a movie. Rip Tower is great as the stubborn Noel Lord, and Tantoo Cardinal superlative as his housemate. Turned out and cardinal are both undervalued actors who finally get a step to work their craft. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is not always comfortable, but it is very right. This is NOT the "humor and touching love story", it is considered as the DVD jacket. In the end, it's a tragedy. The Lord is simply looking too high and ignoring all the advice to take the money the energy company offers to move. <br /> <br /> The music is great, just as time goes on.
