I love this movie! I know some people might say it wasn't a good movie, but I really disagree. Comedy is the classic Mel Brooks style, and the actors were excellently chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines like Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood thinking of you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude to this type of movie. Dave Chappelle is, of course, much bigger now, but at that time it was his first movie and he did an excellent job as Achoo. The characters were all very well planned out and everyone added their own little quirks to the movie. I highly recommend renting this movie and enjoying it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some close friends!
