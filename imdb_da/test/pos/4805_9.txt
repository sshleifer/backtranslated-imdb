Fantastic, in-depth crime warrior starring Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan. <br /> <br /> From the dizzying opening sequence to the extremely satisfying conclusion, this cat and mousas hardly miss a stroke. <br /> <br /> Johnny To, who again works with the ace composer Arthur Wong, designs another operative action that caves against his contemporaries. <br /> <br /> Images are strong and moving. His cut combined with the extraordinary music tracks is exemplary. You're in the hands of a master movie. <br /> <br /> The two sequences where Andy Lau "hides" from the police on a bus pretending to accompany a beauty (Ruby Wong) are testament to Two's unique directorial skills. <br /> <br /> Lau Ching Wan is strong and commanding as the harassed policeman, while Andy Lau is dynamic as a dying man who discourages his father's death. <br /> <br /> This is great film production, only mildly compromised by some bad English dubbing in a scene with criminal Waise Lee.
