This is a movie remarkable for what does not appear as much as for what is. What is shown is the incredible poverty in Sicily that the 19th century gave way to the 20th, a lifestyle that made people dream of the 'New' World of America. The Mancuso family lives in a place that is not even a village, just a stone house situated in the middle of the hard, inflexible stones of a country that cannot even offer a single leaf of green grass. An opening order sees the Mancuso men shrink barefoot on a sharp hillside, rocks in their mouths to offer on a holiday at the top of prey for a sign that they are going to face the new world or stay where they are. It also shows life aboard the liner, hassled masses indeed, longing to breathe and conditions in Ellis Island, where their journey is still not over and explored to prove their 'fitness' to enter America. What is NOT shown is the ship in Longshot, or indeed any shot that would identify it as a great, ocean-going liner; Whatever is not shown is something that would identify America, no clich√© view of New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty, so Ellis Island could be anywhere in any country. Perhaps the most notable shot is the one coming from a camera crane that looks down on hundreds of people stuck together; Slowly, almost imperceptibly, two-thirds of the people on Screen Left start to distinguish themselves from the third on the screen to the right, and we realize that the ones on the left are actually aboard the ship, and the ones on the right are on the quay, a strong social record fragmented. There is a strong documentary feeling all the way through as if we were following a true ship full of immigrants, even though it has been carefully scripted and clearly is a merging of typical families / conditions at that time. With almost nothing happening dramatically, it's not for the popcorn brigade at Multiplex, but for the rest of us it's a very nice movie.
