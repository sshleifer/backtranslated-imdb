Michael Poly's hypnotic "Northfork" is a movie that will remain in one's memory for quite some time. This exquisite film written by Michael and Mark Polish is visually one of the best things that came out last year from the world of independent films. The film is beautifully photographed by M. David Mullen, with a joking score of Stuart Matthewman. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, you may need to stop reading here. <br /> <br /> The idea to put the film in Montana was a big hit for the Polish brothers. Never has the majestic view of the country and the mountains been as vibrant as in "Northfork". We don't need any color! The beauty is in the dark tones of the film that enhances the tale of the desert in this distant outer post. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the story, Irwin is the sick child of the mysterious father Harlan. This boy is seen in his bed, where the friendly priest administers the drug to his body. But is he really there at all? We see him interacting with the odd group we first meet around the cemetery. There are two freshly open graves. Will one of them be for Irwin? <br /> <br /> At the same time, another plot plays parallel to this first theme. We see the six men in black who have come to the area to remove from the area as many as they can. This will be the bed of the man-made lake that will be created. Their reward is one acre and one half of the lake in front of the property if they move a certain amount of people. <br /> <br /> The third story line centers on the mysterious group composed of Flower Hercules, Cup of Tea, Cod and Glad. They follow an opportunity for a link to an angel who has been injured in this area. When Irwin meets them in the cemetery, he offers to help only if they take him away at least a thousand miles from here. We look at the quartet examining the feathers that the boy has placed among the pages of his Bible. Could Irwin be that angel? <br /> <br /> The closing sequence shows us all parties who leave Northfork in different directions. The men in black ride their cars, maybe go home to enjoy the newly acquired properties that are given them as a reward. The mysterious group is seen aboard an aircraft and departs for a higher place. We are also aware that the child in father Harlan, despite the drugs and care he received from the sanitary figure, is dead. <br /> <br /> Michael Polish has one of the best ensembles that works from all the main characters. Nick Nolte, whose father Harlan turns a low key performance into his portrayal of this kind of man. James Woods, who Walter, one of the men working for the developer, does a good job. The biggest surprise is Duel Farmer, who gives an excellent impression as Irwin. This children's actor, with the right guidance, shows great promise. <br /> <br /> The mysterious group is brilliantly traded by Daryl Hannah, Robin Sachs, Ben Foster and Anthony Edwards, the man with the funny glasses. Peter Coyote, Mark Polish, Ben Foster, and the rest of the cast are flawless during Mr. Polish direction. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie depends on its simplicity. Mr. Poland's vision will haunt one's memory. The pictures of Montana, which may be an unreal landscape, are one of the best things in American movies for a while.
