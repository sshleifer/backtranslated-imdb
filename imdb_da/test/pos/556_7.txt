Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August, a single mother who is the working definition of the word "dreamer" and her solemn pragmatic daughter. Adele, who wants to make a new start in a big city, moves them from Wisconsin to California. <br /> <br /> Decent, if not unusual or particularly memorable, with some serious and sad moments. It pushes some emotional buttons, that's for sure. The best thing it gives is a solid cast, and Sarandon and Portman are quite good in the leaders - though their characters are one-dimensional at times. <br /> <br /> Could be better, could be worse. <Br /> <br /> I gave this one out of ten.
