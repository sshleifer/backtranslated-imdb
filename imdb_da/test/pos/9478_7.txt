At the beginning of the film, Cagney's Johnny Cave character tells his chewing gum in the Office of Weights and Measures that the unscrupulous shop owners over the past year had cheated the US consumer with more money than the overall National War Debt! Then he goes out and tickets a particularly greasy green grocery store to sell him a sugar bag that is four ounces (oh, horrors !!) and a skinny chicken that his slaughterer's scale has quite generously proclaimed to be six pounds. Then the fur - or in this case feather - flies. Are, fly. When a racket in the politician's clothing tries to trace a study of the practice of the bad poultry dealer, our hero becomes a lone wolf, who wields the war of war on behalf of housewives throughout America. After all, there are four cents here and a quarter there, and before we know it, we have anarchy! Words of his irreconcilability soon reach both the mayor and the governor's offices, and Cagney becomes a significant man. If that sounds stupid, it is not - the dishonest retail practice is just a plot tool (or as Hitchcock would say, McGuffin) and it is unfamiliar, it also works here as well as any Treasury Agent or G-man anthology where the fight is taken to shady villains working outside the interests of the country's common good. The production standards are definitely Grade B, but it is Cagney who makes this movie a pleasure that it is: This was his first movie away from Warner Brothers after seeking release in court from his unfair contract and he seems to be calm and enjoying themselves immensely - the performance here is intelligent and crackled with its unique energy and surefire charisma. Mae Clark's presence gives a clear Warner's sense of overall production. The supporting players turn in solid performances, and the story moves wisely for a rocking introduction that seems to begin three or four wheels in history - but sit back and enjoy it for the Cagney showcase and engage in the Depression era time capsule, that it is .
