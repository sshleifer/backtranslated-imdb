I love this movie because every single item in it is nothing short of excellent. I'll quickly praise a few of them. Peter O'Toole gives us one of his amazing performances as he becomes the final Mr. Chips. Petula Clark, has a beautiful voice and is perfect as Katharine. The director was able to bring the story to the screen in a fresh new way. Combine it with the fantastic and creative film, editing, writing, etc., And you have a movie that shows the fine quality of its production. I can't praise the well-planned camera work enough, it moves up and around, zooms in and out, gives us the best view and lets the locations become part of the scene. Petula Clark's last song, 'YOU AND I', is only 3 beautifully compound long takes, and in this 2-second era I appreciate the extra caution that everyone involved has to give the long scenes perfect. The music is great and the songs move the story together as they should. Leslie Bricusse is one of my favorite composers. Listen to these songs, how could anyone not like them? This is a very romantic story between two people approaching the Middle Ages who find each other, spreading the best in each other, and it lasts until the end of their lives. Excellent production values, plays, camera work and music make this movie worth seeing.
