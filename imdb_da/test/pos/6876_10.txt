When I know Walter will never reach another set. I was in my 30-year-old when I first saw this sweet, imaginative and effortless romantic movie. I loved it from the first scene and through to the end. Carney was his usual self-confidence Glenda matched Walter step by step in witticisms, and Richard Benjamin delivered the sarcastic voice for the reason he does so well. Along the way there were many actors that we all recognize, making their usual shine. There are a few lines in the movie that my sister and I have been using over the years, but I don't want to say anything about them here. I'm absolutely sure you want to know which two I'm talking about. Just get this movie. Take some popcorn, grab your press (if he's as juicy as mine is, as I'm grateful for) and enjoy this standout romantic comedy from the 70's. You will not be disappointed. But I have a feeling that I am preaching to the choir here because everyone who loves Walter will already own it. I am very happy that it is out on DVD now finally.
