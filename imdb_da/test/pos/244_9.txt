This has to be one of the better post-Astaire musicals made by Columbia. Produced by Arthur Schwartz and directed by veterinarian Charles Vidor, this image really put Gene Kelly on the card and cemented Rita Hayworth's reputation as the cinema's leading female dance partner. She plays a dual role here since she performs contemporary 1940's with Gene and co-star Phil Silvers, but also puts her in the role of her grandmother, a nightclub artist at the end of the 19th Centry. <br /> <br /> The music must also be designated because I believed the last project the legendary Jerome Kern (most famous day for "Old Man River" and "Smoke Gets in your Eyes") worked on and his copywriter was just legendary Ira Gershwin. They provided a score full of charm and characterization. The music of the historical sequences is particularly notable because it is so perfectly styled in the early 20th century idiom that was the original period of the Kern. It's a bit like recording a record from one of your favorite bands from the 1970s and hearing them make a song in the original style of the time. The story is pretty inconsistent, which is fine with me because this movie is so close to an approach that you will ever see from the 1930s / 40s golden age of Broadway musical comedy style on film. Even the 1940s war propaganda aspects of the movie's music give it extra charm, as the talented trio sings "room for tomorrow" and even humorous poke fun on America's enemies and use the slang like. "Gremlins". <br /> <br /> Probably the most memorable performance in the film is Kelly's dance to "Alter-Ego Dance", which found him arguing with and then dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the struggle for conscience. This prepares much of his later work and also stands for an effective and memorable scene in itself. Fans would like to search this out for various reasons - Kelly fans will see this as a rare chance to see him outside the boundaries of MGM with another set of co-stars and music that is better than his usual MGM material. Hayworth fans would like to see Rita in brilliant color on top of her fame and ability. And fans of classic Broadway musicals will surely like to hear Kern's final score and marvel at the quality of Gershwin's lyrics and the compatibility of their styles. This is a particular gem in the crown of Columbia's musical program.
