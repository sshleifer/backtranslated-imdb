This show is a show that is great for adults and children to sit and watch. The stories are a bit slow for adults, but they are still good. There are many children in my family, boys and girls, and it's hard to get everyone to agree on what to see, but they always agree on each other when they want to see Mystic Knights. It is a wonderful show and I hope they will continue to do so. All the kids in my family and I think Vincent Walsh is the best of them all. We have seen that he has done lots of other work and thinks he does a good job. We wish all actors, actresses, writers, directors and producers good luck and will just say the good work.
