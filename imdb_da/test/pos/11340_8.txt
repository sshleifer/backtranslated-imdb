For a long time I didn't know the weather, I liked this movie or not. This is surprising because I usually know it, but because the film didn't go anywhere, I was a little confused. Two people move into a somewhat common household setting. Finding their spouses constantly working or away on business trips, their attention, out of sheer loneliness, wandering to each other. After a platonic love affair, the male leadership of Tony Leung Chiu reveals that he has a mistress on the side. Su Li-Zehn, played by Maggie Cheung, is injured even though their love affair has not been physically completed. Chiu leaves the country, only to come back years later when everything is changed. <br /> <br /> For the cynical part, the movie is correct. By never actively or actually touching that part of love, but only approaching it, the film says more than so many others have on the subject. It's also true, I think, nothing good could have come if they continued to have affair. At least that's the feeling I get. <br /> <br /> If we are to believe it when Garica Marquez writes that "... love is a state of grace, not money for anything but alpha and omega, one end in itself", then this movie miserably short of this, like everyone else. Or if you are inclined to completely incomplete minimalism, you hit it right on the mark. What movies in history have reached, approached or sustained this sentence, if only briefly? My honest feeling in memory is about two. When Harry Met Sally effectively suggests this romantic perfection; and getting it all is about to get there. Interestingly, in When Harry Met Sally, this is done during wooing, rather than in its achievement. Can't anyone say something good about love after it has been achieved by two individuals? Nicholas Sparks latest movie The Notebook comes closer to this perhaps than any other movie; should we believe that when a love is achieved, it flies only by the radar to exist in perfection in another dimension, or perhaps more true latent vehicle for other purposes? <br /> <br /> In Mood for Love, an honest movie with beautiful and generous filmography is worthy of every aspect of the best Almodovar has to offer, but all that stands to say at last is that "Life is sometimes like this." Now this is in no way a diffident thing to say, especially if it is said well, but the problem really comes at the end of the last action when Kar Wai Wong tries to round off the movie only relate to the second time, a broader historical theme that plays in the background of the relationship that has just taken place. This is a worthy effort, and the variation in the musical motif played through the movie is pretty brilliant, but the relatively reserve charge of the theme plays too little to have much more than a superficial effect on the holistically inclined audience, whereby the viewer splits the difference. an error in any movie. An instructor must know where he is going and how to get there. But in honesty it is only a wrong turn. But as everyone knows, all that is required is a remarkable imperfection to pamper the perfect gingerbread. <br /> <br /> However, the effort is definitely worth, trying to extend a historical theme and rounding out the film and raising it beyond the couple's micro meaning, but without any real anticipation it is the crucial mistake. In a word, and unfortunately it is too late. It is also, I believe, too much of a challenge for the non-Asian seer who is not familiar enough with China's history to appreciate this sweeping stroke.
