"More", perhaps, most remembered for the excellent soundtrack composed by Pink Floyd in 1969 they were not superstars yet. In fact, they made an album with the movie music, no fan can miss it! <br /> <br /> But it's also the first film from the German-French director Barbet Schroeder: it's a cult movie. When it was released, censorship cut several scenes of sex and drugs everywhere. It is also one of the first films to deal with the notion of drug addiction. A German boy travels to Paris and meets an American girl: they fall in love. Together they are looking for sun and exoticism. But it is an overpriced love: she embarks on drugs. In the 60s, anti-drug campaigns were not like today, there wasn't much information. On the contrary, it was in many environments that took drugs, a kind of spiritual experience ... So it is quite surprising to see a movie during the period describing a nightmare heroin experience. <br /> <br /> The movie is simple, not vulgar at all and shot in a "cinema verity" style. The actors Mimsy Farmer and Klaus Gr√ºnberg are very convincing. "More" is a document from the late 60s - and a document from the end of the hippies illusions as well.
