In an era where almost all the major horror films from the 60s and 70s are restored to the public who rejected today's horror flicks that are not terribly good, it is instructive to look back at John Carpenter's 1982 OPUS THE THING, which in itself is a remake - of a childhood favorite with the director's Howard Hawks' 1951 sci-fi / horror classic THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE. Although Carpenter's film was not in the first place when a large ticket office hit, when it was released in mid-1982, it has since received a very large subsequent. <br /> <br /> In fact, Carpenter's movie is less of a remake of the Hawks movie than it is a recast when he goes back to the original idea that the source material contains, the John W. Campbell story "Who Goes There ? ", where an American scientific crew member in Antarctica is threatened by a deforming alien thawed out of the ice after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who starred Carpenter in the director's 1979 television film ELVIS and the 1981 film ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, leads a cast of stalwart character actors, including Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart, and Richard Masur in this thrill-filled exploration of paranoia, as the changing "thing" that first comes to their camp in the form of a guide dog, tries to kill a Norwegian team, takes over each one of them one by one. It is not long before everyone in the camp begins to mistrust his fellow man. The end of the movie, where Russell and David are the only ones left, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity similar to the corresponding codas to both the Fathers and the Shepherds. <br /> <br /> Almost universally, when the subject of THE THING is purchased, emphasis is placed on the extremely gory special effects make-up and alien designs created by Rob Bottin, who had worked with Carpenter on the 1980's horror classic THE FOG, and on Joe Dante's 1981 werewolf film THE HOWLING. These effects are actually quite spectacular and graphic, and even today they can be quite belly-turning. But all of this would make Carpenter's movies no more than a high-end splatter epic, if the direction, story, and play were not up for snuff; and fortunately each of them is. When he does not concentrate on the hugely gruesome transformation sequences, Carpenter builds excitement in the same Hitchcock-influenced way, which informed his former films HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, with cinematographer Dean Cundey's proving camera work, especially through the station's corridors, a significant help. The actress improves an already fine screenplay adaptation of Bill Lancaster; And we also get a stack score of Ennio Morricone whose work with director Sergio Leone's classic 1960s Italian spaghetti westerns is well known to everyone, including of course Carpenter himself. THINGEN also includes extra-fine visual effects from Albert Whitlock (who worked on many Hitchcock films, including THE FEDER), and Roy Arbogast, who worked at CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and JAWS 2. <br /> <br /> Carpenter s film was not the success it could have been because Universal chose to release this graphic shocker just two weeks after it released Steven Spielberg's much more family-friendly ET: THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL (not surprising critics and audiences at that time favored Spielberg's Excellent movie over Carpenter is just as excellent, but very different). Also, most of the horror movie box office business in 1982 went to another Spielberg-produced movie, POLTERGEIST. As a result, the THINGEN at a $ 15 million price suffered from a lack of attention in its time. But over time, many have come to see Carpenter's film for what it is - an extreme gory but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, made with a lot of flair and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia in the heart of its history. Although it is still rather cruel, the TINGEN should be remembered as much for the skill that history has put together as it is for the gory alien designs and make-up effects; for it is the storytelling ability and the excitement that make it so memorable in the final analysis.
