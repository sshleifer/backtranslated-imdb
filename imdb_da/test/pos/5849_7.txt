This thriller has so many twists as it had me on the edge of my seat. I watched it on video, some of the scenery on the "bluff" could have been a little more spectacular on the big screen. Cast has Sandra Bullock, Ben Chaplin (from "The Truth About Cats & Dogs"), Michael Pitt (Henry Parker in "Dawson's Creek") and Ryan Gosling (???).
