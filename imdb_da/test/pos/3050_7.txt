A vicious country baron holds water to a group of ranchers to try to take their pennies on the dollar. In addition, Singin 'Sandy Saunders (John Wayne), who saves the day of Gabby Hayes and his daughter, comes undercover as the bad guys latest gunsmith. <br /> <br /> The first of sixteen films Wayne made for Lone Star / Monogram Pictures, this is trying to throw him as a song cono, with only a clear lip-synchronized voice. The title card prominently highlights its character as "Singin 'Sandy", leading to the belief that this was supposed to be the first in a proposed series! Yes it is ridiculous, but also very fun to see Wayne singing songs and firearms, especially when he does a little bit before he shoots it out with gunman Earl Dwire. <br /> <br /> Riders Of Destiny has a rare vicious role for Al "Fuzzy" St. John, who clowns about as much with the evil guys as he played a heroic sidekick, drove with Buster Crabbe and Lash LaRue.
