"Idiocracy" is the latest movie coming from Mike "Office Space" Judge, and it certainly follows a similar theme for that movie in that it is an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity ... relatively speaking. It's a story about Joe Bauer (Luke Wilson) who is quite literally the most average guy that exists. Joe, and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph), become test subjects for a military project in a sleep. They should remain suspended for only one year, but due to lack of surveillance, Joe and Rita are forgotten and accidentally wake up 500 years in the future. <br /> <br /> Here's the scary part: This movie explains, in a very realistic and plausible way, how the entire population of 2505 was completely delayed. With no natural predators, the development of the human species does not necessarily favor the fastest, smartest and strongest people for the progression of genes ... only the people who breed the most. Unfortunately, these people happen to be wasting, trailers trash idiots who breed as rabbits. This abundant reproduction of the stupid people has caused a negative impact on social growth, and now Joe and Rita are the two smartest people on the planet's surface. If that helps, imagine the whole population as just a hybrid of rednecks, jocks, cholos and hoochies. By watching this nightmare dystopy, Joe learns and tries to track a time machine to see if he and Rita can come back to when they came from, and that's pretty much the whole plot. <br /> <br /> But despite how -dimensional I can make it sound, this movie is higher forehead than you can fathom. Shades are everywhere, and everyone can see glimpses (warning signs if you like) in today's daily stupid society's pervasive facets of everyday life and turn it to the train wreck on the display in "Idiocracy." The movie has some really great showcases of realistic retardedness put on a pedestal. I don't want to give anything away and ruin jokes to you, but let's just say it's pretty thorough. I can see how some would say it is just a lot of toilet humor, but that, odd as it may seem, has a purpose; to show how stupid and crass these people are. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor, "Office Space"; No one wants to see it in theaters, but everyone will brag about discovering this amazing / funny movie when it comes to video. My only complaint to the movie would be that the narrative stream is sometimes broken so they can make a Hitchhiker's-Guide-to-the-Galaxy type show about how things are where they are, but it's a necessary evil and are better implemented here . Apart from that, good characters, fun jokes and better social comments have ended in a fun bow. Final note: If we see that our youth are scared, we will be redneck / ghetto waste and be proud of it ... if you are educated and cultivated anyway and can see how our country is out of control an abyss of stupidity, for god's sake, see this movie.
