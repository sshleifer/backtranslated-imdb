Bonny Hunt scores a coup with his direct debut. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have the indescribable something called chemistry. Sure the plot is unlikely, but it doesn't stop one from enjoying this movie. Carroll O'Conner does a good job as Grace's grandfather. Other major character players play their cardmates. Jim Belushi is hilarious as the earthly man Megan, part of the extended family. <br /> <br /> Faith, family, and marriage are respected. A few sexual references and salt words are used, but in context and with gentle humor. <br /> <br /> And in the background, the wonderful Dean Martin sets the tune - "Return to Me". <br /> <br /> Recommended.
