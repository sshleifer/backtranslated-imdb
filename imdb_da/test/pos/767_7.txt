Ben Marshall, a teenager from a religious background, is made aware of the financial situation at home of his dominant mother Laura. She suggests him to find a temporary job to contribute to the household. In fact, the family has taken a widow, to bring a table with them. Robert Marshall, the father, is a priest at the local church; he would much rather be in the country watching birds than having it for the souls that were handed over to his church. The job is with an older actor, Evie Walton, who wants him to do things for her around the house. "Lady" Evie, as she calls herself, is a woman of a certain age whose career is dead, perhaps because she was not that big. In fact, the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera that was popular, but she'd rather forget it. Evie, who is a compulsive gossip, says that Ben is dying only to forget it conveniently, later when she comes to clean the boy. <br /> <br /> Of course, Ben is in awe of his employer's greater than life personality. He has taken driving lessons. Evie asks him to take a camping trip as he does against his better judgment. He knows that it will provoke his mother's rage. Not happy with that, Evie decides to move on to Edinburgh, where she has been invited to study at an art festival. It is this trip that solidifies their ties. Ben gets to meet and taste the meat's joy with a sympathetic Bryony. <br /> <br /> When Ben returns, everything melts at home. His mother, who has had an affair with a parishioner, decides to leave the family in favor of the young man she has had an affair with. Ben and Evie's relationship survives the test of time. He also begins to see his own father in another light. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Brock, the author of "Driving Lessons" and other memorable English films, takes his first directorial job with this engaging comedy. The mix of show business and religion, loyalty and friendship, explored in its screen processing makes it a fun time in the cinema. We have seen the similar situation before as in "Billy Elliott", where Julie Walters plays a nursery role with a younger man. We had read the movie based on Mr. Brock's own experience while working Dame Peggy Ashcroft when he was young. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, who plays Evie Walton, is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie. She always delivers. Mrs Walters is a welcome presence in any movie she looks and she does wonders with her fake "lady". Laura Linney, a shining player herself, does not get our sympathy with his icy mother. Rupert Grint, famous for his Harry Potter's movie, plays Ben, the young man who sees in Evie a kind soul. Nicholas Farrell is the betrayed father. Michelle Duncan has a small role where she shines.
