The original story and funny convincing characters went well, as a teenage girl slumbered a movie (twice now). I loved it, it was fun and moved quickly, no boring drawn scenes. It is violent and has a small language (although most of it is covered). It's a great movie. David Strickland was a great actor. Ron Eldard gave a great performance. I see it with the girls every time.
