Two college comrades - one a close nerd, the other a rude slob - are going through the country. On the way, they encounter a vicious vehicle that looks like a hearth tank combined with a monster car trying to drive their car over. They escape it, but only give the mysterious and dangerous driver more when one of them leaks in the upper hatch while they are resting. Later, they pick up a sexy hitchhiker who ends up getting involved in their life-threatening situation. MONSTER MAN is an extremely entertaining horror comedy that has some great exciting moments as well as some good gory ones. The two main characters and their constant bickering are fun to watch everything on their own and the end takes a TCM-like trip that was very well done. Definitely worth checking out.
