This is a case where the script plays with the audience in a way that only serves to extend this story to 90 minutes. The story begins in 1969, when a young girl named Faith (Cameron Diaz) travels to Europe with her boyfriend Wolf (Christopher Eccleston), but she dies under mysterious circumstances. So in 1976, Faith's sister Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) also decided to travel to Europe and try to find out what happened to her sister. In France, she looks up Wolf, who has stayed there, and wants him to help her recover the steps the sister took and answer some questions. He is reluctant, but decides to travel with her. Along the way, he fills the gaps in the deposits and tells Phoebe that the faith had joined the Red Army, an extremist group involved in terrorism. Phoebe and Wolf engage in a romance, and this complicates the trip to Portugal, where faith died. Their are several things wrong with this movie and it all has to do with the script. First, the romance between Wolf and Phoebe is wrong and does nothing for the story. It rings completely false and comes across as forced. It seems strange that Wolf would engage in a romance with his dead friend's sister. Second, Wolf knows exactly what happened to the faith, but leaves only a small amount of information every 15 minutes or so. Wolf will look at Phoebe every 15 minutes and say, "There's something I don't tell you"! Gee, thank you very much Wolf! If Wolf had been clean the first time he spoke to Phoebe, the movie would have been around in about 30 minutes. Another thing that bothered me was that I didn't think this movie revived the 1960s at all. Diaz wears hippie clothes, but the time didn't really ring. I enjoyed a few things like the authentic places where the movie was shot. It is a very nice movie and the landscape is beautiful. The performances are all good especially by Brewster and Diaz. Besides "The Fast and the Furious" I had never seen Brewster in anything. But after seeing her performance in this movie, I got away very impressed. She is very good here, and I hope better roles come her. The script is told in a very constructed way, and the film never comes across as credible.
