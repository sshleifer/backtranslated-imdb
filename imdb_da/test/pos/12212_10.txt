When I first began to see "Surface" for the first time, I was hooked.It had everything I wanted in a show thrill, action, mystery, great plot and a great cast of characters.My whole family loved to watch shows.It think when there is a big show on TV, the network disconnects it as if they seemed to do with this show.They go by the Nielson rating system which I think is stupid because there are a lot of junk that they seem to see which networks continue the air. If only there was a way for everyone to vote for a show then maybe the good shows will not be canceled. When I watch television I just look good, so right now it doesn't look much on TV. I hope the network brings back the show, but when they come up with it with a stupid decision, they seem to stick to it. I hope there are many people out there who feel the same.
