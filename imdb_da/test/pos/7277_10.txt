This mystery / psychological thriller is I think to be one of the best I've ever seen. All the actors give a fantastic performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who switches from the nervous starlet at first through the strange events she is part of the cold star. You learn a lot about the real feelings of people in this movie and much about the film industry itself. The movie in film situations in the beginning and through the game played with her by the "actor" is fascinating. Also, music from Mark Snow may be the best score I've ever heard. You will not forget this movie!
