I missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played a week. I had to settle down to see the shorter two and a half hour version a year or so later and was left stunned by what I saw. I left the theater tank, I had seen a masterpiece and wondered what the full version was. <br /> <br /> The full version is mostly good, but it has sequences that are so incredibly boring that the whole movie is pulled down and almost sinking under the waves. <br /> <br /> The problem is entirely in editing, which should be felt as the final word on excess. There are times when things go on and on and over, and nothing happens. Shots of people in a city that goes too long with no purpose in the story. We get beautiful views and visions of such beauty that they bring tears to their eyes, but they are often used as a placeholder rather than as punctuation or to place a place. Much of the longer version seems to be on the screen simply because it looked good. <br /> <br /> I have tried to actually sit down and watch Heavens Gate without resorting to the Fast Forward button, but somewhere along the way I find I can't hold it any more. <br /> <br /> I wish MGM would be ashamed of us and release the shorter version to DVD as well as the huge dinosaur. Maybe as a two pack so we could see which one is the better version and whether Cimino was sour or not. <br /> <br /> And while on it, why not include the once-rumored Johnson County War edit that ran 90 minutes. Probably United Artists tinkered with an additional cut hoping to get some of their money back. Whether it was ever done or still exists, it is up in the air, but it would be interesting to see.
