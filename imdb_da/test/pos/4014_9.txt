These days you rarely come from a child's show that doesn't involve 1) a preteen / teen pop star who is as funny as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot to find the perfect date with another guy / girl every time 3 ) is about erratic shouting and incomprehensible humor. Ca. 95% of the performances at Disney, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network fit the specified criteria. To put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality and good storytelling. It is as if producers and writers believe that children are not wise enough to understand character development and plot detail. They couldn't be more ignorant. Safe children enjoy good laughter and irregular behavior (if done at a conservative level and done right), but as they will also enjoy a story, watch drama and watch people challenge. They don't want to see people living in a flawless world where they get everything they want. They know that this world is not all fun and games they know are not perfect. Everyone has problems, and we must all learn to work around them. This show is about that sort of thing. Alex Mack is an average teenage girl who seems to have everything for her genius sister, Annie. Her mother works in any office, but is sometimes a stay with her parents. Her father, George, is a top scientist at Plant, a chemical company that employs most of the city they live in, Paradise Valley. Alex is unpopular and chosen by most of his peers. Her only friend is Ray (but she gets more friends as the series goes). On his first day in Jr. High does not Alex go home to be fond of school, but a truck that delivers chemicals from the plant goes down in a fire that tries to avoid driving her and dumps a strange chemical known as GC-161, where chemical blends with the water and covers Alex in it. Shortly afterwards, she begins to develop strange forces like morphing in a sausage, shooting lasers out of her hand and moving things with her thoughts. She also glows constantly when nervous (although we never see much of it later). Apart from her sister Annie and friend Ray, Alex decides to keep these powers a secret from everyone, even though the parents fearing to be kidnapped by the plant, whose corrupt owner, Danielle Atron has his security chief, Vince, is searching for the mysterious GC161 child. Each episode then deals with Alex, who tries to live a normal life as a child while learning to live with his strange powers. The series may seem like a girls show, but it is not. As a boy, I liked watching this show because of its amazing effects and drama. The producers successfully add some elements of science fiction with the elements of teenage drama. In fact, some episodes were rather violent and somewhat scary. The unfounded plant manager Atron and Vince make good antagonists for the series, because the authors really create them as a threat and give you the terrible feeling every time they come on the screen. Also, smart moves add David, the driver of the truck, who wasted the GC-161, as Vins's bumbling assistant in search of comic effect, but also you will love him towards the end. It was interesting to see a little Alex trying to live like a normal child, but struggling to complete his forces. At times, you forget that these are children who are struggling with a huge adult institution because you are attracted to the story. The show does a good job of explaining children by showing Alex that she can have superpowers, but she is still a child and must be careful. Even an episode, you find yourself confused by Alex's accidents. My favorite episode, where Alex wants her to never be born, really demonstrates most of these elements. As I said, manufacturers have never hesitated to add some laughs, whether they come from Ray's one liner or George's strange habits or David is trying to be a good guy. Of course, you come across corny moments and a whole episode that really has nothing to do with the series plot, but what good series doesn't it? All in all fantastic show. 9.10
