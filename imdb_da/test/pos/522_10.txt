I like to see Linda Blair play again in an actual "horror" movie. I had been disappointed with her in most things since the "Exorcist" movies (which I loved). What was there with all those nasty "B-movies" she did? <br /> <br /> By contrast, David Hassellhoff, all I could do is laugh. He's not cut out to be a horror movie actor. David must stick to "Knight Rider" or "Baywatch". <br /> <br /> It's all a great movie. Even in the eighties it was a fantastic movie. It has horror, action and drama. It's a thrill, and I loved the way Linda Blair appeared.
