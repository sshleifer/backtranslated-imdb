I only heard about driving lessons through the ITV ads, and to be honest, I didn't know how much I liked it. I turned on the television last night and was completely surprised. Driving Lessons is a modest, simple movie that draws you right from the start. Rupert Grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager Ben brilliant. He is definitely one to look for in the future. Dame Eve Walton is played by the amazing Julie Walters. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. The highlight of the movie, for me, was Evie's colorful poem. It shows how friendships can be formed between the most unlikely couples. In my opinion, driving lessons are a great way to spend 2 hours. The scenery was also striking, especially the landscape. Anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable, I strongly disagree with
