Fulci is one of my most popular Italian splatter directors. He is also a very good storyteller who mixes horror, the supernatural and psychedelic themes as a whole very well. This film was really his last great story before he instructed such disappointments as "Voices From Beyond". The story is simple as Fulci plays himself, a horror director. After several years of film and gorefilm, Fulci seems to start to suffer a collapse, where he begins to hallucinate that people are being slaughtered. He decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes matters worse when he convinces Fulci that he kills people. <br /> <br /> Fulci used many scenes from several images at the same time. These movies I do not believe in, but certainly produced. Some of these movies are "Massacre" directed by Andrea Bianchi (Cemetery), "Touch of Death" directed by Fulci, "The Murders Secret," and I can't remember the rest of the movies. <br /> <br /> Nightmare Concert is a very underrated movie, even by Fulci fans. But I loved this movie and have seen it many times already. It's boring that Fulci didn't get the chance to manage something that was worth following, but it is nevertheless a great movie and I recommend it to any Fulci fan, whether you like it or not. 9/10 stars
