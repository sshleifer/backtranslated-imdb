This is a great family movie dealing with people on earth who enjoy their local interests, primarily engaged in horse racing. Lloyd Bourdelle, (Walter Matthau) is a farmer who also travels quarters and has a young son called Casey Bourdelle who loves horses. Lloyd is able to raise a full-grown horse, which he calls "Casey's Shadow" after his son, and this horse breaks all fast records and is a possible winner of a million dollar race. Sarah Blue, (Alexis Smith) gets interested in this horse and offers to buy the horse for $ 500.00, but this horse is severely injured, and Lloyd receives a severe decline that disturbs the whole family. Walter Matthau gave an excellent performance and it is a great movie to watch and enjoy.
