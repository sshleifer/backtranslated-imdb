Beware, my lovely came on TV on BBC2 recently in the early hours so I put the video on it and was glad I did. <br /> <br /> A man finds a dead woman so he escapes so that he is not blamed for her murder and gets a job as a craftsman in a hospital, but she doesn't know what she's doing here. It turns out that this man is a psychopath and possible killer. He begins to torment her and lock her in the basement. He then cuts the telephone line so she can't get outside help. A young boy who regularly shoppers for her notices something is not quite right when he gets away from her. Eventually the man goes and seems like nothing has happened. <br /> <br /> I can see why Beware, My Lovely got an X certificate when it was released in the theaters. Some of the scenes are quite unpleasant for this time. I also thought the man would do something for the young boy. <br /> <br /> The piece has an outstanding performance from Robert Ryan as a psychopath, widowed Ida Lupino and is affiliated with Barbara Whiting and Dee Pollock as the boy. <br /> <br /> This is definitely Robert's most chilling performance I've seen. One should see. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
