Being from eastern PA, right on the border of northern New Jersey, I still get the feeling that this was a documentary more than a movie. I have friends from New York and New Jersey, and this movie represents the kind of lifestyle that still exists today in the lower income area outside the "Big City" lifestyle. If you haven't seen this movie and ever wondered what is really happening in the city jungle, check out this movie. Not really big name actors, it's like they just pulled these guys out of the street and said action that adds to the movie's realism, the show is FANTASTIC nonetheless! SEE THIS MOVIE!
