This is a decent bet for a B-Movie Martial Arts player. Ian Jacklin, a former North American cruiserweight Kickboxing champion, is leading and championing the action scenes. Muscular Matthias Hues gets a chance to add more to his Martial Arts bad persona in this movie than in all his many others, and if you're a fan of The Teutonic Titan, rent this movie now! <br /> <br /> Renee Griffin is also remarkable as the romantic interest in this movie. She starts with attitude, but soon warms herself to the hero, and they do "The beast with two backs" in a very stylish way. The battle scenes are good in the American tradition (NO Hong Kong acrobatics here!) With extra realism from having Benny "The Jet" Urquidez play as John Larson's (Jacklin) coach. All in all, this movie looks to have more sub-areas than most in its genre, so you get more of a story.
