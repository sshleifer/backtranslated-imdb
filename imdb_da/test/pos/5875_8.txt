This movie has gone in and out of fashion more often than the mini shirt. A post-war triumph, it was almost forgotten by the 1970s, except for cinema students. Recently, it has begun to be recognized as perhaps the most uniform representation of soldiers' integration in post-war life ever made (and certainly includes films like "Deer Hunter.") I like it, but my overall evaluation is somewhere between these extremes. <br /> <br /> The story is a simple one. Three very different service men who have patterned after World War II (The Big One!) Fly home to their Midwest city and try to resume or create civilian life. One has a disability, one has a cushy job waiting for him, and the other has nothing to do, but determination. There are some good but unfortunately uneven performances. Fredric March won the best actor Oscar to play an old sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for "It's a Wonderful Life," which also deserved the best prize, but it was clear that this movie touched a post-war nerve. As I said it was fashionable. March has a fantastic scene, a humorous speech that has reminded something similar that involves real World War II full-time Pappy Boyington, and is otherwise solid but invisible. <br /> <br /> I go against the grain here, but I thought Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was actually ignored by the Academy. I hardly discovered a hint of heat from her. In fact, I kept thinking that she had to beat Frederic March to annoy her. She almost annoyed every time they were together. There was something missing there, in her forced smile and her air of tolerance rather than joy. I think all this nonsense that she is "the perfect wife" is only correct if you think a passionate 1950s homemaker is your ideal. You may disagree with that, but the academics do not seem to choose it. She's a big problem with this movie, terribly mistaken. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews as a former soda who became a war hero, winning up behind the counter again, is amazing. He sat with a wife who apparently married him just before he left the war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looked bleak. But then he chances on Marty's daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic trip), and fireworks explode. Both are good, but then comes the bumps again that permeates this movie. Some moments of pure soap opera penetrate the punk of the all-time classic line: "I'll bust that marriage up!" The romance is uplifting and reflects a common condition after the war that the returning soldiers find love in their return. <br /> <br /> Talking about uplifting, now we come to Harold Russell. He has a naturalistic quality for his acting, or is it non-functioning, calling just as true today as it undoubtedly did then. He is an inspiration by taking a no-nonsense approach to his situation. His best scene, one of the best in all cinemas, is when he brings the girl who likes him up to her bedroom to show her the truth about his state. "I'm lucky, I still have my elbows as opposed to some of the boys." Really good stuff. <br /> <br /> The movie has some moments that hover. It also has some moments that belong to the afternoon laps. Take the good with the bad and see it here for the highest points.
