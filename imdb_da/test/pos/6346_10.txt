I've seen Lonesome Dove, Dead Man's Walk and Streets of Laredo, and now The Return to Lonesome Dove. If you are hungry for more after seeing Lonesome Dove, it will fill your stomach. Great cast, great story. Most definitely a close second to Lonesome Dove. I want to buy this movie to be added to my collection. This is the best, or at least my favorite performance of Jon Voight. He's Captain Call. Lou Gossett Jr. playing Isom Pickett is not someone I wanted to row with, he is a bad ass with perspective. William Peterson also does a good job. Rick Schroder is back as Newt with an anxious performance reminding me of his style of NYPD Blue. My only problem with this movie (and it is really picking nits) is that I had the impression that Call wanted to be "the first man to pork cattle in Montana" and it is obvious that Dunnigan had already been there a while. A little inconsistent, but easily overlooked as you lose yourself in the amazing story. I especially love the apparent character growth of Jasper Fant and July Johnson. I've watched this movie several times and am ready for another sequel.
