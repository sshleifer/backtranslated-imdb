Master Sharky, you look so ... normal. You would never get a table in this fancy cocktail restaurant / bistro. I, on the other 'and eat grapes and pate' every day. Do you like my coat jacket with all the fine trim? My huge golden gold rings? Or maybe you like these blonde, you say? Bombshells, all of which are qualified in aerobic and naked petans, which decorate my long, maroon velvety sofa as so many soft cooked larks on a plate of fried foie gras and figs. You like? You can't have! Zey are all mine. <br /> <br /> You will never have 'is as I had'. Domino was the best, except Maman. You do not understand the art of beloved. Just look at your undervalued mustache. It's almost fun for me, not to think of the ridiculous protrusion on your stupid face as you stumble around Domino's love-hike as a piggy that seeks truffle in the woods, the forest raises and sway in the warm winds of desire! You lose Sharky again. <br /> <br /> When I love the women, they know Sharky, Zey knows. Zey teaches, they learn until she becomes a teacher. Not nano-mathematics, the art of love. Domino was the seedling I watered. I won her so often. Everywhere Sharky. Her scented petals, her proud stem, everywhere. She will fade under your ridiculous snake, as the souffl√© removed from the oven five minutes early. <br /> <br /> Now I have to go to Sharky, so you live with your shameful behavior. It is you who will be flushed down the leopard like the smelly. <br /> <br /> Bon chance!
