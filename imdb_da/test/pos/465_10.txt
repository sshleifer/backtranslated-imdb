One of the best movies I've seen for a very long time. Bechard has a way of looking at things that are unique, and this movie does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> This movie has you guessing all the way through and with the seemingly taboo issues addressed it keeps you glued to the screen. There are no bad or good guys, Bechard is sure of that. The characters are so perfectly complex that you feel for each one you care about what they have been through. <br /> <br /> Bechard's use of attention to detail is unmatched in this world of "FAST FOOD MOVIES" and while some of the topics can make some unpleasant - you love the feeling it gives you. <br /> <br /> I've heard it said too often that there are no new stories to tell. Thank you Gorman Bechard for proving the fake. <br /> <br /> Don't go, watch this movie.
