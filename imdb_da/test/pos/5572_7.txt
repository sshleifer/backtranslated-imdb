After seeing the show for about four weeks, which is enough to get a feel for the show, I think it shows the potential. While much is borrowed from other shows (what sci-fi does not do these days) and the characters are stereotypical, I like what they do with the stories. There is some continuity with plot development and character interaction / procurement, despite each episode's predominantly modular character. Some science-related issues have been explored, as well as character secrets / weakness discoveries. These have also added some comedy to the show, something I would like to see more of in "serious" sci-fi. All in all, this gives a good balance so that it can appeal to larger groups of people, unlike the Star Trek vs. the Babylon 5 debate, I have been numerous attendees and witnesses. The visual aspects of the vision are more than adequate and well budgeted for a first season. The play is acceptable and I am curious to see how well the actors manage to grow their characters out of their scripted stereotypes. I see enough positive and potential to stay interested in seeing where the show will go ...
