I don't know if this movie hits my heart, as it does because of feelings of friendship, love, closeness to others or the warmth of this change, creating Babette's cooking, but when the party starts and the rest of the movie , I often move up. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's an emotional movie, but without a spot of mawkishness or facile sentimentality. Please note that the elements of the plot are discussed. Babette's Feast tells her story with restraint and care, and it lets us discover for ourselves the values ​​of grace and love. All we need to know is that Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) was a French refugee who was protected by two aging sisters in a small community on the coast of Jutland. The sisters lead what is left of their father's flock. He was a convincing pastor who learned that salvation comes through self-denial. The sisters made their sacrifices a duty and faith. Those who are still honoring the now long dead priest's teachings and his spiritual guidance. But as they have grown older, the small community has become querulous and argumentative. The sisters do what they can. For the pastor's 100th birthday, Babette wants to cook for the small group the sisters will invite. The sisters reluctantly agree, but when they see the supplies that Babette has ordered, they and their guests are disturbed. They are used to the community's usual fare for dried cod, boiled and a soup made of bread, water and a small beer. Although Babette has improved over time, they now seem close to godlessness. At dinner there is also a guest, General Lorens Lowenhielm, who had previously chosen ambition for his love for one of the sisters. <br /> <br /> What do we experience? There is a tightening of the aging society's beliefs and the stone-blown houses they live in. There is the warmth of candles by the sisters' small, crowded dining room. And then, Babette's art form is transformative when we see her cook, see Erik, a young boy who helps her, serves and pours and sees the old parishioners using fine wine and exquisite cooking, rediscovering their fellowship and love and friendship. The general acts as our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes they eat. The general tells a story to his incomprehensible dinners, a story of a famous woman who was the exemplary cook at the famous Café Anglais in Paris. "... this woman, this boss had the ability to transform a dinner into a kind of love affair ... a love affair that did not distinguish between bodily appetite and spiritual appetite." He is also transformed into a man who will accept what he has become, and yet he will always know the value and love for how long since he chose not to accept. An old couple kissing. Two old men remember previous friendships. And Babette, who spent everything she had won in a lottery at this dinner, had the opportunity to be the artist she once was in France, an opportunity she accepted with love and friendship. <br /> <br /> Babette, who was now as poor as she was when she came strenuous years earlier, will continue with her sisters. The general in a cart with his aunt returns to his property. And the older guests leave the homes of the sisters to return to their own cabins. They pause and look at the clear night sky and the stars overhead. They spontaneously hold their hands in a circle and dance and sing this hymn ... "The clock strikes and time passes by eternity is dense. Let's spend this time trying to serve the Lord with heart and mind. So that our true home we find So that our true home we find. "<br /> <br /> They smile at each other. Everyone has been united. <br /> <br /> Babette's Feast is a wonderful movie, full of held feelings, unspoken understandings, wisdom ... and of course a meal that will leave you with a grueling stomach when you leave the theater. If you win a lottery so you can afford what Babette has created and has her skills and artistry, then she's earned: <br /> <br /> Potage a la Tortue (a rich turtle soup) served with amontillado sherry Blinis Demidoff au Kaviar (small buckwheat pancakes with cream and caviar), served with Veuve Clicquot champagne Cailles a Sarcophage with Sauce Perigourdine (boned quail filled with foie gras and truffle in soft pastry with truffle sauce enriched with Madeira), served with Clos de Vougeot, a fine burgundy salad cheese and fresh fruit Baba au Rhum with glace fruit and fresh figs Coffee and a nice brandy
