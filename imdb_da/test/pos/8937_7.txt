"Plots With A View" in 2002 is a nice little comedy that only the British could do. The film's sense of humor is both mildly morbid and black and yet very lovable and sometimes very slapstick-ish. It's the only movie by director Nick Hurran I've seen so far, and while I'm not going to see some of his other movies at the moment (I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies), this is very enjoyable and very fun . The film takes place in a small town in Wales, where Betty Rhys-Jones (Brenda Blethyn) is married to the city's enchanted and haughty (Robert Pugh). The local morticist Boris (Alfred Molina) has been desperately in love with Betty since their childhood, but has always been too shy to confess his love for her. Apart from being in despair, Boris has some other problems when the eccentric American mortar Frank Featherbed (Christopher Walken) has opened a burial business in the same city ... The strange, very British humor of the film should entertain everyone with a sense of humor and the story is sometimes bizarre. Also "Plots With A View" profits from a wonderful cast. Brenda Bethlyn, who has already proved to be a fun lady in the 2000 "Save Grace", plays the lead and she is once again very funny and very lovable in her role. Alfred Molina, who plays his shy admirer, delivers a good performance as always, and Robert Pugh fits perfectly into Betty's sleazy man. Beautiful Naomi Watts is also great as the man's 'secretary', I become a bigger fan with every movie I see her in. The biggest role, however, is played by the incomparable Christopher Walken (one of my favorite actors). Walken is brilliant as he is always in the role of the eccentric mortar who arranges funerals that are quite unorthodox. Overall, "Plots With A View" is a very entertaining little British comedy that I highly recommend!
