I decided to watch this on FearNet for free, because I figured well, nothing else looks comfortable. And it turned out to be a pretty good little horror surprise! The film serves as an anthology of four urban legends told by four teenagers whose car breaks down in the middle of the sky. After deciding to build a bonfire in the woods, they begin to tell their eerie stories and the film transition to the events of the stories. Honeymoon - A newlywed couple traveling across the country in an RV to Las Vegas is terrorized as they park in a wooded area of ​​evil creatures hunting at the full moon. (I don't want to spoil it for you!) Hook-Amy Smart and James Marsden (probably the most famous people in the movie besides beautiful Christine Taylor) play the young couple who come face to face with the maniac who has a hook for a hand in this most recognizable card. People can Lick Too this is probably the frightening and darkest of the stories. A young girl speaks to another girl on the internet, but it turns out that it is actually a man who is obsessed with her and he continues to break into the house when she is alone. This was really chilling. Locket-This is also a great story with Glen Quinn and Jacinda Barrett playing a motorcyclist and a beautiful dumb girl who is terrorized by ghosts of a past century in a mysterious farmhouse. This was good, but it was the weakest of the records. <br /> <br /> The campfire group slowly develops their own frightening experience in their segments between stories, and the end of this movie is surprising and truly amazing! Overall, this is not bone-chilling frightening, but it is certainly a great little guilty pleasure, as horror fans would both certainly appreciate!
