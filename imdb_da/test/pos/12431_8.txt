A beautiful woman, a backwoods, inbred monster man, a super cute monster truck, a road kill zombie brother and 2 friends ... an anal reluctant, overly sensitive geek and the other a foul mouthed, teen slum. Throw them all along with a dash of Jeepers Creepers, Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Road Trip, and you have Monster Man. A hilarious horror / comedy excursion that never sets out to "say anything". It's a simple, downright grin party. Unpretentious and well-created, this scare / comedy is in his heart, a buddy's flick. This movie offered some hilarious and disease set pieces. I highly recommend this to scare fans who want to be entertained.
