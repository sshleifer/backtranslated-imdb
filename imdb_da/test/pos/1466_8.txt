A strange relationship between a middle-aged woman and a transsexual who soon becomes a woman. Charlotte and Venorica, both caught by their lifeless lives and not knowing how to get out of them. Charlotte is the owner of a beauty clinic she has broken up with her aggressive ex-husband, moved into an apartment alone with all the furniture packed except her large bed. Veronica lives downstairs with her poor dog. She is sensitive and desperately bothered by her mother's visit and the bad relationship with her father. Her only hope is that the upcoming transsexual operation will make her a real woman, and then everything will be fine. All she can do now is waiting for an approval certificate. <br /> <br /> Then these two people meet randomly and gradually they are all involved in the lives of others, there are some sparkles between them, but no one is brave enough to meet the truth because they are not willing to accept the change as Most people do. Finally, the end is quite satisfactory and leaves some imagination for us to think about it. <br /> <br /> The manager's great work gives me a good impression, she handles the development of characters very well, the emotional atmosphere is completely full and intense. Also I am so obsessed with the bleak lights all over the apartment, Delphic, but full of desire. Two main characters are played by Trine Dyrholm and David Dencik, they are amazing in their roles, a very impressive performance and the chemical reaction between them is genuine and convincing. <br /> <br /> This Swedish indie film is about meeting and changing, whether you are gay or heterosexual, male or female, the inequality of life everywhere, when you come across it, you will hesitate and confuse, but in it At least don't be afraid, follow your heart and choose the right path.
