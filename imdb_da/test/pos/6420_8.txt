In a bizarre experiment, an astronaut is left on the moon when Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a troubled translator living in Italy, wakes up from a nightmare of a moon's mission mixed with an old movie that scared her as a child. She also has no memories of the last three days, with the exception of a torn image of the Garma hotel she finds in her apartment. Dismissed from his job, Alice leads to the outing island to try to gather the mystery ... <br /> <br /> Often spied as a giallo because of it's director (THE FIFTH CORD's Luigi Bazzoni) and the presence of Evelyn Stewart, Nicoletta Elmi, and Klaus Kinski, FOOTPRINTS are actually a conscious paced psychotrimer with sci-fi overtones. The disturbing story is beautifully photographed by Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro with a thoughtful score by Nicola Piovani, who blurs the distinction between dream, reality, memory and film. It also combines elements of such diverse films as Armando Crispino's MACCHE SOLARI and Lucino Visconti's DEATH IN VENICE in it's depiction of alienation, isolation, hallucination and perhaps madness. Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan, on display all the time, makes a reduction of her Carol Hammond in Lucio Fulci's A LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN as Alice, a young woman evokes a mystery that makes her a matter of her hygiene. The location reflects Alice's unstable state of mind; The island of Garma, the low season with Arabic influence and ancient ruins is a lonely, almost mysterious place that is not willing to give up its secrets. Evelyn Stewart has a bit of a start as a worried friend, Nicoletta Elmi and Oscar winner Lila Kedrova are hotel guests. Peter McEnery plays a nice biologist trying to help Bolkan, and the always intense Klaus Kinski is "Blackmann" in the movie -within-a-movie, "Footsteps on the Moon". <br /> <br /> FOOTPRINTS is a classic case of "Guaranteed 100% Euro-weird", but not for everyone. There is only one murder towards the end, but you can't see it coming as the movie begins to come together.
