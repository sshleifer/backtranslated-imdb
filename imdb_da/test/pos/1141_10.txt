I went to this movie without any idea what to expect. I actually took a date to it in the theaters when it first came out. We both thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped get someone to discuss it after seeing it. <br /> <br /> I only recommend watching this movie if you appreciate non-ordinary movies. It is not as heterogeneous as Liquid Sky or as imaginative as Prohibited Zone. The original plot is very easy to follow. There is a lot of subtle humor. Here's a quick summary of the plot if you're totally lost: A big-brother type of government keeps tabs on everyone in the community. Suddenly, a new person appears and there is no data about him (he seems crazy). He may or may not be the second coming of Christ. The exaggerated government goes into a frenzy to find him and discover his true motives. The ruler is also obsessed with immortality. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are hectic, while others are quite low key. We follow the main character as he meets all different kinds of people in society. <br /> <br /> I didn't need my consciousness changed to enjoy the movie, but I know some of my friends felt it helped. <br /> Split was also filmed around Santa Cruz and San Francisco.
