This movie reminds me a lot about the later Rock Hudson movie MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT - about a fish writer who has never fished and is forced to enter a fishing tournament. In this case, Barbara Stanwyck is a Martha Stewart-like author who can't cook and doesn't really have the perfect family she describes in her articles - in fact, she has no family at all. Well, like Rock, she is maneuvered to perform - in this case, creating a great holiday dinner while in the countryside. Since there is no family, she takes home a veteran and a few friends and desperately tries not to "let the cat out of the bag" that she can't do any of the things she is known to do. A cute little comedy and a welcome movie for the annual holiday movie lineup.
