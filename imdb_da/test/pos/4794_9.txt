Luis Bunuel has always been a filmmaker whose work was unclear to me. My first experience with him was the Bourgeosian Discrete Charm, often considered his greatest work, which I became so frustrated and sad that I eventually closed the tape. Likewise, Belle de Jour, who is almost certainly his most famous film and generally regarded as one of his many masterpieces, did not interest me much at all. I didn't hate it as though I was discreet, but I didn't like it. Third, I saw L'Age d'Or. Finally I had a place. Fourth, Los Olvidados, also good. Yet neither L'Age d'Or nor Los Olvidados blew me away. Great movies, but not masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Nazarin is my fifth Bunuel, and I just like it a little more than the other two. It is about a pastor from Spain now in Mexico who refuses to live in the kind of luxury priests living in. He will be more like Jesus leading the most lively life. He is also willing to forgive everyone for something and to suffer without protest. I'm pretty sure Bunuel doesn't sympathize with the character and sees him as quite self-righteous. But I just assume that because of my knowledge of the director whose most famous quote is "Thank God, I am still an atheist", as he apparently said in an interview on this very film (I get this information from John Baxter book on Bunuel if you are interested). The interviewer, who drew these words from Bunuel's mouth, must have been confused about Nazarin. One who was more likely to believe in religious convictions, who also did not know anything about Bunuel, could see the priest as a heroic figure. This is especially true if this viewer has his own criticism of organized religion. The pastor may be self-righteous, but he seems to be basically a good man. When he has a violent prostitute in his room to protect her (and probably save her soul), people begin to find out and assume that their relationship is sexual. His superiors take the same and punish him for it. Later he suffers even worse penalties from clerics.
