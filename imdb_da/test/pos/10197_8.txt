As a fan of robocop, I always loved this movie. I saw it when it first came out, and finally I bought it on DVD from Brazil, it was never released in us on DVD. I like the movie, but just like anything else in this world has all their meaning, loves it or hates it. Whatever a movie does, someone will always say "why didn't they do it in another way?" In other words, you can't all be happy. If you love robocop, you will love this movie. For me it is so unique that it is not cheesy or stupid as a lot of lower budget film. this movie always kept me interested. I can see a couple of scenes that robocop borrowed from here, but tell me what movies don't do? Many movies use other ideas from other movies, and sometimes they change them around. funny movie!
