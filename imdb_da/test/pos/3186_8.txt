This is a great television movie with a good story and many comic moments thanks to the excellent cast. <br /> <br /> The only problem this movie has is that it hasn't been the test of time as good as it could have. <br /> <br /> Despite this, it's definitely worth seeing, especially if you're an Alan Alda or Ruth Gordon fan.
