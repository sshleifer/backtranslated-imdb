Of course, I'm a little prejudiced, but at the time it was the most accurate depiction of Marines ever shown on the big screen. I was at Camp Pendleton, who underwent infantry training when Webb took his crew down to film some outdoor scenes and our company was asked to attend. It took about two or three days to remember. <br /> <br /> Webb and Don Dubbins were serious and business. <br /> <br /> While recording our short scene - which seemed to take forever to an 18-year-old - Webb was very conscientious about getting things (Marine stuff) right and he did a good job An exception - the scene where a recruitment had sunglasses. Never happen for a variety of reasons. I have a video of the movie and want to drill my grandchildren anytime I can make them sit still for a few seconds when I show them their papaw when he was a young stud and part of the world's largest combat force , just fact). What surprised me was how well the real Marines performed their plays. It was before I realized that DIs must have some functioning genes to get their work done. <br /> <br /> The only movie I've seen since being equal to DI is the first half of the Full Metal Jacket and that part is only superior because of the foul language. When DI was made, curse was not allowed on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite the lack of profanity, it is still a good movie to rent. <br /> <br /> Ooooo-rahhhhhh !!!!! <br /> <br /> Semper Fi, Do or Die
