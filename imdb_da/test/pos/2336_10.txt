I have enjoyed this movie ever since I first saw it in the theater. Some movies have a casting of characters and a script that comes together in perfect synergy, and this is one of them. The characters illustrate some truths about getting the best out of people, working together harmoniously, building a team, and achieving goals without ever preaching morals. The situation is well designed and is consistent with the film's opening performance. The excitement builds nicely and humor is clean and consistent throughout. The movie manages to pull me straight in to clutter the characters, and to laugh pretty well all the way through. This is a good movie as good as they come. What strikes me is that a movie that seems so simple can be so long-lasting. The music is a perfect copy of music in the typical serious post-war movies that help create humor and point out that greatness is in the eyes of that gaze. The scenes in the credits are a great music video of "In the Navy" that deserves their own full-screen special feature. The scenes and cuts are well designed, and casting and acting are right on. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic that is as good as anyone ever made, without any performance. In fact, the lack of pretension is what makes it so fun to see. I love these guys and crazy. <br /> <br /> The second day I thought about the movie and wondered if it was available on DVD. We have managed to get to us, and the DVD came out in May 2004. I went to the store and made a copy. Then my wife and I enjoyed another fun night in front of the big screen. I've rated this movie as a 10 because it comes together at all levels, far better than many high-budget movies and Oscar winners. This is entertainment. <br /> <br /> Listen to Fox home video: You have a good movie in your vaults and it's a shame to find a cheap shot DVD with very broken tones just 8 years ago. So why not restore the colors and present the movie as it should be seen? I would like to pay a few more money to get the picture right. I'm grateful to have my own copy. Now give us the eye candy that the movie deserves and how to recreate the credit sequence as a full-screen music video special feature.
