Let me start by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original "Lonesome Dove" than I am. Both the Pulitzer Prize winning book and the towering mini series adapted to it stand alone in my experience as moving, dramatic, trustworthy and engrossing works. There is no comparison between "Lonesome Dove" and any Western movie - at least not since John Ford's legendary collaboration and John Wayne. It was with proper reservations that I sat down to see this new mini-series, what about McMurtry's non-participation and the missing original cast members. After seeing the first episode, it was clear that this is not "Lonesome Dove". In almost all measurable ways, this successor is smaller than the original. But then what? I didn't expect to measure up. Taken as an effort by itself, this film is engaging, entertaining and of very good quality. If it was done as a new story, not as a successor to "Lonesome Dove", there is no doubt that it would not have received so many negative reviews. Jon Voight did a credible job as Call, Barbara Hershey was a great Clara, and the new characters like Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well reproduced and credible. Louis Gossett jr. deserves special mention as the Wrangler horse Isom Pickett. The film made me aware of the characters, and I ask no more than that from an actor. It is unfortunate that this worthy effort is in the shadow of the predecessor - it is worth looking into it himself.
