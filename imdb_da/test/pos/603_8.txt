It's very interesting to look at this ... half of those involved are now dead ... At least it's been a long time since I've seen something Muppet-related, but this thing is pure gold. I'm a big fan of puns, and this movie has them pretty well placed, but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing: it's not really high-speed children's pacing, where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story together without giving The character's depth, it's just kind of movements along with the characters where they want to go. <br /> <br /> Kermit the Frog is just a wonderful character. His voice and expression on his puppet-face are amazing. But first of all, he points out why he is popular - "he can sing and make jokes too!" - But more appropriately why he is so appealing - he effortlessly inspires everyone to search for their dreams. Meanwhile, he also has to deal with himself, which is an unusual theme in family films. <br /> <br /> It also includes an entire ensemble of comedians doing performances here and there, some to great effect, others to a little less (I think Mel Brooks part was just a little overplayed?). Some parts of the movie are just kind of odd. But it is very imaginative and goes to the same destination from a completely different direction. <br /> <br /> Moving right along ... <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
