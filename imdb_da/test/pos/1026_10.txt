Just as a reminder to anyone just reading the commentary on this excellent BBC mini-series, published in 1981, it was not available on DVD until the last few years. Since then it has become available, but initially only in the UK format (for which I purchased an "international" DVD player that you have to hack - illegally, I suppose to see it), but the series is now available through amazon.com - 3 disks - for between $ 19-21 to be seen on DVD in US format, no hacking. There were 41 reviews, average 5 stars. This mini-series is one of the very best on Oppenheimer, or the Manhattan project, or just about anything produced by the BBC.
