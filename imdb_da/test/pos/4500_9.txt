This is a movie that left me breathing ........ would like to learn more about Afghan history and traditions. With today's "evil giving" mantra flood reality, it was inspiring to experience the people's beauty and their faith. <br /> <br /> Casting was impeccable, the scenery simply stunning. The action was first rate and the fact that the academy overlooked this (except it is music) is unforgivable. Scripture is wonderful and such and emotional journey. Causes an "ugly scream" from this guards. <br /> <br /> A movie worth seeing a second and third time.
