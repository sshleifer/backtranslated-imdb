Love and war happened on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking long at it, love was as strong as in the West, and the war was often more exciting (should I say more realistic?). <br /> <br /> This movie is just as much about war and love as it is about Soviet thawing of Mr K's era. It also reminds us that the best war movies were not necessarily made in the 1990s with hemoglobin and millions of USD spent on special effects and marketed actors. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic of Soviet cinema and an excellent picture of one of the greatest human tragedies: war. <br /> <br />
