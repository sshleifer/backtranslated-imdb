In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hires traffickers Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as truck drivers to lead their caravan to the San Juan River. Along the journey, they first encounter the broken wagon without water in the twig. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then, the sadistic offenses decide Clegg boys to join the Mormon caravan to pamper the patrol led by the Sheriff in Crystal City who is chasing them. When Navajos crosses their path, they are invited to visit their village for a dance party. When the lane is close to their destination, Clegg threatens the boys settlers, forcing Sandy and Travis to take an attitude. <br /> <br /> The "Wagon Master" is another big west of John Ford. The sequences with the lorry crossing the desert and the hills are impressive. The Mormon group adventure is fun and very entertaining and the songs fit well into the plot despite being dated. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Caravana dos Bravos" ("Caravan of the Braves")
