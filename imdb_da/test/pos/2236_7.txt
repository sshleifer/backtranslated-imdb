This was a pretty good movie that was generally done quite well. The idea of ​​mercy (will not destroy) was also original. I think Angelina did a good job as one of her first films. The only things I feared were some of the corny fight scenes (will also not spoil). I liked the first movie and I liked this too. 10.7
