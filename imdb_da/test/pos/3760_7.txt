Mark Blankfield (from the old television broadcast "Friday") plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a mild-murdered surgeon who discovers a powder that makes him a drug-bound party animal. Of course, this was not his intention, he had higher hopes, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a pretty stupid movie, but it's also quite fun. Of course, when the good doctor understands what he is done, he is ashamed, but he is not all that is done again and runs through Hollywood as a crazy sex machine with frizzed out hair and gold chains. There are a few subplots like Jekyll's fiance, who is the daughter of the chief doctor of Our Lady of Suffering and Pain, Jekyll's employer. And there is Tim Thomerson as a plastic surgeon with apparently few "real" parts and a taste for men and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of Howard Hughes and who should make more people right with a complete set of organs transplants, including testicles . Yes, humor is raunchy and silly, and generally it's all pretty tasteless, but if you're not over a quick flux in the brink, you'd probably like it. Now also available on DVD, for the first time! Woohoo! 7 out of 10
