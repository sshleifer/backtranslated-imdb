SIR. BASEBALL is a film of paradoxes. Written and recorded as a "light sports comedy", it really has a heartbreaking core as human and universal as some of Capra's finest. On plot level you have the paradox of baseball, a fine old American game as it is played in Japan - turned around, with American values ​​repelled and Japanese values ​​imprinted on the game. (Part of the superficial "sports comedy" is the result of Jack's carefree disbelie on how "basa-boru" is played in Japan.) You also have a main character presented as a supreme, aging baseball star, but who is actually quite immature - pro ball allowed him to expose the adult. And you have a protagonist who is rude resistant to the changes in his life being forced upon him, refusing to accept the curve ball that life has given him in the middle of a new country, a new leader, a new one team, and a new girlfriend who has all welcomed him and tries to accept him. Sounds like heavy stuff? Not really. It is a charming "clash of cultures" comedy that takes place at national, sporting, romantic and professional level. But if you look sensitive enough, you will also find a great story about a man who has to give up his immaturity and grow up too late in life (causing some personal pain) and finding success in places he never expected it . I love the story, but I also have great respect for Selleck's performance; He asks his tush (literally) to portray an ugly American, abusive people and throw away tantrums publicly, allowing us to understand his horror within that character. It also doesn't hurt if you are a big fan of Takakura Ken as I am. SIR. BASEBALL is a surprising "loss of innocence" tale.
