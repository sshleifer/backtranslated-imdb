(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school blunt and nymphomaniac that connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to meet her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leave Rae alone. Rae is not alone for long because she is the city's tramp with a strong need to join a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up killing her half and throwing her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home. Lazarus provides medical assistance to Rae and believes that he can also save her from himself. Rae is like a dog in heat, so Lazarus puts a 40-pound chain around her and her radiator to prevent her from looking for men. Lazarus has his own problems because his wife has just left him for another man. Lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain. <br /> <br /> (My comment) The film has a profound significance for it when you get past sex and violence. The movie has a different feel to it. The story is raw and almost puts you in the movie as if you were there. The 40 pound chain is a good metaphor and symbolic of a chastity belt. You don't give love to anyone, but you hold it to your true love. The chain could also be a parallel to a wife who is chained to the kitchen, but Rae did not cook. Rae would only have sex all the time while a wife couldn't. I think Craig Brewer (author and instructor) has made an extraordinary film, and Samuel L. Jackson sings a medieval blues song. The story is emotionally charged, dealing with the issues of race, religion, music and sex in one. (Paramount Classics, Run time 1:56, Rated R) (8/10)
