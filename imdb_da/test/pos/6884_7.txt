Yong-ki Jeong's "puppet master only with scary parts" was the latest Korean horror flip I had the pleasure to see. With the title "Inhyeongsa" in Asia, this movie struck me immediately when I saw it reviewed online, with pictures that made me think of puppets, Childs Play and other toy / doll-based horror flags earlier. But for some reason I didn't think. "Boy, it'll be sticky," I thought it would be scary and funny. Toysome horror performed well almost. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly but I like it so it was fine. The result, almost as I found with Acacia, was beautiful and much reminded me of classic horror scores from the past. I will not give much away but the story was strong in this one and I would highly recommend it to any fan of Asian HORROR. It is not extreme, it should not be taken with the utmost seriousness, but it is really good.
