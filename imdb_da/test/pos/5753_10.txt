My God, that's funny stuff. Yes, it is puerilt in the extreme, but also quite witty ("Here's the page with all the wines on it." "It's a little early for us, I'm scared." "Well, what are you doing?") And the battle sequences is something else. Despite what you may have heard, the laughter can come and in a surprisingly generous rate. Rich Mayall and Adrian Edmondson's pure comic abilities help keep it immensely fun. twist every drop of comedy from the script. I can only compare it to "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" - you find either the movie hysterical everywhere or not at all; The same applies here. It's probably the funniest British movie since "Withnail and I", but to say it's an acquired taste, some of a gross (sic) is understatement.
