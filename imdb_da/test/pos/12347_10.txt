Well-groomed, well-behaved teen Meg Tilly will spend the night in a creepy mausoleum as an inauguration in a high school. The problem is a strong psychic named Raymar was just buried there that day, but he is not completely dead and he needs man's vitality for his forces. Obscure horror movies offer lots of excitement and chills, an appealing and sympathetic cast and most superior special effects. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> A dark night is rated R for violence and adult themes.
