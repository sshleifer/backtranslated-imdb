A love work. Each frame is picture perfect and grabbed you. Then the pure feeling and storytelling takes you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are part of the character's emotional journey. I watched this movie at 2 festivals and it has standing ovations at every show. The remarkable storytelling transcends nationality and language, and I felt I was part of the drama that unfolded for me. The casting is as perfect as one can get. Vijay Raaz, Camille and Benoit each hold their own. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates good cinema. I can't wait for the commercial release of this movie.
