This is probably the best movie by director Hector Babenco. It shows a Brazilian reality that is unknown to foreigners, which is the same reality that pursues all Latin American countries, poverty and a survival instinct. The most affected in this reality is that the children are usually abandoned by orphans or abandoned by their bad parents to do so in a "dog eating dog" community many times that fall into the difference between crime, prostitution and crime. Very well-acted and with a "no frills" approach, this movie comes to you, Great story plot, one must have movies at one's collection. The main role went to Fernando Ramos da Silva, a young boy who fell into the crime wave, killed a few years later during a robbery. I would suggest people to watch the movie "Who Killed the Pixote?" so you can get a deeper idea of ​​the lives of these people. Some other characters from the movie had a similar fate, some dead and others in jail. Nevertheless, this movie lasts a long time in your memory
