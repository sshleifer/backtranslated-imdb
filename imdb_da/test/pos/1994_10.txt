David Cronenberg, similar to colleague David Lynch, is an acquired taste. An instructor who plays with themes such as reality, perversion, sex, insanity and death has to get the most extreme responses from the audience. He showed this with films like The Fly, Naked Lunch, Crash and eXitenZ (Capital X, Capital Z) and recently Spider. It is best to see the eXistenZ with a clear mind. Do not try to read too much about the plot or it will be destroyed for you. What I can tell you is that Cronenberg takes you on a trip down the world of video games that act as a metaphor for any kind of escapist behavior. Living fantasies is something that people always dream about, but how far can you go into it before reality gets blurred and your imagination takes over and turns into a nightmare? These are the themes that are touched upon in the eXistenZ, an exploration of identity, the human psyche, physical bodies that are invaded by disease, and most importantly, the reality itself. The story and the management are excellent. Cronenberg knows his trade very well and successfully brings an artificial world to life and avoids the usual pitfalls and clich√©s associated with stories like this. The film shows some rather obnoxious things, but is an unusual low key in the gore department compared to Cronenberg's other work. The choke effects he plays on are never over the top, and the plot progression is very intelligent and creative. It's not the most intellectual movie ever, but it will let you think about it, wonder and be confused. <br /> <br /> The play also gets two thumbs up. Both protagonists, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, play their parts perfectly and wisely portray the changing moods and identities of their characters. The dialogue may seem a bit old and clinical at times, but it is part of the effect that Cronenberg was going to create to create an unaffected and foreign atmosphere that puts you completely uncomfortable. Supporting actors such as Ian Holm, Don McKellar and a particularly scary Willem Dafoe lift the movie even higher with their disturbingly well-known performances. <br /> <br /> This movie is getting used to, but if you appreciate the dark tone, blood-curation pictures and existential warping history, you will love it.
