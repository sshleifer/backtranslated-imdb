I originally saw this at its premiere in the UK. I was fascinated by it, and it had me in its tears all its duration. I lost it from the television for storage, but over the years it has worn out. And television never seems to show it. Therefore, it was a pleasure to find out that True Movies owns copyright and shows it on their channels. This time I lost it on a DVD so I can enjoy it again and again. Lucile Fray (the game wonderful by Ann - Margret) discovers that she has cancer and is terminal. Her husband has arthritis, and although he is loving, he is an alcoholic and would not be able to take care of their children after she left. Therefore, she must find new homes for each of her children before she dies. The play is top notch, the music beautiful, and it has been wonderful time trial (it still makes me cry!) If you ever get the chance, you would be silly to miss this. It's a wonderful movie! A must see for everyone !!!
