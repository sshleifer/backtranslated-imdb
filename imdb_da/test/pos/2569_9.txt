This film is complex and interesting in many ways. It is an unobstructed abundance of emotions and taboo issues. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual abuse of children, New approach to religion in real life, and all linked with very crude and powerful blues music. <br /> <br /> I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie and the improvement of all the characters. And the end will be more comfortable than you might expect. The music is excellent, the writing is powerful and plays by everyone were brilliant. <br /> <br /> And the DVD has some amazing features, including Samuel Jackson's background for learning to play guitar and feel the blues. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for children and I even warn parents of teenagers.
