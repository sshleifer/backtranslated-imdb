Married to The Mob was one of the first VHS tapes I had with Coming To America and Grease. I still have good memories of this movie after all these years. Hell, I still have VHS in this movie in good condition. The story: Undercover cop Mike Downey (Matthew Modine) is sent to spy on Angela De Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer), the killed wife mafia member Frank "Agurk" De Marco (Alec Baldwin). He later falls in love with her after admitting that she is innocent of all this. Angela should not only deal with the unwanted progress of the mob Tony "The Tiger" Russo (Dean Stockwell). She also has to deal with her jealous wife Connie Russo (Mercedes Ruehl). <br /> <br /> Married to Mob is fun and still holds your interest when not trying to be fun. I like the little jabs it takes on the mafia life (the jealous mafia wife, the bully who is not aware that he is not a chicken magnet, etc.), and you like the characters in Angela De Marco and Mike Downey. It was the last of the fun phase of Johnathan Demme before becoming serious and giving you gems like Philadelphia and Silence of the Lambs (best thriller all the time). If you're in the mood for comedy, Married To The Mob is a keeper. It's better than the nonsense that fits comedies today (Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie, etc.).
