The film was apparently created by an idea that one of the authors had when he "saw" one of his creations in a supermarket. The inhabitants of Royston Vasey head into "our" world to persuade the authors not to stop writing about them and thus destroy their world. <br /> <br /> If that sounds too serious, don't be cut off. Within the first few minutes, we get: Bernice (the poor female priest) who lets go of an unfortunate punishment under confession; Chinnery (the vet who inadvertently destroys every animal he touches) tries to collect semen from a giraffe; Mickey (thick outside of faith) is, ah, thick; and Tubbs (inbred sister-wife and local shopkeeper) are sweet as always - but still obnoxious. <br /> <br /> Some of the common signs are missing, but a new idea from Gents introduces some 16th century characters - and we also have Gents in action. If you're new to The Gentlemen League, it's an easy introduction and a lot of fun. If you are a long-standing fan, this has everything you expected - including the joy of Jeremy Dyson spotting. <br /> <br /> All in all, it has the same weakly surrealistic humor that is featured in the series, plus some moments of quite touching 'introspection'. Sir. For example, Lipp maintains a mild dignity by learning that he regards his creators as a "one-joke character". While most characters remain as they are, some develop in unexpected ways that are quite natural when they happen. <br /> <br /> This movie is a "Swan song" for Royston Vasey, but it's also a showcase for Gents who prove it (gasp!) They can write other things - and it can be very fun. (But you knew it anyway.)
