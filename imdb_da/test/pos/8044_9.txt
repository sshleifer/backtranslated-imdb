The task is an excellent thriller with multiple plot twists driven by character, rather than star swings, the need to produce special effects, mandatory romance, and endless car chases. But there is a car hunt in here and a dandy it is. Aidan Quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval agency "are recruited" to remove him. It is rare for another or third actor, such as Quinn, to play an important role as this one carrying a movie. Usually, such a role is given to an A-list actor with box office draw, which is probably why I have never heard of this movie before I saw it. Donald Sutherland is great as the moral ambiguous, somewhat creepy sometimes agent who recruits Quinn. Ben Kingsley is also nice as the Israeli agent. The reason is very complex and there are several story lines that gradually converge towards the end and not all at once as we are used to seeing. Paranoia and claustrophobia of this type of thrillers are captured and depicted with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity. The location is compelling and efficient. The sound track is nothing special, but rarely do we get all the above-mentioned qualities these days without stupid and / or meaningless plot developments; convincing star turns; loud, annoying, music video type soundtracks; a villain who pours it up and repeatedly casts, costumes and plots that cater mostly to an audience under the age of 25. This is an excellent thriller, which certainly did not get its decay on its release. *** 1/2 of 4 stars.
