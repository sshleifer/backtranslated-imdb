This is a fascinating documentary about a 15-year-old black guy accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and the underlying lawsuit that follows. What this movie shows is how corrupt the US police system is and how easy it can really be to judge an innocent man and how a senile old stupid who thinks a black man looks a lot like another and sucks it if he sticks to prison because I said he was the man who murdered my wife. The star is the defense lawyer, who is brilliant at not only his work in court, but he also did what the police should have done all the time. Fascinating things. 7 out of 10
