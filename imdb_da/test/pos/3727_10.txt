It is difficult to use words for this movie, as it does not contain any. <br /> <br /> But the pictures it provides, both powerful and sweeping, are the ones that remind us why we are watching movies. And you might say "Well, Leonard Maltin doesn't like it, it can't be that good." But you're wrong. Watch this movie. French cinematic brilliance and ensemble.
