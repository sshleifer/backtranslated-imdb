Ed (randomly an editor) is employed to cut down horror films to be beneficial in Europe (where standards are much stricter). But he finds the movies very mind-destroying and starts to go a little sour. Okay, "little" can be an understatement. <br /> <br /> Let me just say this first: best. opening. scene. ever. A man in an office blowing his head with a grenade. His boss then says - with a straight face - "you're fired". The whole movie does not hold up to this intensity level, but it certainly tries. <br /> <br /> Take the shotgun scenes, beheaded, the rocks from "Lost Limbs" (as my friend Jason wants was a real movie). The author of this movie thought of the idea of ​​a woman being raped by a beaver and then immediately being shot in the face with a bazooka. It's something you won't find in any other movie (at least I'm pretty dubious you want). <br /> <br /> This movie is the biggest mistake the quality is. The picture is not as sharp as a movie from 1997 was supposed to be, and the sound could be stirred up (though it is not bad). I thought I saw a 1980 movie. Although it gave it a bit of a boost in my heart - the film also had the 1980s style of writing and looking into it: a sense of fun and giving the audience something extra over the top. I miss those days. I wish I had more to say, but at the moment I can't think of anything strong enough to praise this movie. I think you should see this. You've seen the box in your video store with the ax splitting your head ... maybe you've passed it a couple of times. Maybe you thought it would be cheesy. Pick it up. Enjoy it.
