I'm completely disgusted, this movie is not sold. Anyone who loves this movie should send email to Disney and increase the demand for it. They should eventually sell it then. I would buy copies for everyone I know. Everything and everyone in this movie did a great job, and I haven't figured out why Disney hasn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a vicious good movie and should be seen by everyone. The kids in the new generation will not see it, and I think they should. It must at least be put back on the channel. This movie does not deserve a cheap download. It deserves the right thing. I'm sending them email now. This movie will be on DVD.
