Sometimes, but very rarely, a movie tells a story so well that it almost becomes difficult. This film tells several stories so well while it was the first couple of times a movie I couldn't see for the completion. It was too real .... and the characters so strong to see it was a personal fight. When these three men and their families deal with their hardships, I especially hit me too hard. Now I have seen several times in its entirety without interruption, and I realize what I always suspect. This film is a masterpiece. The writer, the actor, the mix of several stories without being the smallest bit chopped, all about this movie is unusual. Seven Academy Awards? No wonder it must have deserved them.
