From 1950 comes a nice thriller about a few smuggling diamonds from abroad and also infectious diseases cups. Evelyn Keyes draws all stops as the main victim of this movie noir. Once back in the US she is not aware that she could spread the disease at all and everything she comes into contact with. Eventually she is persecuted and must be stopped before an epidemic occurs. Apart from Keyes striking performance, there is good support from villained Charles Korvin, William Bishop, Dorothy Malone, Lola Albright and Whit Bissell. The final is a humdinger with Miss Keyes on a building with spotlights and hundreds of spectators below. A good B flick!
