"Murder over New York" is an entertaining recording in the Charlie Chan series of movies, but if you are aware, many plot reveals itself to the attentive eye. While traveling to New York City for an annual police convention, Chan (Sidney Toler) meets former Scotland's Yard investigator Hugh Drake (Frederick Worlock) on the same flight. Now engaged in military intelligence, Drake tracks Paul Narvo and his Hindu servant suspected of sabotage around the world. Drake believes that by contacting Narvo's outrageous wife, he will be able to cope with the main criminal's whereabouts. <br /> <br /> When Drake is killed in George Kirby's library, President of the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation, Charlie theorises that he was killed by a newly discovered toxic gas called "tetrogens", administered via a glass pill that releases the poison when it's broken. Calling Kirby to bring all his evening party guests together, Chan and Police Inspector Vance (Donald MacBride) question those who are present as one of them may be the killer. Among them is Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), an Oxford student from Drake's actress, Jun Preston (Joan Valerie), unknown to Drake, but asked him to attend, Ralph Percy (Kane Richmond), the chief designer of Kirby's airline, and Keith Jeffrey (John Sutton), Kirby's stockbroker. Kirby Butler Boggs (Leyland Hodgson) is also a suspicion, especially after number # 2 Son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) catches him steaming open a cable frame whose content relates to Boggs himself. <br /> <br /> There are some other wise planted characters in the case as well. Mrs Narvo emerges as Patricia West (Marjorie Weaver), and unlike Drake's suspicion that she can lead him to Narvo, is actually fleeing her former husband and a disastrous marriage. She is involved with David Elliott (Robert Lowery), head of a chemical research firm, and thus a suspect in the tetrogenic angle. <br /> <br /> As with many Chan movies, racial comments must be violated. This one offers two brilliant ones. When Kirby's black servants are brought in to question, he says he does not know about Drake's murder that he is completely "in the dark". Chans answer: "The condition seems contagious". <br /> <br /> Subsequently, after Inspector Vance's order to round off all the Hindus in New York, Jimmy Chan comments on their arrival with "They're all starting to look the same to me." In fact, the scene gives one of the elements of comic relief in the movie, which Shemp Howard imitates Hindu mystic "The Great Rashid", but is actually uncovered by the police to be designer Shorty McCoy. <br /> <br /> Before the movie is over, two more victims fall to the wise Narvo - his confederate Ramullah and the flight magnet Kirby himself. To uncover the killer, Chan in collaboration with Elliott arranges a test flight aboard a newly developed TR4 bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the day before. Before it can trigger the deadly poison, Brit Fenton catches the falling capsule in the middle of the air and reveals that he knew about the plant. Arrested and brought in to question, Chan claims that Fenton is not Narvo. The real Narvo reveals himself when he offers a poisoned cup of water to the nervous Fenton eager to maintain Narvo's secret. But Chan was clever enough to be cautious about such an attempt and reveals the real killer - Narvo now in charge of stockbroker Jeffrey, who has undergone reconstructive surgery after a car accident. <br /> <br /> Now for the plot holes. At the first examination of Hugh Drake's murder, police maintained that fingerprints found in the library were not in accordance with any of the dinner guests. But Jeffrey / Narvo was present at the dinner party. It had already been established that Drake had a non-party visit to the library chemist Elliott. If fingerprints did not really belong to Narvo, then it was a problem that was meaningless. <br /> <br /> Also at the end of the movie, when Narvo offers Fenton the poisoned water, how did he think he would get away with it all who witnessed? But going even better than that, how would a world traveling saboteur like Narvo have time and whether he should establish himself as a stockbroker in New York City, it just doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> For trivia fans, carry a few points to mention. In the movie, # 2 Son Jimmy is a college student studying chemistry when he comes to "Pop's" help to resolve the issue. In the former Chan movie - "Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum" - Jimmy was a law student. The toxin gas formula would be recast in a later Chan movie, this time by Monogram with Roland Winters in the Chan role in "Docks of New Orleans". In that story, poison gas from crushed radio waves is released similarly to assert its victims.
