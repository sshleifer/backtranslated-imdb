Don't let any reviews (critics, IMDb users or mine) affect you in watching this movie. I only read the plot premise and was fascinated. After watching, this movie is, in my opinion, definitely worth seeing. It gives a perspective on life that many people have probably not considered. However, it is not, as Leland himself says, a movie that "can be wrapped up in a nice package with a bow and everything." Other user reviews on this site claim to have a psychological background and imply that history is not possible. Clearly they missed the whole point of the movie, which is disappointing. for the least. <br /> In short, it is a well-behaved, well-oriented film. The story is not a good feeling, but I feel that if you do not get away from the movie, you feel good, you may just have missed something. To characterize it as "art house" is unfair, in my opinion, but since our society likes labels, it is probably what suits. If you find out everything there is to know about the world ... I would suggest skipping this. If you feel that movies should be a kind of escape "from the world" ... you will not find it here. But if you see it ... you can just find something in yourself.
