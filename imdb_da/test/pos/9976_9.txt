When you think of golf movies, you think of Caddyshack, but what if there are children around? Go straight to this movie! Disney user has been shaped to make a movie that adults and kids will enjoy. The action in this movie is, in my opinion, pretty good, and the leading cast is mostly very young! This movie is also supringly filmed very well and unique as all the angles of the golf game are seen. I think this movie should be up to some academic awards for movie editing or something similar because the whole stream of the movie is top notch. Although the end can be a little predictable, the movie goes well alone! It also shows that you don't have to pray, nudity or violence to make a great movie!
