Somehow, I missed many of the early Farscape episodes, so I see them in every possible order as they are repeated on different channels. I caught it first - completely by accident - while I was lounging in a hotel room. The first 10 seconds had me completely hooked - this is what SF is all about. <br /> <br /> The characters are strong; and Moya / Pilot the living ship is what Lexx should have been. The pieces vary in quality, but no one falls under excellent in my opinion. And I have to mention Ruggle - what a brilliant irreverent character! None of your smarmy sugar-coated Star Trek foreigners here, this is the real deal - cynical, self-service and full of vile personal habits, Rygel is the creation of a genius. <br /> <br /> Last week, the SciFi channel was "out of their mind" (the organic swap episode). A real classic, I couldn't stop laughing from start to finish ... <br /> <br /> Long may Farscape grace our screens!
