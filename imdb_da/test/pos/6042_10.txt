I haven't seen this fine movie in 50 years, but I still write a comment on it. <br /> <br /> While JACK WEBB's movies were undoubtedly solely intended as an entertainment --- showing Marine Basic Education at Parris Island realistically as a tough character building exercise - it was said the military was afraid the movie would discourage recruitment. It didn't work that way. The movie showed that getting into the Marines was a bigger challenge than most young people have ever realized, and (guessing what?) Offered a royal size challenge was exactly what many guys wanted. I personally knew lots of guys who joined Marines shortly after seeing DI. Lines on recruitment centers were suddenly so long that the marines had more recruits than they could handle. <br /> <br /> So it goes. America will always have youths who are trying to make the best of themselves --- while the slackers and the born losers are lining up nowhere. <br /> <br /> What we DO NOT have in 2007 is film that inspires patriotism, devotion to the duty of any kind, positive values, etc. What we have is movies that inspire airheads to be airheads, beer drinks to beer, other negative values. Exhibition # 1 is that the airhead teen travesty and beer guzzling epic SUPERBAD is now # 81 in the All Time Great Films list. Values? What do values ​​mean?
