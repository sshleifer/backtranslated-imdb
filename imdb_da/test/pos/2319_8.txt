The first few minutes of this movie do not do justice! For me, it is not fun until they control the bottom and the fun characters begin to jelly. I was born and raised in Norfolk Virginia and met my share of "different" sailors - I once married! Most of my favorite movies are just fun, not current, not addicted to sex or violence and fun every time I see them. Groundhog Day, Bruce Almighty and Down Periscope are still fun, even after I know the dialogue of the heart. Kelsey Grammar with his "God I love this job!" Be sincere, genuine and lovable. Rob Schneider is hysterical as the crew returns to him to be annoying. I'm still amazed at the size of the fishing boat next to a sub! I can see why people living in this life will notice uh-oh, but it's not a documentary, it's a comedy, and I just love it!
