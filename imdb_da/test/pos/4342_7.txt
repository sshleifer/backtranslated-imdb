Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very distant from Paul Kersey of the original film. If you remember the 1974 film, then you will remember that Kersey was a "Conchie" during the Korean War and that he was physically ill after committing his first execution. Ten years later, Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time. But I will overlook the gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels, low-living foam bags are shot dead, burned alive, their teeth smashed and thrown to their death by middle-aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes. Yes, I know the band members are multiethnic, and for that they deserve some credit, but even though they are not racist, they still murder foam that deserves everything they get from Kersey and the innocent citizens. Who needs Mayor Rudy when you have Paul Kersey, an anti-tank rocket and a bunch of retirement pensioners to regain the streets of the criminals. Paul Kersey I greet you sir
