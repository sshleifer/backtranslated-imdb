Lloyd Hamilton was one of the most imaginative (and among the funniest) of all the silent movie comedians. Why is he completely forgotten? Unfortunately, the original negatives for a large percentage of his films were lost when the Fox store burned in the early 1930s. Hamilton was not beautiful or graceful like Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd; He was also not brave as Raymond Griffith. And unlike Harry Langdon and (again) Chaplin, Hamilton did not try for the public's sympathy. <br /> <br /> But his movie was hugely popular at the time of their original release, and they remain hilarious today. Oscar Levant once claimed that he asked Chaplin if there was any other comedian he'd ever envied, and Chaplin instantly called Lloyd Hamilton. The character most frequently exhibited by Hamilton on the screen - a flat-knit naff with quick hand movements and a duck-like gait - was later adapted by vaudeville comedian Eddie Garr (Teri Garr's father) and further adapted by Jackie Gleason as his 1950s television character 'The Poor Soul'. <br /> <br /> 'The Movies', pseudonymous by Roscoe Arbuckle, is one of Hamilton's most innovative shorts, and it's fun. We see him first as a national boy and bid farewell to his family outside their home cabin on the way to the big city. Then he climbs away from the cottage and we see that it is in the big city where traffic is flourishing around him! <br /> <br /> Finally, our hero ends up in a restaurant (unredited, but it is the Montmartre Cafe in downtown LA) where all the film actors eat between take. There is an entertaining gag when Hamilton's bumpkin character meets three actors in costume and makeup like Presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt. This gag would have been more fun if the ancestors looked more like the originals. Finally, our boy gets to a table and hopes to meet a celebrity. Sure enough, entering the restaurant and sitting at the very next table is a great movie star ... none other than Lloyd Hamilton! There is a very well made double exposure shot - the member is almost invisible - when Lloyd Hamilton as himself greets Lloyd Hamilton as the country's boy. Fortunately, Hamilton's highest creativity was very short. He began his film career in raw slapstick movies as half of a double action (Ham and Bud, opposite Bud Duncan) and had a short and flaming period with the star in shorts in the late silent period. Sound film was not friendly to Hamilton, and he was quickly driven down the cast list in some raw early talkies. Then he died young. Fortunately, 'The Movies' is quite fun and a great introduction to this unique comedian's style. I would rate it 7 out of 10.
