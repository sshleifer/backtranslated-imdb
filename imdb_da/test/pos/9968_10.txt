I saw The Merchant of Venice last week. Great acting by Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Finnes and Lynn Collins. Compare with other films based on Shakespeare's play, this production has made the game so easy to understand and follow. Bravo to Michael Radford to manage such top players. The costume and scenery are good, and as it was filmed on the spot in Venice, it provides movies and authentic tastes. I had read the play thirty years ago in school, and emphasis was placed on the character's anti-Semitic behavior against the Jews and the cruelty of Christians. I don't know if this movie is controversial, but at least I'm sure it will get Oscar nominations.
