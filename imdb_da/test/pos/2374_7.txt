The final pass sees Sho Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi (looking cooler than ever in his reversible overcoat!) Fought each other for a final battle this time in the future. The reason owes much to Blade Runner, but made in Takashi Miike's low budget, frenetic, comic style. I felt it was the weakest of the three DOA movies, and although the ending was still monstrous, it lacked the shock value of the two previous ones. Compared to the similarities Ichi the Killer and Visitor Q, DOA: Final is not as close as extreme but is true to the other two films in the trilogy. That said, fans from the first two (and fans of Miike) will get a lot of this as it ties all three films together and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two main characters.
