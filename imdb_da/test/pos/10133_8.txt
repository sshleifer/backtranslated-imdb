This was unusual: a modern movie that was ultra-nice. In fact, it was so nice that it was too hard to believe in parts. When I looked at this based-on-a-real story, I thought, "No one is this handsome, this tolerant." Essentially I referred to Ed Harris's role as "Coach Jones." I think they went a little overboard on his character, but it's better than the reverse: shows him worse than what he was in reality. Nice to see Harris playing the role too, as he has a long-standing resume of playing ugly, profane characters. I'm still not complaining about a nice, good movie, and it's nice to see a bunch of well-meaning, nice people. These folks lead their friendship, love and compassion to "James Kennedy", better known as "Radio", a mentally slow high school played by Cuba Gooding Jr. History takes place in the mid-1970s in South Carolina. Gooding also does a good job with the role. But as Sean Penn's role as a mentally challenged man in "I'm Sam" is an hour and a half of a sign like this enough. Then the sound of these guys gets tired of hearing. <br /> <br /> Note: It was interesting in one of the documentaries on this DVD to find out that this year, in fact, "Radio" was making its transformation, not months as shown in the movie.
