As much as the "Beginning" showed that we still want "classic" x files, Drive showed that X-Files should explore new territory. They start by giving us a unique teaser for Drive, with the news camera recording. It was an interesting transition from the TV to the real events. I would have liked it even better if they had kept the news patterns camera for whole teaser and not cut to the inside of the car. By seeing this episode live back in 1998, I thought, "Am I on the right channel?" The first autopsy of Scully flooded me with big words, which I do not understand. I think she learned her lesson to always wear a mask before performing an autopsy. Silly Scully! What is the problem with the lighting in the autopsy lab? It's as dark as a grave in there! How do they see what they're doing in there? Assistant Director Kersh gets his first line in this episode. I have no love for that man. He is the third recurring character in a series introduced that you love to hate, the first two being Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender. I think the producers felt that there was too much love for Mulder, Scully and Skinner. So they had to add some signs to give our favorite agents some grief and spur our ire as fans. I love quarantine suits worn by Scully and her team with the cool helmets. Boy. It is really smoky or misty in dry northern Nevada at night. Can we say the word "effect"? Drives are a cool episode, but looking at route 36 on my American atlas, there's no way Mulder could have maintained a speed of 70-100 MPH on that road. If he had been on I-80, freeway, maybe. But no way on a state road with so many curves. All the movie inside the car looked very authentic. Excellent job by Rob Bowman. It looks nothing like the old days of the obvious blue screen or cut of passing scenery outside a car window at a stage. This was a fun episode, but some of the inaccuracies keep it from being a good episode. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, so stick to a quick ride!
