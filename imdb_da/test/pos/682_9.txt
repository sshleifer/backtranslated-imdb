Beware, My Lovely is an experimental feature film from the early fifties and was directed by a man, Harry Horner, better known for his set of designs. Robert Ryan plays a craftsman who is employed by Ida Lupino to do some housework for her. The problem is that he is a psychopathic killer and does not know it. Miss Lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win Ryan over for some benefit. He is not the kind of man compassion could help or heal. Thus, we have an interesting situation for two people who basically mean good, but one of them cannot do well because there is something wrong with him. He suffers from periodic weaknesses in which he commits acts of violence which he later forgets. <br /> <br /> The effect Ryan has on Lupino is mainly that of the hunter and his prey or in another sense a sadist. The audience finds out early that Ryan is a crazy killer, but Lupino takes it much longer. Thus, we must live with this knowledge as we see poor Miss Lupino try everything in their power to "win" Ryan over to make things work, get the job done, get on with life. But getting started with things is not in Ryan's makeup, as he is unable to do more than the most rudimentary forms of normality, and as soon as there is an opening, his paranoia claims himself. <br /> <br /> As a study in mental illness, the film is not too impressive. What it is superlative of, shows the effect of major mental illness, with dangerous psychopathology in the mixture, and its effect on a normal person. In this respect, the film is realistic and compassionate, but relentlessly logical, knowing that Lupino can't 'fix' Ryan, but we want her to. The result is that if you are willing, you can become extremely involved in this movie emotionally if you can set aside its melodramatic structure. <br/> <br /> Horner gradually shows us the layout of the Lupino house, a banning gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. We become familiar with stairs, kitchen and pantry; And we'll know which windows Miss Lupino can use for an escape and which she can't.
