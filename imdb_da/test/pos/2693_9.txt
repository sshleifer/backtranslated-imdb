This is one of the funniest shows on television today. It hits the mark 99% of the time. Usually after watching a sitcom after a few years, the actors become comics as if they were trying to become the beloved characters they play. In my opinion, these actors have been true to their roles. The chemistry is still there, the writing has not gone down, and I look forward to seeing it. Family dynamics still seem real, and the situations after all of this time have not been fetched so far to see that the authors are entering an empty bag trying to keep the show on another season. It's one of the few shows I see without the remote in my hand for quick switching.
