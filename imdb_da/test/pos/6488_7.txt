Sometimes it is difficult to define what distinguishes a successful, lovely comedy from one who falls flat. In this case, the rugged plot of a spoiled rich girl who plans to take her nieces away from Greenwich Village's "bohemian" who raises them, only falls for him, not promising. And nothing in director Leigh Jason's filmography suggests he was an overlooked great talent. And yet he must have been responsible for creating a relaxed and happy atmosphere on the set that was faithfully recorded on film. He also had the good sense of throwing this movie properly. One small mistake is Miriam Hopkins in a part that Ginger Rogers would have been perfect for. Hopkins is efficient but crazy, lacking the warmth and sexiness Rogers would have had. She is further hampered by a pair of bizarre long and soty fake eyelashes, sometimes a distraction. But a very young and very nice Ray Milland couldn't be better off in a bubbly, unobtrusive cartoon performance with great charm. And better than that, especially for New York City residents, the Hollywood depiction of Greenwich Village is in 1937. Although it is completely synthetic and idealized, it is again recognizable by a contemporary camera. Art Director Van Nest Polglase created a gracious battle of mews apartments and ramshackle common backyards, the perfect backdrop for this image's collection of artists, strikers, smart-alecks and wannabes. The best part of the support cast is Guinn Williams, who brings sweetness and light to her role as a prizefighter sculptor dressmaker, suggesting life's self-inventive and fluid (sexual and otherwise) life in the village. Even more refreshing are Betty Philson and Marianna Strelby, who play the little girls. Ordinary, intelligent and full of humor, these girls act like real people and are nothing like the professional children's actors of the time. Of particular interest are a few memorable comics: Ray Milland's vacuum cleaner demonstration to a woman with a howling baby is played with more spontaneity than you expect (the baby and his disturbances are wonderful 'found moments') and a fake home 'game' in a department store, who degenerate into a free It is also fun. The movie slowly slides downhill with a fair custody and never gets right back on track when the action moves to Long Island, but this movie is still worth seeing.
