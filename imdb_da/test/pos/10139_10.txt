Spoilers !!! To understand what really happened first, be a warrior, to be alive in real war, to think off-line, analytically, critically and not linearly. Otherwise, you will come to false conclusions that Maj.Gray was stupid or unstable. The truth is something completely different. He was firmly hardened veteran and the only way he could be killed by Capt. O'Malley is that he wants her to kill him. It was his way out. He chooses it. He was not a man who wants to retire. If you've never been to a first line, you can't understand it. He intentionally prepares his own suicide. First, he led Mary Jane when he intentionally acted as a stupid but advanced argument - closing incident before witnesses (to protect her later after she has done what he wants her to do if it comes to trial), than gave her a bullet make sure he could read his gun later), came that night, read his gun, woke her up, put the gun in his hands and acted as he attacked her after shots the first time he raised the knife and cried: " One kill "so she shot him again and before he died he put a knife as he tried to take him back again after the first shot. He also gave her a message with his last cry. "After the first kill everything will change in your mind and destroy your life. This is the only way for me to die as a man, but to be killed by someone I love is my choice and my only prerogative, war and army is not what you thought so far, grow up finally and save your life until you can. " She left military life at the end. She understood him. And he didn't die in vain. The man who helped him prepare everything and after the trial and outcome of this trial was colleague Sam Doran with the help of Tim Macy. Macy did not know what was really going on and what was the result, but did what he expected to do. He took pictures of Mary Jane and Maj.Gray on the order of colleague Sam Doran, who gave the order because Maj.Gray asked him to do so. After refusing to leave the army (what Col.Doran asked her to do), Doran persuaded the prosecutor to charge her with a pre-mediated murder (he knew she could not find quilty) instead of rape (there was a possibility to be found quilty) with taken pictures. Col.Doran also suppresses that there is no doubt that the prosecutor has doubts about prior murder charge, but let it be revealed during the trial, what has a great influence on the jury. I have no doubt about the outcome of this trial. Why coal. Doran did that way? Because he will do everything Maj.Gray ask him to do. Why? Because he saved his life on a battlefield. Why Mary Jane chooses to go to court? Because she was a person who has integrity, a principle. And so Maj.Gray chooses her. It must be someone deserving, someone honest. Keeping her secret about what really happened that night, she also shows her honor. <br /> <br /> Miroslav
