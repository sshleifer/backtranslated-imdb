"Father Hood" is an overlooked little gem of a "road movie". Fine performances by Halle Berry, Sabina Lloyd and Brian Bonsall, two really fun "over-the-top" ones by Diane Ladd and Michael Ironside, <br /> <br /> and a straight forward from Patrick Swayze. The movie is aided by an unconventional story, but poorly undercut by the flashback framing, resulting in a formal and abrupt ending. "Father Hood" would have worked much better without these "bookends". Nevertheless, the film raises important questions about "family responsibilities" and the implications of state intervention. As long as the fetal system rewards state institutions NOT to place children, such abuses will exist. <br /> <br /> Select this one up. It's worth the "ride".
