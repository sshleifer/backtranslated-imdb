I watched this movie early one morning in the early 90s when I was about 12. I have been trying to figure out what it was and finally today I did! I remember enjoying it and being a little freaked out at the end when it showed Gravestone of the young boy and his ghostly face! Can anyone let me know if I can get a copy of this that I would love to see again. I remember that the child is stuck in a cornish tin mine and then turns to a boy. can't remember the kids stuck there with miners but must have been. The boy helps them out of the mine and turns out to be the ghost of a boy who was dead while working there, I think.
