"Everything is enlightened" is like seeing a fine piece of museum quality artwork. It completely overflows the emotions through a very wide spectrum. Jonathan Safran Foer will be playing with Elijah Wood. He is looking for his fatherly legacy in Ukraine. His travels bring him into contact with Alex, played very well and with extreme humor by Eugene Hutz. His grandfather is the most emotional tie for this movie, and he is appropriately portrayed by Boris Leskin. If you find a little humor in human characters in this cinema, you must only turn to Mikke, a real dog called Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. by Alex and his grandfather. They also call him "seeing bitch". The kinematics are spectacular. The colors are a very important part of the film's patchwork. It's a movie worth time and emotional investment.
