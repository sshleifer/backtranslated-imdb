NBC put out a lot of good products when this series came out, but none of them got the viewers. At least, according to their managers, who wisely canceled good shows like Star Trek & My World and welcome to it because of low ratings. NBC advertisers got a good deal from NBC's ignorance. <br /> <br /> This show stands out as the only time James Garner was not enough to get viewers. It's ashame, as this show had an excellent support cast from Stuart Margolin (later Angel in the Rockford files), to Neva Patterson to Margot Kidder. It was set in a 1900 western city. Garner played a sheriff who did not want to use violence to perform his duties. It was small town stuff, but it was excellent. It wasn't long after that that Jim Rockford brought Garner back to success, but for my money this show was good enough, it just wasn't at the right time, right place or the right opportunity. <br /> <br /> The show was so good that most of those working on it got jobs at Rockford.
