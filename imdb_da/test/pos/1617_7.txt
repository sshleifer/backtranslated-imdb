In defense of this film, I must repeat what I had said before. The film is called Arachina, it has a name, and that doesn't mean a name like in actors playing in a little art house movie. I don't mean anything that in your local high school decided to make a movie name and it can have a budget of $ 2. So what do you expect? Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> I felt the movie never took itself seriously, which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list. This list is only for large budget star movies that take too seriously. The film Oscar comes to mind, most of Sylvester Stallone's film. The two leaders were not Hepburn and Tracy, but they did their job well enough for this movie. The woman kicked ass and the guy was not a blithering idiot. The actor who played the old man was actually very good. The man playing anal restrained professor was no Clifton Webb, but he did a god job. And Bimbo's lack of a better one was played by two competent players. I laughed at the 50 cent special effects. But it was part of the movie's charm. It played like a hybrid Tremors meeting Night of the Living Dead. The prerequisite for the movie is, like all Giant Bug films from the 50s. A meteor or radiation moves up the ecosystem, and before you know it, we have virgins, lobsters, rocks or lizards that terrorize the locals. A meteor was the cause of the problems this time. I was was very entertained. I don't expect much and I go much more than I negotiated.
