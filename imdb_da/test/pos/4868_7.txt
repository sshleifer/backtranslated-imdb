Chuck Jones 'Beep Beep' (so-called despite the fact that Road Runner clearly says "Meep Meep") is the second of the exceptionally popular Road Runner series and is a major improvement on its predecessor, the historically important but defective "Fast and Furry-different. While featuring several predictable quickfire gags, "Beep Beep" also expands on the first comic with more ambitious, longer sequences. Chief among these is a fantastic, extended hunt through an old mine where we see Coyote and Road Runner represented by two small lights. There is also a very fun longer gag that involves some rocket-driven roller skates. 'Beep Beep' also sees a great improvement on Wile E. Coyote's representation. Not only does he look more beautiful than his harsh prototype in the 'Fast and Furry ous', but he also draws the audience into the comic more with larger looking at the camera to indicate the brilliance of his idea or his fear of impending pain. Although it is a bit slow to get started (for many long-lasting shots of blueprints, the pace of some of the early gags prevents) when "Beep Beep" comes to the minus-axis sequence, it is clear that Jones began to get a real handle on these. signs and the greater opportunities for what he could do with them. There are better Road Runner cartoons than 'Beep Beep', but there is a true sense of victory over this cartoon, as if it were a confirmation that there was a series to be milked out of this scenario.
