I remember watching this movie as a kid and I was totally awe of it, I couldn't see my TVs. This movie has everything for horror fans! This movie had no fun moments expecting a few lines of stooge (which was my favorite character in the movie) Kevin tenney instructed this jewel and did a wonderful job with a low budget, I thought the end was great, the only thing that could stop them were surviving the night they were unstoppable killing machines! the effects of steve johnson we are excellent I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a love of low budget horror movies because as the old adage they do not make them like this anymore. The followers were also quite good, but not as good as the original ones. This is a must in any horror collection, buy it, if you can find it, you will not be disappointed
