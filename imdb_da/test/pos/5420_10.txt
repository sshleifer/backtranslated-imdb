This very entertaining card is considered one of the best shorts ever and I certainly will not argue with it. Even in a country where sharp animated shorts are created with regularity, this film still manages to stand out. If you ever get the chance to watch this movie, then you do it. It is only ten minutes long, and yet it contains a man obsessed with matter, a woman who vacuumes the bath and a nuclear war. What more could you have in a movie?
