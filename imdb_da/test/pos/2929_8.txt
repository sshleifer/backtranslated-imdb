This was another great season 11 season in South Park. <br /> <br /> Cartman fakes have Tourette syndrome to say what he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear by the other children in school. Kyle tells Principal that Cartman fails. But she doesn't believe that. Chris Hansen plans to have Cartman be on Dateline to talk about Tourette's syndrome live and uncensored. But later, Cartman begins to become so addicted that he can say what he wants him to accidentally say embarrassingly later. This was a fun episode about Cartman faking Tourette syndrome. I recommend it to any South Park fan.
