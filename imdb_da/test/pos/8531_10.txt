You must love this movie! I mean, what other Swedish splatter movie could be so evil, bizarre and cruel ... The whole movie is filled with a kind of strange humor, like: The old cencoreguy just blows his head and the boss just dries the blood of his glasses and says with a mean voice: - your lighthouse !!! wouppie !!!
