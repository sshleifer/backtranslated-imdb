I'm a big fan of Naruto, though I haven't seen every episode or read every manga. I really liked the first Naruto movie and to tell you the truth that I was a little nervous that this would not be as good (or action packed) as the first (mainly because this one in Australia only had one PG instead of one M, which is a PG-13 US or 12 UK). But I was wrong (luckily)! The animation was more improved (although some drawings of the characters on points looked, hurried) and were very good, especially in the battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about it, let's talk about the battle scenes! The animation and action in combat scenes was spectacular and very entertaining! I especially enjoyed genjutsu battle with kankuro and the fight with Gaara fighting the form of changing female warriors! All the characters you want are here! Naruto, Sakura, Gaara, Kankuro and Shikamaru! If only Temari were in the movie, Shikamaru could save her from the female warriors dramatically! And maybe they could have a PASSIONAT KISS! In my summary at the top, I say that this qualifies more like a piece of cinema than just an extended episode. And it does! The action is very cinematic, and the animation quality looks very fancy especially during the games! All in all, this is an excellent anime movie that is a must-see for any Naruto fan! 5.5! 10/10! 50/50! 100/100! Okay, I'll stop!
