Trapped this movie on TCM in the early A.M. It was amazing. Beginning slowly but viciously ... Scott is a shady person adorning women. In this case, two women happen to be due to a legacy in Southern California. <br /> <br /> The seats of the beach and neighborhoods of the 1940s are original and exciting. The title may have been more creative, but human nature and frightening shadows are excitingly exposed, almost in a Hitchcockian version. Scott reminded me of the character Uncle Charley in "Shadow of Doubt," one of Hitch's acclaimed favorite films. The audience learns, we really don't know what lurks in the dark side of the human mind. This movie is a displaced gem and worth buying. 10/10.
