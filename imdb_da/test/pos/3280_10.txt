I think Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important movie. It's an excellent entry point movie for a side of the story many aren't aware of. This is a story of early black colonists, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American war with a gold cache. The protagonist Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. Racism applied to the new black settlers and infantry is explored in this film with excellent casting, including Melvin Van Peebles (Mario's father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance of Big Daddy Kane. <br /> <br /> It is felt that Peeples have endeavored to use as many remarkable blacks (and some not so remarkable - smile) actors as possible :) Maybe for many, some remarkable people (Issac Hayes, Pamela Grier ) only scene in cameo, other cards like Tone Loc. Peeble's efforts to expose these actors will be understood by some. The great cast (a feat for any instructor) works well and does a good job of telling the story of the classic "revenge and struggle against justice" Western. Most noteworthy was the wonderful narrative role of veteran actor Woody Strode (from time to time in the West) whose own life was a barrier-breaker within the framework of an earlier era not yet completed faded from memory. No other actor could have done this role better. Read the mini-cinema on Woody Strode here as a primer: http://imdb.com/name/nm0834754/bio <br /> <br /> The film does a good job of balancing action with a little sardonic humor. The dialogue was excellent if it was a little modern! And as others have mentioned, the profanity was not correct during that period. The sex scene was a bit much - not really necessary. There are some historical inaccuracies such as The apparent electronic branding of the cattle, etc. But Posse is a good effort to hopefully open the door to more historical and creative works that reflect other countless stories and events. The actual pictures of real cowboys at the end credits were very nice.
