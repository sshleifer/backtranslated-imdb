I had never heard of this movie when it was given to me to translate so I didn't know what to expect. I checked it out on IMDb and was curious. It didn't take long to realize that it was a gem. Excellent performances, good history, and it is both well-informed and well-written. It's hard to compare it with other movies, but "Stand by me" will think, even though it has so many differences from "Cure" as similarities. The story of an extraordinary friendship between young boys and the dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this movie and "Stand by me". Apart from that, "Cure" is a fine movie in itself, well worth a wider recognition. It is dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also humorous. I can't think of a single thing that worries me about it. Having said that, I would not give the impression that it is a "perfect movie", whatever that means, but rather that I enjoyed it very much, was very much moved by it and would not change anything in it. I will not go into a detailed description of the story / plot, partly because it would be either too general or too revealing, and partly because you can find the information elsewhere on the website. Finally, I can only say: Wonderful movie, see it if you get the chance.
