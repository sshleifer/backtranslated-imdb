Okay, I'm not sure if this counts as a spoiler, so I just crossed the box to save the hassle. <br /> <br /> I have noticed that the opinions on this movie seem to be a fair split. Personally, I loved it, though I have to say I think some of the cameos were there to get a cameo. (Peter Kay?) Personally, I'm just grateful that it wasn't Edward, the Tubbs and the Papa Lazarou show and that they chose the 3 best characters in the series to watch the movie, especially Sir Goeff Tipps, without a doubt the funniest of it is actually less of a summary more of a rather blunt blog-like thing, but what the hell, the movie was great, and I think that's all that matters.
