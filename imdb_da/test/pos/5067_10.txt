To solve a challenging problem, start by asking the right questions. Without these, even the largest information library is useless. This movie does just that - where other movies control your thinking along a storyboard, this movie draws on your feelings and your understanding of justice and what is allowed. These questions will draw on you all the way and challenge your assumptions as the characters evolve. This movie is important. It is relevant, and one must look for anyone who keeps abreast of current affairs. The fact that it is very entertaining and includes a lot of movie stars only improves performance. My advice: see it with a serious crowd or better yet, not contrary to how you want to read an editorial from your favorite magazine. In this case, there is a difference: the answers will be your own.
