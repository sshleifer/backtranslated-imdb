A tale of a young boy, Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) with AIDS turning to a hard and tumble boy (played by Brad Renfro) his exact opposite, The Cure is sad if it is a little too soapy, draws on your feelings "message" movie with it is the heart of the right place. For that fact alone, it is a recommended view. The highlight may just be to see them find friendship and hang out with each other when no one else accepts them. <br /> <br /> But since the real story is about the boy's AIDS, things begin when a day at the local supermarket is underway with a checkout magazine that says a New Orleans doctor has discovered cure . Both of them, of course a little naive, make it a plan to set off for New Orleans in everything possible. Which kinda took me in two ways. It's a myth of heart warming, and I hate to nit-pick, but I found the plot to be wandering in a melodramatic, predictable sense, and the matter has a brilliance over those that only movies can do. I could not escape the dragging notion that I was watching a car movie about self-discovery, illness and upbringing. For example, I know they are young, but I found it a real job to believe in the things these boys do. Like boiling wood, the hot 'tea' leaves and drinks or eats an experimental diet of chocolate bars because they think it will fight the devastating disease. Not to say anything about those who make a cruise journey, as they do not have legal or just frightening consequences. Still dissatisfaction aside, the movie conventions you come to expect, it's a story worth seeing especially with the family.
