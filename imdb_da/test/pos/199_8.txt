Looking at this movie recently, I had to remind you that it was made in 1957 .......... and in the Soviet Union! It makes it even more remarkable. Many of the cinematic effects in the film seem clich√© in 2002, but they were quite original in 1957. I first saw this movie in 1963 when it was first released in the US and I was struck by its originality then. Now I've just seen it 40 years later, I have no reason to change my mind.
