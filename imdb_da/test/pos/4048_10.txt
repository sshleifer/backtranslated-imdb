I've probably seen movies 4 or 5 times. Each time, I am increasingly impressed with how far the desire of a young heart can go, and Kai and Gerth's strength to fight for what they believe in. <br /> <br /> And the whole story is presented in such a way, you are just transferred to the plot and before you know it, you are there. you can see ... yes, there is kai ... working hard on the mirror ... a little jump .... there is Gertha, fighting for her love ..... and there is the snow queen ... <br /> <br /> It's just a wonderful mix of love, adventure, excitement. It's 10 out of 10 brilliant
