A girl begins to notice that people in their small town are fascinated by something shaped like a spiral. Soon the fascination with obsession turns and things become mortal. While I don't mean that "Uzumaki" was an excellent movie, I would say that it was unlike anything I've seen before. Throughout my viewing, I felt like I was seeing a cartoon. There are fun cigarettes between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes. Later, I found out that the film is an adaptation of a many cartoon, so it makes sense. But just when you think you see something that could be a child's movie, you're bombarded with ugly and horrible pictures! The story often does, and the end is somewhat abrupt and seemed to be anti-climactic at the time, but gradually I appreciate it more for its originality. My rating: 7/10.
