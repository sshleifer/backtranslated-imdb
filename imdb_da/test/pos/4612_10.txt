A powerful debut film by Murali K. Thalluri, exploring events in the life of a group of high school students, each in crisis somehow. The movie starts with the discovery of one of the students and tracks the group's life during the previous hours and leaves the audience in excitement until the last minutes regarding the identity of the deceased. Each of the protagonists faces major stressors that we could see as potentially debilitating suicide. The cast of unknown gives performances full of power and emotion. Fantastic well done, especially considering the young of the author / director who was 19 years old when he wrote the manuscript.
