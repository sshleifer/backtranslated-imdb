History of a widow (Claude Rains) who raises his four daughters. Emma (Gale Page) is loved by big hunky Ernest (Dick Foran). Thea (Lola Lane) is romantic by an old but wealthy man. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to become a singer. Ann (Priscilla Lane) is a romantic one. Drop dead handsome Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), a business associate of their father, will stay with them. All the sisters fall in love with him. Then comes the tough cynical Mickey (John Garfield) into the picture ... <br /> <br /> Very entertaining movies were a big hit and nominated for the Five Academy Awards. It is beautifully managed by Michael Curitz, has a pretty good (if predictable) script and a very attractive cast (especially Lynn). Also this was John Garfield's first movie and made him a star. This was so popular that there were three or four successors (which I never saw). This is an exciting, entertaining, great budget soap opera - worth seeing.
