Outside is undoubtedly a classic Australian television series. Well-defined characters, tight scripts, varied and interesting places, amazing guest stars and a cinematic atmosphere combined to make this series a special one. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Andrew Keir has gone further and Sascha Hehn from Germany doesn't seem (unfortunately) to have had a small screen success in his home country. ABC has repeated the series many times, but there is not yet a DVD release. <br /> <br /> The series is one that is timeless. It is just as likely that there will be a resonance chord with viewers today as it did in their own day. Come on ABC ... publish The Outsiders on DVD !!!!!
