This kind of anxiety can only be within a young person who seriously looks at his religion and place in this world. As the text at the beginning of the film says, these images are dead: They were earlier and have been right from the moment the product was ready. But it is only for the creator of these "products": Maybe to someone who is in the same state of mind (I think many people, at least of those who are seriously interested in religion, go through the same terrible fear and doubt in their personal development). And that is of course the reason why art is made in the first place: identification and comfort among fellow human beings. <br /> <br /> This movie very well uses the "classic" technique of the experimental cinema. And this is where the techniques, in my opinion, are best possible: as an instrument to tell stories and create atmosphere for them, not just as pure abstractions or as an end to themselves. These "tricks" have already been made many times. Some other movies that I imagine have influenced / inspired this director are "Eraserhead" and "Nosferatu". It is interesting how these techniques make this movie completely timeless: There is nothing contemporary in this movie. Or nothing from any other particular time either. It could have been done a thousand years ago. It is interesting in this story how these people treat this newborn holy child: they use it selfishly for their own purposes and do not even try to listen to him. They beat him, rip off the intestines and castrate him. They pull their (living) body with power from place to place. And they make the same kind of violence to their mother. The story also reminds me of Borges' short story "El informe de Brodie". The criticism of the practice of the Christian institutions also reminds me of the great "El Topo". <br /> <br /> Uncomfortable watch at times, but beautiful. Very simple, thoughtful and concentrated. Very strong film, almost too strong. All human energy has been concentrated on this. Also this film shows that when you have passion and ideas, you can make a movie with a round zero budget. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit it was a little difficult to look at a "modern" viewer like myself because of the experimentality. It was so slow and demanding. But after all it's worth suffering. I have to give ten points just for the effort that someone makes this kind of movie.
