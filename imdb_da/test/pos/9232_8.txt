Someone has once defined what is the definition of AN INTELLECTUAL as: "A person who can listen to" The William Tell Overture "without thinking about LONE RANGER!" In this we warmly agree! It would certainly be a high order to achieve this, and one such as Leopold Stokowski, Arturo Toscanini or. Leonard Bernstein would find virtually impossible to do. <br /> <br /> And there's no disgrace here. The radio series and television series along with some movie series, feature films, syndicated newspaper comics and comics all contributed to making "The Masked Man of the Plains and his faithful Indian companion, Tonto" a deep seed element of our collective psyche and our literary folklore . As in most legends, it all started gradually, first with a series of Radio games written for local use in Detroit via Radio Station WXYZ. The creator was a George W. Trendle and Principal Writer on the series was Mr. Trendle's brother-in-law, Mr. Fran Striker. The year was 1933, when Ranger first rode out to "the former western US plains!" Lone Ranger, Tonto and Radio Series successfully ruled all the Americans in Depression Era through the mid and late 30s until and through World War II. But the post-war era found the country in the midst of a super-Nova explosion of invention and technology. There was a new communication medium ready in the wings but could not continue until both VE Day and VJ Day were achieved. When these were achieved and the world and America were ready to settle for both peace and prosperity. "New technology" was of course TELEVISION! And we would certainly need something other than the "Roller Derby" and "Wrestling From Marigold Arena" to fill out the broadcast times. And in the first place, the time a television station had something to do, except for the portrait of the mohican chief (test pattern, Schultz!). Very soon and in a hurry, the network began to drain their existing natural resources, their existing programming! Almost everyone would be mature to adapt to the TV screen. Then the people were over to Lone Ranger, Incorporated very interested as Producers Jack Chertok, Harry Poppe, Sherman Harris and Jack Wrather all approached them with an agreement to put The Masked Man and Tonto on the television waves as well as the radio. <br /> <br /> Immediately, they went to work and gave us the first season to make use of Radio's Big Logbook Drama, all potentially adaptable to television dramas. They played Clayton Moore, a fine supporting actor in many a feature film and with about a dozen years of experience. He had also done some work in series over at Republic Pictures' "Thrill Factory", which would be invaluable experience of "THE LONE RANGER". Cast as his "faithful Indian companion" and partner in bringing justice to different parts of the border, we had pure perfection in the character-supporting actor, Jay Silverheels. ** We have to mention that there was a gap in around '53 when Clayton Moore went and was replaced by John Hart. After a season Mr. Moore back in having been missed so much! Now back to our story !! The first years of the film gave the episodes a look and a sound all their own. They have made good use of the offscreen Narrator, which gave these shows a sense of authenticity and an individual, stand-out one of a kind series. The actors who were hired were all veterans of the films from the late silent era of the 1930s and 1940s. Many of them had only been exclusively "Cowboy Movie" players. A good example of this is the casting of Glenn Strange (Bartender Sam on "GUNSMOKE") as the vicious, murderous gangster, Butch Cavandish. And it was the Cavendish Gang's massacre of the Texas Rangers that led to the origins of John Reid (believed to have been beaten by the other Texas Rangers) as "LONE RANGER". <br /> <br /> In addition to old timers in the molding, you will find a lot of new and new and upcoming talents (so) in the molding. We see people like Phyllis Coates, Dwayne Hickman, Denver Pyle and others thrown from week to week. All this together with one always requires fair play, justice and peace in a western world. <br /> <br /> The last few seasons resulted in some major changes. First was the use of color film. It didn't make any difference as a color TV set was still far out for our household. The second was a new set of musical themes and queues. (Except Rossini's Finale from "U NO WUT!") The new music was never a great thing for us as we preferred the "old radio" stuff. <br /> <br /> With this series and two Feature Films made during this period, The Lone Ranger (Warner Brothers, 1956) and THE LONE RANGER AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD (United Artists, 1958), have the character been a permanent and indelible impression in our identity as a people, we Americans!
