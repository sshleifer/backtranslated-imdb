I have read the last comment on this film and have to totally disagree with it. <br /> <br /> You see, I'm of Portuguese nationality, and although this movie might say a little to anyone coming from Boston, it certainly says something to both Portuguese and Brazilian people, as well as immigrants everywhere. <br /> <br /> And why do you wonder? Well, firstly, this film is about two siblings nations: Portugal and Brazil. Brazil gained its independence in the early 19th century (by the shepherd of the Portuguese throne), and since then relations have greatly improved. <br /> <br /> But meaningful as it may be, there are still many prejudices. Due to the economic climate in Brazil in the 1990s, immigration to Portugal grew massively. You see, Portugal is not just a country that shares a similar language, culture and belief as Brazil, but is also a gateway to the rest of Europe. Some people were thus forced to make the decision to cross the Atlantic and look for a better life, and Portugal was the first logical place to try to immigrate. <br /> <br /> As is still the case with many immigrants, they were paid average below the minimum wage and were treated as "dirt" - only in this case, because the language is the same, they constantly became aware of their status as immigrants . <br /> <br /> Another curious thing about this movie is the idea it is conveying to how a man so knowledgeable about the history of his own country was still trying to make a quick buck through exporting coveted national resources. It is precisely people like this who keep Brazil in a constant state of arrested development, as the country is well equipped with natural resources and can easily climb the economic ladder if it gets a fair chance. <br /> <br /> In a sense, it turns out how colonialism still exists - Pablo represents the exploited people, Igor the man whose status as a "nobleman" (or at least rich or "good") is assured by the foreign colonial power, which is again represented by Kraft. <br /> <br /> If you've seen other films from Salles, you will recognize this as a recurring topic - the battle against an oppressive power. I don't mean to lecture or be overbearing to teach any story, but I thought this movie was symbolically very powerful. I am not saying that there was no room for improvement (as always is), but I think the last comment written on it was not only narrow but hands down ignorant. One last thing to say on this I suppose you have seen this movie with the eyes of an "American movie guard". No damage intended for this note, but I mean "foreign" movies may not all be about "beautiful scenes" - Art deals with the problems of its time. For example, you wouldn't expect Otto Dix to paint all the wonderful places in Bavaria and the Black Forest ... Why would you expect a film producer to focus exclusively on scenery when he feels more relevant issues to follow? br /> <br /> In a nutshell, do not judge film easily and only with two or three criteria. This film is very interesting, its photography is quite good, and even the idea of ​​black and white coloring goes hand in hand with what it is about. I think the image is targeted to the grain ... as reality, no? :) <br /> <br /> See it and reach your own conclusions ...
