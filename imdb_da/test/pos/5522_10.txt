Abe Zwick once perfected it, beautifully. He never made another movie, but created a brilliant portrait of homosexual self-hatred in this movie that is both caustic and influential. He commands the screen and presents a man's crumbling wreck that breaks down under the burden of an increasingly meaningless life. <br /> <br /> Paul (Zwick) is an aging queen who is somehow convinced that Stanley (Wayne Crawford), a doe-eyed idiot without the feelings of the future, follows his star. He's a little thief who's been having sweet hatred recently escalated. He has been forced to jump over the city and move to a suburb of Miami. As a disguise, he dressed like a dried old blue dust with just as much sweet sexual pain as the Church's wife. He tells Stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his "Aunt Martha". Paul himself has no friends, spending too much time alone in the house, and dealing with Stanley's dissolute lifestyle. It would be enough to get someone to cross the line to transgendered homicidal craze. <br /> <br /> Again, Zwick Paul portrays as a tragic figure who has completely lost understanding of how to relate to other people. Nevertheless, there is some poetry in his anxiety, which burns slowly during the film. He is tragic, but also elegant. This is ultimately a very sad movie. It certainly has many hilarious moments, but there is such an undercurrent of hopelessness and despair that humor is bittersweet. This movie is worth looking at the performance of Abe Zwick. He could really have built his career at Martha. She is quite gas when you know her. Just be sure to cut your hair and stop your horsing around. She really hates it!
