Anyone who criticizes 'Jacqueline Hyde' as something more than the playful and unthinkable erotic body that is supposed to be is just not playing with a full deck. Right from the title, it is obvious that this low-budget horror comedy is not meant to be taken seriously ... it's like the tongue of the cheek as a French mountaineering kiss, and equally titillating. The female cast members are all good and fun to watch. Check this out, Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown prince in soft-core horror. Unlike most soft-core horror flicks, this is entertaining throughout with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses. The film does not even attempt to follow the story of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic, but instead seeks to create risqu√© sight gags and erotic situations in every way. Blythe Metz, the brunette femme fatale who portrays the sexier, homicidal side of Jacqueline, is a real knockout. See and enjoy!
