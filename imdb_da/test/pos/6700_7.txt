Lifeforce is definitely one of Tobe Hooper's best movies. It has some amazing special effects and a lot of nudity, so it seems like a typical horror fan dream. The film has gone creative though, and I think it's because of the script from Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby. Beautiful filmography and a good spooky atmosphere make it a solid movie.
