Black Day Blue Night was actually good modern noir. Three young nomads who run from their own lives join forces on some of a road trip through a desert in the middle of the sky (as most modern noirs do). A woman finds out that her husband is cheating on her, and after finding him in a hotel room, he decides to start and start again. Strangely, she travels with her husband's mistress, who is forgiven, when sleazebag never told her he was married. And together, while driving in the rain they meet a third, very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets. While they are jealous and free and all suspicious of each other, the police back in the city have marked them as suspects in a policeman's death. <br /> <br /> The Black Day Blue Night starts with instant confrontation and throws in a pretty good story with all the stuff to mislead your suspicions about one sign after another, leading to a very unusual ending. That is, the movie starts with immediate action confrontation, and when you think the story is resolved, you are immediately pushed into another plot of the plot and reveal just a little more than you expected before the movie is over. <br /> <br /> But as some viewers have written, the end is a bit confusing and a bit of a disappointment. The murderer is not the one you would immediately expect, and when it was revealed, it becomes somewhat confusing because of a rather thinly explained feedback that reveals all the motives needed to solve the mystery. But actually there is a finale beyond what I think is the most interesting of the movie. Because modern noir always involves a circle of criminal suspects, almost all of them are guilty of something, it's also a genre that always involves money. And so the question in these films always remains - how far are the characters willing to go for money? <br /> <br /> If you like this rendering of modern movie noir, I'd suggest seeing Red Rock West (it's also got JT Walsh and some go-ons in the burst desert)!
