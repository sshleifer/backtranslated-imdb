This is an excellent Anderson production worth comparing with the best episodes of UFO or SPACE 1999 (first series). Of course, it's no SFX extravaganza or Star Wars pseudo-mystical tripe party, but a subtle movie that has a low tempo, but it conveys the scary, eerie and eerie atmosphere of the best Anderson productions: for lovers of "cerebral" sci-fi. Lynn Loring's voice is quite rude. SFX is good for this kind of product and trades are also good. Two astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun, but crash the earth home ... or do they? Oh, videophones! Occasionally peddled as the next 'all-time gadget next decade', but still happening 40 years later. The unit of the Earth's twin plane on the opposite side of the sun also returns in Gamera tai daiakuju Giron (1969), so who copied who?
