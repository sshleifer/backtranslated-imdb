Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) has committed an indescribable crime, stabbing the late younger brother of his ex-boyfriend Becky (Jena Malone). No one, at least of all Leland himself, can explain why he has done what he has done, whether the act was pre-mediated or spontaneous, done by hatred or love. <br /> <br /> In the detention center, Leland Pearl meets Madison (Don Cheadle), a one-time novelist who sees another option in Leland's case. But Pearl also wants to understand Leland's motivation and take him under his wing as a confidant in prison. <br /> <br /> The movie jumps from the past to the present several times, often allowing the past to act as a context for the present and vice versa. Writer / Director Matthew Ryan Hodge shows how Leland's crime - and the events leading to it - affect the people of his life, from Becky to his family to Leland's mother (Lena Olin) and foreign father (Kevin Spacey) to Allen (Chris Klein) , a young man staying with Becky's family after his own mother. <br /> <br /> The main feature of the movie is Gosling, which is perfectly cast as the 15-year-old pseudopsy. Like Bartleby Scrivener, Goslings Leland exists only; he shows little emotion under the film, but his expression instead expresses a sea of ​​guilt, sorrow, love and anger. <br /> <br /> Each of the main players might have offered their best work to date, saves Spacey (who isn't exactly a beginner). Special praise is due to Malone and Klein, two young artists who are better known for light hearted comedy dangers than the big drama in this movie. Another great advantage with regard to history is that none of the characters are flawless; no one is heroes out to save the day. This is simply not a black and white movie.
