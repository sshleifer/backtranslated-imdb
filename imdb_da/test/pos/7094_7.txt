A true thing rises above its potentially obscure material to give us a picture of a family of complex relationships and failed, real people. It opens with Rene Zeleweger discussing his mother's death with the District Attorney; Saving us the cheap movie footage of a "shocking" illness and death. From there, it goes into a look at a family system where everyone plays by a number of unexplored rules and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. <br /> <br /> William Hurt as the self-sufficient father, and Meryl Streep as the Suzy Homemaker mother are both excellent; nuanced and not what they seem to be. Zeleweger is sweet, sour and surprised with himself. Tom Everett Scott doesn't have much to do, but he does well. The story is predictable and takes at least one badly fussy trip it doesn't have to take, but the notion and the show of family as a place where anger and love are just as mixed makes it worthwhile.
