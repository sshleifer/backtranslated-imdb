Harvey Keitel gives a typical first-class performance in one of his leading roles as a brash, ambitious, uncompromising young co-producer Coleman Buckmaster, a really talented hot shot with a discerning golden ear and the son of a famous jazz pianist to launch. Coleman is eager to cut some traces with the smokin R&B outfit group (none other than Earth, Wind & Fire in their awesomely funky prime), but his stiff commercial grass head label A-Chord Records is powered by buoyant, mob-linked middle Road Square Jerry (a proper unhip Ed Nelson) wants him to record a hit single for the scary creepy carpenter-like pop cardboard trio pages, an allegedly creaking sheer pile that includes smarmy pedophile founder Franklin (a totally scary Bert Parks) , bitchy, neurotic daughter Velor (a nice, fleeting tour of perky, comely brunette Cynthia Bostwick) and hedonistic smack addict son Gary (formerly 50's juvenile sitcom staple Jimmy Boyd). The extremely naive and idealistic Coleman will learn how the music industry really works and play the downdown dirty game as best he can, otherwise he'll lose both the group and his credibility. <br /> <br /> Adopting an acrid, aggravating, corrosive, and effortlessly biased script from syndicated colonist and rock journalist Robert Lipsyte, director Sig Shore (who is most famous for producing "Superfly") shows a particular cynical and unimaginable depiction of the various bribes, pay-offs, broken promises, back-stabbings, duplicates and doubles, which is an unpleasant but inherent part of the largely corrupt rock music industry, with extremely thought-provoking thematic asides on Art vs Commerce struggling to preserve its artistic integrity, and the then-novelty, which pushes to homogenize stones for bland, useless, creatively stagnant mainstream respectability. In addition, this gritty, downbeat gem provides a rarely fascinating, meticulously detailed and completely trustworthy backstage glimpse of the recording process as recording booth cowboy Coleman fights gamely in his own words to "make chicken salad out of chicken s ** t". Nifty bits look like disc jockey and legendary "fifth Beatle" Murray K as leering, lecherous DJ Big John Little (Velor bites his hand for the Big John paws thigh during live live interview!), New York soul DJ and host of NBC Friday video videos Frankie Crocker as his own jazzy'n'jivin himself, R & B singer-songwriter Doris Troy (she wrote the lovely "Just One Look") as a church musician and tubby, bald 70s blaxploitation favorite Charles MacGregor as a priest at a wedding. The pretty bad sound and Allan Metzger's sloppy movie picture randomly adds the film's overall, ravaged, pan-round-the-edged documentary authenticity. Although technically a little defective, this movie is still one of the great, most bitterly pessimistic, effortless rock paws of the 70s.
