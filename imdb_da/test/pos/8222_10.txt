This adaptation to television was a wonderful vehicle for Bill Irwin to demonstrate his ability to perform physical humor. Based on a match between an actor and his writer / director, Bill uses his clowning antics to showcase a variety of skills, including hat tricks, pantomime, dance, and various physical entities. Although it takes a great swipe in the entertainment industry and his craft, it is exciting for people of all walks and ages. <br /> <br /> This work was removed as a particular PBS. Bill did a piece of it on the Tonight Show, but out of context it didn't go well.
