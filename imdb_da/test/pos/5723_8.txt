I have always been fascinated by silent movies. There is something about watching actors and actresses from 100 years ago performing. Enchanted by today's high-tech special effects, I always try to imagine what it was like to watch a particular movie at the time of its original release. It helps to appreciate the rough early cinema. <br /> <br /> "The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ" is a very charming production from Pathe, originally filmed in 1902 but expanded and finally released in 1905. Imagine a series of famous religious paintings coming to life, separated by title card and you want a good idea of ​​how this movie is. Eg. Is the scene where Mary and Joseph rest when flying to Egypt, almost identical to Luc Olivier Merson's 1879 painting "Rest on the Flight to Egypt", right down to Mary sitting on the famous Sphinx. While some might find these "live paintings" an imaginative cop-out, I found them very charming and very nostalgic. The sets and costumes seem to be straight out of a stage production of Christ's life. Possible from and elaborate on passion games of the day. Make-up on the cast is very theatrical, so much so that a close-up of Jesus is almost comical. Again, when others could be bothered by their boredom, I was quite charming. <br /> <br /> After being filmed for a period of 3 years, continuity is not so bad. The biggest flaws are in casting changes made over that time. The Signs of John the Apostles and the 12-year-old Jesus change in the middle of the scene, much to the audience's surprise! <br /> <br /> The best accidental humor of the movie is in the birth of Jesus. The child appears LITERALLY, as if in magic, in the manger between Mary and Joseph. Perhaps it was simply my state of mind at the time I considered it, but I laughed aloud! If only the child's birth was so easy !!!! To the top is the actress who plays Mary bored throughout the scene (actually throughout the movie), as if this kind of thing happens every day! My how times have changed! <br /> <br /> As simplified as this movie is, compared to today, it truly is a wonderful window in the past. I highly recommend it! <br /> <br />
