<br /> <br /> When I accidentally rented a thousand acres, I thought I was in an entertaining King Lear story, and of course Michelle Pfeiffer was in it, so what could go wrong? <br /> <br /> However, I realized very quickly that this story was about a thousand other things beyond just acres. I started crying and couldn't stop until long after the movie ended. Thanks Jane, Laura and Jocelyn for bringing us such a wonderful subtle and compassionate movie! Thanks cast, to be involved and portray the characters with such depth and gentleness! <br /> <br /> I recognized the evil sister; Runaway sister and sister in Denial. I recognized the Abusive Man and why he was there and then the Father, oh the Father ... All played excellent. I also recognized myself and this movie was an eye-opener, a relief, a chance to meet my own truth and finally do something about it. I really hope that thousands have had the same effect on some others out there. When I didn't understand why the cover said the movie was about sisters fighting over land - they didn't fight each other at all - I saw it another time. Then I could see that if one had not lived a similar story, one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of fear and fear and the deep bond between the sisters running through it all. That is precisely why people generally overlook the truth about their neighbors. <br /> <br /> But another reason why this movie is so perfect! <br /> <br /> I do not give a rat's ass (excuse my French) whether the King Lear story is followed. All I know is that I can honestly say: This movie has changed my life. <br /> <br /> Stop the good workers you can and make a difference. <br /> <br />
