2005 will go down in 'Dr.Who' history as the most incredible year. Everything seemed to click; a first-class new doctor and companion, large audience (10 million for the first episode and Christmas sales), great prizes, critical recognition, and the idiots who spent years giggling at Dalek's seemingly inability to negotiate stairs became silent. But then Christopher Eccleston dropped a booth and finished only one series. It looked like honeymoon was over. Fortunately, the public seems to have embraced his successor, the excellent David Tennant. In addition, the show boasts fine S.F.X. as the space ship crashing into 'Big Ben' in 'Aliens Of London' and amazing story lines like 'Tand & Claw', 'Army of Ghosts / Doomsday'. The new 'Dr.Who' is basically the same as the old one, only updated to the 21st century. Some fans have accused Russell T. Davies of destroying the show. They must remember that there was no show for sixteen years until he came together.
