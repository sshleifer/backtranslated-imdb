First, this movie has no history. It is obvious that there were many rewrites during the production - sometimes signs refer to a timeline that is impossible and that is probably because the timeline of the whole story was never known to anyone on the set. <br /> <br /> That said the movie is a bit brilliant. Pfeiffer is amazing - and I mean fantastic, like Catwoman; she nails the character's inherently sexy dark and good / bad tendencies. Walken is Walken - but even more wild than usual. Devito is not true in the comic when it comes to penguins, but he is good and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keaton is underestimated as Batman. <br /> <br /> Music and style are pure cinema experience. True, the third act does not work. But the last 2 scenes are knockouts, and it is clear that Pfeiffer and Keaton should be in a trilogy tracked by the movie's kinky darkness. It's too bad because Pfieffer and Keaton had classical chemistry, and if they had traded in a third installment, Joel knows you might not have had the chance to destroy Batman for a whole generation of movie fans.
