I've seen a couple of Mr. Boorman's film and did not like much of them. Not that they are bad movies, on the contrary, are good movies, but not content I personally found entertaining. But I think where the heart is, even if it is done to accommodate the less artificial American audience, is masterful as a satire, and as a social commentary on the times it was made in. I had to replace this movie in my collection at least half a dozen times, since every time I lend it to someone I know could appreciate it's art at all levels, my copy fails to come home to me, lol. Last time took 7 years to replace it when it was out of print for VHS sales, has never been made as a DVD that I know and had to wait for one of the premium cable channels ran it before I could lose it again. <br /> <br /> My favorite aspect of nail-on-the-head social comments is the paintings by Timna Woollard. I have been searching for 15 years to find someone or anywhere who could lead me to where her work is for sale. Or even better a copy of the paintings in the movie without the final credits rolling over them. I have a room in my house that I dedicated to putting copies of her paintings in, and no one seems to know if it was ever released as a coffee book or a video aquarium or as a documentary for her work. If anyone knows where I can buy any kind of copy of Timna's work or where her study is in England, do not hesitate to contact me by email.
