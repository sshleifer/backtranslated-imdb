I have not read the novel on which the film is based. So I can't comment on what is missing or if there were changes. <br /> <br /> As I said above, I had a wonderful experience watching THE KITE RUNNER. I find it when I watch movies about cultures other than ours here in the US I learn how other people live and exist. <br /> <br /> The actors in this movie are from Afghanistan and other countries in this area. There are 3 toddlers in this near epic movie in their first roles, they were amazing. The scenes that were apparently in Kabul were shot in different parts of China, I suppose the area resembles the actual places in the book. <br /> <br /> Mark Foster directed and he found NEVRRLAND, he has created the same magic here. <br /> <br /> All aspects of production are top notch. /> <br /> I found this a better movie than the nominees and won the Oscars. <br /> <br /> The movie is subtitled, it is very clear to read. It has a proper PG-13 rating. SPOILER ALERT --- The childhood area is very well managed. <br /> <br /> However, I cannot give this a 4 star rating as the general plot and story line we have seen many, many times, Non-the- less this is a very worthy movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
