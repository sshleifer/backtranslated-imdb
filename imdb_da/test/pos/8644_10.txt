Hitchcock would be proud of this movie. Even when nothing happens, it's exciting. Director David Lynch spends a couple of cheap thrills here and there, but he interspersed them with other movie techniques to prevent it from becoming stubborn. <br /> <br /> Quite surreal, this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible. I'm still trying to figure it all out and will probably see it again to catch things I missed and that can help me understand better. It is a very detailed plot that comes very slowly together so you have to be patient and attentive. Get your bathroom out of the way before it starts. And yet the plot is overshadowed by the theme, the mood, the character development and the film recordings. <br /> <br /> The two roles of the main actress Naomi Watts show their immense talent. That was when I could get the eyes of her co-star. Which couple. <br /> <br /> Lynch surprises the entire movie with unusual camera angles, the length / timing of the editing cuts, jumping back and forth between scenes. Combined with the clever use of music and sounds, it all helps to create excitement in our minds, no doubt a main goal for the director. Well, he kept me on the edge of my seat, even I had to talk to the actors to be careful here and not be so naive there. You know the kinds of things you want your children to do at the cinema.
