This is an excellent, exciting, murder-mystery movie. Not only was the plot filled with excitement and intrigue, but you get to see beautiful Ryan Gosling for a couple of hours, what's not to love! Sandra Bullock is also good at this movie - I've always been a fan of her (I just wish she hadn't decided to be in "The Lake House" which was terrible, but that's another story in the whole taken). Of course, since there are thousands of other murders / horror films out there, there are bound to be similarities between them, no need to bash this movie to have some similarities with at least one couple already made. Anyway, this is a great movie for those of you who actually enjoy "scary" movies, it's a little dark and twisted, but generally a good movie !!!
