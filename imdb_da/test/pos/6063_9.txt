This production, which is based on genuine Danish crime stories, is an experience through excellent management, acting at all levels and having a nerve that is not often seen in crime series. Every episode is a thrill, because it looks like the hollow hole thinks "this is my life right now - this murder or murder is my responsibility to solve" and the output is brilliant. As a seer, you just have this wonderful filling of being entertained because it feels like their focus, intentionally or not, lies on it, they want you good time ...: o) Don't miss this, it's just below the 'Band of Brothers' quality and is a "must have seen" experience - What a wonderful time of crime!
