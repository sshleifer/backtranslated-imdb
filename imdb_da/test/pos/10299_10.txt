This is a stunning movie: a romantic thriller with an enchanted yet perfectly constructed and destructive symmetrical plot brilliantly curtailed by the recurring visual motifs. Everything in it is beautifully busy: the women, the apartments; But more amazing is the devastating juxtaposition of images, almost all scenes have echoes of another. This is a story told in light, in color, in many almost parallels. Every time I see it, it fills me with joy. <br /> <br /> The action is also amazing. Romane Bohringer is great as a woman on the brink of a nervous breakdown: All about her changes with her mood. Vincent Cassel plays a very different role in his part in La Haine; But no less excellent: shifty and sympathetic at the same time. And Monica Bellucci - ah !, Monica Bellucci, yes, simply, she plays (is?) The world's most perfect woman. There is a small scene about three-quarters of the way through where she no longer smiles; But at that moment more than a couple of hours say Hollywood Hollywood junk. <br /> <br /> You can't do justice in this movie without mentioning the amazing sequential climax: sat, shocking, ironic and subtle in turn. But if for a moment captures the brilliance of this work, it is the scene at the start of this amazing breakdown, whose prospects have been plagued for us throughout history. But when the moment comes, it is handled so delicately, so succinctly, so well that by reflection it makes you grab. Only a director of dizzying confidence would dare to suppress this vital point. But trust is justified. The cinema doesn't get much better than this.
