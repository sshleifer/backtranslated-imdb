Lucio Fulci's "Do Not Torture and Duckling" paints an exceptionally flattering portrait of little town Sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys. This surprisingly well-oriented film (especially in comparison to later Fulci's gorefests) is distinguished by the overall atmosphere of perversion, nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence. The soon-to-dead children are depicted as randomly cruel and budding looking; Bruno's near-seduction of the naked patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) must really be seen to be believed. Highly recommended - especially in pairs with my second cult favorite "House with the Windows That Laugh" (1976).
