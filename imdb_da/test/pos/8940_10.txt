Betty and Boris look at each other on a junior dance when they are still children, but unfortunately, Hugh comes to her first and thirty years later when we tune back - Betty is married to Hugh and sets up with her fussy mother who also lives with them. <br /> <br /> Neither Boris nor Betty have forgotten each other, and when their paths cross again, they quickly declare their feelings. <br /> <br /> But Betty feels she can divorce Hugh, a councilor, that would hurt him too much. What Betty doesn't know is that Hugh doesn't hurt at all. He rolls in the sheets with his beautiful secretary Meredith. <br /> <br /> Boris, a undertaker, thinks he's got the answer. They will fake her death. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken plays Frank Featherbed, a monstrous competing undertaker in their medium-sized city - causing further problems for Boris and Betty. > All kinds of complications occur when Boris and Betty try to pull this big coup out. <br /> <br /> There are laughing scenes, a lovely dance and a curse word to be heard. In short, the movie was a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> 10 stars.
