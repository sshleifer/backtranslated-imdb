It reaches all the minds and feelings of those who drive them deep into the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, which parallels the three characters' inner geography as their stories unfold. The strong vacuum of lost love, fear of the unknown and then the transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. Three deceived souls struggle to find something absolute and positive in all the negative space. The drama is convincing. James Franco and his co-stars deliver fancy performances. Naive schoolgirl, suicide blonde, bitter car thief - all with unexpected turns. Together, they create an explosive portrait of broken love - one that inadvertently puts itself together among the hardest forms of adversity and illusion - the blindness of human feeling.
