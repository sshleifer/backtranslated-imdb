How good is this movie? Apparently, it is good enough that they plan to restore it in 2011. Jean-Pierre Melville, who gave us Le Doulos and The Good Thief, wrote and directed this film. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost silent. These are men with few words and prefer to let their actions speak for them. There are some amazing actors in this movie. Alain Delon (Leopard), Yves Montand (Jean de Florette, Let's make love) and Gian Maria Volonte (El Indio from a Fistful Dollars and a few dollars more). The film is not shining on them; They are together for the trip Melville has for them. Melville makes the movie; They do better. <br /> <br /> You see Melville's work in the Ocean movies, but they just get the idea. It can't make it work the way it did. A big loss in the 70s, but his work remains to our delight.
