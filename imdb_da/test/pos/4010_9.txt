My favorite show of all time! Yes, I thought it was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, fun - except when it would be serious, and just a good show overall. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after February 1996, and maybe it makes me think more about the show than I should. For me, it's more the epidemic (now it doesn't look spelled right!) To say "Goodbye" to someone you love and KNOW that you will never see them again. And I still think that, as far as I know, there are no plans to release this on DVD any time soon ... yes, life is mean! I've found out for sure (though you can find an odd episode here or there ... but I've never seen the original copies of things much). <br /> <br /> So much of my sad life: (Most children in the 7th grade do not need the powers that Alex gets them through life (unrealistic - safe), but then again, how many cities have a super malicious chemical plant that is willing to do something for "Progress at ANY cost"? Give this show was fun to see! the kids would have some reason to break into the plant (a video tape or such), as a child's version of "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six" (which later I was hooked on that game series for probably the same reason) almost! have you got the plant's "security" team trying desperately to find "the child from the accident" ... very mean dudes (at least when I first saw the show ... they seem more sympathetic to me now). pretty sad for Larisa Oleynik, not sure if she thinks of this role there mold her ..... but that's what I always remember her. <br /> <br /> Oh and BTW, the actor playing Aaron Peirce from "24" here as a school coach or something .... too cool! Maybe he can get the producers of that show to get Larisa next season at "24". I only bring it up 'cuz Jack Bauer is my second TV heroes and I just love to watch cross-over things, lol :). Both are set in California so I just want to continue with the dream ... I can see it now, "Let me alone with the suspect for a few minutes .... no, I don't need a car battery!"
