Barry Champlain is a radio-phone-in talk show hosted in Dallas whose non-blocked ideas of an abundance of social issues interfere with and offend many of his calls and listeners. Is Barry a media messiah in search of truth or a social misfit to attack his audience? <br /> <br /> This is an intense provocative sign of a man with almost no redeeming features who at the same time seems to be on some really deep philosophy. Although written and directed by Stone, this is truly Bogosian's piece all the way, and he gives an astonishingly hard-cut and pervasive performance from which there is no escape. Barry is at times one of the most abominable imaginable characters, jokingly gigantic misanthropy of all around him, especially those who care about him. But at the same time, he is also oddly empathetic, hypnotic, sage, even lovable. Bogosia's hawkish features burn into the frame, with its green eyes constantly jumping around as if permanently seeking an answer to some puzzles. The movie is essentially an angry, self-righteous riot against all the bigotry, injustice and banality in the world, culminating in a wild three-and-a-half-rotating single shot of Barry, delivering the ultimate I-hat all talk, but boy packs a blow. The support is great, especially Greene as ex-wife and Baldwin as manager. Robert Richardson's featured photography manages to keep the single radio studio interesting and there is a thrill of Stewart Copeland, with a moving coda with the inviting telephone piece, Telephone And Rubber Band from The Penguin Cafe Orchestra. If you're not familiar with Bogosian, check out his amazing talent in this flick - just like his contemporaries, Bill Hicks and Denis Leary, he is one who rarely looks in the ordinary media simply because his writing is out there. I find Stone's movie variable; I'm not very aware of his great successes, but when he is more ordered and objective, as with this (or Salvador and Nixon), he is much more sharp and arrested. A great prime scream of an image based on a Bogosian game inspired by the true story of Alan Berg, a Denver radio talk show host murdered by neo-Nazis in 1984.
