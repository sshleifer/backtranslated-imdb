A movie I have seen and may have enjoyed more than any other movie. I first saw it as a child and loved the drama and the great climate impact. When I got older, I enjoyed it so much or more than before, but now because of all the components that work together to create a true classic. The action is great (especially Keith as T. Roosevelt), the spectacular filmography, the script is full of gems, and the director pulls it all together wonderfully. It is loosely based on a concrete event, and it shows a hurry in Europe and a newly growing America to cut up on the "Sick Old Man" as it collapses in a way unlike any other " historical "movie I've seen. Humor, drama, action, love ... it has it all and deserves much more recognition (like "The Great Waldo Pepper").
