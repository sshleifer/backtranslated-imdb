Not since J. Michael Straczynski's Babylon 5, a television show has captured the wonderful art of using a story arc for a television show. It's the best on TV right now! The characters are sympathetic and one can easily be attached to them and take care of their well-being. The villians are the type you love to hate and leave, wondering what they are next to. And Brian Hensen's doll work is the most innovative out there. Kudos to Rockne S. O'Bannon for a job well done!
