I recently bought Lost Horizon on ebay, with live memories of the things I won't miss the number from childhood (I'm an old 29). I have also recently completed the novel on which it is based. I was so pleasantly surprised to find a real hidden treasure. A wonderful casting brings this warmth and depth to a beautifully simple and elegant story, subtly updated from the original movie (and now a completely separate entity to the much more intellectual and thought-provoking book by James Hilton). Sally Kellerman especially has a brilliant presence as the suicidal neurotic Sally Hughes, which gradually warms Shangri-La's charm. Only Liv Ullmann flounders in his wooden portrait of the school teacher (a role far more suited to a Julie Andrews type. The fact that Finch, Ullmann and Hussey are all called is not important, as it is almost impossible to tell The songs DO vary in quality, the music is far better than the lyrics, but it is still a vibrant and exciting movie that really deserves a proper DVD release and much more recognition.
