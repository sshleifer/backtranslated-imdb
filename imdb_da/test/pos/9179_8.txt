I liked this comedy so much. Will Smith not do anything slow. It's always right on target with the best scripts and comedies that keep you laughing and involved in the plot. You see a good comedian who plays all his parts well. He is fully convinced that he is the one he plays. I loved him and Tommy Lee Jones in the men in black. This comedy beats up with that movie. The mood is moving fast, and Will Smith is as confident as he was in black men. Fast-paced and well-educated in the art of making others score every time, but makes it tasteful and finesse. Will Smith seems to have beaten his comedy routine well. He was so funny. I loved the part where he had an allergic reaction to something he ate and his face swelled and he looked more like Cassius Clay after a fight, then he did himself. So watch him sip on the Benadryl bottle trying to bring his head back down to the right size. I laughed so hard. He knows how to make us laugh.
