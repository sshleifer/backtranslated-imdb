Supposed to be a kind of social commentary on the way our lives spread out of control in the 1970s, this movie plays more like something, Mr. Schlesinger threw along after having had a bad day on the highway. A mish mash of pieces on nuts adjacent to the Florida highway, and along the highways of life, is thrown mostly wasted and probably ended up on the rocky floor. The problem is that what didn't come to an end on the floor would probably have! Now available on DVD, it is a little fun to see a comedy that would have cost $ 100 million if it was made in 2004. It rolls together and is not too difficult to sit through, and strangely in 2004 we are all still pretty much <br /> <br /> jumps in our cars and goes faster and faster, heading nowhere.
