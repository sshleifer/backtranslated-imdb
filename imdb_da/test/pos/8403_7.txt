When I saw Gone with the wind, I thought there could be no better actors than Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable to play Scarlett and Rhett, but then I saw the movie Scarlet. I fell in love with this dramatic story. I love Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler, he's great. This is a movie I could see a thousand times and it still wouldn't drill me.
