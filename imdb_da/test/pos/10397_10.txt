I first saw the movie a few years ago and was completely and completely impressed, but its sensuality. It's one of the most touching movies I've ever seen, though it may seem a bit pretentious and artificial - too beautiful if you want. Still, one thing is certain - the camera man has done a good job - every picture deserves to be cut off by the film and shown as a separate art subject that can be compared to Chirico's or Bernard Buffet's paintings. <br /> <br /> The music forms the perfect backdrop for history, especially the U2's played between the first and second novels on the beach scene. As for the casting, I cannot be objective as I like Sophie Marceau and Jean Renaue very much and cannot add more to others' promising comments. But the very fact that many people (critics and those sophisticated in the cinema) criticized the film made me see it with a more critical eye for the second time. There is no doubt that the setting is great and the molding is beautiful. But that's not enough to make a comprehensive and coherent film. The second novel (when Sophie Marceau tells her story to Malcovic somehow is superficial and doesn't tell much about the motivation of the people involved) was just about shooting a beautiful and sensual love scene with the naked Marceau or what? Apparently, it doesn't add anything to the idea of ​​the movie, and even Malcovic's husky voice is unable to link it to the main plot. Other stories are more justified and are really beautifully shot that celebrate many of the logical mistakes in them. The scene, as Jean Reneau overlooks the city through its large window in its apartment at the top of the high-rise building, is incredible. The sensation of humid air and blowing, which is scattered by the first Ferrera scene, can literally feel through the screen. No doubt, Antonioni is a great master of shades and semi-shades. My favorite novel is the last - the most romantic, deep and meaningful - I assume it is the most Antonioni-like in the whole movie - almost a parable. The positive positive impression of the film is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small ghotic Italian town with its winding narrow streets and crooked sidewalks, fountains with l'eau drinkable and monumental cathedrals ... It was laconic but really touching. I hope My impressions and comments on the movie, but chaotic, they would motivate someone to spend an evening watching it (it works better with the home theater, having some care on your side than in the cinema). Enjoy. <br /> <br /> I ask you for the imperfect English and any misspellings
