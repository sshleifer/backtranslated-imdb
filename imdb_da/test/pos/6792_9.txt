This is a nice movie. Elizabeth Taylor does a wonderful job, like Mickey Rooney. The movie just makes you happy. It is inspiring, and although some parts are a little too sentimental, it is easily forgiven. I could see the movie again and again. The race at the end is exciting every time I see it. Highly recommend this movie.
