Sometimes when looking for a movie, nothing will do except a good thriller. Dead Line certainly fits the bill. <br /> <br /> A small warning though: If you want to watch this movie, you better know that you don't have too much detail about the plot. <br /> <br /> The plot thickens as the film passes. A really remarkably well-constructed tension bracket. <br /> <br /> It's deep and terrible. It goes all the way to the darkest places in the human mind. <br /> <br /> The reason also has some very surprising shifts. <br /> <br /> Wait for the night, turn off the light and watch this movie.
