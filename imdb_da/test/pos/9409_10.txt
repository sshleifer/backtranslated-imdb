I had heard of the case, but had not really noticed the whole of Fuhrman's entire hoopla, who wrote the book, Shack was arrested, etc. But this film did an excellent job of explaining Martha, the Brick Brothers, the murder, Mark Fuhrman's involvement and the results of his investigation. I especially liked flashback scenes with Martha talking about her last summer. The actor who played her literally glowing with life and made it even more exciting that the real Martha was probably like that. It made Martha seem like a real person rather than a victim. I would definitely recommend seeing this.
