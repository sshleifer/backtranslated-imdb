Columbo is a guest teacher for a criminology class. Students invite him to their after-school club. Transiting the nearby parking garage, they discover their regular teacher next to his car, dead from a shotgun. (No, Columbo wasn't after the man's job.) As a class project, the Columbo involves the students in their sleuthing. <br /> <br /> Two students, provisionally identified by the viewer as sinners, were in the lecture hall for the whole class. In addition, the surveillance camera tapes in the parking garage show that no one other than the professor came in or left, after he was last seen, unexpected departure from the lecture hall. <br/> <br /> Recurring the normal routine, Columbo is the one who is harassed by the evil (?) duo, eager for progress reports and a penny for their theories. Forensic evidence is almost non-existent. Solving the case hinges on some final and interesting luck. <br /> <br /> At first glance, Columbo seemed to have turned off the entire culprit's misdirection; However, upon repeated viewing, the small details showed that this was not the case. <br /> <br /> This reviewer has not yet tired of "Columbo going to College".
