I thought Besson's film managed to do without words, how few movies have been able to do with them; Capture true human emotions. The main character's struggles, triumphs, backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and is, of course, made without glitz and glamor for most Hollywood productions, but it is minimalism that allows this movie to exceed the stereotypical Sci-Fi label and become a true drama. But calling this movie solely a drama would take away from the amazing post-apocalyptic plot. True, this type of movie has been done before, but I think this captures the joy and sorrows of that kind of world possibly better than anyone else does.
