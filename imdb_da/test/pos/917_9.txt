There is a spartan, unentimental edge to this film that allows us to participate in the action without any stylistic burden telling us how to feel; in 'Blue' everything was obviously sad (safe, strong as hell, but still); in 'white' it was nice whimsy. But there are no such emotional traces or signs for that matter in this. It is as if he finally lets the power of the story work his own magic without razzle glare. I think that's what makes it the most original mystery of the three, but finally the most transcendent and redemptive. Never have relentless, effortless honesty been quite so beautiful.
