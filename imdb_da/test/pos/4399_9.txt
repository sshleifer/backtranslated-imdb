This was the best movie I saw in the year 2000. The Cohen brothers have never hit me before, and neither did they this time either. It's one of those rare movies these days - it's witty, intelligent, and very entertaining. I left the cinema with a warmth in my heart. Of course, there are many Cohen things in there - odd characters and peculiar gadgets, well-developed plot and magical camera work. But no Cohen movie looks like any other Cohen movie if you overlook the overall quality of them of course. The big surprise for me was that Clooney is so good. But the true master performance in this movie comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But the rest of the molding is also fantastic. A film that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that develops the history of rednecks and old country music - dripping with white and intelligence. It is a very unlikely combination. But that is exactly what this picture is.
