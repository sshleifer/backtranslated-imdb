'The Merchant of Venice' is one of Shakespeare's better-known plays and is still performed regularly in the theater. However, this movie seems to be the first English-language version made for the cinema rather than television. There were a number of versions made in the UK or America in the early days of the cinema, but it was all quiet. <br /> <br /> The reason for this neglect of the game may be associated with sensitivities of the play's alleged anti-Semitism, a subject that has been even more sensitive since the rise of the Nazis in 1933. (This may explain why all previous versions were made In the quiet era, in 1908 or 1922, it would have been easier to portray Shylock as a slight villain than it would be today). But in my opinion, the film is not anti-Semitic at all. It should be remembered that in Shakespeare's lifetime there was no definite Jewish community in England; The Jews had been expelled by Edward I in the late 13th century and were not allowed to return to Cromwell's time, some forty years after Shakespeare's death. As far as we know, Shakespeare never traveled abroad, so it seems quite possible that he himself never knew any Jews personally or experienced the effects of anti-Semitism at first. The play is not just about the Jewish question, but is, among other things, an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudices. It can actually be a coded study of the mutual antipathy between Catholics and Protestants in Tudor England (something that Shakespeare would certainly have had first-hand experience) and an appeal for greater tolerance between them. <br /> <br /> As now, traditional anti-Semitic stereotypes have always depicted Jews as malevolent, but Shylock's primary sin is not wrong; If it were, he would certainly have accepted Bassanio's offer to pay him six thousand ducats, twice as much as Antonio borrowed. Rather, Shylock's obsessive sin is anger, and the root of his anger is the way he and his companions are treated by the Christians in Venice. Not only are Jews generally regarded as first-class citizens, but Jewish money-transferers like Shylock are special targets of abuse, even though the services they provide are necessary for the Venetian economy. The play shows the corrupting effects of prejudices. Not only do views of this kind break the Christians who hold them, they can also destroy the Jews who suffer from abuse. Shylock's vengeance is totally disproportionate to the injustices he has suffered. Spitting on him and calling him a dog, Antonio behaves like a boorish bigot, but boorishness and bigotry are not generally considered crimes that deserve the death penalty. In addition, Shylock seeks to avenge himself on Antonio not only for the undoubted injustices that Antonio has made against him, but also for all the wrongful, real and imaginary ones he has suffered in the hands of the Christian community, such as his daughter's marriage to Lorenzo . <br /> <br /> It is credit to the film director, Michael Radford and the star Al Pacino, that they understand all these issues. Pacino's Shylock originally has some kind of angry dignity about him, which gradually gives way to revenge rage and finally after his humiliation in attempting Portia's argument for pathos. We clearly see that he has been the instrument of his own destruction, but we can still sympathize with him. In my view, none of Pacino's performances, which I have ever seen, have meant those he gave in the first two "Godfather" films (not the "scent of the scent" for which he won an Oscar and certainly not " Godfather III '), but' The Merchant of Venice is the closest to these benchmarks. The other play that stood out was Lynn Collin's glowing Portia, who spoke her lines with great clarity and simplicity and exclaimed the intelligence and ingenuity that makes her character more than just a romantic heroine. I was less impressed with Jeremy Irons Antonio, who seemed passive. Antonio is a complex character; part loyal friend, part melancholy contemplative, part religious bigot and some enterprising capitalist. Although Irons captured the first two of these aspects, it was difficult to imagine that his Antonio either spat on any other belief or threatened his all at risky trading activities. <br /> <br /> Radford's interpretation of the game was attacked by the film critic of the Daily Telegraph, who, while admiring Pacino's performance, did not like the timing and arguing that Shakespeare should be placed in a modern setting if is of relevance to a modern audience with reference to a new production of the scene that puts the action in Weimar Germany. I would disagree with this approach. The theater and cinema are completely different media, and there have been some striking modernist approaches to Shakespeare in the cinema (Trevor Nunn's 'Twelfth Night' comes to mind), a traditional approach is often the best. (For example, I preferred Zeffirelli's 'Romeo and Juliet' to Baz Luhrmann's). The idea that we can only appreciate Shakespeare in a modern cover is pure intellectual laziness; We are not prepared to make an effort to see our greatest author in the framework of the Elizabethan society that produced him, but rather he prefers dressed up as a 19th century replacement dog. <br /> <br /> Radford's traditional approach not only enables us to appreciate that bigotry and vindictiveness are age-old, universal issues, but also make for a visually striking movie. In the play, the scenes set in Venice are characterized by turbulent action; those located in Portia's country house at Belmont are happier and more peaceful. In the film, the Venetian exterior scenes were shot in place against a backdrop of the foggy, winter-white sky, similar to the appearance achieved in 'Don't See Now'. The light interior, with faces brightly lit against a dark background, is reminiscent of the chiaroscuro effects of a Caravaggio painting; I suppose it was quite conscious as Caravaggio was a modern of Shakespeare. Unlike dark or foggy Venice, the Belmont scenes (shot in an enchanting Palladian villa on an island in a lake) were marked by sunshine or peaceful moonlight. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Shakespeare adjustments of recent years; an intelligent and visually attractive look on a complex game. 8.10. <br/> <br /> A few mistakes. We see a black swan on the water in front of Portia's house. These birds are native to Australia and were not introduced to Europe until well after 1596, the date the movie is set. Portrait of Portia in the leaden cap is also painted in the style of the Florentine Botticelli, which was active around a century before that date. Lynn Collins may resemble a Botticelli beauty, but it seems unlikely that a Venetian 16th-century lady would have painted herself in the late 15th century Florence.
