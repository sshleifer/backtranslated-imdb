Take someone you love or love and watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It touches you in all the right places. <br /> <br /> All the other reviewers here have said it all. <br /> <br /> They only like the things that leave you depressed for days. <br /> <br /> This movie is Ga-<br /> <br /> I am so pleased that the director is not educated in the United States. <br /> <br /> This confirms my premise that there is too much mediocrity and consistency in movies these days. <br /> <br /> It's because of USC lockstep mentality and inbreeding. Hooray for Jeff Hare and Richard Marcus, cast and crew. Well done!
