Fran√ßois Villon was a reality poet and villain who lived in Paris in the 15th century. However, most of what is depicted in this historical film is actually fiction - from a game created in the early 20th century. In the film he met and became friends with Louis XI, in fact he died in the 30s and was never involved in all the intrigues that he was in this movie. In fact, he wrote some lovely verse and was often on the wrong side of the law - not the combination of a patriot and Robin Hood-like character as he is in the movie. Assuming you know that the film is almost 100% fiction, then it is well worth seeing - just don't assume it's a good story lesson. <br /> <br /> In the BELOVED ROGUE, Villon is played with wild surrender by John Barrymore. I was also very excited to see that his three friends were all played by very familiar faces. Angelo Rossitto, who was the picked dwarf, played in tons of movies over the years and had a very long career. Slim Summerville was a character actor known for adding a touch of comedy to movies. Mack Swain is best known as the silent film film of many of Chaplin's short films and played his partner in THE GOLD RUSH. All four of these men did a good job and have no complaints - even with Barrymore's rather over-the-top treatment reminiscent of a Douglas Fairbank's performance. However, the show was a serious problem with Conrad Veidt as King Louis XI. Calling this "usubtile" would be a gross understatement. He played the role of a high schooler who believed he was to be the stereotypical Richard III sculpture and act as a demoniacal caricature. While Veidt was wonderful in many, many films (both silent and sound), but here he is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, it is full of lusty adventure and action - like a winding movie minus sailing ships. The sets worked well for all this, as they had been used the previous year for HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. Both films were set around the same time period. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's one of the last big quiet movies. There is a lot to like and the movie is a nice combination of romance, comedy and action. It's worth seeing, even though it loses a few points for Veidt's overactive as well as the way the movie plays fast and lost with history. By the way, this movie was also made twice as if I were there KING (1920 and 1938) and apparently these two films are closest to the original game. In total, however, there have been six films about Villon and tell more or less variations in the same story!
