In December 1945, a train leaves Stockholm's main station to Berlin. There is not much left when it comes. Not by train and not by some passengers. <br /> <br /> This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used to trade in the 40s and also photographed (in weight / weight) as they used to during that period. The actors have had fun doing it. They are not many signs that they were not in their 40s, but the story is well told and everyone has timing. <br /> <br /> A deadly black and deadly fun movie. See if you didn't think the Swedes were capable of humor.
