STMD! is one of the most fun and fun low budget movies I've seen for some time. Director Jeff Smith (who also served as co-author, filmographer and editor) certainly shows his love for underestimated 80's horror movies with this movie! Anyone who loves cheesiness, preposterous situations, wacky and stereotypical characters from the 80's horror movie will surely love this very devoted greeting to the past. <br /> <br /> STMD! surely live up to the qualities described in the poster and then some. It has all the "violent violence" and "gratuitous nudity" that resembles the entertaining 80's horror movies we all love. I had a blast to watch STMD! From the 80s outfits that the stereotypical characters carry to the blood splatter to the itchy tone, I just couldn't get enough!
