When the slow start is underway, the movie starts and becomes really fun in many unexpected ways. The ensemble cast is really good, with Heather Graham perhaps being the weakest of them. Casey Affleck as his brother is really good and extremely sympathetic if you catch my business. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend movies if you just want good hours. Teenagers should really enjoy this movie - it says a lot about relationships.
