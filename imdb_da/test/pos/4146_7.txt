Where do I start. I say how big the filmography is. I praise certain scenes that show the director's creativity. Tell me how realistic the scenes on Ellis Island are. Should I mention it for a change, we don't have the cliché scene to see the Statue of Liberty. (Now, immigrants looking at the statue from the shipping line are a cliché) <br /> <br /> Now it's not comfortable, two great things, one is a modern song score and not even a good one to start. <Br /> <br /> The second and almost lethal is the film boring, it moves so slowly that seeing paint dry would be an improvement. The 118 minute playing time is too long and yet the movie still works unfinished. We see no scenes of this family in the United States. Our hero mentions that he will find his twin brother, I would have had scenes of his unsuccessful perhaps lucky search instead of other drawn-out scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie is a near miss. <br /> <br /> Ratings *** (out of 4) 81 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
