This is a nicely finished story with beautiful music, lots of dancing, lots of great sister / little sister interaction (almost all positive), and many desires given. There are fun moments that older children and adults will enjoy as when King Randolph exclaims: "They're just shoes!" And sore moments like when Princess Genevieve comforts her youngest sister, Lacey, after a blunder. <br /> <br /> The animation may not be as good as Disney, but it's still very good. The facial expressions are nuanced, especially for Genevieve, King Randolph, Duchess Rowena, and her servant, Derek Skomager and Little Princess Lacey. My only stranglehold on the animation is in the dance sequences, where the dancing princesses become absolute carbon copies of each other without the slightest deviation - even the three youngest examples, the dance progresses perfectly. I would have liked to see a little more individualism in the dance, given that these girls are not professional ballerines or co-dancers. <br /> <br /> The answer to the story is handled wisely to get rid of a crook without actually hurting her. There is some violence to guards in history, and the monkey of evil is important to other animals in history. <br /> <br /> My 4-year-old daughter loves this movie and has seen it repeatedly and I have found it quite acceptable for her to watch.
