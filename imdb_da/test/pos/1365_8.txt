Golden Boy is the ecchi humor (bordering on hentai) in the cover of "educational moments." The protagonist, Kintaro, walks around to get into the horrific situations involving women. It's just that he is shy on the surface, but analyzes everything before he can learn from it. The most striking feature of the series is the circumstances surrounding his "education", which is rather embarrassing, yet fun at the same time.
