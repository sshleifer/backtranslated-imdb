This must be one of the most terribly named movies all the time. The kind of title that destroys a movie, because it also does not cause the plot or the characters. A title like this makes a movie flip, even the French title is not much better. Too bad - Truffaut & Deneuve must have been enough to sell it. <br /> <br /> This is a long movie but well worth it. Clearly influenced by Hitchcock, we have an intercontinental story of a personal ad god, her rich man, a theft, a change of identity, and compulsive love. The reason here is actually very good and takes us on an unexpected trip. What works both for and against the film is the focus on the relationship. It is an interesting study of how these plot developments are played out in "real relationships" with these two people. Unfortunately, it is what kills the movie down and eventually makes it unsatisfactory. We like movies to have a true sense of finality and it is missing here. <br /> <br /> It was the case in many of her films that Deneuve became a canvas for directors to play their fantasies out and this time it doesn't seem so good. Shaken here is the fact that the director would definitely have Deneuve take her out sometimes. Deneuve is an actress who always seems very conscious and thought-provoking, so these attempts to make her seem spontaneous fall flat. <br /> <br /> Basically, the script had to be made better before recording began, to make this movie tighter and shorter and snap. But Truffaut didn't snap? So - it wanders a little, but remains interesting.
