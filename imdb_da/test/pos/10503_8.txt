Let me first watch the movie. This movie throws me out and I don't even believe in aliens! However, the film has its faults. <br /> <br /> There are three actions for this movie. Act One is perfect. It sets the film up and really builds the crawl factor. I have to say the score is amazing! Everything is created and it is created perfectly. Act Two begins when Jillian, playing Sherry Burton, goes to shrink. They hypnotize her, and she remembers the abduction. Act Two destroys the movie when foreigners come up. "Screaming Mad George" did the effects for foreigners. I have to say they did a good job except with their depiction of the "gray" aliens. No offense, but Grays looked like inflatable door prizes. <br /> <br /> On a page note, I liked how they treated hypnosis in actions 1 and 2. If you have emphasized, you will notice that husband and wife had two different memories. In the man's version of events, the blue light zaps them and his wife says, "Someone is here" or something similar. It makes sense. The man is worried about his wife. "Someone" can hurt her. That's his problem. But in her version of events she says, "Help me!" She doesn't say "someone is here." This also makes sense. Foreigners are after her. Wanting her husband to help and save her is her problem. Now back to the movie. <br /> <br /> Act Three makes the movie a gore party. It begins with a "strange" ultrasound procedure. It's a typical gore party, but it has a surprise ending. I don't want to ruin it, because it's actually an interesting development. <br /> <br /> DVDs and comments are getting serious, but if you think Wilford Brimley says "Horsesh **" is fun, you might want to check it in the cast interview section. Now on my praise by Jillian McWhirter. <br /> <br /> I could only hope Jillian would read this. I had never seen her before, but wow what a performance! Let me tell the rest of you this. First of all, this must be a serious movie. The details I now describe may sound campy and fun, like "Humanoids From The Deep" (1980), but it is not. Understood? Okay. <br /> <br /> Jillian is warm, naturally beautiful. She's naked too much of the movie, a good thing. Unfortunately, she is usually attacked, terrorized and raped, a very bad thing. But she must act in a lot of this movie naked. She gets points to overcome it. She has to act happy, sad, horny, scared and physically hurt everything in a moment. The turn of emotions is amazing! She has to cheer for joy when she learns that she is pregnant. She has to scream in horror when foreigners get out of her gut. She must act very sour when her husband suggests that the child is not his. She must act as if she is in denial and say that there is nothing wrong with her baby when her husband says otherwise. A denial I have to note is really forced on her by foreigners who control her. I speak Oscar-caliber achievement here! <br /> <br /> There is rape scene. It's disturbing, but since it's just a little bit of rubber stranger, it's not that bad. In this scene, the alien is not a "gray" stranger, so I will describe it. The alien has tentacles, and it is a bit like a table. Jillian is on the table-like part, held by the tentacles. At her head is the stranger's head. The alien's head is long and it flips down so the head is now over Jillian's legs. Then the alien's hi-nanu-nanu comes out of his forehead. It's forehead! Sounds pretty campy, right? Jillian plays it right and she pulls it out! She has to act like a stranger with her hey-nanu-nanu coming from the forehead to rape her, and she pulls it off! It's a very intense scene, but it doesn't. You see, this scene is made in a flashback. What makes the scene is Jillian's performance reminiscent of these events. She is just in a hospital under hypnosis reminiscent of the aliens abduction, but her action here is more intense than the actual rape scene! How many players can draw a performance in a scene describing a rape that is more intense than the rape scene? Not many! But Jillian does. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on again. Jillian, if you ever read this, I want you to know that I, (name detained) alias of MegamanX-1, think you are the best actress ever. You're the best actress ever! I could only hope you read this and always take it with you. <br /> <br /> As for everyone else, "Descendants" (1999) is an Okay to Good movie. I would recommend it.
