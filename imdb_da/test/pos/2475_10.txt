Dead Camp Opera: Right Here, Right Now! <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, I read that a very special movie had been directed to the polarization of our society. One particular Peter Watkins was the author. His image was acted by some non-professional actors, citizens like you and me ?? and other. The violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic. Was it a movie, a documentary? Both actually. <br /> <br /> Over the years, I realized how difficult it was to find it. Maybe I would randomly? Yet it is yet another ancient story. I saw it a short time ago. Absolutely impressive. My very favorite freedom: Punishment Park is its name. I love this "docu-fiction", this "truecastmovie", this "reality show fiction", what ever. After all the shock films I saw, I get the best with this strong and intense movie experience. I found a masterpiece. There is enough on the web to know many things about the movie. It is even buying on DVD, with several things. The only words I want to add are about my own experience with this movie. I can only rely on such a sincere and committed artificial freak for people and people, those who lead, act, or see. A movie theater that is simply a real human experience in an art adventure ?? or the opposite. <br /> <br /> So I'm not talking about all the "mucs" we can watch on TV, especially "real'shity show", which the concepts of people play themselves are interesting, but used in a stupid and perverse way. In Punishment Park, we can see some real people living as they are. We only put them in a very specific context with a few lines to follow, and we let them be what they want to be. It's a kind of therapy, a way to 'individuation' for them in the movie and also for the active spectators in front of screens. Then the director's touch edits a short and sweet apocalypse movie, a desperate scream, a 'Death Camp Opera', where some people are fleeing for virulent trials. The Penalty Park is for those who want to grow. Watch this movie and have the opportunity to choose your own morality. Get up and harmonize with it! If you can feel it! If you can see it !! In my case, Punishment Park is stuck in me forever with all my love, consciousness and will.
