This Christmas gift arrived with TCM. We'd never seen the movie, even though we've seen most of Barbara Stanwyk's movies. This comedy made us laugh so much that we sometimes had to withhold ourselves to hear the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to be seen by people suffering from stressful situations, especially around Christmas. It would certainly lift one's spirit by just letting go. The film would make a perfect gift in the form of a DVD or a VHS tape. <br /> <br /> "Christmas in Connecticut" was ruled by great panache by Peter Godfrey, based on a story from Aileen Hamilton. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is the happy pairing of two of the most popular stars in the era: Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan. Barbara Stanwyck always played strong willed women, of course it was a change in the pace of her. In this movie, as well as "Lady Eve", Stanwyck shows a talent for comedy. She and Mr. Morgan, who played in many musical comedies, makes a winning combination. <br /> <br /> There are no faint performances in the movie. Sydney Greenstreet, an actor notorious for playing 'heavies', is a joy to see as the rich and fat Alexander Yardley, the man who owned a media empire, and who knew well when he saw it. Reginald Gardiner, a deeply committed English actor, adds brilliance to the star play behind the two main characters. <br /> <br /> S. Z. Sakall is another source of continuous joy; he plays the Hungarian chef Felix, who has difficulty with his own version of the English language. Also, Una O'Connor makes a perfect Norah, the housekeeper in Sloan's perfect Connecticut farm. <br /> <br /> In reading other comments in this forum, it is sad to learn that the glorious black and white filmography is not appreciated by some people. Color was still not widely used in the 40s, and most of the classic films have to be seen in their original format because what would be achieved in 'coloring' them? <br /> <br /> This movie should be a requirement for anyone who wants to spend nearly two hours of uninterrupted Christmas fun because total joy is guaranteed. See it with an open mind and heart, and maybe you would like to see "Christmas in Connecticut" every year.
