This movie is like a dirge. Until it comes to music tracks that are like MIND F * CK, but milder as a mind caress. MIND FOREPLAY. The depressing mood given from the character's speed and desperation can be beautiful Kill-Yourself-Awesome until you get to the music tracks. It's a good movie. Optimistic. Strange. Bipolar. That is it! THIS MOVIE IS PEOPLE. anyway see it. IT IS A MUSIC !!! With depth !!!! If you like the existential dross like The Stranger, or Waiting for Godot, then you probably get a real kick out of it. I had to download the DVD via Amazon.com for like $ 12. OH & the songs rocker. well they rock, but they are not rock, like calypso, jazz, Broadway, but by Grace Chung, and i can't find the soundtrack NUHVER <but i want the songs good and the dancers are so funny.
