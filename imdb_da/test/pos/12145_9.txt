Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I watch a Jean-Pierre Melville movie that I had to give it a watch as soon as possible. Since I discovered Melville and apparently work backwards through his filmography, it would be easy for me to fail this as one of his films, but it was made in 1960 by Claude Sautet before Melville would come and claim his French neo-noir. <br /> <br /> Classe Tous Risques has two of the best leading men of the time, Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Ventura plays Abel, a gangster banished in Italy with his wife and two children who want to get back to Paris because the police are closing in on him. After a roaring and fast opening with a great surprise, Abel eventually becomes associated with Eric Stark (Belmondo) who wants to enter the criminal underworld. Strong becomes Abel's driver and possibly. Only friend in an underworld who returns to Abel for everything he has done and gone through. The film shows the duality of the two men, the older Abel at the end of his time after the tragedy hits him, and the younger Eric starts the same way Abel did, in love with a beautiful woman who sticks with her husband despite for the world they are a part of. It never ends well for them or their loved ones. Its one thing to see an individual criminal coming to his death, it's different when he has loved ones, he risks taking down with him. <br /> <br /> Like Melville's films, the seemingly simple story becomes more subtly complicated as it goes together. As usual, as I feel with Melville's movies, it left my head spinning (in a good way) and dying to see it again to get what I missed the first time. Classe Tous Risques is a specific goalkeeper.
