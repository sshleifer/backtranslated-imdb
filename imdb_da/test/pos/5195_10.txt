One of the best war movies I've ever seen, if not the best. It is very difficult to talk about such films, as it is very difficult to point to any movie errors. The "problem" is, as it looks real, and so you pull yourself into the ruins of Stalingrad and make you suffer for both sides. This is why this film, in contrast to most Hollywood movies, does not harden war or hero of the protagonists. Instead, the film only makes their heroes to be human and thus is anti-war as much as the reason can offer. Extremely convincing war scenes and so impressive plays see most scenes as isolated theater plays. The German army is also played by Germans who are so convincing. The film is produced and realized by the Germans, where you can see their love of detail to perfection. This is why "Stalingrad" is one of the movies I can see millions of times and never feel boring. I watched movies with my father who fought in World War II, and the first thing he said was, "This is just as true, so the war against the Germans looks like". This is the place you can see, how it seemed to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of warfare in human history and turning point in World War II: Stalingrad.
