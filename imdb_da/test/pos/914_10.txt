Irene Jacob is fascinating in this last installment of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy, and the story is infinitely satisfying as it manages to tie all three films together. I'm simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to make one of those stories, let alone all three. Everything seems to fit together so precisely that all film-forming elements are so blessed and the end result is so much larger than the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic in nature and belongs to a list of amazing cinematic performances. Simply brilliant!
