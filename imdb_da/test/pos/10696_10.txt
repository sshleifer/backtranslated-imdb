After watching this movie, I have no choice but to write a review in the hope that there are others like me out there who were blown away by the rocket's burnt ninja action and white hot sexual titulation, Ninja III's: Dominationen. /> <br /> We all know that Sho Kosugi rocks. It's a given, but what about Jordan Bennett's ultra-macho interpretation of his character police officer "Billy Secord"? Bravo Mr. Bennett, bravo. You prove early while trying to seduce Buxom Christie (the game of perfection by a lady Lucinda Dickey of Breakin 'fame) that you are not afraid to take chances on your craft. I especially enjoyed how you don't have to step in and try to help her, since 4 thugs are trying to rape her outside the gym. Oh you could have helped you safe, but by standing there watching you, let her know who was the boss. Secord will wear the pants in this relationship. I also enjoyed how Mr. Bennett was not afraid to repeatedly take off his shirt or wear the wife-beater thought despite his gorilla as shoulders and back. Back and shoulder hairs are hot and Secord knows it. And what about Lucinda Dickey? All I can say is "KABOOM" - I see a sex bomb ready to explode. She has all the right moves as both a tempting and a martial art. The chemistry behind Dickey and Bennett is what makes this movie tick. You would think she would hate him because he is a kind of cheesy jerk, but not my friends. Animal magnetism is too strong to resist, and they are associated with crazy glue. Sho Kasugi is not as prominent as you might think, but still a protagonist, which is fine for me because all I wanted was more Bennett and Dickey. He seems to wear a lot of eye makeup, which was nice to see. The special effects? Wow. That's all I can say. I won't give away the end, but let's just say it won't disappoint. I love Ninja III: The Dominance and can only hope there is a Ninja 4. I give it a 5 out of 5 throw stars. disappoint.
