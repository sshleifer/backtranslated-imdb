It is well known that Irene Dunne could sing a little more than a little. And I think her talent as a comedian can only be understood when one has fought through a sonata of Haydn or a song by Debussy and made it a success. Her instrument is her voice, and her handling of it is pure musicality. She could tackle any part. The only thing she couldn't do was not to succeed. This movie is a perfect example. In it she channels Ruth Gordon (because the game is the case), is feminine, charming, intentional and self-destructive, generous, protective and fighting, but never pretentious. She manages to remain as credible as Alexander Knox is in another difficult role he assumes with aplomb. The viewer will have to believe what he sees and cares for. It is refreshing to watch a movie that is both entertaining and intellectually challenging as you push all the right patriotic buttons. I sincerely hope that the entire Dunne oeuvre makes it a DVD one day because it's really hard to keep a secret like that among just a few initiatives.
