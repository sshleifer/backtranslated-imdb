After many years I saw this beautiful love story again and wondered how would I half a century react to a movie that made so many girls cry and sigh at the time when I was just a male youth trying to understand The women's behavior in a small town in Brazil. This time, however, it was something else that caught my attention in the film, namely the insistent doctor Dr. Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) reminds journalist Mark Elliott (William Holden) of his particular ethical condition as a Eurasian. In fact, she places constant emphasis on this point in their relationship and repeats that she is willing to take on her love for him and perform it in an "occidental way", provided she does not betray her Chinese side. It seems to the onlooker that Suyin eagerly makes an effort to create a very subtle settlement between the two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture, for they will immediately engage in open conflict in her thoughts with a minimum failure in her attempt to Check them. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Suyin's views always leave poor Elliott ?? a definite, brave and extremely practical man ?? anxious and confused without knowing how much importance is to give to her words. For him whose love for her is pure and simple, the situation is quite clear: if we love each other, let's make a couple and start a life together immediately. "Not so fast" is what she seems verbally and does not verbally answer him all the time. <br /> <br /> In fact, Suyin's Chinese part would never allow her such a level of pragmatism. And as she continues and further amplifies this very targeted balance between these two worlds within herself, she often also signals to him that a very peculiar feature of Chinese culture is deeply rooted in her thoughts, namely the constant "raids" on real world of invisible beings from a spiritual or non-physical world. For Suyin always warns Elliott about how dangerous life is, not because of any objective and concrete threat (as it would be a continuation of English colonialism or the eminence of a Japanese invasion), but because of the threat of plenty of cruel and harmful gods and other mysterious and mythical beings over the poor, fearful and vulnerable people. In fact, a whole lot of Chinese deities seem to be permanently on guard to make people's lives completely miserable. Because of this, mothers must dress their precious male babies in girls' clothing so that they are not removed by jealous gods; everyone should always be ready to make light sounds to send the clouds away to avoid covering the moon's vision; farmers are advised to shout loudly "The rice is bad! The rice is bad!" To protect their crops from being stolen by the deities and in a funeral, it is recommended that the dead family be isolated from the other people by curtains so that the gods do not exploit their grief and fragility. In other words, Suyin introduces us to a culture where the supernatural has a real existence as if a rather disturbing pantheon of malign and sadistic gods is always interfering with the most banal actions of everyone's daily life life. <br /> <br /> As history takes place in Hong Kong in 1949, it should be clear that at that time, China was almost a semi-feudal community, while the country from which Elliott had come from was not yet dominated by The hard capitalism, which was launched by the United States after the first oil shock in 1973, took responsibility for the whole world. At least in one aspect, both sides of Suyin's Eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be today. Many stories happened since these old days. With regard to China, the most important fact is that after several phases of a communist regime over the last two decades, the country finally reached the condition of a very aggressive economy, much more properly described as state capitalism. And what happened to the old spirituality that so much fascinated Suyin in Hong Kong in 1949 and that she used to impress so much on a passionate Elliott under the tree on the hill behind the hospital? It's gone, gone! In short, if that story happened today, Elliott would not find it necessary to go to China to propose Suyin in the presence of the third uncle and the whole family. In fact, both men will now be incomparably closer to each other, in their huge pragmatism, to speak business as normal!
