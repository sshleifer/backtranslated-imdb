The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classical writers such as Charles Dickens and several contemporary authors such as Edward Gory. As a musical, of course, it becomes more like the musical Les Miserables. Both deal with the ugly effects of poverty in the industrial revolution and the breakdown of organized society. But this musical is different from Les Mis in a very important aspect: Stephen Sondheim, the songwriter who can adapt to any style. To be sure, he has had his successes and mistakes, but one thing about his shows you can always count on: They will be something unique. Who would have thought somebody would write a musical about a barber that knocks people's throats and turns them into meat pies? Sondheim did so, and he did wonderful things. The whole show is set in a factory to suggest the still catastrophic effects of their misery at the bottom of society, and this perfectly serves the needs of the show. Catwalks and railings are moved everywhere to suggest streets and walkways and bridges. Techniques are borrowed from Kabuki and Noh, with the visual scene hands and changes. Then, to throw it all out, the great Angela Lansbury cast as the cruelly practical and humorous Mrs Lovett and George Hearn with her operative baritone voice like the murderous Todd, and you've got yourself a starry musical vehicle. The rest of the casting moves smoothly through the cliches of the love story perfectly, except for Johanna and Pirelli, who sound a little too forced. If Johanna and Pirelli from the Broadway show could be here, it would be perfect. Hearn works while singing more than Len Cariou on the OBC album, and the accents don't sound like forced here. Throughout it all, Sondheim's score never avoids emphasizing the darkness of history. As I said, he can adapt to any style. In Follies he mimics the 30-inch style of showturns, in Pacific Overtures he captures the subtle art of Asian music. Into the Woods tracks 32 bar Disney style songs, and Assassins covers a history of American music. Here he does, however, marvel at making his score clear English, from singing songs to operator duets and soliloquies to community rolls for Gilbert / Sullivan style tits. And yet the show is deadly serious, even though it provokes more fun than any musical comedy. In it is still a bleak warning of the evils of revenge. Here's where this movie makes a mistake by cutting the judge's solo, where he flags himself for the sake of his crimes. Without it, the judge is just a conventional villain, and this film is supposed to have no straight guys. Both Todd and the judge learn too late, horrors of having to accept responsibility for their actions, and Todd loses everything in his occupation. This is well-brought out of the chill replay of the ugly yet rollicking Ballad of Sweeney Todd, ending the show with Todd and Lovett rising from the tomb to tell us that the end is the same: in a world full of Sweeneys, revenge vengeance only revenge. "Join the story of Sweeney Todd. He earned a dark and devoted God. Seeking revenge can lead to hell, but everyone does it, and rarely as well as Sweeney, like Sweeney Todd, Demon Barber of Fleet Street."
