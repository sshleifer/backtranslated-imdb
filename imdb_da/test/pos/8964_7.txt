Great movie, a very worthy 7/10. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was at his usual best, the heavy drinking congressman who rescued Afghanistan from his communist oppressors! Based on a true story tells us how the West throws money and weapons at a problem and expects it to go away. Well, it went away, though temporarily. See who we (including British British) are fighting with the same people that the United States gave weapons, training and money to in the 80s. <br /> <br /> This movie will always provoke political thoughts by people who see it, but it shows a very good story. But when the main goal is reached, that is, tearing the Communists from Afghanistan, it is seen how quickly human life is forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie was good, it was a well deserved 7/10. It told the story of the Communist invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent hidden US operation for some details and was well dramatized. Although I'm a good movie, I'd recommend it to people, but some people won't enjoy it. Especially a serious movie about good (USA) v evil (Russia) is not your thing!
