Seven Ups has been compared to Bullitt for chase scene, but doesn't come anywhere near matching Bullitt. Bullitt has a beginning that builds building builds. When McQueen leaves the seedy hotel, enters his Mustang, which is parked under the Embarcadero Freeway (now torn down) and notices the nearby charger, you know you are seeing something spectacular. From the moment McQueen starts the car, the best car chase sequence ever begins to be filmed. Adding to it is a fantastic Lalo Schriffin if I remember correctly soundtrack. This continues for a long time before you actually hear the first tires trembling. The shot of McQueen's Mustang, which suddenly appears in Bill Hickman's rearview mirror, is unmatched for visual impact. Hickman's look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect. Then, of course, San Francisco is unsurpassed for setting cars up and down hills and around bends. Also, the Bullitt was filmed in the 60s when cars were still "Hot" (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger) made for a better set of wheels then two boring, smog units laden Pontiacs in the 1970's Seven Oops. Bill Hickman was the driver of the bad lighthouse in both films. I saw him sitting on an insider movie preview once at the Univeral party when I made movie reviews for a paper. They gave it a good try in seven ups though with the chase scene. Seven weeks had a few "jumps" over small hills (Yawn), but of course they were not San Francisco hills. The Seven Ups hunt, where they actually go fast, is longer than the quick order in Bullitt. But the scene for a single shotgun blast jumps out completely on the head of Roy Schieder's Pontiac's height of absurdity. Strictly Hollywood, I would say, except it was filmed in New York.
