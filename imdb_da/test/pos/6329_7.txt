Bergman and comedy do not go completely together. Some of his comedies are so naïve that you almost win. This movie has the odd naïve moment - the last 30 seconds are nadir, but on the whole this is a charming (rather than fun) piece, comfortable all the way through. Bergman throws several of his usual suspects who do well. There is a great scene on the train between David, Marianne and a spooky salesman who wants to stay in memory. Some of the marriage material is typical, cynical Bergman, but it is Bergman in a light rather than dark mood. <br /> <br /> This movie has its moments and is worth the 90 eight minutes. Not one of his classics and not the place to start if you want to fall to Bergman.
