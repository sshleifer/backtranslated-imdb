I have a problem with the movie snobs, who consider the Americans to be rude half-literates could not appreciate the more sophisticated Europeans, les Francais, read Italy's subtlety ... almost anyone from le continong to whom English is a foreign language. If humor in "my father's hero" is different from that in "Mon Pere ce heros" it is because the French sense of humor is different from the American one. Not better, not "more wise", just different. If you think it's a desire for Hollywood to "borrow" from the French cinema, just consider how much the French cinema has borrowed from Hollywood in the first place. Where would Belmondo and Delon have been without Bogart? Truffaut without Hitchcock? Jerry Lewis - not known for its subtle and cerebral style is idolized in France. Go figure ........ Monsieur Depardieu is exceptionally good as the outrageous divorced father of a perishable 14 year old daughter on holiday in the Bahamas. Unknown to him, she presents him to the other people in the hotel as her lover to make herself more interesting for a boy she is watching. Not surprisingly, complications follow. There are "hommages" for "Green Card" and "Cyrano de Bergerac" entertaining inset and M.Depardieu goes along with it all very well - naturally. He makes a good Maurice Chevaler impression with "Thank Heaven for Little Girls" which is actually fun and quite appealing as his audience, who all believe in him being a lover of a 14-year-old girl, getting up and leaving two - two As he curls away, happily ignorant of what is happening. Turning at the end of the song to acknowledge the expected applause, the expression on his face is invaluable. Without him, the film would be very average. With its large shambling figure, the screen dominates it is very fun. No pecs, no six packs - just a really decent human type. Awesome!
