After the return of "horror movies" (came on Scream is not scary!) I did not have very high hopes on this low-budget three-story horror movie. But I was pleasantly surprised! Man this is scary !!! The first 2 stories are simply brilliant. The first about a new couple running in a dark forest with their RV when they encounter a violent ....... (see the movie)! The second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl who is home alone for one night .... I know that sounds nothing special, but it's scary. I promise you. The last story is not scary, but at least not bad. It's about a biker and a ghost house. In fact, the stories are based on real urban legends (I think Kevin Williamson can also steal ideas). Run this movie, it's good !!! I'd say I'm the scariest three-short-story-horror movie ever made!
