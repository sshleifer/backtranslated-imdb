There have been many (well, more than a few in any case) attempts over the last 30 years to create films that have a "widespread" look. Assuming that this is a film director's desire to refrain from other films or simply to smooth over the low budget and shabby appearance, "Begotten" is at the top of this pile. <br /> <br /> Apart from the relentless "Eraserhead", anyway. Merhige's meticulous process of artificially degrading film alters the entire structure (imagine how this movie would have resembled brilliant, standard Technicolor) - It can almost be considered as an artifact from another, unknown culture. Some images are so far removed from what we expect to see on the screen, they mainly interfere with being disturbed. This is not the "last house on the left" disturbances, more like leaving-your-cave-for-the-first-time-and-see-sun disturbance. <br /> <br /> See this fever dream if you get the chance and enjoy. Remember, they make other, more standard films every day. They can wait.
