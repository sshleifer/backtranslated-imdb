**** SPOILERS THROUGHOUT **** This is a very strange movie - especially for its time - in every respect. For six years, American films had shown American soldiers like everyone's son, brother, father. In movies as the best years of our lives and to the end of our time, our hearts are drawn to the difficulties The sweet, returning soldiers adapt to peace and their families. But in the same year, this movie shows soldiers as a mix of people who are rather worse than the viewer - a message of this movie is - "Unlock your daughters". Even the good soldiers - with plenty of time on their hands - gambling all the time, get stupefyingly drunk and don't care if they even have wives anymore. And their reaction to the police investigating a murder is - to conspire against them. <br /> <br /> Mitchum, the most sympathetic soldier says things like "I don't know if my wife wants to do it now after the war. Hasn't seen her in two years. I don't care? Not really. Maybe We'll leave it, maybe not. "<br /> <br /> Another soldier appears to be unusually sensitive because after years he would see his wife again. <br /> <br /> Later, when this soldier says at the police station that he spent the evening at a whore's home - not knowing that his wife is sitting right behind him, there seems to be no doubt what his wife will be fine. In fact, she is - I think it's "Hey, soldiers become soldiers". <br /> <br /> The police detective, played by Robert Young, trying to kill a murder, says convincingly and with endless fatigue about a person's account of their actions on that night, <br /> <br /> "I don't care? No, I don't care about anything anymore. I've done it too long, I think." <br /> <br /> A man comes up on the whore's apartment. He says "I'm just a man like you, interested in" hear. Then he says, "No, it's a lie, I'm her husband. I want to be in the military, I was knocked down before." <br /> <br /> hen he says, "No, it's a lie, why do I want to be a soldier?" He goes through another series of lies when the police ask him who he is. To the end of the movie we have no idea who he is or why he is there! He is one of the strangest characters in the film's history! <br /> <br /> A man stands with his girlfriend in a bar talking to four soldiers when a lumpy soldier hits a drink on his girlfriend. She leaves changing her dress - and right again wearing another, no problem. But the man does not leave with his girlfriend - which simply disappears - but instead follows one of the soldiers when he leaves to go to another area of ​​the bar! The man then extrapolates from the minimal information he has been told about the soldier - philosophizing grandly about the problems of returning soldiers - and immediately the soldier invites home because he is full and feels ill. These are strange things. <br /> <br /> Likewise, a dance girl is annoyed by the sentimental soldier who wants to take her out "for a real dance - and maybe dinner". Yet she dances with him - and gives him the key to her home! <br /> <br /> Were people in the late 1940s always urging soldiers to come to their homes after they had just met them? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan kills his host, a stranger when he is furious that the Jewish host is trying to get it drunken Ryan out of his home. The reason for the murder? "No Jew tells me how to drink". "How do you drink?" Huh? What does it mean? <br /> <br /> This movie is always off-kilter, deliberately so - the soldiers are consistently acting with complete complete scams in the law, and all the characters are as cold and tough as any movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> And yet the movie is quite poignant! You simply have no idea how these people should act - or what new bizarre character will emerge - without anyone thinking of the person's actions being strange at least - eg. Wife's behavior. <br /> <br /> The story is about the finest I've ever seen - from Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Gloria Grahame (who earned an Oscar nomination), Paul Kelly and other players I had never heard of. <br /> <br /> I have never heard of this movie - and it is a complete joy that I have discovered one that I will see again and again and again. It is really strange but impossible to look away because you have no idea what these creatures will do next.
