One of my favorites. As a child grew up in the NY Metro area at the end of the 60's and early 70's, I often had the opportunity to visit NYC with my grandfather or dad when doing business there. The magnificent, busy, human, reality of the city, especially in the winter, has stayed with me. <br /> <br /> This movie is very well captured by the strong, cold, material facts of the NYC winter season, while undermining the region's infamous crime and police underworld. A good snapshot of a place and time and culture. <br /> <br /> And the cargo is simply amazing. At least on a par with that of "Bullitt" and surpass the hunt in "The French Connection". I can see again and again when the suspension comes down to the Plymouth Fury police crossing that goes against the GW Bridge in pursuit as it enters the sharp right curve and jumps and scrapes in conflicting traffic. The stunt driving coordinator for this scene did "Bullitt" and "The French Connection" as well as many other noatable movie hunts. Good play too, and a decent plot line. The musical score is edgy and convincing, and film and direction are top notch. A great if underrated 1970s cop drama. A keeper. Not out on DVD yet, though. <br /> <br /> Compares in style and content to: The French Connection and Super Fly. Early 1970s soldier drama set in the gloomy NYC winter months.
