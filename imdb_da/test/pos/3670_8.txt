Yes, sometimes "unconditional love" is overwhelmed as it jumps - no, as it ricochets - from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it was only before I looked at the movie for the second time that I began to understand what I think, P.J. Hogan might have tried to deal with this crooked, unconventional flick. Perhaps the whole movie itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love that Grace (Kathy Bates) longs to describe in the later part of the film. Grace insists that unconditional love is, without condition and without qualification. So I saw "unconditional love" again with that in mind. I laughed much more than I did the first time, became more involved in the characters, I began to understand, sometimes absurd turns the story takes. The performances are often over the top, but no more than they should be to fit Hogan's odd and whacky vision, a vision that moved me to tears, longing and outbursts of side-gurgling laughter. Yes, Hogan asks a lot about his audience. But I have come to really love his film - unconditionally.
