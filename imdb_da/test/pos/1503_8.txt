I must honestly say that a cat in the war is one of the most fun and unintentional hilarious movies I've ever seen. This film is filled with stupid dialogues, ridiculous scenes, and a self-explanatory plot starring the legendary horror director Lucio Fulci himself. The up-and-coming storyline is about an aging director (Fulci, who is also called Lucio Fulci in the movie ...) who begins to suffer and hallucinate because of all the evil things he has filmed in films over the last few year. He goes to a shrink who hypnotizes Fulci and tells him that he will believe in being a killer, but that shrinkage will actually be the one who does the killing. The rest of the movie is made by plays from "the movie", which Fulci controls throughout this action, scenes from the shrunk kill people who constantly grind as a beautiful moron and some of Fulci's hallucination sequences. Oh, and a few breasts also threw well ... A cat in the war is completely top-notch and ridiculous in every sense. Gore is classic Fulci - nasty and strong with some really decent scenes. The chain section section of a female body is pretty cool, just as the chain saw's head is a little boy. Lots of stabbings, gougings and other dead kill scenes make this a beautiful non-stop carnage. The ridiculous dialogue (LICK IT !!!! LICK IT !!!), as well as some of the insane scenes (the Nazi orgy, the opera-singing clapper and the wear and tear of an innocent hippy come to mind easily ...) This fun as hell. Not nearly as dark as some of Fulci's other movies - the CAT is more of a self-indulgent horror / comedy, if it wasn't supposed to be fun, is actually a little sad. I say to grab a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle in it. I saw the CAT with a couple of friends and we laughed all the time. THIS is the emotional movie in the summer ... Recommended 8/10
