Whether one sees him as a gallant cavalry of the plains or a glory chasing egoic, the debate on George Armstrong Custer's life and military career continues down to the present. They died with their boots On presents some facts in the Custer story and have taken freedom with others. He actually took the exam at the bottom of his class at West Point and got this campaign overnight on the brigade general battlefield. His record that led the Michigan Regiment during his command was one of glimpses. It was also true that his marriage to Libby Bacon was one of the great love struggles of the 19th century. Libby and George were married for 12 years until The Little Big Horn. What is not known to today's audience is that Libby survived until 1933. During that time she was a resident of Custer legend. By his own iron will and personality power, the late man became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way. I think Raoul Walsh and Warner Brothers missed a good opportunity to have Custer's career told in flashback. Olivia DeHavilland should have gotten the way Jeanette MacDonald was in Maytime and tell the story of her husband and her marriage from the nostalgia and point of view. Even then, the cracks of the Custer legend arose, but if they were finished from Libby's point of view, they could be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> Sydney Greenstreet performed well as General Winfield Scott. The only problem was that Scott had nothing to do with Custer, he retired and replaced by George B. McClellan at the end of 1861, while Custer was still at West Point. I'm not sure they ever met. But Greenstreet makes a good characterization of the mighty and powerful Winfield Scott. A good Mexican war history should have been what they gave Greenstreet instead of his very accurate portrayal of Old Fuss and Feathers. <br /> <br /> However, the film is worn by one of the great romantic teams of cinema, Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. This was the last of eight films they did together. The last scene they ever made for the cameras was Libby's farewell to George when he left to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign. Both their performances, especially Olivia, were a high point in their careers at Warner Brothers. We know through history that Custer is riding to his death, that and the fact that this was their last screen holding, gives this scene such a special poignancy. If your eyes do not moisturize, you are made of marble. <br /> <br /> As a story they died with their boots on the leaves much to be desired. As a Western adventure that successfully blends romance with the action, you can't beat this movie at all.
