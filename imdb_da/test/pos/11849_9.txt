I was in the cave this morning under the scene where Ed was involved in the 3-way and thought my wife was catching up with some early morning pores! Much to my surprise, it caught my attention and I rewound it and we started to see it at 4:30 am tomorrow! What a very entertaining, rich, fun and well-developed plot line and script. We both thoroughly enjoyed it, my wife so much that she shared the experience with her girlfriends at work! Goes to recommend it and say what a "kick" she got out of it. I'm in my late 40's and she's in her early 50's. I think this movie would appeal to both young and old. An unexpected, very enjoyable surprise. Nice work! Thanks! Two thumbs up!
