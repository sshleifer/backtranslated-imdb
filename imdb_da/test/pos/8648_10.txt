10/10 <br /> <br /> PLOT DISCUSSION <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies ever made, and I don't say because I'm being fooled by the seemingly inconsistent presentation. Those who do not like the movie because they do not understand the story often criticize those who boast the film by saying that they accept their genius because they do not understand it. I don't see this movie as very allegorical. For me, this is a story with a beginning, middle and end. People get confused by the movie because they expect them to have a deep philosophical meaning to interpret from the allegedly meaningless scenes. I feel they are unable to realize that the crypticism comes from a chopped and rearranged plot combined with a very long and fairly explanatory fantasy sequence and not from a chaos of visual allegory. Because of the limitation of length, I will try to keep this card and to that point and touch the big concepts. <br /> <br /> The general plot: Diane moves to L.A. after the jitterbug competition to get into acting. At an audition she meets Camilla with whom she falls in love. Diane gets furious with jealousy when Camilla sleeps with other men and women. Diane discovers the other man (director) at a film recording and discovers the other woman (a random blonde) on the engagement party for Camilla and the director. Motivated by her rage and possession, Diane hires a hitman to kill Camilla. Then she is overcome by loneliness and slides into an unconscious fantasy world where she lives the life she wants. Diane is then awakened. In her conscious state she is haunted by what she has done. <br /> <br /> The Importance of the Imagination: The movie starts after the credits with a 1st person p. Shots depict someone coinciding on a bed and slipping into unconsciousness. This is where Diana's imagination starts. The accident is there as an excuse for her to "bring back" her dead girlfriend and justify the fantasy life. She portrays her girlfriend as innocent and innocent because that was what she wanted her to be. Meanwhile, she seems like everything is "as in the movies" because she has an escapist personality. She kills herself to some extent and assumes the identity of a waitress named Betty in a dining room. The story about the director is a direct result of her feeling that he somehow became the victim in fact as she was and "convinces" that he was forced to choose Camilla. It was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party. In fact, Camilla Rhoades in the fantasy is the random blonde from the engagement party. She hated her so much that she turned her into Camilla and made the ultimate antagonist. She took the real Camilla and turned her into a perfect, entertaining out-of-the-movie girlfriend and used Rita Hayworth as inspiration. She also paints the hit man as a very clumsy and unable to further justify Camilla's survival. Her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was a search for Diane, who ended up being herself and having the dream world die by taking her through a series of reminders of reality. The first reminder was Club Silencio, who chanted that "there is no band" and the "instruments" you hear are not right there; This is a metaphor for the imagination. She starts shaking violently because it shakes her perception of her surroundings. The second reminder is the blue box. In fact, the blue box is not the reminder itself (more of a Pandora's box, really), but the blue key that opens the box. The blue key reminds her of Camilla's actual death, because that's what the hitman said would show up when it was done. Along with having love, this whole creation of her is an escape from reality by living in the idealized Hollywood that she expected to be a part of when she arrived. <br /> <br /> This is a story showing the psychology of a very troubled woman who lost a dream. It's not a number of random things specifically designed to interfere, and it's not a cryptic philosophical message. It is an unfortunate lump of the human condition that is presented beautifully. <br /> <br /> But in the end it's all my opinion. I can be far away. Or it should not be meant to mean a thing. There are many who disagree with me. Great! Afterall, why should that matter? Why can't it just be a statement in itself? What if coherent, sensible stories are hangers for artistic expression? For example, Peter Greenaway has used many words of benevolent support for this idea in such statements as "I would argue that if you want to write stories, be a writer, be a novelist, don't be a film maker. Because I think movies are so much more exciting in areas that are not primarily related to narrative. "And where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation? There is no such rule because the clarity of the film is independent of art. "I did not understand it!" So...? "Mulholland Dr.," history or not, affects viewers, harasses them, pulls them, gives them, lulls them. The way it listens to interpretation is amazing. It never gets old. It never loses its luster. Its visuals are always effective and beautiful. It's cinematic perfection no matter what. Enjoy.
