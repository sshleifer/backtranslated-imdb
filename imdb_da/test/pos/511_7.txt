It seems to me that many people do not know that Blade is actually a superhero film similar to X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the like. What all these heroes (and in the case of the X-Men Hero Group) have in common is that they were all perceived in Marvel's magical world. Leaves were originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal angry and eventually turned to Dracula himself and he lacked a better word boring. So boring, in fact, that the sign was shrewd and actually never used in the Marvel universe. At least until he was reinvented. <br /> <br /> David Goyer did a brilliant blow as he took Blade's character and transformed him into a leather-covered dark knight. However, he cannot take credit, and much of this must also go to Stephen Norrington, who with his distinctive visual style brings out the best of the character. The blade character (Wesley Snipes) is pretty amazing in this movie and blends martial arts with Batman as dark. Snipes are pretty good as the title character and are successful in highlighting duality and inner demons. He is, however, a rather stiff actor both in voice and in posture and is only interesting enough for a movie (which is clearly seen from the subordinates). Kris Kristofferson is also good and really brings Whistler's painful character to life with energy and sense of timing. However, N'Bushe Wright is rather weak as a leading lady who makes her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is quite fun and manages to do much with a smaller character. German, Udo Kier, should also be mentioned as he brings a lot of finesse and style to vampire races, probably born of his experience playing Dracula. Stephen Dorf gives the best acting in the film and his chilling performance, as Deacon Frost is one of the best screen shots I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story is good and I feel, renewing the vampire genre (something that hasn't happened since Robert Rodrigues' From Dusk Till Dawn) by adding many modern elements and maintaining the cartoon feel. By saying that the movie has a cartoon feel, it does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from. Much effort has been put into trying to make the film seem as real as possible. Including the effects that are quite good for their time. I found the vampire "dusts" to be a very good touch. Instead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies, Norrington chooses to let the vampires spontaneously switch, which looks great. The fact that the overall effects were well done increases the credibility of the film, which would otherwise have fallen flat on the face. As mentioned earlier, Norrington has a very clear visual style that differs from the directors of the following Blade films. Del Toro is almost as good, but I prefer Norrington's style. His style gives the film a very special look and most importantly it gives the film atmosphere. A very tense dark atmosphere that works well in accordance with the main character and story. Along with the visual style is the music, which also works fine and adds a lot to the film's atmosphere. All in all, Blade is a very entertaining movie that probably should have had an 8 from me, but a few annoying errors (which cannot be revealed without destroying the movie, it is enough to say that many of them are near The film's end) makes the film settle with a high 7. <br /> <br /> 7/10
