I'm an opera buff, and operas are full of sex, blood and death. It can help to know the librettos of the operas, as the arias come from really appreciating this movie - my mileage is very different from Tug-3. I am a classic music lover and I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I loved Ken Russell's "Nessun Dorma" segment and would actually like to see him produce Turandot, because opera must be overwhelming, truly multi-media experience, but then I loved Lisztomania. I love * Turandot * and know the libretto so well why I don't find this segment, the travesty that Tug-3 did. <br /> <br /> The Buck Henry / Rigoletto segment is probably the most accessible to average viewer - they will probably recognize the tunes and it's a classic bedroom farce. I like bedroom farces so silliness doesn't disturb me. <br /> <br /> The "Liebestod" segment is so excellent that I recommend people to see this for that piece alone. "Depuis la Jour" was for me beautifully spiritual. And the Caruso recording of "Vesti la Giubba" (also I Pagliacci) with John Hurt, when the clown was wonderful. But people who just want naked women can feel that there is too much music and not enough tough meat and sex.
