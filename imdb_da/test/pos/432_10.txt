I'm not a fan of musicals, but I'm a big fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin. I rented this movie on a whim and was pleasantly surprised even expecting the grandeur of the classic director. This movie is BEAUTIFUL. The shoots are like oil paintings with movement, which many directors strive for, but Renoir MASTERS. I can't express how much this movie goes beyond ... it's not really a musical, it has just a few well-placed music tracks and a grand dance final. But there is especially something about this movie that makes you feel absolutely happy when you see it. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of foreign art films, but I'm also a meathead who loves things like Die Hard and Schwarzenegger movies. I am very easily cut off by things that are too happy or in "la la", but this movie has an overwhelmingly positive energy which is just irresistible - not to mention every frame is beautiful and the plot is good. 10 out of 10
