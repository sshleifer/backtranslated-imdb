I think it's a great, classic monster movie for the family. The mill, what a machine! The tall creature with beak, the flying green lizards, Ranthorincus / mayas or whatever they are, and the monkey men are talking to them telepathically. Men's battle in rubber suits fighting for a doll for breakfast umm! delicious! Class, what more can I say? How would they make a 2002 remake of this?
