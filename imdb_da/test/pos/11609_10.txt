I have been able to watch this amazing movie at Fantasy Film Festival in Berlin, and when I left the cinema, I felt like being drunk * g *! I've really seen lots of movies and there are just a few I called perfect as Fight Club or Koyaanisqatsi! Subconscious cruelty is now one of them! Half of the people who looked at it in Berlin went out of space, and I can fully understand this because it can be a real shock to a person living in his perfect world every day, dreaming of his dreams if not to think of horror on our planet-in our lives! I don't think I should describe the film's story to you because the people have already written on this site! It's a movie that shows everything and more !!! Get 10 points + from 10 !!! It would be cool if you people who also saw it love it, would write me an email! So far I have not met anyone as impressed and happy about it as I am !!! Finally sorry for my bad english- i'm not a studied person (and am also gut so !!! :-))))))
