To say this is a good show is not to say anything at all. After all, this show is made by the same crew responsible for Airplane and other hilarious and brilliant films. Writing is amazing. Although the show is built on one-liners, they do not become indulgent or annoying. Leslie Nielsen bends his comedy muscle to the fullest extent as if to say: You haven't seen anything yet. The format was absolutely polished to introduce Naked Gun. When you watch the movies, note how many schticks are taken from the TV show. The brilliant part is that they don't have to change too much. The show was really a test site for bigger and better versions that came later.
