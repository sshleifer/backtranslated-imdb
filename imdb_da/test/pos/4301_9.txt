This was one of the worst Columbo episodes I've seen, but I'm only in second season. The typical Columbo activities are both entertaining and annoying. His cigar tank, causing him problems, has been seen before, and the bit where he always somehow identifies with the killer - in this case cooking, the scene of the TV cooking show distracted from the main theme. <br /> Also, it was not explained why the brother at the start of the show cut part of the mixer wires. The reason was never explained, nor did it serve any purpose. But the part I didn't like most was the death of the bride. This was never explained, and that is the main reason why I give this episode such a low class.
