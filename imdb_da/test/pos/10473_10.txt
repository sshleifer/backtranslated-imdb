I can think of no movies that better capture the concept of grace, in the theological sense. The blessed religion of a small congregation that has gone wrong after the death of their leader robs them of the very thing they preach: grace. The precious gift of a humbled Parisian culinary genius returns them to their call to love one another and humiliates an aging general worried that he has wasted his life. CHOICE is a central theme as well as grace. At the same time, artistic gift is recognized as a strong, transcendent role to play in everyday life and the coming life. Impossible to improve or ignore. This is a life-changing movie for those who hear the message.
