Yes!! They finally got it to perfection. What a good idea, a refreshing use epic for Generation-X, whether they know it or not. After disasters like Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD, and being turned off by Blockbuster, our hero, Lloyd Kaufman, decided to go after it, stop catering to distributors and let Troma be the whole of Troma it can be. Lloyd would make this the most unhygienic, outlandish and even hilarious Troma movie yet. This time Lloyd takes Shakespeare's love story, turns it inside, tromatises it, and adds that the long, lost, entertainment value it always lacked. Entertainment value, like Lemmy Kilmister (narrator), Debbie Rochon (chef), Joe Fleishaker (the cool guy) and of course brutal mutilation and toilet humor. Tromeo and Juliet are the final version of a rather missing history, and the Troma universe crown jewel. <br /> <br /> Many years ago, NJ business partners Monty Que and Cap Capulet in Tromaville started a movie company called Silky Films, which would produce seemingly tasteful, soft core films. Monty believes Cap's friend, but Cap is out to screw the poor sucker out of his share of the business. On paper and in books, it seems that Monty gave his life's work for free. Fast until the mid-90s Manhattan, we have two families who are extremely dissatisfied with each other, that is, they are just looking for a reason to take a limb or preferably a life. Monty has a son, Tromeo, nephew, Benny, they, along with their friend Murray Martini, who is just too excited about the whole carnage, wars on the incestuous capsules, except Monty, he is too full to care. As in the original, there is a confusing situation that causes Tromeo to fall to Cap's daughter, whom he never met or never knew about. Unfortunately, Cap is a sadistic pervert, which is not a thing for the bottle, which is not the same as Tromeo's father, and that would, of course, cause father's little chenshaw melon to be physically and emotionally abused and melted and held in a plexiglass cage of and depending on Cap's cool mood. Cap also forced his vegetarian daughter to marry London Arbuckle, a billionaire butcher, who would make almost all unpleasant, with or without the rose bread. With all these drawbacks, young lovers feel that eloping would be the best decision, but how will this affect the great feud? It may or may not be a bit like the original, but finding out how this end ends up is simply not happening, you will never see that. "<br />" One with Leo "is just a sleep-inducing companion to Tromeo & Juliet, but if it's water down, overrated, big budget, Hollywood, Garbage, that's what you've been programmed to go on, then it certainly goes, but if you are in the mood for something a little more colorful, something that really packs a blow and does not follow the "normal" movie pattern, and if you happen to have a rather abnormal sense of humor, then If you just do not hate this movie, Tromeo and Juliet give their finger to everything that is mainstream, full-blown exploitation with just as much humor as something from a young John Waters, along with some bad actors, Tromeo and Juliet hit on a thunderstorm Including the legendary engine head, and not least a great effort by James Gunn who really brought this together, for more awesomeness from James Gunn, check out Lollilove, and for more excellence from Lloyd Kaufman, check out his next vision, Terror Firms. Juliet is jaw -drop invaluable exploitation for the 90s was brought to us by one and only king of B-movies. Thank you, Lloyd. 10.10
