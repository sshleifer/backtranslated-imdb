I saw it on a German press screening. Without giving too much away: Most critics really liked it a lot. There was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for that species. From my point of view, so far, it was the funniest movie of the year. It keeps the charm and joke of the three W + G shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other films. Of course, there are obvious ghosts for monster and werewolf movies, especially to "An American werewolf in London", "Jaws", "King Kong" and even to Peter Jackson's "Braindead" / "Dead Alive", but also to other genres. <br /> <br /> Characterization was better done in "Chicken Run", but that movie had a complete new "cast" where introduction was needed. Here you can already know the two main characters. So the new "Wallace and Gromit" movie is best enjoyed if you saw (and liked) shorts already, but it also works alone. "Chicken Run" had it more convenient, but also more "storytelling" plot. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece holds the more discerning and in some way more "isolated" sense of W + G shorts. The kids should also enjoy it very much, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love sweet rabbits, this is a must-see for you !!!) and because Gromit has a lot to do and really steals the show (kids also love dogs. .. :-)). But many jokes are thought for a more adult audience (there are even soft sexual allusions in it). The movie, like "Shrek 1 + 2" and "The Incredibles", controls high-level entertainment for the whole family, adding a British and at least a little darker edge to humor in American animated films. <Br /> <br /> The animation is ?? as expected ?? amazing and they were true to the Aardman style because they did not put too many digital effects - I just realized a few when it came to Wallace's inventions. Finally, the score works fine in movies, although one of the main topics is certainly "borrowed" by Randy Edelman's "Dragonheart" score. The bad thing is: It will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from Nick Park & ​​Co.
