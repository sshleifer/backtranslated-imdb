* MINOR SPOILERS * <br /> Need further evidence that Tsai Ming-liang is among the most original and provocative filmmakers working everywhere today? Watch this movie. </p> <p> Due to weak variations of a theme that runs through most of his work, the HIGH represents a study of alienation and loneliness - in this case between a man and a woman who is upstairs / downstairs neighbors - and how varied structures (genuine or psychological) of modernity are, people are moving away from each other. Here the woman (the downstairs neighbor) tries to endure, as her apartment is flooded with a strange leak from the top. A plumber tries to locate the source of the problem, then disappears after creating a large hole in the floor. Already isolated and desperate (both signs are among the few residents of a housing project that has not fled before a mysterious, near apocalyptic epidemic). The cave, which connects the two apartments, first acts as another in a wide variety of indignities, but soon begins to assume a sense of near mythical proportions. <br /> <br /> Tsai sense of humor and sense of film history is shown with a little more openness than usual - as the woman's occasional daydream about her upstairs neighbor is visualized as musical tracks (tuned to Grace Chang's music) that explodes from the screen in short bits of sensualistic, surreal romance and humor - reminiscent of big-screen pennies from heaven. And for all that enui and alienation on display here, Tsai's bias of the late 90's tensions is exciting, absurd and gives this movie a very appealing strageness. The final scene is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tsai - typically typical - is undermining most of the usual expectations or predictions. Westerners bring to Asian cinema with a nonchalant, randomly revealed directness that focuses on both the absurd tendencies of the human mind and the most absolute of the early days. There is a complete, disadvantageous demystification of almost everything about his characters, analogous backstory or most cultural significance (which enhances the isolation of the characters), making HOLE - and his other films - quite disorienting, but always fascinating and insightful.
