Wow! Where to start? <br /> <br /> This adaptation of Sarah Waters third novel is one of my all-time favorite movies !!!!! <br /> <br /> I'm not too big on fiction novels (seriously I never read fiction), but the book is just as AMAZING as the movie! Or should I say that the film is just as fabulous as the book? I just love this story !!!!! <br /> <br /> In any case, I like to watch this three-hour movie (2 part series on DVD, 3 part series on TV / book) for about a year and a half. It simply didn't look that interesting ... I was so wrong! <br /> <br /> I was instantly immersed in the rich and exciting plot ... totally thrilled! Like the book, you can't stop seeing / reading. It takes your attention for 3 hours ... and when it ends ... you don't want it. <br /> <br /> The story flows just as beautifully and you will ask yourself where the time went. <br /> <br /> The lesbian subplot was just icing on the cake! The parts I love the most are the subtle facial expressions and gaze / eye contact between the two characters. You really feel their desire for each other and yet they can't act on it ..... until they have to. <br /> <br /> Let me point out that "lesbian theme" is an important part of the movie, of course, the core of the movie is a truly unexpected love story, but it is certainly not what the whole movie is about. For me, this is what makes this story so unique and exciting. I have never read or heard of anything like this. Sarah Waters is pure genius! <br /> <br /> The turns that take it leave you hanging on the edge of your seat. Seriously! My hands were attached to my couch with every surprising plot twist, and I even shouted several times ("OH MY GOD! ANY WAY! IT WAS NOT HAPPY! DO IT?") ... I never do it! /> <br /> The only negative I have to say about this movie is that I wish they had added more from the book. But of course the adaptation is limited by time, they could not add anything I would have liked. How terrible, though ... I think I'm just brutally selfish now ... forgive me. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes seem a little hasty. But they put all the important bits in, where even if you only see the movie and choose not to read the book, you will be most satisfied with the result. <br /> <br /> The actors are just SUPERB! BRILLIANT YOURSELF! Sally Hawkins (Sue) and Elaine Cassidy (Maud) have such a great screen chemistry, they steam up your TV set. Simply electric! The feelings ... the desperation ... the struggle that each one feels is apparently expressed by these wonderfully talented actresses. Rupert Evans plays such a good bad guy as a gentleman. I found myself sweet every time he came on the screen but loved it because he's just so wonderfully sweet and somehow still charming, even if you want to twist his neck. Imelda Staunton gives another great performance as Mrs Sucksby. She is such a warm-hearted actress, you can't help but love her ... even when the character she plays is not so nice. Everyone else in the cast was perfect! They really represented the characters well and were like I imagined they should be after reading the book. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for any movie stuff! In fact, everyone and everyone should watch this movie and read the book! Chances are you won't be disappointed! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars from me! There are only four other films I have given the same rating too. It is very rare for me to actually enjoy a movie so much that I give it 10/10. This is one of those movies. Fingersmith is really a masterpiece!
