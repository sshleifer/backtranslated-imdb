A brilliant horror movie. Totally cruel and very scary too. The Thing is a remake of John Carpenter, but please don't let it burn you off this movie. It is simply brilliant. The movie's start has the alien's spacecraft raging against the earth for centuries before mankind walked on the planet with an explosion, releasing the title of the film into stunningly shiny white and blue indicating 'The Thing'. One of the best opening credits for a horror movie ever. <br /> <br /> The game of actors playing the twelve team crews is a joy to watch and the location of their Antartica Station is visually stunning on DVD widescreen. It must have been good in the cinema. I'm not sorry to see this on the big screen. Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men who are trying to fight a fatal model of change that has infiltrated their base. All the players in this are really good and create amazing scenes of paranoia and excitement about who the case has infected. My favorite scene throughout the movie should be when Macready tests anyone still living for infection, it is tense, scary and finally spectacular. I love it because it's fun too. <br /> <br /> Special mention should go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing makeup effects and shaping the changing design of the alien himself. If he didn't get an Oscar for the best visual effects at the time he got the hell out. It can also be discussed whether it is John Carpenter's greatest movie ... it is certainly a cruel masterpiece. Wait for a cold winter night. Get some Budweiser from the fridge. Sit down and watch The Thing, a horror work of flame-piercing heroes, struggling with changing towers of gore and slime. <br /> <br /> Absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten.
