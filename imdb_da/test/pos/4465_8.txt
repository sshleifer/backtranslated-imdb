Sporting a title apparently more suited to a Looney Tunes featurette than a grisly giallo, "Do not Torture a Duckling" (1972) is nevertheless a Grade A thriller from horror maestro Lucio Fulci. In this one someone has confused the preteen boys in a rural, southern Italian village and typical of these gialli there are many suspects. There is Barbara Bouchet (Patrizia) who looks more scrumptiolicious than you have ever seen her, a rich girl hiding behind a drug scandal; Florinda Bolkan (Martiara), the local epileptic voodoo woman; her witchcraft practicing beau; Giuseppe, the local idiot; the sweetened priest; his mother's mother and again and again. The movie features some exceptionally violent pieces, including a chain whip of one of the main characters in a cemetery (one of the most realistic bloody sequences I've ever seen) and a beautiful dukeout when the killer is finally revealed. The film's violent offense compensates for the fact that there is no real scary or excitement to talk about. Nevertheless, this giallo fascinates with its unusual rural background, disturbing child murder, oddball characters and freaky scores of Riz Ortolani. The film is beautifully photographed in what I suppose to be Monte Sant'Angelo, near the Adriatic Sea in southern Italy (at least, the city's police force is thanks to final credits). And while subtitling would have made this great DVD work even better (the American snake doesn't convince in this rural Italian setting), Anchor Bay has to be thanked for another well done work. Oh ... that title also makes perfect sense!
