This was an excellent movie! I saw this at Karlovy Vary IFF in the Czech Republic, and it won a prize there. This is the first movie I've ever seen from Jan (the director) and I was impressed. It's a great story of love and family. The film has a great balance between comedy, romance, drama and excitement all together. I will not give away any of the plot, but it is a well-made movie and I would see it again if I had the chance! The camera / editing is great, the movie simply flows and the characters are warm, and they are the kind you can relate to. I hope you can enjoy this movie as I did. If anyone knows where to find this in the US or if they plan to drop it on DVD anytime soon, let me know !!
