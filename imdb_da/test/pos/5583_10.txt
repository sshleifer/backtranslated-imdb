I also remember watching this movie as a young at a local little theater that presented foreign films every week. It was the bold adventure in all that was in my memory ever since. <br /> <br /> Particularly impressive was the scene with Noel Purcell as the old sailor Paddy who drank too much, saw or heard the apparitions and died of scare in a cave. I have always watched Noel's career even decades later because I saw him. There is also a young Cyril Cusack as the mating boatman, James, with designs on the lovely Jean Simmons, shown as the Emmeline adult. <br /> <br /> Would like to own a video of this haunting movie and update my memory of it. Where do I send my request?
