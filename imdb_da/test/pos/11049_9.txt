And with these words, one of the big movie advertising campaigns came to a conclusion. 'Garbo Talks' and she spoke these words in her first sound movie, an adaptation of Eugene O'Neil playing Anna Christie. <br /> <br /> Unlike some other players and some other studies, MGM was very careful in finding the right vehicle for Greta Garbo. Many players who were fine in the universal medium of silence would lose their careers due to talkies. Their heavy native accents would get in the way, some didn't know English. <br /> <br /> It was no coincidence that Anna Christie was elected to Garbo. First and foremost, it was authored by one of America's leading dramatists, that was the kind of literary property that would have appealed to her. Second, when the title role was one that was Swedish, the accent could be explained. Finally, many kinks from early talkies were drafted, although Anna Christie still made use of title cards. <br /> <br /> As most of O'Neil's work, it is not as effective but far and deep in characterization. The story takes place on the New York waterfront, where Garbo, as Anna, has come to live with her father George Marion. Marion ran away to sea years ago when Anna was a baby and Marion left her wife. Anna has had to do what she could to survive in the adult world, and that includes prostitution. <br /> <br /> Of course, Marion is happy to see her, even kicking off Marie Dressler, the old waterfront he has lived with for years to make room for his flesh and blood. Of course, both Marion and Garbo have their trouble adjusting to each other, not made easy when they shelter a sailor played by Charles Bickford who wants Garbo. <br /> <br /> Marion repeats its role from original Broadway production. Anna's role on stage was performed by Pauline Lord. Anna Christie ran for 177 shows in the 1921-22 season on Broadway. It is one of O'Neil's most famous works and one that is often revived. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garbo's perfect diction performance even with a Swedish accent was recognized, and her future in sound film was assured. Greta Garbo received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, and the film also received nominations for Clarence Brown as Best Director and William Daniels for Cinematography. Daniels should especially get a lot of kudos for the way he photographed the waterfront scenes. And Brown created the atmosphere around the waterfront where the movie is set. <br /> <br /> Eugene O'Neil's work is timeless, so Anna Christie, even with a lot of early-sounding prisoners, does not date the way many movies of that era do. Garbo also shows that she mastered the subtlety needed to work in the sound medium. Anna Christie is a classic all around.
