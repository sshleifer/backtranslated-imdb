"Dead Man Walking" is one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen. I find it hard to believe that anyone who, after watching the movie, could not care about the movie or its message. Tim Robbins does not attempt to impose his ideas and beliefs on viewers, but manages to make a movie that in most ways is sympathetic to both views on the death penalty - whether or not it is right to murder a killer. I have always known where I stand in this question, even as a child, and this film - although not really taking any pages - made me even more confident in my belief that it can never be right to murder * anyone *. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Matthew Poncelet, his nomination for an Academy Award was very well deserved. Although Nicolas Cage does a good job in "Leaving Las Vegas", I would have been happier if Penn had won the prize. Susan Sarandon is also brilliant and she deserved the Oscar she won. And Tim Robbins certainly deserves the vote I have given this movie: 9/10!
