The jazz soundtrack makes it a Clint Eastwood movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole affair hits me as Burt does Clint. The story is good, and the film is full of lines I carry with me today. (Reynolds to bad guy: I want to pull the chain on you because you're out in my city. And you want to know the worst part? You're from outta state!) <br /> <br /> Highlights: Technics 1500B Roll for roll is nice set of dressing for audiophiles! <br /> <br /> Charles Durning comes unglued while listening to wiretap lost by prostitutes who have (kind) phone sex. (You have to see it, trust me, it's fun.) <br /> <br /> Brian Keith plays against the type as a tough guy. (And do it well!) <br /> <br /> Bernie Casie is passionate about Zen. <br /> <br /> Rachel Ward. WOW! (Where did she go?) Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show band play their ranks as usual. (Joe Willem's guests on vocals. Manhattan Transfer re-recorded "Route 66".) The audio track gives the class the whole affair. <br /> <br /> Can I say more? It can be Reynold's best movie ever. <br /> <br /> (Yes, he plays as usual, but it works!) <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
