I would like to submit the following goof. <br /> <br /> During the bridge scene, soldiers are seen in the river, asking to be taken away and trying to escape. Some of the soldiers are approaching Captain Willard's boat and trying to board them with suitcases. Soldiers are also not issued, they never carry suitcases to a combat zone. They have duffel bags, packages and footlockers, but not suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of order. If you look closely, you also see that the suitcase floats on the water. This is probably a very good indication that it is empty, otherwise it would sink.
