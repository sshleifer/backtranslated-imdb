hi i'm john and i want to tell everything my dog ​​was in this movie on the baiting screen he was pit like someone who had to bite the man chained up. my dogs names were colin and he was away filming for a week for this movie. He was also in other things like crime watching UK and some other small parts. he won some dog shows but he has gone away now, i miss him, he was a big, true and loyal dog, and we had some good times together but he got cancer that could not be treated so i had to get him to To put the worst day in my life I hope it gives you something to look for in the movie if you see it again. <br /> <br /> Thank you all
