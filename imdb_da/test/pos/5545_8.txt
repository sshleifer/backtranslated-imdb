This is a fun movie with subtle intention. Its off-beat comedy is fun for me, unfunny to my friends. The soundtrack is perfect. I own this on VHS and I have seen it many many times because it is simply a fun and fun love story with great performances by all main characters (although you only use Joan Cusack alone as a perch for big hair was wasting her talent. I know I know she was still young ...). <br /> <br /> On a sad note I decided to check out the DVD last night (instead of watching my VHS tape) and became SHOCKED to find many important scenes cut. And on the copy I looked at, there was no particular feature of deleted scenes: it was as if the deleted scenes never existed !! I am so glad that I bought the used VHS in a flea market. It is clear that there was a great choreography in this, which is another reason I love it so much. It takes great skill, talent and genius to move around the scenes like Mercedes Ruehl, Dean Stockwell and Matthew Modine, doing from stage to scene (note the scene when the shopping carts converge, the one rolling on the floor during shooting in Miami, Chicken Lickin's debacle , foot massage, salon hair wash.) There is a very "theatrical" feeling of this movie which may be the rejection for so many if bad reviews follow: I know some viewers who do not quite understand this style fails the exaggerations and over-the-top performances for bad action and inferior direction. Not so. Jonathan Demme does a good job of killing the entire company and their respective roles. <br /> <br /> The opening allowance and first stage placement among my all-time favorites as well (another favorite opening credits / first scene: Fly Away Home). <br /> <br /> Too bad, Matthew Modine jumped so heavily out of the public eye; I really like him and found his casting perfect in the role of ms smith. In fact, this movie is well cast from soup to nuts: everyone is credible and faithful to his role. As for the question of the audience accepting Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians - why not? I thought they took it all out. <br /> <br /> Charming, fun, exciting ... what's not to like? If you want a little fun, you can see this nice, colorful fairy-tale love story.
