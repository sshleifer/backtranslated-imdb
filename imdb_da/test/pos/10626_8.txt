First of all, I must say that I love this movie. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie I saw from Director Micheal Haneke and I was impressed by how good the direction was! <br /> <He / He probably knows how to lead actors. What I found intresting is also Haneke's scenario. At first, you saw a woman who is very straightforward and seems to be a good piano teacher and very much loved and respected by everyone in her affinity. Then you realize that she has a mother who is a control freak and is too much present in her life. Now you know she's horrified that she has emotional problems, but you don't know exactly what. And then you fall into her dark side, but her dark side is revealed only when a student sendenly falls in love with her. She can't control herself any more. <br /> <br /> The roles are very complex and difficult to play, but Isabelle Huppert is great in her role and she deserves the recognition she had at the Cannes Festival. Benoit Maginel is also very solid, but slightly obscured by Huppert's performance. <br /> <br /> There is one thing I found strange in the scenario how the character that Magimel plays is not particularly credible. He's too talented! It is rare for a person to be a piano virtuoso, but pass most of his time to play hockey and study ... It thinks it's a weak point, but only a minor mistake. <br /> <br /> I just watched the movie so I can't make a very complete critic because I didn't analyze the movie. I like what I saw! so I give the movie an 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... at the end, Haneke showed that he would really shock his audience. A motivation that does not seem necessary to make movies, but Haneke does it with style and precision, therefore his film is better than Baise-Moi for example. <br /> <br /> Vince
