Two funeral directors in a Welsh village? English humor unlike the other things from across the Atlantic? How could I resist. My wife and I saw it on March 6th for our late Valentine's Day party and both of us enjoyed some good stomach laughs. We were going to watch another movie later, but didn't decide because we wanted the experience of this movie to stay with us in the evening. The Mortuary scene in the last 20 minutes of the movie is worth the wait. It raises problems that are rarely spoken in society, but I know three funeral directors, and humor is really good at the money. Recommended and congratulations to the authors. Without you, all actors, directors and the others have no work on Monday.
