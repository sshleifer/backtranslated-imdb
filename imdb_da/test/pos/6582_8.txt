Imagine the most depressing winter you will never experience: gray instead of white, no warfare and certainly no wonderland. It is Finland as depicted by 'Frozen Land'. This movie follows a bunch of people whose lives are strangely associated with each other's' results beyond anyone's nightmare. Yes, most characters are flawed in the way that only celluloid figures can - quite annoying and frustrating to see, yet you want good luck turning. <br /> <br /> With some randomly placed humor and a cast that merges Finland's somewhat mainstream faces, Frozen Land gives a glimpse of the Finnish mentality, which, despite the depressing downward spirals, manages to restore some belief in humanity. More than Kaurism√§ki, at least.
