This is one of Bruce's most underestimated films, in my opinion, it's a fantastic heart-warming movie with a nice storyline and a great performance by Bruce Willis! All the characters are great and I thought Willis and Spencer Breslin were just amazing together, plus Bruce Willis is simply amazing in this! This is definitely one of Bruce's best comedic performances (The waaaaaaaaaamabulance thing was great) and I thought it was very well written and made too, plus the finale is especially cool! It's good natural, and it was cool how you can see Russell's (Willis) character change throughout the movie! plus the finish was pretty good. I think this should be higher than 6.0, and it's one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen! Plus, it has many surprising moments throughout. All the characters are extremely sympathetic and it also has a sweet love story angle for it, plus Bruce and Spencer Breslin both had some really fun lines (Holy Smokes!). This is one of Bruce's most underrated movies in my opinion, it's a terrific heartbreaking movie with a nice story and a great performance from Bruce Willis, and I say it's a must see!. The direction is amazing!. Jon Turteltaub does a good job here with really good camera work and just keeps the movie at a very fast pace. The acting is excellent!. Bruce Willis is fantastic as always and is amazing here, he gives one of his best comedic performances, hilarious had wonderful chemistry with both Spencer Breslin and Emily Mortimer, had some fun lines and was dead throughout the movie, he was one of The main reasons I liked this movie so much! (Willis Rules !!!!!!!). Spencer Breslin is great as the younger version of Russell, he was very fun and didn't get on my nerves once, he's one of the better children's actors out there! Emily Mortimer is good as Amy and was really sweet I liked her that she also had a decent chemistry with Bruce. Lily Tomlin is fun as Janet I liked her quite a bit. Jean Smart is good at what she has to do, which wasn't much. The rest of the throw makes it fine. Overall a must see! **** out of pf 5
