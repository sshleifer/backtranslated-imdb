I've read some grumbles about court scenes. These people betray their ignorance. This production went to simply amazing lengths to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story took place. True manners are something few people outside the court ever see. Although the play may seem very stylized, it is actually as close to a replication as possible of the individuals' behavior in their particular stations that the director could create. The actor's facial expression is a marvel, especially the double Marquis Changxin and the King's mother. There are, of course, reflections of both Greek and Shakespeare tragedy in the relationship between the king, his parents and his love. The comparison of the king who transforms from good to evil and the murder from bad to good gives much food to the idea of ​​the development of a person's nature. This film would give much to consider in a college course on the humanities. At the same time, it almost hurries, even in the slower scenes, heading for inexorable degradation. A suspicion of involving large parts of the troop's movements, which was quite awesome. This makes the Lord of the Rings battle scenes pale by comparison. Few directors have the ability to literally mark thousands of people on the battlefield just for the sake of art. I remember a scene where at least 30,000 troops can be seen across a large plain. Logistics for such a shot would have been staggering. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but simply, I can't recommend this movie highly enough.
