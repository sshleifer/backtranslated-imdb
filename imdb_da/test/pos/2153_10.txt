Saw this film during the Mod & Rocker party in August. I was so inspired and touched. Harry had a great life and one of the best and different voices ever recorded. For those of you who do not know about Harry Nilsson, do some research and you can see that Harry has somehow found his way in your life in some way - perhaps it was his 70s special "The Point" or " Everybody's Talking "from Midnight Cowboy. For me it started with "people let me tell you about my best friend" - the theme song from "Eddie's Father's Courtship." To see this movie you can really feel the love and admiration of Harry's true friends and peers. Don't throw a tear for Harry - he had a ball ... <br /> <br /> Fold
