A poetic study of the human condition performed without dialogue. The Anti-Hero, The Man builds a ban on escaping a band of marauders, out of the destruction of early civilization, into the ruins of the city to pay tribute to his survival. There he crosses paths with The Brute, brilliantly played by Jean Reno, of "The Professional" and "Mission: Impossible" fame. The man is rescued by a crazy old genius who lives in a fortress of his own design. Using their wits, The Man and the old genius can hold Brute and his ilk in bay, but they realize that it is only a matter of time before their defense is compromised, so they pause for it. This is a highly discreet tale of the desperate struggle for life with excellent action scenes and smart humor. Of all films of its kind, such as "Road Warrior", "Omega Man" and even "Ultimate Warrior" (with Yul Brenner as a buff knife fighter), "Le Dernier Combat" is the most elaborate design. Copies of the video are hard to find, I would give my left eye ball for one. If your local art house ever has a revival of this movie, I heartily recommend breaking a commitment to see it big.
