A chick girl like Guys still likes - Yes! Wonderful. Now I can have fun, enjoy the company with my girl, and don't feel like I can't wait for the movie to end! Light - but fun. Good cases. What ever you do, don't miss DVD extras. This is also a large "blind date" file. Will Smith does well in this - though he is light-headed - he pulls it through well. The film is a bit slow in pacing - don't expect too much action - the laughter is there - and that's the message too - but the timing is a bit slow. Use the little moments to whisper or kiss - it will pick up. The end makes it good to feel good moments. Most of all, fun light-hearted fare - and beware of some amazing start-up of the supporting actors - expects the film. The plots are predictable - but it's a data move, so get refills of popcorn from the kitchen - and don't let it pause. Count on several dates after this movie - she wants to see what's next in the queue. Remember Hitch's advice !!! <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
