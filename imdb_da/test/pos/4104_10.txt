It may be a remake of the 1937 movie by Capra, but it is wrong to consider it only that way! It had to show Hilton's novel in a completely different way. As a musical, it is excellent. The scenery is amazing, the good signs and someone like "Leonard Maltin" who considers Bacharach music horrible must be totally deaf! I highly recommend it.
