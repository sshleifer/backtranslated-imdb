The nurse Betty has the odd but winning combination of a repulsive, unpleasantly-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. Likewise, I told Fargo at first sight, and realized that I was still thinking about it days later and somehow enjoyed it, I liked Nurse Betty much more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it is quite forced in many ways, but it seems to be part of what makes it so striking. Just work by Greg Kinnear, good work from Morgan Freeman (though I'm worried he is stereotyped as the principal villain). Chris Rock was good but not a standout. Clean Z. is so natural that it is unnerving - that is to say, being "natural" does not play well in the head. Similarly, this kind of "abrasive sparkle" performance from Allison Janney resembled a small part. <br /> <br /> Don't expect so much from a "road movie" that you might assume from some synopses. (There is "road", but it is barely relevant.) Rating 8/10.
