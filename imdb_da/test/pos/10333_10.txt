This movie was one of the best I've ever seen. The second day I was reminded of this movie of something on TV. It came back to me as a dam flooded. I have never been more touched by a movie than by this one. After the movie was over, I couldn't stop crying for approx. 2 hours. No movie has ever led me that way. I was 15 at the time of the movie and haven't seen it since, but I hope I can find a copy to buy so I can see it whenever I want. If anyone suggests you watch this movie with them, go .... you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Peggy Fries
