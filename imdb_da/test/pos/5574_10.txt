After 2 years of using this site for movie reviews, I finally registered with IMDB so I could give Farscape a "10." The show's authors, cast and crew have proved the unequivocal masters of the science fiction genre. Even those who usually don't appreciate sci-fi should be encouraged to give this exceptional series a chance! Farscape's virtues are simply too many to list, but one of them stands out everywhere; The quality of writing is fantastic. I haven't heard dialogue this good page "Blake's 7." In fact, Farscape feels very much like a "Blake's 7" with good special effects and a little more romance. <br /> <br /> All, enjoy!
