With its track from backwood's classics Deliverance and Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Jeff Liebermans Just Before Dawn can't offer much much new in terms of plot ?? a maniac and kills a group of campers ?? but still manages to be an effective shocker thanks to the instructor's skillful handling of the material, great use of the stunning scenery, even greater use of women in hot pants, a brooding synth score by Brad Fiedel and a beautiful twist to the end (although it should be clear to those who have been aware). Thanks to solid performances from his talented cast ?? including Oscar winner George Kennedy as founder Roy McLean? There is a sense of realism for Just Before Dawn, which is all too often lacking from this kind of fare. The movie also gives a beautiful, frightening madman (like snails like Dick Dastardly's dog Mutley and uses an eerie serrated machete to kill) and delivers a couple of very imaginative sequences that help lift it over many of his contemporaries: a topless woman ( free naked box well and properly crossed) in a lake discover that the hand that has mocked her underwater does not belong to her boyfriend; and a concise character makes out with his father's boyfriend (as a joke), unaware that the person who is slowly approaching is not his friend but the killer.
