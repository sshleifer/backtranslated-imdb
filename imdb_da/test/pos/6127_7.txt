A very strange, disturbing but exciting film. I don't think I ever need to see what a person can do with his ass, and I doubt if I will ever see it again. That said, there is much to be entertained by as Divine takes Jayne Mansfield's classic tour of "The Girl Can Not Help It" and puts meat plates between the legs of a grocery store. A gritty feels very much like a Russ Meyer movie. In general, bad acting, with the remarkable exception of divine.
