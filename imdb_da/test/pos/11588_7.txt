The sea inside a movie by Alejandro Amenabar. <br /> <br /> Almodovar has always handed the flag to Spanish cinema for years now. Amenabar reinvented genres and injected some new blood into the otherwise bad Spanish industry, now in a big gamble he switches from psychological terror to social drama, well the big ones would be, is the audience ready to embrace the swing and more importantly can he hold the flag? This is the story of Ramon Sampedro, a sailor who, in his twenties, was paralyzed by the neck into an accident at sea and his struggle with the Spanish government for the right to end his life. The story has the traces of an afternoon made for television melodrama, and the only way it will work is through words and honest ideas, and they both come in spades. Mateo Gil and Amenabar co-write in a way that the audience is not supposed to be lead-blind to the end of a death, but they are encouraged to make their own minds in the process, and it is a brilliant blow, it is not a film death, but a movie in favor of the ultimate illusions of our time Freedom. There are a few laughs that are long, like when the church comes home in a wheelchair to deconstruct Sampedro beliefs, but it is mostly a valley of tears through out, shocks come from all fronts even when you Think you're sure his father that to that point made no sense coming up with the most moving line of the whole movie. It is a heartbreaking experience especially when Sampedro seems more full of life than most people walk in the streets, and everyone around him tries to convince him of the underworld of life, even those who help him die? but when you strip a man of his dreams ?? The film is almost exclusively based on close-ups, giving a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic to Sampedro. It is a huge challenge for the actors to construct their entire performances with their eyes and eyes not lying. Bardem did not get his second Oscar nomination, probably in favor of Eastwood, but in my opinion he was the only one who could have shadowed Jammie Fox. This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck in KILLING A MOCKINGBIRD, where the play looked so effortless, and I expect Bardem to have reached the status where the line of what works and what's right has become completely blurred. I was never happy about his early work, but since Almodovar's Live Wing is on the roll, LOS LUNES AL SOL, DANCER UPSTAIRS and Oscar nominated BEFORE NIGHT FALLS made him an international star, and although he and Banderas come from the same Almodovar The background is fascinating to see how different roads they took and how Bardem has now become a real reference to Spanish cinema around the world. A golden block, 14 Goyas, jury prize in Venice and probably an Oscar with permission from CHORUS BOYS, Amenabar leader, co-author, edit and set music for a high-caliber drama, he has pulled it off ?? What about some science fiction now? If life is it anyway? ****.
