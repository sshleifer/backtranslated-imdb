or stories reminiscent of Leopold and the Loeb case, you can find this movie entertaining. The piece includes Robert Culp, with Stephen Caffrey and Garrison Hershberger as college students. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is his usual self, pretending to be deceived by the perishable students. Caffrey ("Longtime Companion", "Buried Alive") is excellent and should make several of these threatening roles. Basically, the two fraternities get tired of their demanding parents who expect nothing less than academic perfection, participation in the best schools will only be funded if they adhere. There is an excellent scene where Culp rakes Caffrey over the bullets after he gets a low class, threatens to cut off his trust, and Caffrey later tells his friend: "I hate him, I want him dead" ... <br /> <br /> Everything is not good in Beverly Hills. This is always an excellent theme. I think this movie came out in 1990 right after the Menendez killings. If you see "Menedez, a killing in Beverly Hills" and then comparing it to this movie, you can find some interesting parallels.
