Enchanting. The best time to watch this movie is once unhappy or sad. It's just so sweet, even the way white bears love the queen in secret and finally gets her, also the performance the two young actors Gerda and Kai gave. It is also music very well. The two of us will always be a combined with sad piano tones in some places giving a very touching result, and if you see both parts at once, he sees that the snow queen is not that bad. She only tries to surround herself with love in the wrong way. Evening this movie was here (first part) I only watched it because I was sorry, but I loved it a lot more and was very angry because they did not show the next part because of the Pope's funeral .. Yes, It was terribly sad for me. But when they said it would be next week, I was so glad I recorded it, and now I'm happy to have done so.
