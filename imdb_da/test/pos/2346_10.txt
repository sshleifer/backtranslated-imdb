I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen so far for naruto. The action was much better than the first movie because it had a much more battle scene and it came to you at a faster pace. it was amazing, the choreographer was excellent as well as most of the visual effects. The story is new to naruto. But it is pretty much the same as the first movie. in the series you see them fighting against other ninjas, but in the movies (1 + 2) you see them fighting against the mass destruction machine. It's nice to see them struggle with something other than ninja and that it was great to see a different power than chakra. and how other people from other country over the sea are fighting. Sakura also killed one who is stronger than her. (She's really got strong) It was much better than fillers on the series that I see now. When you watch this movie, the fast-paced action scene will surely make your heart pound. With new jutsus and garra in the movie, you know it's good. and the music was also good, but I think it lacks something. But the final theme song was a plus. (dind dong dang) I thought it was a really good song. I totally recommend it. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this movie a 10 because I just love it. If you decide to see it, enjoy it. laugh out loud
