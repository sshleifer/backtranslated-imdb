Director and co-author Alejandro Amenabar did not make things easy for the viewers of his tight, somewhat protracted but very disturbing story, precisely based on a Spanish man's struggle for self-help. "Mar Adentro" ("The Sea Inside") is poignant and its effect far exceeds the time in the theater. <br /> <br /> With the award-winning Canadian film "The Barbarian Invasions", people seeing a family along with a coterie of devoted friends prompted the desire for a beloved but irascible man to end his life. In that film, attention was exposed to progressive, incurable cancer, and his descent to a terminal stage was rapid. Emotionally as the scenes were, death was inevitable - the question was how gentle it could be through encouraged intervention. <br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro (brilliant game by Javier Bardem) is another story. For well over two decades, he has been a quadriplegic because of a diving accident. (Very sharp viewers can discover a terrible irony about why he ended up in that state because of his improvised dive.) Once a world traveler and lover of beautiful women, he is now trapped in a motionless body, his every need, as a truly devoted family who deliberately surrender much of their privacy and time to maintain their beloved relationship. <br /> <br /> Rosa (Lola Duenas), a single mother of two little boys, enters the Sampedro household out of what might have been just curiosity about learning about the suffering of the lame man, but she becomes both an emotionally supportive centerpiece for Ramon as well as an entertaining but occasional aggravating presence. A good performance of Duenas. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem is that Sampedro is not ill in the normal sense. He can live for decades more with appropriate care. So, his soft but persistent desire to end his life with "dignity" creates a moral dilemma for friends and relatives who do not surprisingly react from various ethical and religious perspectives. <br /> <br /> Ramon is the quad of a group poster dedicated to changing Spain's laws on assisted suicide. "Death with dignity" is their word. Gene (Clara Segura) is a sensitive activist who uses help from pro bono publico counsel, Julia (Belen Rueda). Julia has her own health problems that carry an indefinite but catastrophic prognosis. Fortunately, married to a devoted spouse, she connects emotionally with her client. <br /> <br /> The following is an acute-sensitive interaction between values ​​and emotions. Ramon lives with his brother and wife, their technophile teenage son, not the intellectual Ramon, and his old father, who cannot stop grieving over his son's cataclysmic descent into utter helplessness. <br /> <br /> The moral and legal issues are played through excellent plays and short vignettes, including a courtroom scene where formalism triumphs over any legal interpretation that can take into account Ramon's feelings and views. It may be Spain, but the problems live in most countries, including the United States. Particularly fun is a shouted, first floor bedroom, debate between Ramon with a drop-in, lecturing Jesuit priest, also a quadriplegic but one whose hidebound dogma masks the casual lack of a soul. Special kudos for Mabel Rivera, Ramon's sister-in-law, Manuela, for a wrenchingly authentic depiction of a strong woman holding the family together. And the same compliment goes all the way to Belen Rueda, Julia, who tells herself of an objective lawyer to close friend to a woman who scares herself against a dark fate. <br /> <br /> The director does not impose any valuations that allow each character to express his or her feelings efficiently and at times, moving across the spectrum. As "Dead Man Walking", this movie can support any view of its deadly subject. No one can stop a person from committing suicide if he / she is determined, but the universal tragedy in the world's Ramons is that without lifestyle, the life of a body where only the heart beats and only the head can move can be a phrase no court can pronounce on the most killed of criminals. <br /> <br /> The kinematics are well-adapted to history and the beautiful Galician scenes are a deliberate contrast to the limited outlook that once monstrous Ramon experiences from his special bed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
