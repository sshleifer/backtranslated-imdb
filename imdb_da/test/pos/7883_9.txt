This is a classic movie that dramatizes the situation of a man who cannot adapt to changes in society and feels more and more alienated, leading to violence. Joe is a worker and he is unhappy and angry, and all he needs is a pretext to smash out, which is the story. Joe alone is quiet; with another, he becomes deadly. And what makes Joe's character even more chilling is that he fully rationalizes his violence, so for him it is not only not bad, it is necessary. For Joe, his own violent tendencies project on those he considers "the enemy" and therefore considers himself in a war, and in this movie, the "generation gap" is depicted as a war. But it is only a war in Joe's mind because the "enemy" in this case is in his imagination. Nobody wants to fight Joe, but Joe feels he has to defend himself. Although this movie was released in 1970, the message is just as relevant now as it was when society continues to undergo major changes leading to the kind of intense alienation that the film effectively dramatizes.
