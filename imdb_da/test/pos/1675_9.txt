Or the other way around. <br /> <br /> This is a French film noir directed by an American filmmaker (Jules Dassin) who had to leave the country because of being blacklisted by Hollywood thanks to HUAC. The prerequisite for the story is quite familiar - a last jewel heist to Tony le Stephanois and his buds - and then the end to everyone is ... Well, no spoilers here, certainly, as this is the kind of movie in which excitement towards the end is important. <br /> <br /> Dassin filmed in black and white in realistic lighting on the streets of Paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous. The engaging - sometimes intrusive - score of Georges Auric nicely enhances the film and reminds less viewers of many a similar score from American films noirs from the eighties and early 50s. Jean Servais plays the hardcore, consumable lead in fedora, which Humphrey Bogart might have played him. Tony is recently out of prison, past his prime, but still tough and decisive when he needs to be, his mind is still sharp when focused, the kind of anti-hero whose eyes water, even though the tears never fall. <br /> <br /> Dassin plays the Italian safecracker and would be ladies man who knows the rules but gets careless. In film noir, we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify with the evil ones. Often there are levels of evil guys, the "good" evil guys we identify with and the "bad" bad guys who are out to do in our good villains, and then maybe there is a really bad, bad bad guy or two. (Here we have Remi Grutter, played by Robert Hossein, a slightly sadistic druggie.) Then there are the police who are irrelevant or almost so. In more modern film noir, the evil are not even "good" villains, and they come away with it or something close to it. In the old film noir, which evolved from the thirties in the gangster movies, the usual motto that followed the old Hollywood code was "Crime Not Paying", as any criminal has to pay for his crime before the end of the movie. Probably the most impressive feature of Rififi is how nicely the movie moves along. The plot unfolds quickly and smoothly, just as the big movie directors always did, directors such as Stanley Kubrick, Louis Malle and Hitchcock's best. Some have actually compared this to Kubrick's The Killing (1956) and suggests that Kubrick stole a little. Well, the steals always steal if necessary, and there may be some similarities to being "a last hoist" to the protagonist and having the girl gum up in the work. The similarities can go deeper because, as this film approaches its end, I suddenly thought, oh no! the suitcase in the back seat will fly out of the convertible, hit the ground, burst open, and all the money will fly into the air! Those of you who have seen The Killingen remember what happened to the money at the end of the movie! Which reminds me of another movie with something bad to do with the money: Oliver Stone's U Turn (1997) starring Sean Penn. There the money in the backpack is blown to the smiths by a shotgun blast. Ha, ha, ha! Getting the duplicate version of this movie would be an act of sacrilege since the dialogue (when there are some: heist himself is done completely without dialogue, about 30 minutes worth) is thick and easy to follow, requiring only an occasional look at the subtitles, which, by the way, is quite utilitarian and guiding as opposed to having every word spelled out. <br /> <br /> Another thing: All brutality is done as sex used to be done in movies that are off camera. A guy gets his neck gap. We don't see it. I'm like this approach. We don't have to see things. You can almost let your children see Rifif - almost. <br /> <br /> Catch this one now and be on the lookout for a Hollywood genre with Al Pacino and directed by Harold Becker coming out next year where you can be sure the violent scenes will be played completely out.
