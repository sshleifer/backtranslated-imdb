I have only praise for this movie. From start to finish, it caught glimpses of Stephen Sondheim's musical. I'm not a big fan of musicals, most of them are very overdone. However, this one changed me. I am an actor myself and have actully played the Sweeney and I know how hard this role is. George Hearn gave a great, masterful and rounded achievement worthy of the highest prices we can give him (He won an Emmy and that's something.) All he does is turn to gold. He is so good that it will think about why he is not into movies that win oscarer. Lansbury is also very good and very fun. Sara Woods is scary and wonderful as a beggar woman. All in all, a good video. Pick it up if you can.
