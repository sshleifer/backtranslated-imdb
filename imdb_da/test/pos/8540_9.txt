The box in my video store is why I rented this. It looked cold from the guys face in half so of course I had to try. I was pleasantly surprised when I actually saw that it was an "Evil Dead" fan. The Swedish decision makers must have been fans as well as they contained many references in this masterpiece. A criminal is trying to break into the house Evil Ed edited the movies, which ultimately drives him crazy and says "groovy" as he looks at his weapon, as Bruce Campbell does when he finishes his chainsaw's hand in Evil Dead 2. Also, many posters of the film are scattered around the house and the office of the film. They do not just condemn the Evil Dead, as there is a Gremlin scarf sample throwing on Ed in the fridge. My personal favorite is when he chases his wife around the house and says, "I'm coming to get you Barbra," as if you didn't know, Barbras's brother line is in "The Living Days Night". This movie has virtually all the good plot, cool characters, fun stuff (Gremlin puppet), scary stuff (demon doctor), excellent effects (exploding head) and a lot of female nudity. I only gave it 9 because its kind slow before Ed goes insane, but it's worth the wait. So if you liked "Evil Dead 2" or one of the other movies I mentioned above, rent and watch it with a freind, and once you've done that, "Brain Dead" is because I hear it looks like this masterpiece. <br /> <br />
