At first glance, it is another high school anime with many excuses for 'fan service', but much more is happening. "Fan service" is part of the plot, the main character is a tired cynic (unusual), and most importantly there is a smart plot that binds all the episodes together, and it raises some interesting questions. The episodes are deliberately non-chronological, and it is definitely worth seeing the series again in chronological order. The series is worth watching carefully because there are many informal hints there that foreshadow and explain things, plus a good number of inquisitions about other series, anime and others.
