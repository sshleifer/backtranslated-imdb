This British documentary recently appeared on Comedy Central during their "best of" week and can also be seen on South Park's second season DVD. I remember seeing many commercials for the DVD showing clips of this documentary, most of which appear with Matt Stone, Trey Parker and another guy in a hot tub. It was fun when I saw it in the advertisements, but I was used to seeing it when I saw the actual documentary. On the whole, "Goin Down to South Park" is a pretty fun and interesting look at how South Park episodes are made and the story goes back to when Matt and Trey came up with the idea of ​​college. However, there was something about the tone of this documentary that actually felt kind of depressing. It's not as fast, fast-fire, and as lively as the actual South Park episodes. Instead, it has a slow, dry-white style, which can sometimes be fun, but most of the time you just wait for something to happen. If you get the chance to see it, it certainly goes, but I don't think you really miss much if you never see it. <br /> <br /> My IMDb Rating: 7/10
