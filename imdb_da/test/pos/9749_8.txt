My friend gives me these 3 big boxes. "They are laserdiscs of Flash Gordon series," he says. "I want some huge coasters," I say. But not so. This serial cut. (But I had to gnaw and moan for almost everyone I knew to find a laser disc player for em). There is really a bit of everything in this series: There are lion men, hawk men, shark men, farmers, and I suppose you would call them Mongo men. The sets and costumes combine Greek, Roman, Oriental, Egyptian and even armor like English knights. Awesome costumes. And some of it was a rebellion. The horrible pantyhose with shorts over those worn by Zarkov is out of the description. And the guys in the oven seem to carry boxes. <br /> <br /> It's also fun as they renamed octopus to an octosack, orangutan to orangapoid and tiger to a tigron. There is even a dragon (a godzilla-like creature who threatens Flash a few times before being killed). <br /> <br /> You like the invisible man? This has got you covered. You like sword fighting, wrestling (both animals and men), fist battles? Lots of every taste. We have an underwater village, a sky city, a town on top of a mountain and tons of secret passages and caves. <br /> <br /> Hokey Effects? Massive quantities. The sky city is supported by radium furnaces stoked like old-time steamers. The rocket ships are "powered" by fireworks and have constant rear springs and / or humming sounds. Lots of wires are visible that keep things up (like food when Flash was invisible and of course rocket games). There are clouds out in the room, but no one around the earth when seen from Mongo. The "Giant" lizard turns out short. Fighting sea creatures seems to threaten Flash & co. on the way to shark's underwater city. "Gadgets" in Dr. Zarkov's laboratory pulled me up. And they seem to be the same, no matter which laboratory he is in (he worked in Mings laboratory and Vultan). And yes, we have romance. Everybody wants Dale; Ming, Vultan, Flash. But at least one person wanted Princess Aura (Prince Baron) just not the person she would have preferred. In fact, it appears that many of the subsets relate to the intrigue of Princess Aura's side to try to win Flash. I think the characters are awesome. The fat, horse, King Vultan was fun. How he was doing these wings was pure artistry. And Ming! What can I say about Ming? He was perfect. They should have brought him to the emperor in Starwars. Ming has to be my favorite character in this series. Princess Aura was also a little character. And she looked nice. I think she's a better actress than Dale Arden by a long shot. Even the sneaky high priest had a distinctive role. Zarkov was good, but not the strongest character --- and he always stood in the background during battle scenes that kept Dale. Now we come to Flash: Flash, of course, was the strong point, the leader, the hero --- and he did well. Crabbe is a good actor and this role is perfect for him. <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I think I know where George Lucas got the main idea for Starwars. See this, you want to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> If you ever considered seeing an old serial (or something serial for that matter), this should be your first choice. The only reason I didn't give this a 10 is because of a few narrative holes that could have been solved easily, the way the giant lizards seemed just knocked in there and a few weak characters (King of Shark Men & King of Lion) -men).
