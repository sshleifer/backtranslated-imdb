The copy of this movie I have seen is not very good. It is grainy and has almost no color in some parts. It shifts back and forth between English and French, often in the middle sentence, and sometimes even in the middle of a word! To make matters worse, there are no English subtitles under the French language parts, which I think is at least a quarter of the film. But amazingly, the film is still very understandable and enjoyable, even in this state, and I think it says a lot about how good this movie is. <br /> <br /> This is a spaghetti vest with great plays, an interesting story and an excellent music score. It also has a cool protagonist, a beautiful dark-haired girl, some weird characters and events and a general sense of melancholy. This movie has "Euro" written over it. <br /> <br /> I hope there is a pristine negative or print of this movie out there somewhere because it deserves a quality DVD release, and when it comes out, I'll be one of the first in line to get it!
