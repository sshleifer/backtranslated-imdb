"Boy Next Door" is a hilarious drum through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing --- this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis to draw dual work as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. If you thought everything he could do was play the "Bull" bailiff at "Night Court", think again. This gem of a movie highlights Stephen Garvey's great fun writing. Remember that name. Forget Charlie Kaufman, Steve Garvey is the true present king of quirky comedy.
