Very unfortunately I can relate to this movie as I am 17 and have not yet been kissed so I really feel to Josie. It has been a while since watching this movie, but to write this review I saw it again and remembered everything I loved about it. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is a great actress and this role suited her really well at that time. The chemistry between Sam and Josie was really good, and Michael Vartan was an excellent actor in this. <br /> <br /> I loved the story too - as I said up there, I could relate and it's rare to find a movie that you can totally relate to. <br /> <br /> Everywhere - I loved it. 10.7
