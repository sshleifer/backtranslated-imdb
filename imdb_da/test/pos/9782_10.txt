When I heard there was a mini-series with ABC [Australian Broadcasting Corporation] based on life in Changi [WWII POW] camp ... focusing on "elements of comedy" I was deeply skeptical and somewhat critical. /> <br /> My father had served in World War II. Such was the Japanese barbarity, he could talk about horrors in and around Labuan (where he was stationed) until only very recently. Together with my father I had the fortune of knowing many great men (with stronger character and spirit than I ever have) who had experienced acts of indescribable barbarity in the hands of Japan's empire and never completely restored. The name 'Changi' is intended to evoke horrible images in the future to come ... <br /> <br /> But on display I was very impressed with the cast, the characters and the complex plot lines of this wonderful series. I now consider 'Changi' as the highlight of my week (remember, I have only seen three episodes so far ... I hope the remaining episodes comply with the standards set by the first three). <br /> <The black humor seems extremely good (the flatulence jokes are a bit overdone), and while much of the horror has been suppressed, the series comes close to relaying the unpleasant spirit of the survivors who could later continue their lives despite the inhibitory memories. <br /> <br /> The 'flashback' format in this series will be difficult for some to follow, <br /> <br /> but I can't think of any better way to do enough justice to the men who suffered deep emotional scarring, continued detention ... when painfully oppressed experiences are remembered, sometimes years after the horror. <br /> <br /> One of the darkest chapters of World War II, the 20th century, and (I would go as far as to say), in the history of mankind, is being forwarded to a new generation through this series, and I hope it serves to resell the overwhelming adversity that the war generates. <br /> <br /> In the future "Changi" I don't think I will ever be able to listen to the exciting song "on the way to Gundagai" in the same way again.
