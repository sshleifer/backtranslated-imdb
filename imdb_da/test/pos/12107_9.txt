This movie gives you a fascinating tour through one of the most exciting cities today - Istanbul - and its musicians. Don't expect a collection of Turkish folklore or anything like that. Alexander Hacke, a German musician and member of the cult band "Einst√ºrzende Neubauten" travels to Istanbul to get to know the music. His scant voice over what he experiences is a guide through the movie. But mainly German-Turkish director Faith Akin lets different artists from Istanbul do the talking - and of course their music. <br /> <br /> You meet a wide variety of personalities, great stars and street musicians, young and old, who play many different musical styles. But this movie not only introduces you to the sound of Istanbul. It also draws a convincing picture of Istanbul today and how Turkey has forged in the last decade. The film characterizes its main characters with subtle humor, but never without respect. Everyone shares a passion for music and faith in its power. <br /> <br /> Again, Akin shows his talent for portraying diversity as he brings you close to different musical scenes. After his award-winning feature film Gegen die Wand, Faith Akin proves with "Crossing the Bridge" that he can just as much touch, entertain and lead his audience in a documentary. If you have never been to Istanbul, you would like to go there after watching the movie.
