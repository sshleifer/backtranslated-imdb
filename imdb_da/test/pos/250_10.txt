"Cover Girl" is the best musical Rita Hayworth ever made. Ms. Hayworth will always be remembered for "Gilda", but the next movie would be "Cover Girl". The story is amazing. It's about a dancer who wants to be a girl and makes it big in the show business. She does it without the help of her talented dancer / instructor girlfriend (Gene Kelly). Mr. Kelly gets the chance to choreograph the songs. The dancers are spectacular. It's fun to see Phil Silvers, a comic book, making music tracks with Mrs. Hayworth and Mr. Kelly. <br /> <br /> The support molding is perfect. Lee Bowman gets the chance to be an interesting third wheel, the second boyfriend.
