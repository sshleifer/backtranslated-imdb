One of the best known occult-oriented horror films from the 70s. It is gritty, exciting, scary, surreal here and there and at the moment even very smart, which cannot be said of many of the films of this kind. I can't help seeing some stinging symbolic and metaphorical points in the 70's societies and generations from the time this movie was made. The scriptwriter has, of course, been cooking while he also provided some good old "from the crypt" kind of scenes. With a well done work from a creative director, the result is entertaining and thoughtful. The simple yet effective conclusion shows especially how these things are treated properly by those who can. The excellent cast was best known to me, except LQ Jones as the moody, but funny Sheriff and Strother Martin as the city physician. Martin, not surprisingly, always ends up stealing the movie. With that voice and skill, he is nevertheless one of the greatest loonies in movies. What an actor! <br /> <br /> So it's a little mystery to me why this movie has not gained much more recognition. I think it would deserve almost equal space in the occult horror gun along with Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. A helluva movie!
