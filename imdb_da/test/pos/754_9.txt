If somebody ever collects a compendium on modern American horror that is really worth it is salt, * should be * an entry for SF Brown's ubiquetous exercise in Asylum Horror. Every time I watch this movie, I am impressed by the film's complete economy, from the compact, completely independent plot with an enigmatic beginning and an overly horrible ending, the exciting notions of what was essentially a group of non-professional actors and a previous sense of fear and claustrophobia that effectively consumes the fool with some inevitability, which is more frightening, because viewers know what goes on long before the hero, with the only question when do they wake up and smell the coffee? <br /> <br /> Shot of a tooth tissue budget in Brownrigg's homely Texas by an ancient palace history, serving nicely as a setting for a private sanatorium, DO NOT SEE IN THE BASEMENT another exciting twist on the good old Edgar Allan Poetome on inmates who take over asylum just before an otherwise "normal" outsider inadvertently joins the line without realizing until it is too late that not everything is what it seems they are completely cut off and outside help, and Inevitably find their own insane questioning that madness is out of control - The original STAR TREK TV series had a ride on this with their WHOM GODS DESTROY episode from 1968, Juan Moctezuma gave the case a peyote burnt Mexican psychedelic tour in the DR. TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON in 1972 and tangentially related is Fernando Di Leo's ASYLUM EROTICA / SLAUGHTER HOTEL, which injects the elements into an unknown killer and an end that can only be defined as "Splatter Cinema" - Brown rig must not have seen or thought of SLAUGHTER HOTEL, but he certainly came up with some similar ideas. Legaliciuo's former Playboy Playmate Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale, RN in Clinical Psychology, who has just left her quirky job as a counselor at a large hospital to travel out in the middle of some godly waste right out of a Peckinpah movie to work together with a Dr. Stevens at his private sanatorium. Dr. Stevens has pioneered a new form of therapy based on the basically encouraging ones emotionally and mentally scared to meet their inner obsessions, bring them to the surface and hopefully release the patients from what has fried their sense of reasoning. Good idea, but to awaken a 6ft 250 pound insane man with an ax and tell him to smooth out his aggression and then get you back on him is probably not the smartest idea, and Dr. Stevens is shipped before Mrs Holotik herself appears on the screen with the good part of his skull. <br /> <br /> This event effectively leaves the sanatorium in the hands of a Geraldine Masters [actress Annabelle Weenick, who also served as script supervisor & production manager], a woman with exciting professional behavior who quickly destroys the situation with Sam , the movie's wonderfully unlikely hero, a lobotomized African American boheomouth, played by an actor named Bill McGhee, who unfortunately was robbed of a supporting Oscar nomination for his turn as a muscle mass with an 8-year-old boy's brain. Sam's one desire is to get someone to help him put his valued toy boat "in the water" and his continued request for the various female cast members to do so [and his uninterrupted consumption of chocolate poplar] as * SUMMER * kind of underlying theme although we want to avoid this because the children can still be up. There is also a quick subplot about an employee who has decided to leave after being threatened by one of the patients, but I will leave the details of this for your discovery. <br /> <br /> Wife. Holotik comes just like Dr. Stevens has been put to rest and has been quickly won by the naughty professionalism of Mrs Masters, who reluctantly allows the young young nurse to stay in spite of the tragedy that has just happened, MINUTES AGO, which you must admit, was a bit sporting of her. Holotic Nurse Beale begins to demonstrate symptoms of not being the sharpest meat cleavage in the drawer, but when she is informed that she shares living quarters with a bunch of maniacs, and there are no locks on the doors and does not pull off the closest aces Hardware Store to grab a hasp and padlock to secure himself and we are treated with a couple of really scary scenes where some of the inmates sneak into her room and do things that smell her hair, trying to kill her with butcher knives and caress her neck with ax heads. But it is quite part of the work in such a radically psychiatric health environment, mrs. Master informs her, and she goes about her strangely defined "rounds" consisting of wearing legs that define a nurse outfit that you can find in a 42nd Street fetish boutique and get to know the inmates. <br /> <br /> Allysson is an obsessive compulsive nymphomaniac with homicidal tendancies who like to take off her shirt and give the movie some T&A between fit for histrionics; Harriet is a young former mother who lets her child die in a stupid accident and now dots on a beaten old doll that she is also homicidally protective; Seargant is an actual seargeant [and implied Vietnam veterinarian] whose negligence led to the death of his plutons, and now looks from the window with binoculars for the access of an invisible enemy; Jennifer is a Phish fan who could not score a ticket for New Year's Eve and went crazy and likes to scarf down nembutols and other barbituates when no one looks, and also has hidden homicidal tendencies associated with her inability to find a bra ; Judge Cameron is apparently a homicidal pervert who was obsessed with his own sense of power and now likes to chop things up with axes; Ms. Callingham is an aged poet who serves as a kind of soothsaying old hag from MACBETH before the cat gets his tongue; and Danny is an insane idiot who was included in cast as the random element that the plot cannot control and whose antics serve as the real catalyst for the series of tragedies and murders that ultimately take place in this dark, old , creepy house in the middle of nowhere. The house itself is a wonderful set, with a tremendous beginning of the 1970s d√©cor that is remarkably infinite, with a stunning color color achieved with subtle ambient lighting. The house is a series of hallways and rooms with shiny brown wooden floors, twisting, enclosed stairs, separated cupboards and passages that lead to the various larger areas, and of course the basement mentioned in the title - visited only once, but boy is it probably showing up to be a doozy! I love the frosted old freezer, where Sam holds his stump of popsicles, the ordinary exterior that reminds me of a cottage that our family used to visit every year and force us to swell in the heat: All are covered with pearls of perdition and looks exhausted, and even the always cheerful Sam at some point begins to suspect that bad things are happening, even though he does not understand what that means, and Rosie H. is too firm in her belief in her profession to herself suspicion of what really happened and while Mrs Holotik's limitations of an actress may have reduced the effectiveness of her great revelation scene, she is a great screamer when the whole hell begins to break loose and Brownrigg pampered with some great camera pictures of her in various suggestive situations or stages of dressing it show off what a beautiful lady she is without exposing anything more than her contract stipulated. Too bad! The real show steals Sam and fans of what I have been referring to as the Splatter Cinema will not be disappointed with the rather shocking final, and there is something to move about how Sam runs to protect his friend and brutally kills everyone before for headroom within seconds, which either suggests that he was a mediocre motha before his lobotomy, or the movie is CUT. In any case, you won't be prepared for the end the first time you see it, even if you as the viewer know what the point is long before someone else in the movie puts it together. <br /> <br /> Except for one person: Rhea MacAdams' uproariously stereotypical old coot Mrs. Callingham [who seems to be inspired by Donald Sutherland's Old Woman character from Michael Reeves' 1964 Christopher Lee movie CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD in addition to a pretty nasty death with round spike to the eye], which not only predicts the future but has most laugh loudly entertaining bit of dialogue while you go for a walk in the garden with Mrs. Holotik running something like this - <br /> <br /> "It's really beautiful out here. Do you go out a lot, Mrs Callingham?" asks Holotik as the old woman answers <br /> <br /> "You are the one to come out." <br /> <br /> Hilarious, and one of the things you need to see is seeing "get" yourself. Look at the base is available on at least half a dozen "bargain bin" code-free DVD releases by companies such as Brentwood Home Video, Diamond Entertainment, VCI and Platinum Disc Corp.'s HORROR CLASSICS series; I like Alpha Video's sexually gorgeously decorated 2003 $ 6 release: <br /> <br /> Dig through these negotiating trays! But be sure to get one with the 89/90 minute printed content therein; An older 83 minute version is completely confusing because of some of the trimming, and you really need to see the final credits that are meant to bring this sick, twisted and surprisingly entertaining yarn to its end. <br/> <br /> Masterpiece? Maybe not compared to THE EXORCIST or ROSEMARY'S BABY, but it's a very unique American horror movie and a true classic of the drive-in age that deserves to be rediscovered by anyone looking for something made with more than just a little bit of brain juice and not a penny more than they absolutely needed. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 out of ****
