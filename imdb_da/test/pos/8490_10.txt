Jamie Foxx leads a brilliant cast in this powerful journey through the life of the blind, emotionally troubled, African American genius pop jazz, Mr. Ray Charles. Although the entire molding is wonderful, Mr. Foxx more than just an Oscar. If it were possible to appoint an actor for consecutive years, I would consider doing so for Mr. Foxx. Foxx doesn't just play Charles, he creates him again. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve special mention for their depiction of Ray's mother (the inspiration of his life) and young Ray. These two gave the strongest support in the film. The dramas of Charles's battle with guilt, the death of his younger brother and mother, blindness, discrimination, addiction, and success have been woven into tapestries of his music. The music is beautiful, the manuscript is as far as I can tell perfectly, and the play is nothing short of legendary. <br /> <br /> The film's direct-oriented method guarantees discussion. Taylor Hackford - a director, I am generally ambivalent about - had to choose which aspects of Charles Charles' greater and final life story would tell his story honestly, dramatically, and understandably. Although some disagree (apparently wanting a documentary instead of a dramatized biopic), I think he chose his themes admirably. Much of the success of this movie is its consistent focus on some persistent themes in Charles's life - his deep love and respect for his mother, his need to be loved and accepted, his addiction and guilt complex, his musical genius, and his deep-seated fear of responsibility for others. Charles is depicted as a man fighting fiercely against an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could have imagined one of the men I used to listen to on my old album with my father in his living room on Sunday night, while football matches were on television. And nothing was sugar-coated in "Ray". The themes are presented with power and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama that spans the length of his long and enlightened life. The power of these themes, the powerful script and direction, the music and the play make this one of the most enjoyable and evocative biographical movies I've seen. Recommended to everyone.
