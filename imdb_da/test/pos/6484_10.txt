My first review on IMDB, after some years of using this site all the time ... <br /> <br /> Anyway saw this on the tube the second night, loved it. It is in the mind of a dangerous road or a replacement, but much better. I was sure for a moment that Rex was Speedy Levitch in Waking Life, but after checking it didn't look like it. <br /> <br /> I can see why many people have problems with this plot and its poetry, but I also believe that these people are dense. Admittedly, the end was not quite what I had hoped for, but in general it was so unique and well-behaved, I cannot complain. I would not call this cheesy as a reviewer did, drew it from the scene better than most movies from the 80s did. And they refrained from playing any really datable 80 music. <br /> <br /> Can't remember everything that made me smile when I saw this, but basically it showed realistically very creative individuals surrounded by mediocrity and whether or not I share Rex's beliefs. original attempts to describe the meaning of life. And his mutant theory is, to my knowledge, original. He also hit a lot, but they showed how confused he was at times, and why he might have some psychological problems. And then in his clear moments he was a philosopher extraordinary, a person who saw the small details of life and tried to express them. <br /> <br /> I was also very impressed with John Savage as a teacher. Normally, actors fail in that role. He pulled it brilliantly off. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Waking Life, I say, watch this movie if you get a chance. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> hp
