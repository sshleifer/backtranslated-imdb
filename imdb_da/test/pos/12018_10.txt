This is one of the movies that for some reason just clicks on me. Everything about it is right. Eric Roberts laconic, nice investigator, his voiceover story, twisted plot, Dan Hedaya and Denis Lipscomb gave good roles, the settings, the paintings in the artist studio scenes, the end-circle sequence and the wonderfully joking theme music that perfectly encapsulates the mood of the whole movie. If I have any reservations, it's about Beverly D'Angelo's femme fatale, but she's beautifully playing her final scenes. I think Director Matthew Chapman was trying to get some kind of "Chinatown" to feel it all. It did not work. But as a murder mystery, it is a gem.
