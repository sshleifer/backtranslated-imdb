Don't forget your girlfriend on the page !! She is a 'hottie', Karen Parsons is delicious, she is wonderful, in acting and beauty and style. It's just his job! HO, now it's a show that writing swallows you in the intestines and as you double, you kick in the butt! By quoting Peter's wife (The Associate / Writer / Producer), when they looked at the "previews" to come up with "new" shows at an ABC network party, she looked at her husband after the previve for "job" one played and said, "It doesn't look like anything else on this network. You're in trouble." Meaning, it looks very good! But it doesn't look like the regular "shiny happy people sitcom" fare or over-hair-style drama that they (ABC) regularly enjoy to put on "Air". From the time I saw this, after the first episode finished, I made sure I didn't miss this time slot next week. I was immediately dependent on "The Job" Cutting wit and cynicism, outrageous situations, and laughing writers making this series a hit !! <br /> <br /> Then I felt anger and a sense of failure that the show just sailed out of the air. I wondered which leader decided to tear down a big comedy cornerstone for their network? <br /> <br /> I talked to other people about some knowing, some not, but I know that the stupid network does not promote it hard enough or I should say visually enough. If they had, it would have run at least 3-5 seasons, maybe even six. I just think you know network cards and are far too subscribed to a 'formula' or another that they missed the boat with this one. There was so much room for expansion, it was hardly just beginning. The situation was fun and serious, fast and sometimes slow, but not much, it kept a good pace. some years later I finally found it on dvd new for $ 50.00. For me it would be worth $ 1,000.00 to have this in my entertainment library. I looked surprised when I went through both seasons again for the third time on the DVD and the end 'Treason' episode, went into a totally serious drama segment with those who revealed a murder victim, it was better than most of the drama victim Unity 'and' cop 'shows on the air now !!! They went into the scene as seriously as a heart attack and as credible it did not even strike a blow. Just as it was supposed to be serious, I am so impressed with the "versatile ways" that Tolan and Leary shared in the stories and scriptures. In another disgrace of the "entertainment week" I learned that the beautiful wardrobe, silk ribbons and expensive suits with pressed shirts and ultra style footwear ... were sold to the film made for cable "In the cut" (2003) for only four hundred dollars, is it !!! ! I am sick. Did you see what they all have on each show ?? A good over coat alone could run so much. <br /> <br /> This was Denis Leary at some of his finest. I recommend this great cop 'dramedy' for east coasters or anywhere you are in the country. I even heard that people from Ireland were fun with the Leary 'Bathroom' episode and repeated lines back to him from one because they saw it over there. (****) An extremely intuitive, comical New York Leary / Tolan cop Show.
