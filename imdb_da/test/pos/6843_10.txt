The efforts of a new group of young talents with Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, 2 highly gifted actors, create an exciting and exciting evening entertainment. And I can add that Hal Holbrook shines as a senator. This movie deserves five stars. I give it a ten on your scale. And the end is PERFECT. I am constantly amazed by the British players' ability to master our American accents. I was convinced that all the actors were born in Louisiana. And what nicer locale to a mystery than New Orleans! The Big Easy, also known as Crescent City, permeates every scene. As author and director, Sebastian Gutierrez deserves great praise.
