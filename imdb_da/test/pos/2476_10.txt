I saw pp the second night. I have to say I was very impressed with how the real movie seemed. It felt a lot like a documentary. I also think the film presented realistic possibilities. In the film, the war in Vietnam escalates to the point where China has become involved. What if it had happened? I think the scenarios would look like the one depicted in the movie. We have had camps before in this country ... and still do ... <br /> <br /> Recommended to everyone ... especially radicals ... <br /> <br /> I said that if I was in the position that these children were in that I just wanted to put my ass out. I love America and its great wars (flash blink)
