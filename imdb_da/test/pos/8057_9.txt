To see the fictional biography "The Phenix City Story", I say you have to enter fields where American filmmakers rarely have game, director Phil Karlson has received his directorial task at "The Untouchables" TV-mega-hit series largely based on "Kansas City Confidential" and this film; And it has become one of the most admired and imitated films ever made. The rarest feat for American filmmakers seems to be the completely centered targeted anti-crime film or television series; I remind the observer of how much "Cain's Hundreds" and "Hardcastle and McCormicks" and even "Untouchables" producers had to work to produce anything but episodes largely attributed to criminal unfictional activities instead of their ethical opponents. This powerful, seminal and very gritty movie has a style of its own; and its lesson seems to pay attention to details of opponents and victims of criminal organizations as well as their gang members. There is a twelve-minute prelude to the film, where reporter Clete Roberts interviews the real Alabama City participants who had fought against their corrupt vice gangs. The problem grew out of the presence of Fort Benning across the river and the nearly century-long existence of vice-caves in the area. The film describes John Patterson's return from Germany, where he has been accused. His father, defeated by lawyer in Alabama, refuses to participate in his practice of 14th Street Vicelords despite several provocations, including a blow of his son, claimed by Patterson on his plagues. There are several well-developed characters, including Ellie, working in one of the clubs and her honest boyfriend, leader of the syndicate, Patterson's and John's wife Ed Gage, vicelords operations, and Zeke Ward, an honest black man victim of his opposition to them. The cinematography of Harry Neumann and the art direction of Stanley Fleischer is in B / W and is much like news movies and adds the realistic power of the film. Music by Harry Sukman contributes effectively to the movie. Author Daniel Mainwaring and Crane Wilbur produced a quick and fair story divided into parts. Part 1 illustrates the vicelords empire inside one of their clubs, showing the fate of a victim beaten and then retrieved by the police in Mob's pay. In the second part, Albert Patterson refuses to oppose the leader of the Mob, the intelligent Rhett Tanner. In part three, young Patterson turns back and after several incidents, including having to beat Mob's star to avenge his own blow, decides to drive his father to the State Justice Minister. His wife is horrified; and Mob kills Zeke Ward's daughter and dumps the body in Patterson's house with a warning that his children will be next. A few more such incidents, including the loss of an attempt where Pattersons prove that the goon killed a friend of theirs who had found the car implicated in the murder of the little girl and see the investigation unintentionally, convince Patterson to run, and he wins the democratic state nomination despite Mob's statistics tactics - and is immediately murdered. John Patterson stops a vigilante crowd from starting open warfare with the 14th Street mob and using their voices to call the capital and demanding martial law for Phenix City. The clubs are closed and equipment confiscated, but not before the girl is murdered by Mob's goon, and Patterson must be stopped by Zeke Ward from killing Tanner instead of handing him over to the law. The end of the drama is optimistic; but the forecast for the city is less sanguine than painted; The mob actually tried to come back and moved to Tennessee. In this well-acted classic of anti-crime filmmaking, Richard Kiley is young but very strong as Patterson, it plays without accent. John McIntyre as his father is very good, while Edward Andrews as Boss Tanner is price caliber. Others in the cast include Kathryn Grant as the girl inside, Ellie, Jean Carson and Kathy Marlowe as Mob's women, John Larch as their goon, Biff Mcguire as the young victim, James Edwards as Zeke Ward, Lenka Peterson as John's wife and some good character actors as towns and mob bosses. It is I propose hard to say enough good things about realism and the lack of alignment in this movie; It's definitely one of Phil Karlson's best instructions. Karlson also made "The Scarface Mob" later "Walking Tall" as well. An eye-catching and inspiring look at the ease with which compassionate citizens of a public interest democracy can acquire tyranny, and how a few honest men can teach them the need to fight for their rights.
