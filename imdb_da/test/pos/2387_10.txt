I loved the movie "Eddie Monroe". The movie had all the components that kept me interested while I saw it. I especially loved the plot twists along the way and the surprising end. Craig Morris has Brad Pitt's potential in both appearance and talent. His blue eyes reminded me of Paul Newmans. Fred Carpenter took this film to a new level. I loved the cast. Music scores, movies, talent, places and script were awesome. I loved seeing some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. Fred Carpenter is an incredibly talented and gifted director. He gives his work 200%. The film has great texture. I hope there will be an Eddie Monroe 2. I would love to see how Nicolette shows up after getting her blow off money. Fred Carpenter's Eddie Monroe is a Hollywood level.
