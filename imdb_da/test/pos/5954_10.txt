As a French, I found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype that is made by French as such, by some standard Westerners, by Spy films, etc. And also by many other things along the way ... I've already seen it 3 times, and every time I discovered new things and laughed at tears ... Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Béjo, Aure Atika the director and all they threw, made the whole crew a great job. This movie is fun but is much more than it: it has many levels to it. You laugh because of simple gags, because of some critics made with humor (the movie is brave enough to be critical) because of physical comedy because you believe in the characters, etc. ... Aesthetic and musical is also a success . Go see it if you can.
