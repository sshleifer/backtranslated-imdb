Perhaps I am one of the only avid horror fans who believe that the recent overload of Asian shockers is so overheated! Movies like "Ringu" or "The Eye" ?? who is praised all over the world ?? simply did not convince me and they looked more boring than scary. Well, this silly opinion does not go to the South Korean pearl "A Tale of Two Sisters". This is a stylish and completely complex psychological terror story that really comes under your skin! The reason for a local folklore story can be a bit confusing to get this movie listed among the greatest genre reproductions, but the atmosphere and excitement certainly evoke feelings of great respect. This is one of the few films that is impossible to notice: The events of "Two Sisters" qualify as mind-bending horror as well as intense family drama and a deep psychological portrait. Besides a fascinating story, "A tale of two sisters" also has all the great elements that I feel, usually lacking in Asian horror films such as compelling music, good acting and innovative camera work. The mansion was the family events that take place, are excellently illustrated as a truly eerie place where secrets and dangers lurk behind every door. Several sequences (like the dinner with relatives or the nocturnal appearance in the girls' room) are basically the ultimate in annoyance. They really made me feel uncomfortable and I like to believe I've seen my share of spooky horror. "A Tale of Two Sisters" is a fantastic movie adventure and a must see for Asian movie fanatics. A small warning for people with a short attention, though: this movie forces you to keep your eyes and ears focused on all the time. It's also a movie that requires repetitive viewing, though no one will ever "get it" to a full 100%.
