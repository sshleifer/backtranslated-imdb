Great movie from the late 1970s. Much about corporate corruption at the expense of the common person so that the powerful can win big gains and ignore the environment and security of others. <br /> <br /> Almost 30 years later, this movie is convincing about the power of some companies that have been given ten times their ability to control since the release of the movie; It shows the need to regulate the public against powerful business interests whose primary goal is profit. Jack Lemmon is brilliant - while Jane Fonda and Micheal Douglas are just as convincing in their roles. The frivolous 70s who are cursed too much, redeem this movie the decade. <br /> <br /> A movie that gets better after a while.
