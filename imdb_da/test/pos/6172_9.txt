I've been a devoted IMDB visitor for a couple of years. This is the movie that eventually forced me to write in a review. <br /> <br /> I caught this movie by chance (the opening points passed when I turned my television in the morning). I thoroughly enjoyed the movie for many reasons, all of which have been well covered by other reviewers - the mood, the forgotten history of the Czech pilots, the subtle charm of the supporting characters, the fatalism of the protagonists, and the first person viewing during battle scenes. But the element of "Dark Blue World" that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects, especially during battle (and that's a good thing!). While the pilots fled in battle, there were no musical scores that were accompanied by them, no manipulative shots of worried spouses / lovers were interwoven, each tiny air maneuver did not evoke trite patriotic bowls, and viewers were not asked to swallow incredible James. Bond-esque pilot heroics. Instead, the audience feels melancholy, fear and isolation of these single pilot warriors while trying to stay high during battle. As comrades are shot down, we are spared from tearful sleeve and the typical (but audience pleasing) revenge-based heroines. Instead, the other pilots obviously and clearly see the fate of their co-pilot - in fact, they must still be strongly focused on their own safety and goals at the same time. We only briefly experience breathing of the breathing and the background roar of the engine as we, the audience, testify of a friend's spiral quietly down to his death. And then we must immediately 'we' jump back into battle mode and focus on survival. <br /> <br /> Too often in Hollywood, we are blaming the feelings we need to feel, and there is no room for the viewers' imagination. "Dark Blue World" maintains a frugality that captures and involves the viewer so we can invest in the movie and fill the gaps and gaps through our own thoughts and feelings. Excellent movie, worth seeing.
