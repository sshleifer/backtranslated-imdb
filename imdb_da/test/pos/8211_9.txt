All the comments made to date on this movie are negative, but I have to say that I found "The Net" engaging. Few movies can keep me on the edge of my seat, but it did. Another plus for that is that most actions / excitement movies are full of language, but one had little profanity. I found it a fun movie to watch. However, I'm a little biased, but is a great Sandra Bullock fan. *blink*
