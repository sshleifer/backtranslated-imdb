This movie was better than I expected. I don't think it deserved an R-rating, though. I've seen PG-13 movies with worse language and violence. I found this movie entertaining and I enjoyed it. If you are a person who dissects everything, you may find it very wrong, but if you take it to its face, I think you find it entertaining.
