This is easily the best movie version of William Faulkner's fiction, which I have ever seen, and I have seen several of the most prominent. Filmed in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, it really captures Jefferson and Yoknapatawpha County. Intruder in Dust is not one of Faulkner's best novels, but even though it is a clich√© to say this, it would be the crown jewel of another's career. It beats Harper Lee well, but simplified killing a mockingbird fifty feet in the ground (I read one in ninth grade and that's exactly where it belongs). Two of Faulkner's most prominent characters play big parts in the movie, Gavin Stevens and Lucas Beauchamp. Stevens is probably the most common character in all of Faulkner's fiction. He is a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator, because unlike many of his other characters, Stevens is a logic man, not feeling (at least when he is older). Lucas Beauchamp may be the most prominent of all Faulkner's black characters (he plays a major role in one of Faulkner's outgoing masterpieces, Go Down, Moses); Unlike all the other black people in Yoknapatawpha, he refuses to bow to any white man. He has pride, and many in the white population find that an executable quality in a black man. One day, Lucas is standing over a dead white man with a newly fired gun in his possession. Most of Jefferson and the surrounding areas do not see the need for a trial, and everyone is absolutely certain that Beauchamp will be lynched before evening's or at least the next day when the murder and arrest took place on a Sunday. Beauchamp, on the other hand, declares his innocence and tries to get Stevens to help him. Stevens refuses; the case seems open and closed. But his young nephew, Chick Mallison, because Lucas had helped him in the past, is willing to help him now. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, no Hollywood movie from this era of racism is as obvious as this. Hollywood movies rarely pursue the black population, but rather prefer to refer them to roles. If you are an African American actor, you might as well give up and accept the role of either mom, girl, servant, or concierge, for that is the only way you want to work. In Intruder in the Dust, one of the most memorable non-portraits is found by a black actor, Lucas Beauchamp. And Beauchamp, as I have described above, is not a stereotypical character, and perhaps it has been difficult for the audience to accept. Even today black characters are usually simple, magical and friendly. The latest arthouse here far from heaven is a good example of that. Beauchamp is sweet and he is very stubborn. Although he may be a little less so here than he is in the novel, he is not a kind of stereotype. He is a complex man. Juano Hernandez plays Beauchamp extremely well. I haven't seen the movie for a while, but he is also seen in Robert Aldrich's 1955 movie, Kiss Me Deadly, as well as the cinematic adaptation of Faulkner's last novel, The Reivers. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great in the movie. I should also like to praise quickly Claude Jarman Jr., who has the great role of Chick Mallison. The novel takes place from its point of view, and he is the conventional one entirely from the picture. Jarman is an actor; He captures the character (which also appears elsewhere in Faulkner's fiction, for example, tells events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel The Town). He would appear in another major role next year in the underrated John Ford movie Rio Grande. The only other movie by Clarence Browns that I have seen is National Velvet, a completely different picture than Intruder in the Dust. His job here is unusual; I really have to credit him to catch Faulkner perfectly. Other famous Faulkner adaptations are too melodramatic (The Long Hot Summer, filmed in 1958, which I really like despite it) or too cold (Tomorrow, filmed in 1972, which I dislike, the coldness is a complete misunderstanding of Faulkner). The only other that really does well, depending on its source material, is Douglas Sir's great 1958 film of Pylon (truly another kind of Faulkner novel entirely), Tarnished Angels. 10/10.
