Despite some truly scenic oriental sites and some occasionally energetic music by Franco Micalizzi, this movie does not reach the level of Joe D'Amato's similar efforts while staying just as trashy. The author of the original book "Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman", Emmanuelle Arsan, instructed and had a small role in this movie, which mostly shows pornographic a very young Annie Belle, which she gets in a variety of oddballs sexual situations. Her boyfriend, played by ZOMBIE's Al Cliver, actually approves to sleep around and even persuades her to continue her practice even after the two are married! Orso Maria Guerrini drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married to two women, one of whom is played by Arsan himself. Even though you start promising and have a couple of hilarious lines like "can you see me with the naked eye?" ... "I can see you better naked!", Shifts the film plotslessly to the less than spectacular finale. Like D'Amato's EMANUAL AND THE LAST CANNIBALS, the protagonists are all looking for some lost tribe, but don't get your hopes there is no violence in this movie, and not much sex for that matter. Just a lot of nudity and stupid dialogue. I couldn't help but find any gratitude for this little movie, if only for the wholly cornball logic that the movie goes by.
