Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) a rich woman discovers her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman (Eva Mendes). She doesn't know what to do and friends, Sylvia Fowler (Annette Bening), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) and Alex Fisher (Jad Pinkett Smith) are trying to help. <br /> <br /> OK - there was no reason to restore the 1939 movie. It is a true classic and does not need to be updated and redone. Of course it was done. This has got some of the worst reviews I have ever seen for a movie. I love the original and have seen it many times - I constantly compared it to it. Now this is not a classic, but it's not that bad. <br /> <br /> ** MINOR SPOILERS !!! ** First the bad - the story is old and was (poorly) updated. Really - a man who cheats his wife is hardly shocking today. Meg Ryan (a wonderful actress) is quite awful here. Her face does not seem unable to change expression! I couldn't believe how badly some of her scenes came over. Eva Mendes is also bad - but it's not quite her fault. Her role is poorly written and she has to compete with Joan Crawford from the original. Smith's character (a hard lesbian) breaks into a workplace. It's fun ... but it shows that a strong woman immediately breaks when confronting an emergency. Also, the script inserts some clumsy passages where Ryan speaks to his daughter about being yourself. In these moments, it seems more like a lifetime film than anything else. <br /> <br /> Now it's good - this movie preserves the originals' decision to NEVER show a man on the screen. This movie is about and for women - men are not needed (BTW - I'm a man). Bening is just amazing as Fowler - when she is on the screen, the movie makes a good leap. Also Smith is just amazing - she exaggerates (or underplays) her lesbian character too much. Brass is also good, but she is not so much. Bette Midler is just hysterical in a small role, and Cloris Leachman pulls out a housekeeper's role. The direction is also good - especially during a fashion show. I heard director Diane English apparently had a lot of trouble managing his first full-length movie, but it doesn't show up in the end product. There are also some clever references to the original (mostly certain lines) that were inserted without fuss. <br /> <br /> I saw this in an audience full of women (there were a few guys but not many) and they loved it. The film ends in an operating room sequence that everyone had howling. So - it wasn't necessary, but it's not the disaster people say it is. Also - people say we don't need a movie with all women. Well - why not? I see lots of movies with all the guys in the cast and no complaints about it! Ignore the complaints and bad reviews and see this. With a better performance by Ryan, I could have given this a 8 or 9, but as it is, I can only give it a 7.
