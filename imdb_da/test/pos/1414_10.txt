An introspective look at the relationship between Hawking and the space / time quota. This film expands the Galilean and Newton laws and relates to Einstein's general theory of relativity. <br /> <br /> The film is methodically directed and exposes details of the man (Hawking) as well as his work (Black Holes). Interviews with his family are a little too long, so unfortunately there is less development of his theories and ideas. <br /> <br /> A Philip Glass soundtrack complements beautiful film. Only another man could compose such haunting tunes (Jean Michel Jarre). On the whole, I strongly recommend this movie based on Hawking's 'nuggets of wisdom' and his appropriate explanation of an Event Horizon!
