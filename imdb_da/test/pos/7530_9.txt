I just watched this movie and I have to say it surprised me. It was very well done, with good acting and a deep look at high school students from Japan, in youth love. The look is very different from many movies, and you can easily get into the movie. Much of the weight seems to be in the story itself, which is extremely subtle. The main theme and relationship with other characters is a bit complex. But the overall sense of realism and dimensions still draws you. <br /> <br /> Of course, one main feature is those who like something simple. Which is not here. You need to be open to many things, including a new culture, to get more into the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. It's worth seeing.
