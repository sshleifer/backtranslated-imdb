This movie is a work of pure class from start to finish, for a moment forget the famous 28 minute no dialogue hoist, forget that it's set in Paris and forget it's Noir. The film itself, the prerequisite and the performance make this a pure gold experience. It is sharp intelligent and well thought out in detail, just like the hoist itself. It depicts true characters that are not only credible, but who you empathize with. It's a movie that doesn't glamorize the notion of robbery, but shows it for what it is ... theft. It shows that a heist is hard work and ultimately not worth doing. Now, all things also considered a bold 28-minute sequence with not a word count and put in beautiful Paris with great attention to detail and fantastic filmography and the last scene ... when you look up and see the trees ... wonderful use of raw and basic film techniques ... it's a masterpiece in my opinion and I'm happy to have seen it.
