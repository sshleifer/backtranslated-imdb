I just watched the DVD and loved it. I especially thought the director and Jude and Nicole did a great job of kissing between Inman and Ada just before Inman left. It was the most romantic kiss I've ever seen in a movie. I thought it was crucial to set the tone for the rest of the movie; It managed to make it credible that Inman and Ada would go / wait for each other for all the time without ever having had a relationship. I thought the movie managed this crucial plot point much better than the book itself. I'm sure many of you will be quick to name other movie kits as best this one, but this one is for me! Jude and Nicole had shown incredible chemistry in the few scenes they had together.
