This story, documenting the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unite the empire, was the most expensive film production in Chinese history. It's worth every penny. Visually dazzling filmography, a sweeping score and excellent characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (alien or otherwise.) Don't miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
