I just watched this, an early Harold Lloyd short film, presenting his "glasses" character on Kino Video's DVD of "The Harold Lloyd Collection". In fact, he is a man with Snub Pollard as his partner, who is discovered by Bebe Daniels, who himself performs false missions. What she discovers is that Lloyd and Pollard bilk many customers by losing false "lost" rings. I'll stop there and just say that this was quite fun, especially when Harold and Snub enter the place where Bebe works and encounters some creepy contraptions and puts on costumes like Snub trying one of Bebe's outfits. Not too much slapstick, but what's too was quite fun. So on that note, do I recommend that Crooks be dishonest?
