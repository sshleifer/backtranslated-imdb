Gary Cooper is a cool leader. Always wanted his easy to go on par with the headline. As some others have commented, there are some peculiarities in the script, such as. A US Marshall who got his job and can't even beat a barn with a gun. A ranch with about thirty hands, but can't seem to endanger his cattle. <br /> <br /> But there's lots of fast thinking, straight shooter that keeps you entertained. <br /> This movie was made in 1950. People in their 20s and 30s find it difficult to understand the movies that were made for entertainment, not Oscars. Expect Oscar material to make this movie unfair. It's about the good guys finding a way to round off the bad guys. <br /> <br /> So rent, borrow or buy this movie, bite some corn and enjoy Coop again.
