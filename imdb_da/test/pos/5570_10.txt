I must admit that I was first worried about Farscape. The opening segment was not very strong, and I began to worry about what was to come. But as it sets itself in the familiar Henson area with the angry humor, the unique and enduring characters and the compelling story combined to create an excellent piece of science fiction. The story follows John Crichton (played by Ben Browder) a scientist who has developed a spaceship and theory dependent on slingshot propulsion. However, his craft encounters an unknown magnetic field during the first test, and he is propelled into an unknown galaxy, where he finds himself in the midst of a battle between escaped prisoners (on the constellation Moya) and the peacekeepers (human enforcers). He is literally drawn into the prisoner's ship, and after many turns he finds himself united with the prisoners (Ka D'argo, a Luxom warrior, Pa'U Zhaan, a partial priest, Rule XVI, a devoted ruler, and Aeryn Sol, a peacekeeping officer who has reluctantly joined the crew). With excellent special effects, moderate makeup and dolls and robots that exceed the Henson standard for perfection. FarScape seems to be a fantastic original, creative and smart science fiction series.
