Anatomy (Anatomy) is an entertaining and engaging film that does not live up to the discomfort to be associated with the film's subject. The idea of ​​ethical ignorance in the world of medical science is one that pushes the viewer towards discomfort and the realism of the institutions ('Heidelberg') and the special effects make it a not-so-easy movie to watch. <br /> <br /> But the characters, the script and the brilliance of the movie are all too familiar with the Scream movies that repopularized this kind of genre. Unfortunately, while the subject is one to worry about, presented with another movie full of college student characters, which we don't really get a chance to care about, unresolved subplots and hammy scene murders reinvented even since the memorable Drew Barrymore's opening scene in Scream several years back. <br /> <br /> Steven Ruzowillzky makes a sharp effort for the script and direction, but does not push beyond the general theme. While we are being presented with an entertaining movie with some reasonable performances, we are unfortunately back with the old feeling: Nothing is wrong with this movie, but nothing is extraordinary either. <br /> <br /> An entertaining movie and an interesting chance to see how foreign filmmakers have been influenced by the post-screaming 'horror' culture. 6 out of 10
