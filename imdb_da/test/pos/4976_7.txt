It is always interesting to capture a line in a movie that is winning something prophetic for the future of an actor. In this case, I was fascinated by Edward G. Robinson's statement to Barbara Stanwyck - "I promised you the valley" when discussing the lone hold outs for his attempt to control the entire country in Logasa. Ten years later, Stanwyck wanted to star as Barkley Family's Matriarch at "The Big Valley". Somehow, I thought she might have seen older in the previous picture; I think all the bright dresses and fancy riding clothes have a way to spread their youthful side. <br /> <br /> As for my summary line above, it is Lee Wilkison's assessment of John Parrish (Glenn Ford), one of them shortly after Parrish uses his knowledge of military tactics to take a number of Wilkison hands out after they hit his ranch and flashlights his home. I liked the way the film explored its character, starting with the way he dealt with author Wade Matlock (Richard Jaeckel) in a calculated showdown. The set-up for the ambush was also a clever maneuver, diametrically opposed to the strategy of hurrying the evil guys upside down with both sides fighting it out to the last man standing. For that, Parrish also had something to say - "Never meet the enemy on his terms". <br /> <br /> "The Violent Men" is a good title for this movie, and was probably in the lead of its class in the mid-1950s, but by today's standards come close to the blood to leave one Find in a "Tombstone" or "Open Range" where the spheres clarify a spooky savagery. But it is shaped by fine performances from the protagonists, with a subplot that explores infidelity that seemed almost ironic, as it was Stanwyck's character who was cheated.
