Snap, crackle, pop! The devastating sound of any change in the camera angle. And that's not to mention the white flashes and the clipped endings to almost every spoken phrase. What on earth were they in the editing room? Or could this approach be intentional? Probably not. What purpose could it serve? Despite all his technical short-comings, this is an interesting film depicting a day in Joe, a hustler who is determined to earn $ 200 for his wife's pregnant girl friend. Joe Dallesandro is unique as the easy, passive, backward young man willing to let the other person make the most of the speakers while listening with a distant eye. <br /> <br /> The story is skinny and outlined and documents the insecure life led by a man who trusts casual street sex to support his young wife and baby. One thing is certain, Joe is uninhibited when it comes to disrobeing for sex or constituting an artist. Understandably, because he has a beautiful face and and just as beautiful body. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the movie that is remarkably effective. There is no sound, no dialogue. Joe tightly naked hangs on the floor and feeds crumbs of cake to his little baby. There is a beautiful calm and tenderness trapped in these quiet moments. Another scene of entertaining interest is the one in which Joe desperately seeks a $ 100 loan from a gym friend who is asking a very ruthless approach. Joe tries to look interested, but is hesitant in his conversation when an artist gives him an uninterrupted resume of Greek and Roman art. It is a preliminary to another occasion when Joe disposes of his clothes and constitutes the discus thrower in true classic style. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, we get the impression that we need to know Joe well. After all, he has uncovered more than his soul.
