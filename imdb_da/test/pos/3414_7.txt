A warm sentimental story from the author of The Waltons. If anyone was to pitch the material to me, I would probably reject it as for the maudlin. But the dramatization here controls a tear without the anticipated embarrassment. No one in the 1950s was better at lovable herds than Arthur Hunnicutt. His appeal here is put to full use as a mountain man who, however, is faithful to a loyal hunting dog. Their fate is bound together as inseparable as any human bond. Well. I see a subtle environmental message here. All critters go to heaven, because how can we condemn any poor devil who just follows instinct to stay alive. There is no fraud in the animal kingdom, and yet how cruel we treat them often. An oddly satisfying episode confirming this important message.
