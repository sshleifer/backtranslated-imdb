There are subtleties in this movie, which I think many people may miss if they are not careful. You really have to follow what Leland says and read his character to find out the planned "why" movie presents at the end. Nothing that solid, it's not clear it's about what the individual viewer takes out of it. I think it was the plan from get-go, people are not supposed to understand it in the same way, it's almost about creating your own personal relationship with Leland to perhaps feel a little better. The story is interesting, but its summary can never explain what the movie really is. It's dramatic and thought-provoking, many heavy ideas, but the pace of the movie is almost calming, even with its more intense shouting scenes. I think it's probably Leland, he's just calm and almost calm, even for all his grief. The film personifies Leland in a way. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's captivating and engaging if you let it go, but there are some recycled ideas. I think Leland has a very impressive dialogue, he is anything but typical, but he is not a prophet. All he says is not a revelation, many people I know have mentioned things he mentioned, even I have observed a few things he observed. Leland is the unique and attractive character he is probably mostly for Ryan Gosling's depiction. Ultimately, the play is quite unusual, there are no real villains, there is no way to psychologically evaluate Leland, just to understand him and life a little better. <br /> <br /> Compared to Igby going down I don't think comical, but looks like in his overall life view.
