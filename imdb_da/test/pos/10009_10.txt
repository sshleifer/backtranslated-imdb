I loved this movie from the beginning to the end. I am a musician and I let drugs get in my way of some of the things I used to love (skateboarding, drawing), but my friends were always there for me. The music was like my rehab, life support and my substance. It changed my life. I can totally relate to this movie and I wish there was more I could say. This movie left me speechless to be honest. I've just seen it on the Ifc channel. I usually hate having satellite, but it was an advantage to have satellite. Ifc channel shows some really good movies and without that I would never have found this movie. I'm not a big fan of the international movies because I find out that many of the don 'I do a very good job of translating lines. I think the obvious language barrier leaves you just thinking it's what they say, but it's not that big of a deal I guess. I hardly ever saw this amazing movie. Good thing I kept up with it instead of going to bed .. well earlier than usual.lol.I hope you all enjoy hell of this movi e and love this movie just as much as i did. I wish I could write everything in caps, but again, the rules I think are screaming, but it would really show my excitement for the movie. I give it three inches up! br /> <br /> This movie blew me away!
