I really enjoyed Fierce People. I discovered the movie by accident and searched through my On-Demand movie lists, trying to find something interesting to see. The movie is mostly about class in America and it quickly takes your attention. The characters are clever and articulate, and the story does not adhere to the usual Hollywood rules. The main character is Finn, a precious but underprivileged 15-year-old who spends his summer with the Osbourne family. Donald Sutherland plays patriarch Ogden C. Osborne, the seventh richest man in America. Diane Lane plays Finn's mother, a friend of Ogden, who is also a common cocaine user and a sedentary. Osbournes own a large estate and seem to live by their own rules. First, they seem charming and sophisticated, but the super rich are different. They are used to getting their own way. The movie is fun because it has a sharp intelligent dialogue, great acting and a story that takes unexpected turns. It's also an R-rated movie so it's not quite healthy. <br /> <br /> Casting is excellent. Anton Yelchin is credible and sympathetic in Finn's demanding role. Sutherland and Diane Lane have never been better. Chris Evans is impressive as Osbourne's incredible granddaughter. Kristen Stewart is good as the beautiful grand daughter. High quality film.
