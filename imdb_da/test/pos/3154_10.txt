In 1858, Tolstoy wrote this in his diary: "The political is not compatible with the artistic, for the first must prove to be one-sided." This mindset from a great mind applies to the United States The Movie. The movie can be read by those with a narrow focus as a 90-minute slam of Bush, Cheney et. eel. as well as a ripping of America as an imperial force beyond control, which will eventually be destroyed by its own stupidity and thirst for power. The more obvious viewer will take note of the recurring images and themes that make this DVD a testament to postmodernist thought, as the main character breaks into pieces surrounded by repetitive images of the natural world as opposed to man-made constructions; Towers, roads, video screens, radio, vehicles. Above all, the vicious threat of war that has been and will crumble through. War and rumors of war are what are created, destroyed, and recreated on the screen, in our conscious world and in our unconscious mind.
