I never thought I'd say this about a biopic, but there is an abundance of characterization (especially about Kenji Miyazawa's feelings) and too little on the literal events of his life - in the end I'm not sure if he dies ( he should), or if his sister finally dies (she was supposed to) or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (it's an inside joke if you missed it - Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad). But this glimpse into an author's thoughts that "outlined poetry and adventure from his imagination" is very intelligent, creative, entertaining, and emotionally powerful. All of this despite the fact that everyone is animated as animals (as in many of Miyazawa's stories). <br /> <br /> Some of the images are truly amazing, especially considering that it was made for television movies. Seriously, some of them (like the sequence of birds following blue light) rival parts of Fantasia. However, I still can't stand computer animation when mixed with cel animation. The CGI trains are terribly obvious - even more so than the Anastasia train. <br /> <br /> 8/10
