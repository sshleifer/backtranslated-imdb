This is not far away from the trash that Bollywood usually does, but there is just something really good about it. <br /> <br /> The title song is one of Bollywood's best and jokes all the way through. This is one of the films (along with Baazigar - a must see Bollywood movie) that made Shah Rukh Khan, and this is for you to check it out. Other reviews give away the story - it's a pretty basic idea - ShaRukh certainly stands out and one of his final expressions right at the end made me give this movie an extra star. It's pretty cheesy but definitely worth seeing if you're new to Bollywood or not! 8.10
