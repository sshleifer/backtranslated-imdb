Fascinating and fun bad, the Lights of New York is the first all talkie feature and one that almost never saw the light of day. <br /> <br /> Two naive barbers (Eddie and Gene) out of town get involved with bootleggers and end up presenting a speech. When a policeman is shot by one of the trifles, the police begin to shut in, and Hawk (who shot the officer) decides to tie the murder of Eddie and instruct his servant to "take him on tour". But it is Hawk himself who takes the ball in a twist that will surprise few. <br /> <br /> One-week shots at a $ 23,000 prize, "Lights" was originally termed a two-reel, but Foy took advantage of Jack Warner's absence to expand it to six. When Warner discovered this, he ordered Foy to cut it back to the original card. Only when an independent exhibitor offered $ 25k to the movie, Warners actually watched the movie, which continued to make a staggering $ 1.3 million. <br /> <br /> Now, this is an extremely hokey piece of action ranging from the passable (Eugene Pallette) to Trance who (Eddie's Granny in a particularly risible scene) and much of the game is on par with Vaudeville. Since it's an early talkie (4 part-talkies before that) it's all about the characters, and very slow on it. The manuscript feels impromptu, visual style is non-existent (except for the shooting scene made in the silhouette) and scenes paint on interminably. Title cards are intercut, which redundantly announces characters and locations. <br /> <br /> In spite of all these "Lights" is a compelling experience as we look at actors and crews struggling with the alien technology and changing the cinema forever. /> <br /> Catch it if you can
