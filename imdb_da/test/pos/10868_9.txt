I found it charming! No one but Kiarostami can do so little and yet get so much. You may think I'm weird, but I was so charmed that I couldn't speak during the movie. While in other films I comment a lot. The short film made by him to Lumiere et Companie, the one with the eggs, one is invincible in my heart, but it is also wonderful. I liked it better than Ti. Kiarostami is perhaps the best instructor in my opinion because he can see things! He doesn't have to use many things "brought from home" to illustrate his pictures, he just takes a camera. Not many can do it. Maybe I don't know much about movies, but I don't care to complicate things, all you have to do is touch my soul. Kiarostami does.
