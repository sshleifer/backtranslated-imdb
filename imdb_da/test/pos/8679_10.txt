I have to say this is the best movie I've ever seen. I know that on this site only negative reviews were received, but for once I would like to be the good person who gives the world's best movies a good review. I find the movie to be extremely fun and it has the perfect mix of everything. It makes me feel all kinds of emotions when I see it, and I can't get enough of it. soundtracks brilliant. I love it, I understand why people might not love it as much as I do, but I don't understand how people could hate it. The film is 100% shine. The veil is amazing. I never understood that Aussie movies could be so good and I never understood that I could see a movie so many times in a single day without getting sick of it. I think everyone should look at it, whether it is to get a feel for what life was like during the younger days, or whether it is to see what you're up to when you reach the end. year 12.
