I own this movie and I love Canadian movies but employ an actress like Rose, I don't understand. She's totally useless in this movie, just a name that's all. The rest of the cast is good enough to do this little thriller work. I was surprised by the plot, which is not the first time it was used. But the unknown actors did very well even the Jergen, I'm not a big fan of his, but i liked him in this movie. If you got the chance to see it go for it.
