This film is a fascinating example of Luis Bunuel's storytelling skills. This is a comedy that is not a comedy and a social drama that is not a social drama. Although I didn't think it was fun, it made me laugh. Also, despite the fact that you can never take Bunuel too seriously, the film made the idea of ​​religion and its importance in the lives of some people. Bunuel tells the story of a Catholic priest devoted to his faith as no one else and the viewer witnesses what happens when the priest's unclear commitment to serving others is being tested. As usual, Bunuel's goal is Catholicism, but I don't think he was trying to suck the church as he often does. At least I didn't take the film as a mockery of the institution. I think he is trying to make an interesting point about how religion could be a nuisance in today's modern society. Not because belief in itself is bad, but because people are always going to bastardise the concept. Message aside, I think this is one of Bunuel's most clever works. Francisco Rabal is great as a priest. Absolutely, one of the filmmaker's best movies.
