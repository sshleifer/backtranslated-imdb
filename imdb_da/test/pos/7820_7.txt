Marco Poloni (Costas Mandylor) was born in a baking family in the Bronx. Although Polonis has been known for their garments during the decades, the company has fallen in hard times. Meanwhile, Grace Carpenter (Lauren Holly) is a most talented dessert maker in Manhattan, but she can't seem to land a premium confectionery position because of the glass ceiling. An unfortunate meeting between Marco and Grace results in a conversation about a possible solution for both of them. There is a high profile bake-off, The Golden Whisk, which takes place in the near future, and Marco wants Grace to work with him. There is a huge amount of "dough", haha, at stake for the winners, enough to put Grace in its own business and also save Poloni's eatery. Grace reluctantly agrees. But there are complications. Some of the judges and other participants may have previous problems with both Grace and Marco. Also, although Marco and Grace both feel some kind of attraction for the other, Grace has a long-standing, very rich girlfriend. Can Marco and Grace win the competition? This is a nice movie for the romantic at heart. First, there is the good cast. Holly has always been a lovely actress with a remarkable husky voice that promotes her attractions. In this movie she is perfectly cast as the firm but beautiful Grace. Mandylas, a newcomer, delights also as the beautiful rival baker. The rest of the actors, including the wonderful Brenda Vaccaro like Marco's mother, are pretty nice. As a Hallmark movie, costumes, sets and production facilities are in vain, and the script still manages to be fresh and fun, despite some well-known themes. Treat yourself, romcom lovers, to a sweetest confectionery by ensuring a viewing of this movie. It is certainly the movie that corresponds to a large box of quality chocolates.
