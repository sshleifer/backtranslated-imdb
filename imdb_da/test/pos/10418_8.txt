This movie did a great job of capturing NYC stereotypes there best. If you want a simple, sweet story, you can't find it here. The related stories are interwoven in a way that makes an excellent job of capturing the dense, yet contrasting, anonymous lifestyle that is Manhattan. A perfect watch for those who enjoy and can laugh in New York life in its most natural state.
