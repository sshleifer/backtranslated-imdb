The first adventure race of Jim Henson's beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy car like Kermit. The frog leaves its carefree, marshy environment for the bright lights (the egg of stranded Hollywood agent Dom DeLuise who overheard him singing); Along the way, he meets Fozzie Bear (a pitiful stand-up comedian at James Coburn's El Sleazo Caf√©, who has Telly Savalas for a hopper and Madeline Kahn a patron!), Piano man Rowlf, bestial drummer Animal and his laid-back, funky band, egomanian beauty cone Miss Piggy (in a ceremony pursued by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen), etc. Yet Kermit et al. of frogly burgher magnet Charles Durning and restrained acolyte Austin Pendleton, sold cars, ice cream and balloons to Milton Berle, Bob Hope and Richard Pryor respectively, served food by the monstrous servant Steve Martin, almost brainwashed by the feared German scientist Mel Brooks and finally landed a audition in movie magician Orson Welles who has Cloris Leachman for a secretary)! The nice song score comes with Paul Williams, who also looks like the resident pianist at El Sleazo. For the record, I recently acquired four of the subsequent Muppet films and had to watch them in the coming weeks when their turn fell due.
