But pretty dated today. Otto Preminger made this film without a certificate of approval that was necessary then. It was enormously courageous and risky, as he could have lost his investment and future. <br /> <br /> The movie is not true to the wonderful book and unfortunately is Hollywood. Frank Sinatra (and I have never been a fan) playing Frankie Machine, is amazing in his performance. One forgets that it is Frank up there, the level of realism he brings to the role of a jonesing drug addict must be seen as being believed. Kim Novak, forever beautiful and talented, does not disappoint the devoted outsider, always there for Frankie. Supporting roles, especially a young, beautiful and talented Darrin Mc Gavin, are flawless. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Parker plays Frankie's wife, is hopelessly unlucky. She swings from annoying to melodramatic and is far above the top. An unforgettable performance. <br /> <br /> The stylish, inexpensive settings are horrible as if a firm gust of wind would blow the whole sticky painted cardboard over the horizon. Almost ridiculous at times in their tawdry fairness. The music was annoying, so poundingly so at times. As if every nuance of the manuscript (for example, when Louie gets Frankie, he got the fix out of a drawer) emphasized at a high decibel level. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10. Sinatra really deserved its Oscar nomination. Worth to see.
