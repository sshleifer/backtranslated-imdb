This is one of the best films on the French Revolution ever produced. Being a person well versed in the period I was amazed at the level of detail. The costumes are spot on. Even the detailed small daily items such as ink wells, serving plates, etc. are all perfect. As an American citizen of France, who has access to the websites of the movie through his membership in various historical associations such as the Napoleon Alliance, I cannot say how impressed I was with the film's visual accuracy. <br /> <br /> The dialogue where it is known is virtual quotes and where not registered is character. I was extremely pleased with this movie and am disappointed that it is not out on DVD yet. This is how historical drama should be performed. Must see ....
