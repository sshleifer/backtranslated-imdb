Interestingly, someone made a comparison of the "Fifth Missile" to the Star Trek episode. It should be pointed out that the original Star Trek TV episode, where the company crew undergoes madness as it orbits the planet Si 2000, is called "The Naked Time" and not "Naked Now". "Naked Now" refers to the first regular Star Trek Next Generation episode where Enterprise-D meets a science vessel. However, this episode refers to and is based on the "Naked Time" original series one. <br /> <br /> Now to the Firth Missile. While crew responses in the Star Trek episodes were based on those similar to alcohol poisoning, the crew's condition aboard Montana was caused by a much more serious situation, namely, the paint vapors emitted by the defective shot end. There are few places where such a reaction can have more serious consequences than among a crew who has responsibility as seriously as a crew member on a ballistic missile submarine, and that is, of course, what makes the movie so exciting and such a thriller. The reason is very credible. At the same time, this film, along with "Crimson Tide", "The Day After", "By Dawn's Early Light", "The Hunt For Red October", "Ice Station Zebra" and many other similar films give us much insight into how easy it is could go wrong and how easy it could be for a nuclear program to start. Fortunately, such an event has not taken place, and (God willing) such an event will not happen.
