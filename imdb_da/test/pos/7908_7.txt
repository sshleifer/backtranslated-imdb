A hard life gets harder when the three children of a single mother are scheduled to be sent home separately after her uninterrupted passing. <br /> <br /> To stay together, the older boy plans a bold, high-risk flight to find a far-lost uncle - their only remaining neighbor. <br /> <br /> Your trip takes the three terrible flushes in a hunt through the desert into a classic beetle, effortless, hungry, desperate, terrorized by criminals and also young to drive, chased by the threatening civilian authorities. <br /> <br /> What the movie lacks in acting and plot realism, it is in the honest human need to be part of a fulfilled and complete family - even though that family is cobbled with spare parts of broken life. Of course, the end is forced and too dramatic for the critical film gates, but each heart shouts the same cry for family unity and belonging. <br /> <br /> With all its weaknesses, I still give this movie a strong recommendation.
