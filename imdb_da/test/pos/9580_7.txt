... the opportunity it gave me to look at Ireland's past was invaluable. <br /> <br /> I had the benefit of seeing this with my mother who greeted from Cork and in seeing, we talked and I learned a lot from her about how things were back then. <br /> <br /> Things like how Deasy and Co. was a Cork soda; how rain could really ruin a harvest; how the farmers used to gather the crop; how in dance halls women and men really have to stand on opposite walls before the men went forward and asked the woman to dance; about the bellows, which kept the fire going, how the priests really called the list of church donors and their donations and a little about the currency then (which my dad helped me show me the pence, shillings and crowns used back then (which was legal tender in England too)). <br /> <br /> I didn't pay much attention to how good the movie was, but I was very grateful to have this opportunity to look back at a time that for some is Irish History, but for others, including Some of our parents and grandparents are just their childhood.
