I caught "On the Run" at the Screening Room in New York and was immediately seduced by its true independent spirit. Starring Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia from The Sopranos Cast, "On the Run" sets us up in a 24-hour tour of the city that never sleeps as we follow the meanderings of an introspective sales agent who is suddenly drawn by his long-grandchildren , just outside prison. In fact, he has fled from it and is "on the go" looking for some action and a glimpse of life in the midst of the big city. Powered by amazing performances, this film gives us the old sense of 70 images, with both characters rediscovered as they blow over the city, which encounters wild events and locals. An elegance for a particular side of New York that seems to disappear, "On the Run" shows great sensitivity and humor. I predict to be a cult classic who encourages to be discovered: future viewers should surely surrender to this nightly tour.
