I first saw all the rivers on TV when I was a kid and loved it. It was great to see a mini-series set and filmed in a place so close to home. Living right near Echuca, I loved going to the historic harbor to see the paddle steamers. The first thing I ever had a trip on was Pevensy (Philadelphia in the movie). I love how it takes time to let the events unfold. Nothing feels rushed, as most movies are today. The action was amazing. All Rivers Run was the perfect cast and I just love the crew in Philadelphia. Mac is always fun to watch with its trademark raw onion sandwich after a great evening. Easily deserve a 10 out of 10 and is one of my favorites mini-series all the time along with the Dirtwater Dynasty.
