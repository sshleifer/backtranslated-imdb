All in all, an excellent movie from that time and source (coming from Warner Brothers as it happened in craft and style just before World War II), provided you don't take it seriously at all. The film really does not claim to be historically accurate, and it certainly is no more or less accurate or credible than say, JFK. (This may actually be more honest about what it essentially admits along the way that it should not be taken as fact-based, but more of a stylish semi-heroic depiction.) It is worth noting that the audience of the time was not more naive over history than we are today; The NY Times review admitted that the audience would "dismiss erroneous inaccuracies sprinkled all over the film," described the biographical statement of Custer's life as "imaginative" and pointed out that Custer's presentation of the final events was contrary to various historical accounts . They could really have gone overboard in building Custer, one assumes, but they succeed admirably in portraying him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent guy around, but appropriately determined, basically and inspiring. <br /> <br /> Flynn and DeHavilland, who make their 8th movie together in 7 years (and their last), are so comfortable together and play each other so easily at this time that it's not too hard to overlook how thin their proposal is written here. With a first-time mating, it would be difficult to imagine what could really draw Elizabeth to Custer, but these two make it work. The film also lacks their director from their previous seven films together (the heavily underestimated Michael Curtiz), but having worked with them on the previous year's similar theme Santa Fe Trail, it is understandable whether he chose to deviate from this one. (They all started with the captain's blood and the charging of the light brigade - both fantastic - so we can't really blame them if they started having a hard time keeping it fresh.) <br /> <br /> Raoul Walsh, the director here, is probably more comfortable with the action sequences - which are excellent - and everything else outdoors. The interior scenes are a bit more uneven, but studio artisans manage to compensate for it as well as Warner Bros' excellent cast of "usual suspects" and new faces (Greenstreet, Gene Lockhart, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, etc.). I would have learned better if Kennedy's character had been a little less standard (I generally think of his work), but here he seems to be basically the same notes in each scene; that part could have been better written - and I suppose they might have been unsure of what he could do when he had only been in movies for a year (Walsh probably took him to this after making High Sierra together) . <br /> <br /> Various highlights include the image (probably imagined) of the formation of the "Garryowen" as a cavalry theme. The last half hour is particularly excellent, especially with the separation of the leaders echoing the end of their screen partnership, followed by the last battle scenes. A thoroughly exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
