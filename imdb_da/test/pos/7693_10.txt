This was / is an incredible movie with incredible cast, music, song, history, etc. It is a tragedy that some arrogant families (Gerswhins or Premingers) can keep it from being available for generation after generation. I wanted to see it again all my life. I just found this site and read why it has not been available. Shame these families for their contamination. My wife is from Germany and she has never seen the movie. Neither do I have my wooden children or my grandchildren. It is very sad that a movie with this depth and quality is not available to them to see. Where do these families get away from making such a gifted, self-meaning, selfish, discouraging decision to ban generations from enjoying this movie, these stars, these notions, this music! Release the video and let them judge the world and enjoy!
