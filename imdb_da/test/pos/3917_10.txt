This was the biggest movie I have ever seen in my life, the action was amazing, and I was so scared there were a lot of things that did well, I would see it 1000 more times, and Paris Hilton, D * MN she has it fine in that movie. But still I would recommend it to anyone, even children (like me) adults think so. You would probably have nightmares at night though, but besides that, anyway, I can't stop it. EVER EASY, when I hear about it, I smashed and jammed and in school I gave out the words of flyers, 6 wax houses can see it. I got my whole school into it. But still, I would definitely say that it can be 6 houses of wax, be there. It gets beaten.
