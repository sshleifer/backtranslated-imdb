The Good News: The director is reportedly committed to Amnesty International's case and eager to provide a solid message of freedom of speech and the evil of oppression. The reason is clearly original and the actors are two of my absolute favorites. The not-so-good news: 'original' is not everyone's buzzword when you visit movies or video stores. Also, critics such as Mr Maltin and Roger Ebert have dismissed the film as a truly unsuccessful attempt to convert a game from stage to film. If I remember correctly, the title is taken from the adventure Stowe's character has written, and has made her a possible subversive and suspicious person in the fictional place where history takes place. Her dreams are dangerous to the government, represented here by Rickman as the intense, manipulative interrogation. As the two people are basically the only ones who appear in the film, the instructor is in a real challenge to keep the viewer aware. Eventually I found it all fascinating. Not flawless and certainly not for everyone, but rewarding. It is not near a masterpiece like Kieslowski is 'A short film about killing' or as an explanatory as 'Dead man walking'. But if you are in these movies or any of the Costa-Gavra's political thrillers, you can also appreciate this one. Just don't expect any explained sermons or eye-catching sequences.
