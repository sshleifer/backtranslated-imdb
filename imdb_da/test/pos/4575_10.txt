I was one of the few who went out of my way to see this in the theater. I've been thinking about it often since. After two DVD views, I'm happy to say it stopped perfectly. Like any great comedy, I laughed more at each show, both in anticipation of gags, but also after catching things that were missed before. <br /> <br /> Mike Dommer is doing great at creating fate of comic characters and adapting them to their world to make sense. In Office Space, the environment makes the signs credible. The future of the Idiocrath gives him the freedom to write incredibly stupid characters and make them work. I'm waiting to see if they release a better DVD with some actual features before buying it. But this movie deserves the support of DVDs that are not offered to the theater.
