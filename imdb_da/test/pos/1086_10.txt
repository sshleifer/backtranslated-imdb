This is by far one of the best films ever made by India. The following are the pluses of the movie ... Great direction, movie and editing, editing is very smooth, and the time of transition is excellent. <br /> <br /> Though film shows Mumbai police life and their hardships, it never gets boring or sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Mind-blowing is by main player Nana Patekar. One can certainly hope that he will be nominated for the best actor for academic awards. <br /> <br /> Controlled violence. The violence is controlled, and the film does not become a bloody mess. <br /> <br /> No silly songs like in usual Indian movies. <br /> <br />
