This film is one of the most amazing examples of compelling and artificial film production I have seen every time. Herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of Dieter's history, as well as his loving personal character. At the end of the film, I returned and wanted to have the opportunity to meet Dieter before he passed. On a technical note, the cinematography is intimate and amazingly beautiful. The story is intricate with great awareness of the subject and his ability to relive and restore traumatic events. Few documentaries have such a strong opportunity to thoroughly invest the audience in the character. This movie is a must see !!!
