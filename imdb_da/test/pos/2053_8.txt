A wonderful Christmas story about the moving theme "Susie Homemaker finds her inner Amazon." No, I'm serious! Geena Davis amnesia begins to improve when she is beaten upside down. From this familiar beginning we move in an unexpected direction. Good pace, good action, fun story, lots of explosions and chaos.
