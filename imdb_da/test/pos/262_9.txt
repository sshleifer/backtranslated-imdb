It's just one of those movies, you either love it or hate it, my girlfriend and I loved it, told my brother to rent it and he hated it, said it was too flashy and consistent, so he only goes back to watch big action movies, so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed. There was some great new talent (I had never heard of the leaders before anyway)? Des Brady (CEO?) Was particularly good. I played a real girl at the start, I thought he would never solve himself, but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created, and eventually I drove right to him. A very surprising movie with a lot of heart, if you can live without body counting and explosions then this one is very original. Yashimo. Brixton in the UK.
