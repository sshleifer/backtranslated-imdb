Every time I watch this movie, it just makes me really want to go out and have a good night! My buddy is spending the weekend weekend talking to the psyche even before going out! And so do I ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great debut for the author / director - well done buddy! <br /> <br /> The action is amazing, all characters are credible and bigger than life! The 'strange' scenes are a joy to watch, Jip's running Mr floppy flashbacks / explanations / visualizations are all good! The scene in the huuuuuuuge pub when everyone stands up and starts singing the moody national anthem is also laughing. There are lots of comedies here - Howard Mark's' 'spliff politics' speech is fun! <br /> <br /> Oh, God, just watch this. Mind you, I felt the movie did some glorification of the use of ecstacy, but hey, that's the truth in the case eh? At least, the film does not look away from this fact. I suppose the movie also carries a decent message to it - don't take life too seriously, you have to let yourself down sometime. And of course, the chat in the pub, when Moff tries to explain to his friends, is coming out of drugs, a sure reminder that when they come out on the road the good times, you know the party over! <br /> <br /> This is sometimes a very smart movie in it's use of the camera, lighting, etc. It was a realistic piece of cinema, and a good emotional tale of helpers, love, clubs and fabrics. <br /> <br /> Get out of the 'Rat race' people !!! <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
