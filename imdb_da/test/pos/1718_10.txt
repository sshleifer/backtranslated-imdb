As a fan of the old Doctor Who, and after the mediocre Fox movie, I was questionable for this new series of Doctor Who. However, I gave it a try and I'm so happy about it. Yes, some episodes are not as brilliant as others, but they are all fun, and yes, Eccleston's Doctor is far from anyone we have before, but ... Eccleston's Doctor is just about the best there is. His performance is sometimes comical, with other dramatic, sometimes quite crazy, but always amazing. <br /> <br /> This and Bille Piper as Rose make this series a cut above the rest (Camille Coduri is also great as Rose's mum) and there is a depth to this series that is not present before. This series is incredibly powerful, especially considering its Sci-Fi. I mean who would have thought that you could ever have been sad or even cried for a Dalek prior to this, how many times in this series of stories have we had moments like those with Rose's father, Emergency Doctor and 'You were fantastic ... was I finally speaking? I recommend to anyone about a fan of Doctor Who or even TV drama to buy this set on DVD, it really is "Fantastic!". <br /> <br /> Now, only 4 episodes through the latest series (and looking forward to the new cybermen) I have to say that David Tennant's Doctor is not as good, of course you can disagree, but I don't believe that his doctor is capable of the emotional moments seen in the previous series. I also have to say that in my opinion this series has not been as good as the last, but the return of Sarah Jane & K9 was a fantastic episode, a real gem. Not to say that this series is not good, just not so good. <br /> <br /> Whether you like it or not, and whether you prefer Tennant or Eccleston, the doctor is back and he's here to stay. "Fantastic!" - Almost as many "Fantastic!" Like Doctor! -
