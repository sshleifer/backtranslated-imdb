I don't want to drill you with any synopsis, chances are you already know them. And hopefully you're already familiar with Park Chan-Wook's work. I strongly disagree with some of the other commentators by saying that "The park has not moved from the revenge trilogy blah blah blah." Because you know what? He has!!! The revenge trilogy was different in style to begin with, how can one even compare sombreness and subtlety in "Sympathy For Mr Vengeance" with the hectic and extravagance of "Oldboy"? Park Chan-Wook has incredible style, but his movie doesn't share the same style! It has been true and remains true with the release of "thirst". <br /> <br /> "Thirst" is a great picture, it has literally everything you want in a movie. Stupid violence, tasteful fun, good humor, incredible excitement and even very realistic sex scenes. The story is so crazy that you can in no way guess what will happen next time. I'm so happy to say that Park is back in top shape with this amazing dark comic-vampire love story. See it as soon as possible!
