The United States of Leland was a great movie. I passed it on the guide on my television without knowing what it was and never had the chance to sit there and get into it. So one morning when I woke up early, I saw that it was just about to start. So I decided to see it. I had the time and interest to see it. When I saw that Ryan Gosling was in the movie and then he was the protagonist, I was immediately sucked in and couldn't move from my sofa. The struggle that Leland goes through is such an inspirational story. Everyone has to deal with the same type of thoughts all the time in their lives, whether it is a small minor detail or something as big as what he goes through. I have to sit and watch the movie again just to catch all the things I might have missed the first time. As a general comment ... I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Gosling fan or someone who just likes a good movie with a really good story. The fact that there are so many other great stars, all of which also had good performances, is just an added BONUS! So do what you can to take the time to check out this movie, I can almost be sure it won't be a waste of time.
