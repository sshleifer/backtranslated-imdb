I am surprised by the relatively low rating this movie has. It is a screw-basketball comedy and romance film rolled up by a person besides Billy Wilder, but it does a really good job and even won an Oscar. It is Ingrid Bergman's first film in the United States since the 1950s and even though she is no longer the young bomb holder she was in her early films, she brings out a difficult role quite beautifully. This movie shows that she had more talents in addition to her beautiful looks. <br /> <br /> Goldie Hawn, who won an Oscar in this one, her first film as an entertaining actress, is very good as the modern sophisticated but rare newest mistress of dentist playboy, loves them and leaves them Walter Mathaw. Goldie is great for all the senses of this role, which with a big cast put her up as a slam dunk for this early career prize. This film is not really deep, but is a gem that has stood the test of time very well. Not sure why it is average, as low as I give it a solid 8.
