I saw this at the screening at GenCon in Indy. I had some time to kill and decided to check it out. It played for about 1000 people in a packed standing room-only ballroom. <br /> <br /> Wow, what a trip! Scripture was tight. The action tense. The pacing is perfect. The character exhibition excellent. One thing I really appreciated was that you knew to go in that this was not a big budget movie. But it soon became clear that the creators pushed their sets and effects as far as they could despite their limitations. And it was more than enough. <br /> <br /> It's true that this movie was aimed at a particular audience - players / tabletop players - no effort to hide it. But other filmmakers could learn a lot from them. In order to go to the jugular scene after stage and not worry about the mother who is going to see it "get it", they got the biggest laugh again and again. But there is enough universality there, mother will also laugh, even though she is not in every joke. I think too many times I see movies trying so hard to lower the bar to the lowest common denominator, so they will appeal to most people, but the movie just ends up suffering for it. <br /> <br /> But not this flick. In fact, this movie was so solid that it had the audience wrapped around that finger from the opening credits. And while the viewers around me * really * liked the movie, they weren't pushovers - players could be among the most critical niches out there. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I got to see this in a big crowd. At least 10 times the audience had such a good time that they broke out in applause on a joke or scene during the film. How often do screenings occur? It should not be surprising that there was a huge standing ovation as the final credits rolled. <br /> <br /> For my part, I can't wait to be released. After that, one of the manufacturers concluded that they were shooting for a simultaneous TV / DVD release. That date can't come soon enough.
