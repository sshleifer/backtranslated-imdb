Stan Laurel, it has been noticed, first made a real name for itself by appearing in short parodies of popular feature films in the 1920s. He definitely demonstrates to be an excellent comic actor and performs here in "Mud and Sand" (a parody of Rudolph Valntino's "Blood and Sand"), but I think a movie like this really doesn't work because Laurel was a great satirist, but because it gives the audience the opportunity to jump into the comedy that is already familiar with the situation and the scenes. Laurel can then loosen with his inspired gags without having to create context or do without it. I saw this day after seeing "Blood and Sand" itself; It surely increased the experience of knowing what was parodyed and where. <br /> <br /> The scene where Laurel's character (Rhubarb Vaseline, if you believe in the title cards, or Rhubarb Vaselino, if you think how his name is written on chalkboard) tears his mother out of money with a two -your-trick is fun because it's a great gag, but it's extra fun if the viewer is aware of how it takes the air out of Valentino's extravagant and melodramatic promises to give the mother any luxury she wants. <br /> <br /> This is the best Stan Laurel solo work I've seen. It is simply fun - even more so if you have had the chance to see the source material.
