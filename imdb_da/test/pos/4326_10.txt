It was Libby who spoke Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how she came in the same hospital, Hurley was in) then you should know that Libby's death is dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we get answers to questions about her. <br /> <br /> BTW, big episode. It had a really good cliffhanger and some interesting questions ... just like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four-statue? <br /> <br /> I can't wait for season 3, just lost rules !!! I hope that all unanswered questions will be answered. I loved how they explained why the plane actually crashed. Desmond did so when he failed to write the numbers in time. 4 8 15 16 23 42
