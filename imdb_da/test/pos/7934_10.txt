Nevsky is one of the great epic war films. Sure, others such as the nation and Napoleon had come before, but this is just as influential. The action is stocked, but anyone who knows the first thing about Eisenstein would know that it was part of his film theory. This film, unlike many of his silent works, is about the heroic individual as much as it is about the group. This reflects the Stalinist philosophy that had risen in the foreground in 1938. Still, his film shows us the power that can be generated by people coming together to fight something they perceive as evil. Nevsky is just one of many men. He is a prince because he is the strongest, but not because he is somehow different from the rest. The romantic angles of the film give more of a personal history than Eisenstein had previously allowed. Not all elements work, and the film is probably a bit too long, but it's still resonant.
