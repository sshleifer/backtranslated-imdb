Great just great! West Coast got "Dirty" Harry Callahan, the east coast became sharky. Burt Reynolds plays Sharky in "Sharky's Machine" and I enjoyed every minute of it. Playing a maverick drug police in Atlanta, GA is just what everyone wants. Instead of being suspended, he is sent to the vice squad. Like in the Dirty Harry movies or other cop movies, the captain is always shaking. When I was a kid, I was curious what that movie meant "Sharky's Machine". Now I knew who played Sharky, I wonder what his machine was. It was his group of fellow police. After uncovering the murder, he goes out to find the pen. When it turns out to be a big time mob boss, Sharky doesn't play around. When he gets the other prostitute in safety, Sharky struggles hard and well back despite losing a finger to the chew. And I also like the part where the bad is blown out of the building through a glass plate. It was BOMB! Randy Crawford's "Street Life" really puts the movie in the right mood and the movie itself is a great hit for me, ALWAYS! Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.
