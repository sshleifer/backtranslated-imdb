I just can't see what's so bad about this movie. I loved this movie! I thought this movie was the best movie in the series. Although part 3 is the best in the series, I still gave this movie 10 out of 10 because it's great. I can't see what everyone hates this movie. Who wouldn't want to see a little bit of critter action. I wanted Brad Brown to show up in this one because it might have done a little better. Those who like a little drama because ... wait, I don't want to tell you, just watch it. This movie also includes a few popular actors who are ... (I don't want to tell you because I hate it when people give spoilers so I won't be one of them). Well, that's all I have to say about this movie.
