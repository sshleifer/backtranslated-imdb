Part of the BBC movie of all Shakespeare's classic plays, makes this version of Hamlet nothing to remove my particular impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most overrated games and Hamlet himself a not very moving and tragic character . I don't feel any sympathy for him, and I didn't do that after seeing it. <br /> <br /> Even when you have great actors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of Danes, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, it cannot spoil the lack of passion in history. And when a good actor like Jacobi injects passion into it, he makes the whole role incomprehensible. I just couldn't connect his physicization of the character to what he said, and it killed me. Having said that, he gets the "to be, or not to be", speak right, as his actions with a dagger obviously make the character's suicidal feelings at the time of the play. <br /> <br /> The supporting roles, better written to me and, consequently, better played, are fun, especially Lalla Wards loopy Ophelia and Stewart's detailed interpretation of Claudius. <br /> <br /> In four and a half hours it is very long and best seen in bite-sorted chunks. Check it out if you are interested, but be prepared for a long clock.
