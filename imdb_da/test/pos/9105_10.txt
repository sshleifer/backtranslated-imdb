I was lucky enough to win free passes for the snail's preview of POD. Just let me tell you, from just the previews I was thrilled to see it! The movie is completely rocked! What I really liked about it was that JB was in his element. With other movies like "School of Rock" he makes namby pamby music for kids and families, but this music is of course all his. <br /> <br /> I took my brother and sister with me to see it and we laughed all the time. There are a few places where I wonder what the hell they were thinking, because some things are a little different, but for the most part it was good. Much of the time, it didn't seem like a low budget movie, so it's a plus. What I was most surprised about was Dave Grohl as Satan. It's f-ing fun! You will honestly not know from watching the movie that it is him. <br /> <br /> I say if you are a rock fan and are in JB, KG and / or Tenacious D, watch the movie. Be prepared for a lot of drug references, a lot of four letters and some skulls!
