The stunt sequences (as well as the special effects) are Brilliant, in this film. Michael Scherer must be one of Canada's best stunt coordinators of all time. The explosion in the cafe is a great combination of Stunts, Special Effects and Visual Effects. The director had an idea that the crew succeeded in creating films. <br /> <br /> Beyond that; Donald Sutherland makes one of his best performances in this movie .......
