living in Romania, I was almost stunned by the very realistic scene of the scenes and the great care paid to local details by the director. The performance of Anthony Queen is amazing, and the rest of the role does a good job supporting him. The film takes some knowledge of the Eastern European context in order to be enjoyed, but it is otherwise a good performance with some memorable lines. The end is perhaps a little too melodramatic, but it is actually the way people are in this part of the world. I think the manuscript is great because it presents the horrors of WW2 in a most original way - no blood, no battlefields. Still, the lives are shattered, and the smiles you get every now and then throughout the movie are quickly killed by the war realities that affect the characters.
