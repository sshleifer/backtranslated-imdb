I love this show. It is wise and very well acted. David Morse and Andre Braugher have good chemistry. The writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief. After each new episode, I'm always amazed at how thoughtful and entertaining this show is. My only complaint would be Donna Murphy's absence at this time in the second season. As David Morse's ex-wife, Heather, she added such character to the show. <br /> <br /> I think this show is a credit for the crime / drama genre. With that said - I can't understand for my life why this show has such a low rating. Would anyone please who gave this show a 1-rating, so that's a criticism?
