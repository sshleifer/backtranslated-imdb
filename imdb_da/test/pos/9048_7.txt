Okay, I admit right in front that the Inki cartoons made by Loony Tunes are pretty offensive and I can understand why Warner Brothers pulled them out of the market. Seen today, the enormous lips and very stereotypical Inki are not politically correct. However, the drawings were well-made, and it is a pity that they are not released with any kind of explanatory prologues (like the one with Leonard Maltin, they included some recent politically incorrect Donald Duck cartoons recently released on DVD). In other words, it is to forget our comics entirely. Plus, Inki, Little Black Sambo and other racist cartoons are out there - especially on the internet. <br /> <br /> This Inki cartoon features our little out-of-the-box hunt. Initially, he follows a cute little caterpillar, but later happens to a lion - a lion that is more than happy to make Inki for his dinner. But through all this, a strange Minah appears again and again ... and in the end you will see why this bird is so important to history. <br /> <br /> Sweet, well-made and wise. I like Inki cartoons. Plus, I'm excited to show them to extremely thin shiny liberal friends just to see them have apoplectic fits or even heart attacks. Lots of fun, people!
