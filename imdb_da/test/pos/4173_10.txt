There are two ways to look at 'Head'. Either it's a dazzling, blowing music collage, old movie clips, psychedelia and T.V. sitcom-style comedy, or a plot less, pretentious, wandering mess. The truth is probably somewhere in between. It is also one of the best movies all the time. "The Monkees" - Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Mike Nesmith - had just finished their series and wanted to make a movie. In collaboration with author Jack Nicholson and director Bob Rafelson, they made 'Head'. <br /> <br /> It begins at a bridge opening ceremony in San Francisco, where the Monkees Gate crashes. Mickey jumps over the safety rail and throws hundreds of feet into the water. Mermaids save him to the accompaniment of a beautiful Jerry Goffin & Carole King composition called 'The Porpoise Song' and images that make the Stargate final of '2001' look like murder. At this time, you will either be off in confused disgust or be completely imprisoned. <br/> <br /> Several bizarre events unfold; Mickey uses a tank to destroy a Coca-Cola machine in the middle of the desert; the whole Italian army surrenders him; the group is hired to play to play dandruff in Victor Mature's hair for a TV commercial; an overweight waitress insults the group and describes them as 'the gift of God to the eight year olds'; a surprise birthday for Mike goes wrong; The group is sucked into a vacuum cleaner, and to throw it all, run away inside a giant glass container. <br /> <br /> You will either hate this or love it. I found it a refreshing change from thoughtless popmusicals of 'let's make the show right here' black. The songs are also good; 'Daddy's Song' is super-choreographed by Toni Basil (who later appears in Rafelson's Easy Rider) and boasts wonderful editing, with David's changing color at lightning speed. 'As we go along' is a nice Goffin & King number whose accompanying images carry a strong environmental work. <br /> <br /> Frank Zappa, Annette Funicello is just two of the guest stars to vomit. Did Victor Mature read the manuscript before he agreed to do this, wondering? However, he is fun in it. <br /> <br /> Being angry is just a genius behind it. 'Head' is a small '60s gem and it is worth repeating time and time again. Shame it didn't find an audience at that time. If only 'Spiceworld' had been like this!
