I happen to love this show. It is a refreshing take on some older sci-fi feelings and styles. They are not afraid to shoot, and when they do people tend to die. Too many shows are afraid of this and end up pointing the guns and then getting it to a standoff. Farscape also comes complete with a large amount of heartbreaking characters. They all grow on you to the point where it confuses you to hear them discuss taking some of the animatronic ones out of their box to make the mini series. From the beginning to the end, farscape gives you a sense of hope and decay as new and unexpected things happen and people live and die, surprise you every time. Worth to see even if you don't have time.
