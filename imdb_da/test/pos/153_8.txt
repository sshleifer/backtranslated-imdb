Now that I've seen it, it was NOT what I had expected, at least not for the END itself. I read some of the other reviews before I downloaded a used copy of this from Amazon and was glad I did. After I was first introduced to Park's work via Oldboy, I was curious how he would treat the genre and was quite satisfied in the wise way he performed it. I think Park has matured in the form of presentation, because while Oldboy and some of his other work have very nice and deliberate camera work, he has some good innovations in Bakjwi, which I hadn't seen in other vamp films. For example, the scene where Father Hyeon realizes that the "beast" is growing in him as he gives his shoes to the always barefoot Tae-ju and is able to see the blood pumped through the Tae-ju's skin and his height enlargement in bloodstream for it. It was a good effect. I was also pleased that Park didn't CG wondered about the movie and it is actually very little CG at all. I got away from Bakjwi is completely set up to believe that one thing was going to happen and being taken on tour in true Park fashion. In addition, I liked that the park played with a little symbolism and turn, while we usually do not get this asia cinema. At the start of the film, we see the plot developing slowly and learning to know the characters, and you want an invisible observer of what works. Park treats you a bit as the Ghost of Christmas future is going to show you, albeit a little boring, what life is like outside your world. Oh, but then we begin to feel a little kinship with the commanded Father and his budding desire for Tae-ju and conflict with duty as priest. We almost begin to rotate for themselves until Park is not so beautifully turning us into reality, and we really see that Bakjwi is ultimately a film of moral dilemma and right and wrong. It won't ruin it if I tell you to see Bakjwi from a priest's mindset and I think you get away with what Park wants you to get away with. Don't expect Oldboy and stylization, because that's not what you get here. A very interesting take genre really. Those who missed the many literary elements and religious allusions looked at another movie, not Bakjwi. After Bakjwi, see Let the right IN, it's not what you expect either.
