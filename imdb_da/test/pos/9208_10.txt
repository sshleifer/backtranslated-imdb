I would like to wait for my dissatisfaction with the NBC Cancellation Las Vegas. The show had been Top Notch for the last 5 years. Tom Selleck's addition was fantastic. He really brought a nice fresh addition to the show. What does NBC have now? Lame reality and night time games show. I mean, come and keep the old and tired law and order? Not even putting Jack McCoy as the DA can keep the show interesting. Gee let's keep quality programs like Deal or No Deal or ED? ER should be laid out for pastures. NBC is worse now than it was in Pre Seinfeld Cheers days. With cable and internet, NBC can't afford to fall flat on the face. NOTE USE BACK VEGAS! I remember when the street murder ended as it did. At least they had a two-hour series final. Hi CBS Are You Listening? Please download Vegas it's a great show.
