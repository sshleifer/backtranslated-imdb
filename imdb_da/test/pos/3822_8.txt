Ah the external borders. I love that show. It was surprisingly creepy or lower right mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I must have started looking at the road after it was canceled, as Sci-fi showed it as re-runs or played marathons of it. It was a really good show, I do not know all about the seasons and everything, but I remember that every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV says: "There is nothing wrong with your television. Try to adjust the picture "I would scare with joy. It was a good show and I enjoy watching it if it were to move on. I give it a healthy 8 out of 10.
