Two horse dealers arrive in a city and meet with the leader of a group of Mormons tied to a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the city where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate awards, and Bond introduces the idea of ​​them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.), who lead the train to this valley, are some of the best in movies, like Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while talking to Bond. Once on the track, they come across Joanne Dru, who might have seen John Ford in the Red River, and offered her a much better role in this movie. In the Morman train there are a number of remarkable signs. The Mormons are a peaceful group who are challenged along the way by a really low group of criminals. In their case (the banned), for people on the train and later a band of Navajos that they encounter, and in the well-written characters played by Ben Johnson and Ward Bond, the movie avoids completely stereotypes while the camera seems to be using so a lot of time giving the viewer the big picture of Monument Valley hitting the train as it moves along with a few water crossings along the way in stunning black and white and then comes back to what is happening in this rolling community, all to the accompaniment of the beautiful vocalizations of the pioneer sons.
