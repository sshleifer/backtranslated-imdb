John Huston was seriously ill when he made his final performance and it is thoroughly his will: uncompromising, difficult, a thousand miles away from crazes and fashion, it will be the best "last movie" you can ever dream of. A very strict manuscript, no action, no real hero, but a group of people who cope with the vanity of life, the fleeting years and death. The party does not favor people for a long time. Permitted comes the warmth and love of the songs and the meal, complete with turkey and pudding. But time has partially ruined Julia's voice, the first crack in the mirror. Then the camera leaves the room where the guests are gathered and searches for the old lady's bedroom. For sure, she seems to have been a happy life, but it is a life that inevitably comes to an end. A shot refers to the end of the movie Julia on her future death bed. Perhaps an unfulfilled life is because she remained a spinster without children to continue. Only some poor things, yellowish photographs, bibelots and trinkled s .... But is a human's hope and dreams all fulfilled? Look at Gretta. She is a married woman, about thirty-five, she is still beautiful and healthy, but she knows something that is destroyed. What Julia is today, she will be tomorrow, so she goes back to her past in her consciousness stream, only to find out how hard her memories are: A young man committed suicide for her, a symbol of her youth now declines. The final monologue, if we listen carefully to it, involves us all in this eternal tragedy, they condemned to fail human condition, John Houston's masterful lesson.
