I thought the movie was good, but I like to read the real story behind the movies "based on a true story". Does anyone know the names and location of the right characters on which the movie is based? I have done a complete internet search and cannot find any information on this matter. All I get is the movie information and the fact that it is based on a "true story". I find it hard to believe that a judge would change his sentence immediately in the courtroom, even after such a profound speech from the brother (beautiful John Corbett), but in general the story was very poignant. Anyway, if anyone knows the real "real story", I appreciate you sharing it!
