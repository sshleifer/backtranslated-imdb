Never have I been sitting for six hours just to see a miniseries, but Changi changed it. I'm not going to lie, I know some Aussie flicks can be pathetic and boring (in fact, I like the Aussie flicks myself, but maybe I'm biased), but Changi is on a completely different path. Although it's not historically accurate as we are constantly reminiscent, the show combines great acting, an excellent script and the addition of humor to give us an entertaining and emotional perception of life in a POW camp in World War II. <br /> <br /> Remember that the show should not be a documentary, so don't let any actual mistakes disappoint you. <br /> <br /> This series reveals such creative writing by John Doyle (also Roy Slaven), who is more famous for his comedy than anything else, and an excellent instructor and actor brings this creativity together perfectly. To see how much hard work went into this series, visit the official website, it is really interesting and you will learn a lot about true accounts for changi. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Changi yet, make sure you don't do anything for a whole day because you want to see the series as a whole.
