In this episode, Locke and Eko are looking for "?" symbol that we saw during the lock on a previous episode. Michael, who shot Ana Lucia and Libby, is struggling with his actions like Libby's inches closer to death. The most interesting thing about this episode (I think). Is during the commercial break. Locke and Eko find a hatch under the plane that killed Boone in season 1, and a new training video ends with "Copyright, The Hanso Foundation, 1989" In a forthcoming commercial break, a rather bizarre and non-descriptive advertisement announces "The Hanso Foundation" (a planted commercial), and the advertised website (www.sublymonal.com) leads the visitor through a world of information about life outside the history of LOST. A must see for all fans!
