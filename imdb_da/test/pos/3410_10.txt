One of the best! As a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first part of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze provides and extraordinary achievements, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. By seeing this amazing story unfold for some time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, sorrow, shame, harmony and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think I would not have been interested in the soap of this civil war. To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every heart in my class, and that's just the first book. I bought the novel and studied similar and differences, and it was amazing. I am 17 now and still enjoy the story, the characters, the subject and remember the times of the civil war. As the film director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
