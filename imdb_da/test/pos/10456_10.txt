I saw this in a theater back in 1982. I was expecting a stupid T&A movie. That's not what I got. Basically, it is about three teenage boys trying to have sex. We get the expected sex jokes and scenes - but for once they are actually funny! Yes, they are stupid, but I enjoyed them anyway. There was also a surprising amount of male nudity. <br /> <br /> Then the movie goes halfway through a sudden dramatic trip when one of the boys (the victory played by Lawrence Monoson) falls in love with a girl. Then the jokes stop and things get very dark. I will not give away what is happening, but I was very surprised at the sudden turn of events. The film provides some very important issues and deals with them realistically and with intelligence. And it has a really heartbreaking end. <br /> <br /> I give this a 10 because this is probably one of the best teenage comedy / drama ever made. It blends imagination and realism together and works! What more could you ask for? It also has a large soundtrack.
