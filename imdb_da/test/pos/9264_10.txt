I have always been a big fan of "Homicide: Life on the Street" so when I heard there was a reunion movie that came up, I couldn't wait. <br /> <br /> Let me just say I wasn't disappointed at all. It was one of the most powerful 2 hour TVs I have ever seen. It was great to see everyone back again, but the greatest joy was to get Andre Braugher back because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always the strongest part of a unified show.
