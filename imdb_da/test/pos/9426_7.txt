When others have complained about putting Sherlock Holmes in a modern setting, I will not. Basil Rathbone could have looked after any era with that voice, the savoir faire. This is a nicely composed mystery based solely on "The Dancing Men", one of the best of Conan-Doyle's stories. Instead of the original plot, it makes the men part of a Nazi plot. Holmes advocates the British war effort. His opponent is Moriarity, which seems to die often enough to compete with the central figure of 13th Friday's film. He is certainly creative, but Rathbone Holmes is unflappable. Watson is right together for the ride in this one. He doesn't get much stupidity to endure in this movie, and that's a real plus. The reason is complex enough to keep their interest. There is a final speech that is almost a parody of itself. But then I cannot be critical of a time and a nation that was under great coercion. If they were to call Holmes, be it.
