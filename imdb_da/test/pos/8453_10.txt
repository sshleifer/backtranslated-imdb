TV newsmaker Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her radical camerman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are at a nuclear power plant when a serious accident occurs. The plants lead it down, but Adams has filmed it all. Wells and Adams are trying to get it in the air, but the company that runs the facility prevents it. Plant leader Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) realizes that there are serious problems and the tests have been forged. He tries to get leaders to believe in him - only they know it. Wells, Adams and Godell endanger their lives. I saw this in a movie theater in 1979. I was only 17, and it scared me stupidly. To make matters worse, three accidents occurred near this time, making the movie all the more real. Seeing it over 20 years later, it doesn't scare me, but it's still an excellent movie - it seems like a mystery, a poignant drama, and an exposure to the nuclear industry. Fonda (with red hair) has one of her best roles as Wells - she conveys her character's growing suspicion and horror as she realizes that a nuclear disaster can happen. Lemmon is (as always) excellent. He begins to believe in his company and job and begins to rave slowly when he begins to find things. He was rightly nominated for an Oscar for this. Douglas is good but he has a small portion and is completely overshadowed by Lemmon and Fonda. <br /> <br /> A really good movie - one of the best of the 70s. Don't miss this one!
