MONKEY is definitely one of the best shows ever shown on television. I remember when I was a kid, I would go to my grandmother's house every Saturday morning and I turn on the TV so I could watch MONKEY. I loved it. It had kickass action scenes, cool special effects, a great story, a fantastic theme song that was guaranteed to never leave your head and hilarious dubbing. But it is a little strange that it is in China, and the actors are Japanese and filmed in Japan, but it is no stop to make this TV show gracious. <br /> <br /> MONKEY is about three people's adventures: Pigsy (Toshiyuki Nishida), Sandy (Shir√¥ Kishibe) and of course the unforgettable and most lovable character, Monkey (Masaaki Sakai) traveling from China to India to get a lot of sacred rolls to save the world. <Br /> <br /> MONKEY is fun and it is magical.
