I recently got the movie and all I can say is a good movie. There are many famous Rome monuments and historic sites. It is from the same author and director of The Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks stars along with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The film starts with the space and time experiment in Sweden until one of the canisters is stolen by the church's most hated enemy Illuminati. The reason is hard to discuss about without destroying anything. Its a race all over Rome after the Illuminati track to get to the Illuminati secret venue. As you drive towards the time to find the Illuminati path. Over all it was a movie worth seeing hell, I saw it 3 times, and I like it, so finally you have to buy it. It's much better than the movie 2010. And the end has a fantastic plot twist.
