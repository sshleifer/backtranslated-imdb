Oh yeah, impossible n't just gaulois. <br /> <br /> Well-strained, very entertaining movie. Exactly good command of the French language and knowledge of modern France (and history) is recommended. I don't think this movie really works in any other language. The movie is incredibly much better than the previous one (In pursuit of ...). Apart from the big actors and the savvy camera management, it is white and fireworks of allusions, puns, etc. That gives a really good movie. Cartoon vorlage is recognizable, but the film is very emancipated. The cost of the film is used for good. In fact, all the special effects fit into 'natural' in the movie, you never feel choked by them. <br /> <br /> Bref, oui, les 2CVs, ça traîne a peu mais à part cela, Imhotep! <Br /> <br /> - A neighbor from the other side of the Rhine
