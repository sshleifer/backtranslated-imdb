This is a great movie in many different ways ... Perhaps the most important thing is that it introduces Western audiences to the remarkable tragic story of Aung San Suu Kyi and her struggle for freedom and democracy. Wonderful plays, beautiful filmography, breathtaking action and excitement: "Beyond Rangoon" has everything. I've seen this movie several times over the last ten years, and each time it means more to me. Not everyone will like it (hence the relatively low rating on IMDb), but that's because it's not conventional Hollywood dumbtainment; Rather, it challenges the viewer on several levels. I have never seen it without sneaking in the end and promising to live a more meaningful life.
