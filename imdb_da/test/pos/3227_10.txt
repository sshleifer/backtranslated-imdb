Gilmore Girls is my favorite TV show of all time. they only aired the first 2 seasons in India, but I've seen the rest on DVD or read it online. It is very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist does not sneak over her mother's back, but has an open relationship with her. chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel playing Lorelai and her daughter Rory is truly amazing. all the play is excellent and the characters, although very quirky, are still credible. The residents of the stars cave show all the entertaining bizarreness of small town life, which is contrasted by the endless snob and social norms that make up Lorelai's parents of the high society. On the one hand, there is the dance-athons and the firelight festival while you are on hand you have cotillions, dar meetings and cocktail parties. The whole character develops a lot and there is a happy end for more or less everyone. There are dramatic elements, but also very very witty humor. Rory's boyfriends are all incredibly warm, like her friend Lane is. basically it is a cool, fun, very satisfying show that embraces every aspect of life and gives you a feeling - if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you get what you want, even if it wasn't what you had Imagine you.
