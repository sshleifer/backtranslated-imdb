This must be the funniest movie I've ever seen. Chritopher Guest is really talented. He has a gift of humor. I almost laughed. In fact, when I saw this in theaters, I considered going out because the movie was so stupid. But it is stupid in a good way. It's funny stupid. And it's a really good combination. You will laugh from start to finish. <br /> <br /> This mockumentary style film follows a series of characters, all competing at the Kennel Club Dog Show. The game includes Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, John Michael Higgens, Michael McKean, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge and tons more. <br /> <br /> This is a really fun movie that makes everyone laugh. A person born without personality would laugh at this movie. It's presented in widescreen to give the image you see an actual documentary, and that's probably what adds to the hilarity. BEST IN SHOW: 5/5.
