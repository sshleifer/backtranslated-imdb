I don't see very many "horror" movies, but one night I sat down and watched with my cousins. Now we are teenagers, so we tend to make fun with many things, but honestly, the reality here was really not very good, especially in the beginning. One line that stood out was when Scarlett tells Jill and Tiffany: "This is so ... high school!" while the next scene shows that Jill walks past a sign with their high school name on it ... Many parts in the beginning reminded me of a corny, poorly written, badly acted Lizzie McGuire episode. But as the story progressed and the play moved to almost only Jill most, I could appreciate the movie more. Camilla Belle did really well in this movie, and I think the other actors and actors ruined the movie for her. And I must admit that this was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Well, no, there weren't big monsters and white faces in dark corners and had dolls, but what made this movie scary than those containing those things is that it really could happen. And this movie really reminded me of what is really scary ... We all know that we will probably not stumble over the living death ever in our lives, but the idea of ​​having a killer inside the house where you babysitters can really happen. The only flaw in this movie is that it is one of the most cliché movies I've ever seen. It has everything that every horror movie has ever had - turning the keys and the car starting, shading in the corner, turning the stairs corners with excitement, turning around and seeing a dead body, ending a deadly scene quickly waking up from a dream, etc. . On exciting scenes it was very predictable, but overall I would give it a 7/10. It is definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is my first review, so I don't know if any of these were spoilers .. But just to be safe ...
