I was recommended this movie as one of the best love stories ever told. And since I'm a big fan of love, I bought the tickets and sat in the theater. After 90 minutes, I left the theater with nothing but disappointment and the theme song as the only positive thing in the movie. I was shocked by the story itself that two people can love each other, but be so afraid of never acting. I just couldn't go over the language barrier and the cultural barrier. The second time I ran into it ... I was in a different mood, no longer had expectations ... and had more patience, more relaxed mind to "watch" the movie ... and as soon as I opened my eyes, I discovered love ... the beauty of the movie. I went beyond the language and love story and then the actor (not even for a moment had I ever felt they were acting!) And the cinematography. The first time I heard a definition of what a movie is, I was told it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photographs (shots), and this is the movie that matches the description. Almost every shot has an idea behind it and combined with the music ... and the light effects ... the result is just a masterpiece! And a masterpiece is just something you need in your collection of movies.
