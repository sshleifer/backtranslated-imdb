I have been strangely attracted to this movie since I saw it at Showtime sometime in the early 80s. I say oddly because it is a bit ridiculously a little soft fluff, a genre I am not very interested in. The dialogue is pompous and invisible philosophically (it is undoubtedly only for French-Italian producers) and the plot completely outside. What is achieved is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. The landscape (the beautiful Philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely visible motion in a kind of movie that is rarely seen today. It really is one of my great "guilty pleasures". I was lucky enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have seen it several times than I think is healthy. A worthy piece of humor.
