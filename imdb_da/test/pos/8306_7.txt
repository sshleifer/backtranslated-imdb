Due to the fact that there was no CGI in 1976, I felt the movie was quite visible. The studios were very good and very elaborate. The background effects were very credible and always seemed like they were part of the whole set. The actors made it OK considering the film's premise to be put in a kind of Jules Vern atmosphere, where imagination and prospects for future exploration were most unlikely. Had I seen this movie in 1976, I would probably have been in awe of man's ability to build a machine that could travel to the core of the earth. I'm still wondering on this day why we're not all flying around in our cars, but I'm going down. McClure and Cushing have their fun moments, mostly from their facial expressions to each other, which of course makes the movie some campy that I loved. "Monsters" left something to be desired, but the story had a good premise, although I feel like another kind of "thing" could have been more credible under these circumstances. All in all, quite durable for their time and fun now.
