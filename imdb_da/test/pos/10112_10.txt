'A speech by two sisters', or 'Janghwa, Hongryeon', is a true masterpiece. Brilliant psychological thriller, heartbreaking drama and gripping horror, all wrapped in a beautifully orchestrated package. From the intricate plot, to the beautiful filmography, to the absolutely perfect casting, every aspect of this movie is extraordinary. For fear of revealing too much about the plot, I just want to say it is very satisfying. Although it may seem a little difficult to understand at first, it does a good job of explaining things in the end. And if you prefer psychological thriller, drama or horror, I promise you won't be disappointed. From a technical point of view, it is almost flawless. The set, cinematography, lighting and especially the soundtrack are all captivating. Waltz seemed an odd choice first, but turned out to be a brilliant choice. <br /> <br /> In terms of molding, we speak absolute perfection. I am Su-Jeong is quite convincing as the defiant but disturbing Su-mi. Mun Keun Yeong is as convincing as his emotionally traumatized sister Su-Yeon. These two girls were magical on the screen. I will definitely watch their other movies. Yeom Jeong-ah is deceptively cheerful and hauntingly evil as a boardmate. Finally, Kap-su Kim gives an excellent performance as the tired, broken father. <br /> <br /> I really love this movie. If you haven't seen 'A Speech Of Two Sisters' yet, I highly recommend finding a copy. It's a real gem worthy of everyone's collection. <br /> <br /> (10/10)
