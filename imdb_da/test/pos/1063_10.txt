It's fun and fast, as a lie leads to another and another to an inevitably surprising conclusion. The excitement separates this Holiday Flick from everyone else. One wonders how the pieces fit, both during the film and in the future. <br /> <br /> The character actors laid the foundation and entertained us in the process. Sinkewicz (Frank Jenks) shows us what manipulation can get ... and ultimately what manipulation can cost! Uncle Felix (SZ Sakall) sizes up for each person for us while trying to protect "Lishka" (Barbara Stanwyck) and it helps us decide who to turn to in the end. <br /> <br /> If we could ever achieve a perfect world, imperfect humans would probably have to go through a series of events like these. A sharp weakness is the fake baby crying after it allegedly swallowed Uncle Felix's watch. I've heard more authentic crying from a doll in a toy store. <br /> <br /> See it and you'll really feel like you've been somewhere!
