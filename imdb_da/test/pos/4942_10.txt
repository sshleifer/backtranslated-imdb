This game was one of the main reasons why I actually got a PS2. I remember playing Soul Edge (sometimes called Soul Blade) back in the day and I was hooked on it. <br /> <br /> I played the original Soul Calibur, but I never got a chance to play it for a huge amount of time. However, I bought the Gamecube version of Soul Calibur II, and that was what really got me hooked on the series and I was ecstatic when I heard about Soul Calibur III. This game still gives us the classic characters like Mitsurugi, Cervantes, Nightmare and Taki. However, it also adds several new characters such as Zasalamel, Tira and the unplayable Night Terror. (SANDS SAGS SAGS SAG) The strategy-based "Chronicles of Thes Sword" mode is a new feature that I really like, it can be quite challenging in the later chronicles, but it is a good complement to the series. <br /> <br /> Soul Arena mode has several missions where you have to fight a particular enemy under certain circumstances. (The exception is "Final Battle", where you simply have to defeat Night Terror). It's another nice touch that makes the game more fun. <br /> <br /> In some scenes in the Tales of Should you be made to tap certain buttons to get another result, this can be to avoid or block an attack or to get a better end. (Each character has two inferences) All in all, this is an excellent game and I would recommend it if you are a fan of fighting games.
