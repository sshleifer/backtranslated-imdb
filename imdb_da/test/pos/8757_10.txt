I had been very curious to see the original six-hour miniseries that Steven Soderbergh's latest movie was based on, and now I am happy to say that you are no better than the other. They are both intelligent, involved and extremely entertaining. The only real advantage that the miniseries have over the film is that it is three and a half hours longer, so we learn more in depth. There is no false note to be in this production, one that you should definitely make time when PBS re-releases these miniseries sometime in 2001. You will not regret it.
