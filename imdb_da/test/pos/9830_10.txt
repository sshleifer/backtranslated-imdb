Random Hearts are a very orderly, well-scripted and perfect cast actors for the primary roles. I found it so intense that you have to stop and wonder in almost every scene, Harrison and Kristin are together, how their characters deal with this horrible situation they are in. Very talented from both. Many people I think, who did not appreciate the movie for what it was, did not get the point for the movie or could not even grasp a situation like theirs. <br /> <br /> (please skip this next section if you haven't seen the movie yet) <br /> <br /> I loved the end, which was a great surprise that tied the whole movie. It relieved to see how these two good people might come out actually happiness in the end. <br /> <br />
