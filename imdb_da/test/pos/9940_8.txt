If you are okay with the foreign work in Italy's leading horror director? Could accept his monstrous stories and flamboyant style? Then you need a good time with Opera. If you don't, then you won't. <br /> <br /> Cristina Marsillach plays Betty, a beautiful young opera understudy who gets a shot to fame (in an avant-garde production of Macbeth) when the star of the show is hit by a car. As anyone who has 'believed in the boards' will know, Macbeth is a production that curses a curse, and Betty soon discovers that the show where she is now the star is no exception: a killer is systematically offensive theater personnel and poor Betty is forced to look at the sadistic killer (tying needles under the eyes to prevent her from closing them!). <br /> <br /> With the help of a little girl crawling through her air - conditioning channels, her instructor and agent, and a few ravers who have seen the killer face (!!!), Betty discovers the killer's identity and the truth about her mysterious past. <br /> <br /> Let's see ... Opera is a crazy movie with its exquisite plot turns, overdue death scenes, and an end begging faith. And although director Dario Argento has never been one for, let's say, traditional story lines, this particular giallo is so bold and has so many of his trademark stylish touches (all hit to the maximum) that it's almost as if, With each subsequent film he sees what he can get away with (sometimes almost parodying his previous work). <br /> <br /> That's why I find the movie so fun !!! <br /> <Argento's camera movements are amazing: sliding, crawling and in a stunning scene, even swooping around the opera house; the power of Verdi's music is perfectly combined with Claudio Simonetti's sans majesty, providing an appropriate grandiose accompaniment to the lavish visuals; and several excellent set pieces (with Sergio Stivaletti's nauseating Gore FX) going to prove that no one does death better than Argento (check out a character's amazing death, where a ball passes through a spy hole in a slow-motion door and right into their eye!). <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.
