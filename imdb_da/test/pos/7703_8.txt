One of the most macabre, depressing but eye-opening documents. I've been watching for a while. There is no narrative or story that is told, just a "third eye" type camera that follows about 2 pairs of heroin addicts in NYC through the seasons. Seeing them shoot up on the public toilets floors and then "clean" their needles in the public toilets ... sometimes it's a bit too much and you have to pause just to take a break. <br /> <br /> Anyone currently in alcohol / drug enhancement should see this when they want it - it really shows you what you could come back to! After seeing this, it is a wonder how one could even try this drug to begin with. <br /> <br /> All that was needed was a follow-up to the end to tell where these people are today. Judging by what is shown in doc., There is no hope for any of them. They mention getting better and finishing, but it seems that the only end to their habits is to stop dying. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not for all audiences. I found myself like seeing a car accident - after I started to see it, I just couldn't turn it off. I had to watch for a dark / morbid fascination with how it is in these missionary lives.
