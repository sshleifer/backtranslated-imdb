I thought One Dark Night was amazing! It deserves a 10! As for a statement from a user, they were dead who actually zombies in this movie. A dead person brought back to life is a zombie, no matter what method or cause / to be brought back to life. The "zombies" in this movie are used to scare the girls, not to turn them off like traditional zombies. This movie is a particular star among the horror flicks of the 80s. The score and atmosphere are pretty scary, and the audience is excited by mausoleum scenes. The act is actually convincing, with real expressions of horror at the sight of the undead. Although I enjoy all zombie flicks, this movie is a refreshing change from the typical "meat-eating zombie" movie.
