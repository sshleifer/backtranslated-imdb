This movie has a lot to recommend it. The paintings, music and David Hewlett's naked butt are all beautiful! The plot, a tale of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in adversity is also very interesting and touching - and it is not predictable, which says a lot about a movie of this day and age. But the play is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just strange. It often felt that it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody * of *. And if it's not a parody, it's still a movie with great potential that it didn't live up to.
