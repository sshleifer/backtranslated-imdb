I recently saw the House of Wax and have to say I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> It has been one of the best Horror / Thriller movies in the last few years, if not one of the best and most entertaining. /> <br /> I've heard a lot of people bashing the so-called slow start and character development that takes the movie opening 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> But if the movie dived right into the deaths, audiences and critics would have criticized the movie for not having decent characters they couldn't care less about. <br /> <br /> as well as for the character development, I think it worked incredibly well. <br /> <bringing me in my own answer and others (from reading postcard posts), many people ended up having the characters to live, of which I have noticed many who mention being Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton). taking into account Warner. Bros. Having marketed her death, it's a surprise that many audiences ended up cheering for survival. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the hunt / death scene, they were some of the most inventive and exciting I have witnessed for a while and each enjoyed a lot. <br /> <br /> The action in the movie was just fine, I couldn't fault any of them, especially Paris Hilton, I thought she was very decent and I was hoping for her to get more than just a 25 minute screen time in a 120 minute movie, but her chase scene made it and believe me when I say Paris can be scared. (See the scene where she hides a car from Vincent and he walks past her .... The look of terror on her face comes across as VERY REAL). Overall, I give the House of Wax maximum stars for entertainment value and excitement and even do ...... only criticism is I wish that during the marketing of the movie, they had not revealed the death list and who die and who survives as I would has been ten times better without knowing whether the character being hunted should live or die and terrible death. <br /> <br /> Can't wait for the DVD, but watch it at the cinema while you can, it won't be the same in your own front room, but if you're waiting for the DVD, watch the movie in the dark without interruptions, trust me, you will not be disappointed.
