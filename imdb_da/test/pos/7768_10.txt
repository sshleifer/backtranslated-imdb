Late film critic Gene Siskel said this film shows how easy it is to make a movie. He gave it a compliment, though it may have been offended. Although I did not always agree with Gene Siskel, I agree with him here. Love Jones is a shining example of how a love story should be: realistic with real characters in real life situations. The story chronicles up and down the relationship between Darius Lovehall (Larenz Tate) and Nina (Nia Long). Larenz Tate and Nia Long are more than just a beautiful couple on the screen. These two actually have chemistry together. You can feel the vibe between these two when on the screen and its amazing. Bill Bellamy is pretty funny as the fraudulent Wood and Lisa Nicole Carson are great as Nina's friend Simone. Isaiah Washington is as big as Darius' close friend Savon, and I suck every time I see him in a movie. The guy is a great actor whose career is ruined by the industry's lowlifes and the childish games they play. You can believe he called that little creature on Grey's Anatomy out of his name, but anyone who knows how Follywood works, knows better than believing any "official story" from the place of make believe. At least ... Love Jones is a wonderful love story full of interesting and sympathetic characters that are in realistic situations that anyone who has been in love can also relate. You love these people because they are trustworthy and not portrayed as gangsters and tramps. There is no obscene stereotype here. Contrast it with the Romance movie of toady. Exactly. Finally, if you love Black Cinema, then you would do well to own a copy of this movie.
