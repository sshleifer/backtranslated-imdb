A young couple - father Ben (solid Charles Bateman), wife Nicky (the lovely Ahna Capri) and their daughter KT (the sweet Geri Reischl from "I Dismember Mama" fame) - find themselves trapped in a small California desert town populated by hysterical lunatics . Even worse, there is a harmful satanic cult who has kidnapped small children for their own diabolical purposes. Director Bernard McEveety, working from an offbeat and inspired script by William Welch and L.Q. Jones (the "Devil Times Five" director Sean MacGregor came up with the bizarre story), telling the convincing oddball plot in a slow, yet steady pace, and greatly creating a creepy, edgy and mysterious ooga booga atmosphere. Strider Martin delivers a wonderful vicious and robust performance as Doc Duncan, who is the eerily outrageous leader of the evil sect. The best set of excellent character actors qualifies as a significant asset: Jones as a gruff, no-nonsense Sheriff Hillsboro, Alvy Moore as friendly local Toby and Charles Robinson as a sharp, fiercely devoted priest Jack. John Arthur Morrill's sharp, polished widescreen film, Jamie Mendoza-Nava's spooky score and the wild, sparkling climatic black mass ritual are all just as quick. The idea of ​​having toys for the murderous life is simply brilliant (the opening scene with a toy tank coming true and crushing a family in their car is really jolting). Nice honest ambiguous ending too. A pleasingly idiosyncratic and undervalued winner.
