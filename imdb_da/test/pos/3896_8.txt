William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems like he would be somewhere else. In short, he is what more actors should be. "A small case of murder" is controlled by Steven Schachter, who continued to make two fantastic films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap). Television films have long been a dump of exaggerated plays, poor filmography and sub-par scripting. Therefore, it is so refreshing to watch a TV movie that does exactly what that kind of movie was created for. To tell a little story (not a simplified story) that doesn't require viewing on the big screen. <br /> <br /> "A small case of murder" is light, entertaining fare and a good watch. <Br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
