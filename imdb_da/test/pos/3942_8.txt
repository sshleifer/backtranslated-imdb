This film was adapted from the well-known sutra of Journey to the West, where a monk with his three students seeks to find a far-lost book regarding Buddha's teaching. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not as solemn as the previous films made under the legend, it managed to introduce romance and fun humorous scene. <br /> <br /> This real goal of this movie is more about the monk, which was primarily saved from being eaten by demonic flying creatures. One of his students managed to get him out of the fight in time, but was again caught by the demons and thrown into a dragon deep neck, unlocked in that dungeon. The monk woke up in a small village where he found Mei Yan (the so-called ugly snake daughter) who fell in love with him at first sight. Although it was ugly, she did not let her appearance be thrown except to come to him. But a quest to save his three students soon turns out to be full of obstacles, and each of them turned out to be worse with Mei Yan after the monk. The problems crept deeper, and this is where conflicts between the relationships get worse. The rest of the story will be left at your disposal, but it is enough to say that this movie does not depict the typical story book, it is more for those who want to search for a fun and easy picture of what travel to The West and love barriers really mean. <br /> <br /> Finally, the entire summary can be described with only one word, and that is love. The monk went to show the heavenly gates, the heavenly palace and the Buddha himself, how love can overcome even the worst fear of all and is considered suitable as the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of superior forces. <br /> <br /> A wonderfully created and fun action awaits those who buy this ticket. Of course there would be no regrets, at least from my side and those who were with me at the cinema that day to watch the same movie.
