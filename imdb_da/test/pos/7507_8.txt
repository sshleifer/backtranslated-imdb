Dr. Bock teaches at the hospital and he is quite good at it. Things about him are that he is depressed. Dr. Bock and his wife separated, his children are different, he can't perform in the bedroom, and he feels like he's not doing a very good job of healing people. He becomes a suicide, but meets Barbara, who changes his ideas for the better. This whole story is a murder mystery and a group of angry protesters outside. <br /> <br /> The film is well finished and the character of Dr. Bock is well played. It's a little sad, something funny and something of a drama. It was good to see a few stories wrapped around the hospital, even though they had nothing to do with what Dr. Bock did. Great film.
