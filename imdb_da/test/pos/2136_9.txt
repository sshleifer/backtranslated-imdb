I only saw this movie once a quarter of a century, but it has never been, and I still remember even now my reactions to it. I was fascinated by the breadth and the sheer beauty of so much of the photography. I was amazed that an American studio could produce such a slow-paced European film and its unfocused plot. The lack of strong characters felt like a mistake, but I rushed to the utterly unnecessary end of the yacht, which seemed to be bolted on to give some kind of plot, and quite contrary to the style of the rest of the picture. It was also refreshing to see a Western who did not express the brutality and exploitation that so often was the unfortunate rejection of the American dream. The western scenes and sets also had a authenticity that was completely new to me and that pre-configured the latest Deadwood series. The film was massively cut to the American audience, and it is my very real desire that Michael Cimino has today been given the opportunity for a fresh editing in the light of reflection - a cut that can make the ill-fated movie in the masterpiece it had the potential to stay. I have now seen the original first cut and the network of relationships makes so much more sense, even though Christopher Walken is responsible for the primary thing to do. If only De Niro and not Kris Kristofferson had played the lead role! There was still a great concern for creating reality and the atmosphere to the detriment of a good script. Nevertheless, the camera work was so cleverly handled that at times you could almost believe that you were in the action yourself. And there were many special moments. Anyone arguing in the hall in different languages, trying to overcome their national differences and seeking agreement on the imminent disaster, gave a real insight into the difficulties that the United States welds together, especially when the threat stems from a combination of the old elite and money. Nate's receding approach to Ella, when she first visited her cabin, was in stark contrast to the violence that was to follow and was another. I had a special show with a large group of friends watching the new cut and we all enjoyed it at the same time with varying reservations. This revisionist and much closer to the truth version of events was probably too much for the Americans to take when the film was first released, but we all felt it had a huge profit and that its place in the cinema history was also due to major revision
