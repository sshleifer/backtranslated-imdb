This completely forgotten slasher flick is one of the best horror movies ever made. Very dark at times it reminds me of a little famous thriller "Deliverance". Director Jeff Lieberman creates a great atmosphere of fear and despair. All actors are decent and the climax is really exciting and memorable. So if you are looking for something scary, try to find this little treasure. My personal rating: 10 out of 10.PS This is even more chilling than "Halloween".
