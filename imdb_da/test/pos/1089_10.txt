I love the way he is experimenting. Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to see as much Satya and the company were. Jatin the new one also lived up to his role, and Nana Patekar was at her best. Suchak was really annoying, but I think he fits the character he played - he had really ugly teeth. The story has great progress, and no songs in the movie make it better. I just want him to join Urmila for his other upcoming movies. I think they are the best instructor and actress combination I've seen. I haven't seen Naach yet, but I'm looking forward to it. For some reason, Antra Maali doesn't find it exciting to look at the screen - unlike Urmila.
