(The description of the mood in the movie can be considered a spoiler - because there is not much action actually). <br /> <br /> Great one ... Is it to my particular interest in dystopias and utopias? Is it to the atmosphere of the movie. Or is there any more magic? If so, it certainly is the most human ... This film is undoubtedly extremely artistic / artificial (depends on taste). I can imagine most people who hate watching slow movies (and those of Tsai Ming Liang (who I haven't had other times) are one of the slowest I know of) who suffer from the movie. Yes, people are unable to slow down and let time pass - and see it without feeling they are wasting it. One can take this piece as torture or as therapy ... The subject on the surface? The lack of communication - even though we live in rabbit cages - one next to each other - but not really together? People are tired, sick of something and unable to describe it - just don't want to meet, touch, talk, confront the others ... as if they had disappeared. The large apartment block looks empty and the rain falls constantly evoking the weird melancholy inside. And sometimes it must be some abnormal, unexpected, somewhat unwanted decay like a hole in the concrete floor - it allows us to reach each other. <br /> <br /> One of the possible ways to look at it is: Do not examine the inner world of the characters - consider the entire film space to be within yourself. And ask - why is that there? Where could these depressive states and mood come into shape? Are there room for them, are they not entitled to be here? And search for the answers (if you need them) among the walls and halls of the blocks - instead of containing a barely transparent mind in a man. The key to understanding is not to understand - to let a movie lend us - as a subject of study - inside itself - and ultimately turn us back to our more colorful and "normal" looking reality. <br /> <br /> You may now - like me - feel the real, possible, non-pathetic hope that we at the core are still humans ... and this state of mind can help a lot to live in this world.
