Meryl Streep as Kate, a woman who dies of cancer, performs her role admirably. No wonder she was up for an Oscar. In the part she proves that caring and caring housewives are as important as their sisters in business. And the lesson she learns about life's expectations and their lack of fulfillment as the relationship grows is the most important thing she teaches her daughter. We can expect for many of our friends. Realizing that there are many ties and forgiveness or understanding are the main ingredients of a good life. This is a grim movie and the end is sad, however, showing reconciliation between father and daughter. I give this one a ten.
