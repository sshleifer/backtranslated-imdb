Fans of Pink Panther, Naked Gun or Get Smart will definitely enjoy this farce, who won a César and was nominated for four more. Jean Dujardin is Agent OSS 117, a man who wouldn't know a little about it hit him upside down. He is also a reflection of the colonialist attitude that suggests the West. <br /> <br /> All the Russian spies, Nazis and Muslim radicals around him are just as stupid, but there are Larmina (Bérénice Bejo) and Princess (Aure Atika) to keep things interesting. <br /> <br /> OSS 117's monstrous ability to retrieve languages, play musical instruments the first time he chooses them and sings as a native, is all more impressive than Bond's tricks, but he's still stupid.
