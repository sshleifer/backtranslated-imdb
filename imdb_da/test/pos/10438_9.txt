I absolutely loved this movie, tried to buy it and can't find it. One must see, a movie you can see over and over again, fun but also a tear in one. great album for the movie. It's a really good 80 movie, I wish I could find a copy to buy this movie because I wanted the actors in it to work really well. There are many people out there who could probably relate to this movie. That's what makes this movie so good. So go out and try to rent it, you won't regret it. It's an older movie, but it's worth watching, I wouldn't be surprised if they made a remake of this movie soon, but I'm sure it wouldn't be the same. whoever has not seen it, rent it.
