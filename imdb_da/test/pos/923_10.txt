Well every scene so perfectly presented. Never before had I seen such a film that matters in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> As I watched this movie, I remembered seeing "Amilie". Amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch. These films are both based on a same plot line. But both are perfectly perfect in their own way and are able to create their own world. Red is able to provoke many thoughts in people about fate and dejavu s. And I still think about it. <br /> <br /> The story is amazing and the end is a little fun. I laughed at the closing scene. Good fun, how this three movies Red White and Blue are connected. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good work of art. A work of a master man. <br /> <br /> 10/10
