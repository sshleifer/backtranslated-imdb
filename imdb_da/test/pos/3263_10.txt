If you've enjoyed movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, you'll love two hands. It has the same type of black humor beat to it and will keep you entertained throughout the movie. Like Pulp Fiction, it has the crazy scenarios in which the characters come in and how they handle them. Along with Gallipoli and Picnic on Hanging Rock, this should be one of the best Australian movies I've seen. It is also a young Heath Ledger before he became really big in the states. <br /> <br /> This is a terribly underrated movie that I think is as good as Pulp Fiction and these greats. You must see it!
