The TV in 1982, from a Los Angeles production, is probably the best example of a filmed scene that you are likely to encounter. Released on DVD in 2004 in a remastered digital transmission, it is absolutely fantastic. Hearn and Lansbury give the performances of their lives, and the rest of the casting is obviously caught in the electricity produced. It is of course Sondheim's music and lyrics that make it possible. If anyone doubts that he is one of the "greats" in the American musical form, listen to this. The sets are sharp to fit the plot, and clever in allowing the fast scene changes required and the cameras capture the action without excluding the fact that this is a stage production. A central, removable and revolving platform is Mrs Lovett's tear shop, with the shaving store upstairs. Around there are various gantries and floating stairs to allow the rest of the action to take place. The brutal tale of injustice that leads to revenge, murder and chaos is completely spiced with dark humor and comic moments. Sondheim does for shaving shops what Hitchcock did for showers! An important work in American music theater is here given an electrifying performance.
