The man with the golden arm was one of the first films as the main subject (and in some respects the message) the tragedy of heroin addiction. It's not near a big movie, but its importance lies in Otto Premingser's commitment to making it feel right and on the edge of melodrama and naturalism. What I liked is that it is not so much that junkies are exposed (if you want the best exhibit of it, read Naked Lunch if you can get through it anyway, beyond the point), but the nature of the urban environment Frankie Machine liver. He expects that after he gets out of jail to act straight and narrow, to become a drummer in a band and make it legit as a musician. But he has his "curly" wife Zosch who can't work and needs money and often complains, and then there's the old quarter - he can't escape seeing Louie (Darren McGavin) who still makes back-room card games And yes, pushing dope. Like Mean Streets, it is difficult to escape the minutia unless you go. <br /> <br /> But it is again difficult for Frankie Machine not to try to drive naturally in this neighborhood. It's just that he can't escape the temptation of junk (when he is booked on a false theft with his friend, he sees a junkie freaking out, and it puts the fear of going further in his own self). And personalize Frankie's Sinatra, and I can't see anyone else who could have played him, even original choices Brando. He fits into the neighborhood and seems like the kind of guy who has to be one step ahead of the game. But there is also a vulnerability to Sinatra that he pulls out wonderfully, and as we see him go 'cold turkey' in Molly's apartment, it is credible, even though it is not the kind of things that my generation would think of heroin (ie Trainspotting and certain requirements for a dream). If you have nothing else to see the movie to see what happens to Sinatra as this character. However, the shortcomings come in some of the other beliefs, although it is a little difficult. Eleanor Parker seems to be exaggerated for much of the movie, freaking Frankie, that she is really paralyzed when in fact she can go and fool him for some reason. But then it becomes clearer as it goes together - she must be nuts and nuts with jealousy, and at that level it begins to improve. However, Kim Novak is good, but not Vertigo-worthy, as the possible girl in the side, but more like the voice of reasoning in history. Then there is a Detective Bendar which may be one of the most ethnic characters / performances ever. And also Sparrow, Frankie's nerdy friend, and the characters Louie and Schiefka, and they all play together as one might expect them (in fact, McGavin is better than OK). As for the casting of other talent around Sinatra, Preminger doesn't do all that great. And honestly, some scenes fall flat. <br /> <br /> But there's a lot of fascination in the Man with the Golden Arm, and not just as a dated piece of sociological interest. It seems like a convincing drama, and as a piece of message conveyed without being preaching or campy. It's a real article, just not unique.
