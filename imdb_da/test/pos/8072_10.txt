I did not see such a film, where the creators put so much heart in their work and pay attention to the finest details for a very long time. Everything was well thought out and perfectly put into reality. Camera work, editing and composition worked so well together, it was just amazing. The titles were so fun and so perfectly choreographed. <br /> <br /> This movie blew me straight away. <br /> <br /> "Showdown" could have been cut down by 10 or 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's a close to perfect greeting to the early silent noir movie story, spectacle, nature and costumes were perfectly fitting and credible to have com from the ages with silent filmmaking.
