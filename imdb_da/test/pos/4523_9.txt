This is my fourth review of a Charlie Chan movie in a series of chronological order of these consecutive days. This is also my first comment to someone I have seen before, even though it has been around 24 years ago, so I didn't remember much of it. In this one, the Honolulu detective examines a spying that was originally tracked by a former Scotland Yard acquaintance who has turned up in the Big Apple ... This is the best of the Chan entries I have so far seen in memory With all management being connected (of course, if I look at them at closer examination, there may still be some gaps, although I can't think of anything right now). And "No. 2 Son" Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) is of some help when he first identifies the poison that results in some murders early even though he obviously slams a little later. Among the recurring supporters of the last Chan movie Charlie Chan on the Wax Museum are blonde Joan Valerie as June Preston and Stanley Blystone, who brother John G. hell a lost Chan called Charlie Chance's as a fingerprint expert. Nice plot, especially with an exciting climax aboard a bomber. Oh, and watch a particular Stooge at a police force ...
