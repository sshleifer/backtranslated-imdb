To the guy who closed the idea for Lifeforce, I have one thing to say: Thank you, Mr Lifeforce combines the big budget sci-fi pump of Star Trek: The Motion Picture with Phantasm's cheap horror thrills and tops it all with t-ts - and some real fleshy hangers in it. And best of all, it's actually a good movie! It amazes me that someone actually justified a mainstream movie that is a vehicle for a hot chick that appears naked on the screen for an hour and a half for the producers. God bless you, all of you who were involved. Steve Railsback (Helter Skelter) plays Col. Carlson, the American commander of an international space mission sent to investigate Halley's Comet. Carlson's crew finds a foreign ship inside the comet, and within the three naked people find in suspended animation - two guys and a warm broad (Mathilda May). Well, to make a long story short, they are "space vampires" ... naked "space vampires." They were rubbing the crew except for the Col. Blueballs, who decided he had to let the hot chick out of her lucite display, because that part of his brain that controls his nut liquids told him it was the right thing to do. The Col. wings back to our big blue ball in an escape pod. Meanwhile, another space crew member has discovered his ship floating dead in space, and has returned the living spacecraft's three spacecraft back to London. And that is when people start to turn into pigs, and it is usually getting out of hand for despair quickly. <br /> <br /> Carlson, along with the uneven colleague Caine (Peter Firth) British SAS, traces our naked cutie - who has a hell of a time sucking guys from left and right. Carlson has discovered that he has a mental link to Vampira, which allows them to track her, with the ultimate goal of blowing her ass away and destroying her and the friend's large space umbrella, sucking up people's energy, the vampire attacks. Will they succeed in time? MINOR SPOILER: Yes. <br /> <br /> Wow. What can I say, but "Wow"? This damn movie really works. I can't believe they got actual British actors like Aubrey Morris (A Clockwork Orange) and Patrick Stewart (Sexiest Man Alive or any such title) appearing in this movie. All the actors are good. The direction is good and really shines in the last half where we see London's amazing destruction. Special effects are also not slim. For 1985, this film has been the most, for example, going. All effects are pretty impressive, and there is a wide range of talent on display here in animotronics, makeup effects, light shows and very nice space scenes with some good old fashioned modeling and carpet painting - very nicely finished. There are even some gore and bloody squib shots for all the horror fanboys out there. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a great movie for anyone who has nostalgia for when popular movies on the bigsce were made with 100% love from the beginning to the finish. The creators of the filmmakers really made sure all the bases were covered and the end result is a phenomenal fun affair that doesn't allow you to turn away because the case is just too nice. Really solid entertainment here: 8 1/2 out of 10.
