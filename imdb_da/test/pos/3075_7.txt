May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> This is just a good movie. Lots of good stupid things to laugh at. But don't watch the TV version, they cut out too much. Dom Deluise is pretty amazing as Mafia Don, who is hired to kill Robin. All I can say about his ten minutes: It's a long drive from Jersey. You also need to love those who control the script to make sure Robin gets a new shot. Also: 12th Century Fox. <br /> <br /> Any bad thing? The rappers at the beginning and at the end seem quite dated. The songs were pretty paralyzed. Once, while watching this movie, I could think out a couple of times when they could have thrown into another joke or 2. <br /> <br /> Overall, though, it's an enjoyable movie experience. A must watch for comedy fans.
