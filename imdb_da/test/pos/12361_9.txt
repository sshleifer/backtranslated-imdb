The last person to die before New Year is cursed to drive Phantom Carriage for a whole year and retrieve the souls of the dead. <br /> <br /> I saw a scene from this old, silent Swedish horror movie on Youtube, and decided to track the whole movie. It was worth working to find it, because it is a fantastic movie for the time it was made. It has a wonderful eerie atmosphere. The old fashioned filmmakers really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere. Unfortunately, many of today's filmmakers do not seem to understand how important the setting and atmosphere is, and go for the cheap jumpers. The visual effects are excellent considering the production date. If you can find a copy of this, I strongly recommend giving it a watch. 9.10
