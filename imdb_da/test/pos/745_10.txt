... but you've probably seen it otherwise you wouldn't be here. It is so unclear that you probably stumble upon what I did because this little known gem does not receive mouth-to-mouth. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, you know how the story will shake, but watch as our innocent red-haired nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together high quality entertainment. Most horror films bombard the viewers with graphical displays of torture, but don't look in the basement playing it subtly, giving superior excitement. Notice for horror movie creators: some of us do as subtleties! Lovely and domestic nurse Charlotte takes a job at a sanatorium but is horrified when she learns that the general practitioner who hired her had a cruel accident and she is now subordinate to a mysterious doctor whom we all know is not a doctor at all. The excitement is built up through Charlotte's unraveling of events with the help of many patients, but which of the patients can Charlotte trust? This is a gem and is my absolute favorite TRUE HORROR movie. I love Re-Animator and Evil Dead, but they play more for the HORROR-COMEDY audience. $$$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ \ t $$$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ & & Games accounters & $$$ \ t $ The opening scene is classic, no other horror movie starts better and the end has its fair share of gore too).
