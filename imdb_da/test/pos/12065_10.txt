Hilarious show with so many good stories that it reflects the world today as we know it, in such a fun way it stole my play for other shows. I laughed so hard that I just found some other comedy shows unfunny. The unique confessions of each character is a fantastic original technique that just makes the show fun and very humorous. You may think that this is an average comedy program about hard life with a family. That's what I thought first, but I found out that it contains new and unique techniques that completely set it apart for any other average comedy show. Michael Rapaport is a star. I would definitely like this show not canceled.
