I just saw this on cable. I liked it. It kept my interest and the dramatic choices were good. The old couple were very good and good to be subtly scary. The kinematics are not that big, but the shabby video also adds to the feeling of realism, so it is a trade-off, do you know? At times, the girl would hit New England accent hard. The accent would come and go. Anyway, I thought the movie was well done overall, though. The story was strong and dramatic excitement was held because you felt theirs was something weird mystery going on, even though things seemed everyday. Good work on a low budget. Another good SUNY Purchase movie maker. Way to go
