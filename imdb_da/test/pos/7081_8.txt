This movie began to confuse and grew into one of the best movies I've seen ... The play was amazing, and since I didn't dry my tears, I enjoyed Meryl Streep, whose performance was extraordinary. The film deals with the difficulties of a distant family that handles a mother who develops terminal cancer. The movie was very hard to see and heartbreaking. The audio track fits this movie into a tee. Brava Bette Midler !! Out of 5 stars, I give this a 4 1/2.
