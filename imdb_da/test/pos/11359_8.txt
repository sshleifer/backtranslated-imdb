MY DINNER WITH JIMI is a glimpse of Howard Kaylan's dizzying and exciting journey to fame with his 60s Folk Rock band The Turtles. The turtles were a kind of 'second tier' action during the sixties, but the film clearly shows that they could eat, drink and party with the titans of hippie culture. And not just what they had the musical chops to back up. Many of the stellar acts of the era are seen as interacting with the band at work and in games. This gives my only complaint about the movie. Almost from the beginning of the film, it is seen that it is almost impossible to find actors who can convincingly constitute such recognizable stars. All too often during the film I felt that I saw an engaging exhibition of false wigs and mustache. But if you're a fan of The Turtles' music, or The Swinging 60s in general, it may be the movie for you. And don't forget to see the extra features. There is a very fun (and informative) piece of band members, Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan, about their disastrous experiences with leaders and agents.
