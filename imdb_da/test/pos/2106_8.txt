I've just reviewed this boring reminiscent of cinematic madness from my early days and have to urge you to steal or borrow it. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a duel between a fair Shaolin priest and our villain Abbot White, needless to say, Abbot White kicks Buddhist ass and pays his campaign against Shaolin unhindered with the help of his new ninja allies (a gold-plated, struggling with a gold ring, a black clad that struggles with a spear, and my favorite, one who is struggling with a pair of blades that can disappear and emerge as a flying blanket). The rest of the story is about training the disciples of the Shaolin monks killed by Abbot White, one of whom is Alexander Lo Rei. While we are being treated to the punitive training sequences, the two young avengers have to go through to learn the Shaolin Finger Jab technique needed to defeat Abbot White's insurmountable armor technology, we see some of the ways our villain holds shape ... mainly using Taoist magic to extract the blood from naked ladies. We all know how this will end, but it is the psychedelic journey between what we are here for. In conclusion, this is a good example of what Taiwan did when Hong Kong fell ill with martial arts films, making more and more outrageous martial arts films. This movie is very well choreographed, has some nudity, some gore and enough balls for the wall gimickry to keep even the most jaded viewer entertained. Visit your local Beewise today! <br /> <br />
