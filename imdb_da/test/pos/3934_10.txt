I'm not sure why this movie is so low on IMDb on average, when it's absolutely all you'll ever have in a horror movie. This is the definition of being a horror movie. I consider myself a great horror fan and I have to say that this house delivers the goods. Wax House Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game that decides to camp out at night and run into a local weirdo. When they wake up the next morning, they make a cruel discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car. The city is scary and I just have to stop there. Because it is when the really cruel chaos begins. trust me when i say if you are looking for a horror movie, see this, you will love it. It is wonderfully devilish and inventive with its killing scenes, the story is interesting and the characters are decent drawn with the actors giving them gobs of personality. Paris Hilton included who does it quite well with her part. the film is a little on the low side, but it's so much fun and who cares. This movie has to be eaten at the cashier's office, and all horror fans have to share it. Go to the House of Wax, the film that makes the skin peeled, super-glued lips, dead animal bodies, hot wax sprayed on an ever-living person, a finger cut off, a beheading, a pole through the head and much more. I was fortunate enough to witness this movie at the Tribeca Prize, and all the actors were ready to promote the movie. And boy, do they have something to be proud of. House of wax is the most scariest roller coater ride of the year! 9.10
