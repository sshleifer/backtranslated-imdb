Turner and friends are closing in on HBO to the top spot among film-produced producers. This is a nice pace, contemplative thriller of the kind. William Macy is a star, as always, and Adam Arkin offers one of his better performances. A bit more lively than classic Hitchcock, but not as in-your-face as a typical movie of its kind, a light case of murder eases you and never lets go. (Note: I saw a preview copy, which means I didn't have to wait through advertisements. These interruptions can hurt pacing, but you know this will be available on video sometime
