This is one of my favorite series, all categories, all the time. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate enough to get the whole series on VHS a few years ago. I loved it when I saw it back in -91 -92 when I was about 12. I love it so much or more today, which is remarkable considering my (hopefully) improved movie remarks and criticism. Most of the movies I liked are not so happy today, besides the nostalgia actor. This factor is also present here, but there is so much more to Robin of Sherwood than nostalgia. <br /> <br /> There are few bad things in this series. First, the picture and sound quality is uneven, at least in the first few episodes. Fortunately, it gets better. Secondly, you might have wanted a little more blood and realism in the fighting situations, even though I know it was not an option in this case. <br /> <br /> So on to the good stuff! And there are many of them. First of all, Michael Praed is IS Robin Hood. I don't think I've seen him in a single role since then, which only strengthens this fact for me. He delivers such a credible performance as Robin. Jason Connery was unable to replace him. The fact that Michael Praed has not become a major name as an actor is incredible. Or maybe it was his destiny to make this one role perfect and then disappear. <br /> <br /> I love Nickolas Graces Sheriff of Nottingham. He is really not a complex character, but completely rotten. The relationship between him and Gisburne is just fun. In fact, just looking at the Rainault sitting in his throne, bored, sharp, makes me laugh even before he has said anything. Another actor who deserves extra praise is Ray Winstone as Will Scarlet. You can really feel the sadness inside him as well as his hatred for the soldiers who killed his wife. Winstone is an actor who has finally got her well-deserved Hollywood breakthrough (in movies like The Departed and Beowulf). There are also many other good actors here. <br /> <br /> I love the depiction of the robin band. They have fun, play, laugh, you really get a sense of companionship between them, the closeness that comes from a tightly bound group like this. These tape scenes are so important. I think it's UK produced with British actors, has really done better than, for example, the -92 movie version with Kevin Costner, who just feels fake, fake, fake. (Christian Slater as Will Scarlet, move on ..) The cast that can speak English with British accent makes it more credible, and I get the feeling that the actors, as well as the director and authors behind the series can put themselves much more into Robin Hood's gang shoe than an American crew could have. The music is wonderful, Clannad is perfect for the feel of the series. The music is another of the things they just nailed. <br /> <br /> An exciting addition is also the imagination and magic spice that is put into it. It's not over the top, but trustworthy and makes it all better and more interesting. I also love how beautifully the mix of comedy, adventure and drama is mixed. <br /> <br /> These are some of the things that make this series so vibrant and real. It's by far the best Robin Hood version I've ever seen. I will not unpack with "Nothing is forgotten" quote. But one thing that will never be forgotten for me is this amazing Robin Hood story. See it.
