<br /> <br /> The kind of movie that requires too much of the audience, yet disappoints most of them. I think of the Mexican people who (either in an attempt to support Mexican films or willing to see a film casting top Mexican stars) saw it, half of the people went out of the theater when I went to see it, It is certainly not the kind of movie you could expect. I also think of the people from other countries who dared spend 2 hours watching it all the way to the end, "what a piece of shit". To understand Cronica de un desayuno one must be Mexican, and one must be familiar with the low middle classes (or even better, be a part of them). There is nothing unintentional in this movie, the family is and has, at least, many families in Mexico. You have to see it with a big open mind to accept it altogether, it's not the kind of movie you fully understand when you see it. The older brother would not let anyone sit on his red sofa, the sister stays no matter how she wants to leave, the younger brother goes on an excursion, and all he cares about is the yellow radio, the mother must prepare breakfast for the family, regardless how excited and unbearable the situation is. The father came back to who knows how long she allows the mother to live a passionate life that somehow turns out to be short-lived and ends up repeating all of her sons' attitudes ... The stories around the house are surreal (and then the movie ), a travestite looking for his penis, a factory worker and his suicide attempt, subject to his girlfriend, a fat man on the bike after an interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister? wife? mother? ... the music doesn't pretend too much, but it achieves much, no more than a snare drum, cymbal, some strings. Thank you, a movie this one was made and released. One of the best Mexican movies ever, and one of the smaller ones, even by the Mexican ones, no matter how identified they should have felt with it. <br /> <br />
