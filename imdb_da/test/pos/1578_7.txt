Kazuo Komizu strikes again with "Entrails of a Beautiful Woman", the sequel to "Entrails of a Virgin". This time, the story is based on a psychologist (Megumi Ozawa) who decides to assume Yakuza to avenge the suicide of a baptized and raped patient who is won the door one day. When she gets over her head and Yakuza catches her, she learns their insidious spot of doping girls and sells them to slavery. It seems to end badly when she overdoses from the cocaine. But she soon reported another body to be disposed of to be stupid, stupid, stupid ?? "Super Slime Hermaphrodite Zord"! This he, she = it makes meat meat out of the yakuza and saves the day not really. <br /> <br /> Well, it's better than "Entrails of a Virgin", but not much. Most of the movie (67 neighborhoods) consists of rape and sex with fog and the usual main things. Near the end we finally get our gore track with a few cool sequences (like an Alien-inspired penis monster through the stomach scene and a combed suffocation), but it still suffers from a hyper low budget feel that makes fun, but can Don't lift it from z-grade soft horror-core fare.
