"King of Queens" could be divided into two eras. <br /> <br /> The first era of the first few seasons depicted the problems of everyday life for a man and his wife who make it through the wages payslip in the city. <br /> <br /> The second era increased the expansion of the show, addressing the current folk culture and marriage problems with a humorous spin. <br /> <br /> But besides all that ... <br /> <br /> Kevin James, when not making crap comedy with Adam Sandler, is a genius of laughter, and his chemistry with Leah Remini was second to none on television. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller as the psychotic live-in-law father-in-law added his own unique style of quirky humor, and Patton Oswalt as "man-child" Spence Ulchin was amazing, he is a great comedian too) "The King of Queens "was the last sitcom in the 1990s to get out of the air and it is a shame. Now all we have to see is the idiotic sitcoms full of countless actors and actresses whose only appeal is their physical appearance. I like many fans of really fun TV shows are now in mourning
