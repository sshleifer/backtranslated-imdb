I have seen this movie recently for the first time in over 30 years and was very pleasantly surprised. I remembered a movie that captured the mood and feel of Britain in the mid-1960s without falling into the 'Swinging Britain' clichés that so many other films thought they were going to multiply, my memory turned out to be correct. Those who feel that this is like a video game are not completely wrong, but while Andrea Newman was to become famous for risqué television drama, this movie is more in the tradition of 'kitchen sink' movies such as 'Saturday Night and Sunday Morning' 'but with an emphasis on the middle class instead of the working class life. Rod Steiger is excellent as a middle-aged anxiety-ridden lead, unhappy married to a repressed and apparently barren wife (Claire Bloom). The beginning of the technological revolution is the background for the drama, where old values ​​and certainties are challenged. This is the scene of the central character played by Judy Geeson, a role which at that time was a shocking departure from the modern heroine's typical primary behavior. The reversal of roles where the girl assessed her conquests in a small-black book was a precursor to the feminist movement and was criticized at that time for promoting promiscuity among young girls. The irony of this criticism is to be seen in both Claire Bloom and Peggy Ashcroft's characters, both of which are acceptably dissatisfied. Peter Hall made few films and on this evidence it is a great shame. Steiger is exemplary and completely trustworthy and shows why he was so highly regarded
