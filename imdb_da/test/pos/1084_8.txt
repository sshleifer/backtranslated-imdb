Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictional story about a police department in Mumbai, India. Sadhu Agashe is a hard-working, hard-hit policeman who leads up to a plainly-dressed crime fight that names himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police rallies rather than locking them in jail. His loyal officers undoubtedly obey him, but a rift form when one of his officers, Imtiaz, gets frustrated by Sadhu's senior status and secretly competes with him for criminal killings and status. A new recruitment is also pushed into the fraternity, and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to take the lead in his first case. Further change comes in the form of a new policeman who deviates from Sadhus tactics and everyone gets caught in internal politics. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see such a well-favored action thriller from India. The camera work is excellent, the story is told well, and the excitement is high when the drama unfolds. The actor, the pace and the political underworld convince the viewer that they are a fly on the wall that testifies to the blood, sweat and tears of a close-up and personal perception, and that events are based on reality, which is undoubtedly why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film, although it is likely that the director, Shimit Amin, has taken liberties with factual accounts. Nevertheless, Ab Tak Chhappan is a highly polished piece of film making.
