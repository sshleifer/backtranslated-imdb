That's what I thought when I heard about the Casting of Inglorious Basterds. And I'm both from Germany and into movies. This guy is older than 50 and so far he played almost only in mediocre TV shows - and even then he didn't play the main parts. It is clear that no one has ever noticed what he is capable of. Now thanks to QT, he got a shot to change it - and - let's say that - it was a bingo! He is the living proof of what a great Tarrantino caster is. <br /> <br /> By the way: I think it's a good privilege to watch the movie as a German - to understand everything. And the German dialogue is written almost as well as the English. <br /> <br /> Now I could repeat what many others have written here before. I'll say it briefly: Finally, QT is back.
