KITE RUNNER is one of the modern epics that you occasionally adorn. Across two continents, several family generations, and many decades, this movie touches upon countless things, including friendship, love, loss, and ultimately redemption. It's the driver is Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi), a native Afghan boy who often plays with the hired help; mainly young Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), a Hazara boy whose family seems to be inferior to the ruling Afghans. But the two constitute a bond of friendship based on education (Amir teaches Hassan to read), proximity to Amir's house, and of course, kite flying. But bad times are coming for the city of Kabul The Communists are invading, and Amir and Hassan are separated by an impossible brutal act of prejudice by an Afghan boy against Hassan. The two must never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Amir's father runs to get himself and his son out of Afghanistan, and finally find their way to America. Here they establish a petrol station and live hand in hand by selling in niche markets. And as Amir's father gradually becomes ill, a new revelation will strike Amir's heart; one that he cannot ignore and requires his return to his beloved cabul. <br /> <br /> A study of friendship, war and reconciliation, Kite Runner is truly a fantastic piece of cinema. The story is never spoken in English when we are in a foreign country and only broken English when we are in America. This was refreshing and lent to a realism. <br /> <br /> The action was relative to the best you want to see. Special note should be made by Homayoun Ershadi, who plays Baba, Amir's carefree father and strong patriarch. Also, Khalid Abdalla, when the older Amir played well, especially when returning to Kabul to find it in ruins; quite contrast from when he had left. The pharmacy in Afghanistan during the Amir's flight and the ultimate return is nothing short of breathtaking with snow-capped peaks that will make your mouth relax (I'm not sure exactly which mountain range they used in the movie, but anywhere I want to go There and film it yourself!) But it's not the movie or the performance of one or two people that makes this movie a success. It's a simple story told very well that makes it worth watching movie recorders. Highly recommended.
