The most amazing movie I've ever seen. I didn't read the programming and I accidentally talked to the movie. I thought it was a real documentary, and I felt sick of what I saw. I only found out that it was a movie after it was finished, and I looked on the Internet for more information on "Penalty Park" in the United States. It felt incredibly real, and it is easy to believe that this really happened in the US if you are from Europe. I must admit that I felt really anti-American after watching the movie and before I found out that it didn't really happen that way.
