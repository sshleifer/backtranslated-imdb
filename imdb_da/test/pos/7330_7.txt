I like this movie. I can be biased because I love dolphins. But my 3 and 4 years. Old will sit and watch the whole movie .... It's not Oscar material, but absolutely entertaining. Dolphin cinematography is well done with a beautiful backdrop of ocean scenery and sunsets. My favorite scene is when Flipper "pops" the popcorn out of the wandering Sandy in the head. It's a really fun moment that makes me laugh every time. On the other hand, the villainous slamming of the dinghy (forgetting his name) is a bit difficult to take. And the shark scene is far from reality. Question: Do Dolphins Make So Much Noise? Or is there a serious duplication here? Bottom line: My kids like it and it keeps recycling through our video recorder.
