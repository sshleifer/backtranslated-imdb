I watched the movie yesterday and really enjoyed it. Although there were several clues that I could realize after seeing it again, I couldn't awaken the Dow-Dawn case. Maybe it was my carelessness. A woman's subconscious was made concrete with personalization. "Let me get out of the movie's key phrase. Let me start from the deep depth of your brain, and we will both be free. A discrete film that forces the boundaries of human consciousness and brain. Anyone who has seen the 'machinist' , would realize the similarities of breaking dawn. A man who could not escape from his conscience (again a psychological and abstract concept) meets it in a human body.And he just wants to be free to accept and realize that there is no is some opportunity to escape. Also I will mention about the notions of 'breking dawn's stuffs.
