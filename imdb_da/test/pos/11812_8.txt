I really liked the movie, thought it was very entertaining as well as dramatic. But I just had a question about the music being the movie. I have not been able to find any kind of soundtrack (if there is even one). And specifically, I wondered if anyone could tell me the name of the song that plays while the boys go down the river on their way to New Orleans? I thought it was something like "My Great Escape", but I have searched the Internet, books, pretty much everything I would like to try, and I just can't find it anywhere. If anyone could help it, it would be much appreciated. Thanks.
