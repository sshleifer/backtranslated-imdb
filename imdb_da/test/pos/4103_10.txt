I am surprised that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not deliver. I've been watching this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. You can get all kinds of movies in line ... old movies, new movies ... but it's all targeted to a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Perhaps if enough people want to write in, the copyright holder will get a clue. It's time for this to happen. Yes, it's date, but it's also the Wizard of OZ. It does not seem that this should be so difficult. So for now I will continue to see these illegal copies on search engines like many others.
