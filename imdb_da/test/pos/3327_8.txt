"Side Show" is one of the strangest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places but not as shocking as the trailer makes it seem (The Trailer for this movie shows all the gory parts). Also the plays and visual effects are well finished. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of Horror Movies like this will check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks.
