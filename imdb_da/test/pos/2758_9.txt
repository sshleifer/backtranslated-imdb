Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2x is not very different from the previous games (except Tony Hawk 3). The only new feature highlighted in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is the new range of levels and tweaked graphics. Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2x offers a new career mode and it's 2x career. The 2x career is basically Tony Hawk's 1 career, because there are only about five challenges per level. If you missed Tony Hawk 1 and 2, I suggest you buy Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, but if you've played the first two games, you still have to try it. Overall, there is really nothing new, but it is still very fun to go through the game. Hopefully this review will benefit your needs. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 out of 10 Overall, clean pictures are not one of Tony Hawks Pro Skater's 2x main features. The atmosphere has changed a lot from Tony Hawk 1 and 2, and the sign models look a little better. Looking back at Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 on the old PS1, the old graphics thought badly through your head. In Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2x, the graphics are made much better. The character models are no longer filled with jaggys, the textures are more smooth, but not to any great extent. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x's images do not compare to Tony Hawk 3's graphics, but Activision would probably not make Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2x extraordinary graphics. Overall, the graphics deserve an average score of 7 because they haven't put the full effect of the Xbox into use here. Graphics are beautiful and clean, that's all I have to say. Sound: 8 out of 10 The sound effects do not deliver much to the imagination, but the skateboards jump off the ground sounds good. The main reason I gave the sound factor a rating was because you are not required to listen to the Tony Hawk soundtrack below average because there is a custom audio track feature. The sound effects sound much better than the sounds in Tony Hawk 1 and 2, primarily because it's more obvious and just the fact that everything sounds good. One of the main reasons I bought this game is because of the custom soundtrack. Grind the sound effects still sound the same as the first two games, just a little fine-tuned. One of the major issues with the sound factor is that if the song is over, it will NOT continue to the next track, the song you just listened to will only play again. I do not like the soundtrack in the game, but as I said, you are not obliged to listen to it. <br /> <br /> Checks: 10 out of 10 Checks are the best at Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2x. The control setup is wonderfully comfortable and easy to get used to. Back on Playstation days, people thought the controls were the best ever, but 2x seems to have done a better job with the Xbox control. Surprisingly, it is very easy to use the control stick to perform tricks. Activision has done a good job with Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2x control. They have made the Xbox controller the best for Tony Hawk games. You will not be disappointed with the control style and it is a guarantee. Game Play: 10 out of 10 Without Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2x being pretty much Tony Hawk 1 and 2 put together, the game is still incredibly fun. The game's factor has been changed a bit. This time you get much more air than in the first two games, and it is much easier to perform tricks. In Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2x, each character has three career methods consisting of Tony Hawk 1 career, Tony Hawk 2 career and 2x career. Tony Hawk 1 career is pretty easy because in the first game you get nothing to air. The Tony Hawk 2 career delivers the same amount of difficulty as the Playstation version did. The only amount of difficulty that applies to the 2x career is finding out where all things are, but after you have done so, 2x career is not at all difficult. In the 2x career, there are a total of 3 levels, and the first two levels are finding the secret bands, collecting S-K-A-T-E, and doing whatever else is needed for that level. The third level out of the three is the level of competition where you have to get a certain number of points to get the gold. On the first two levels, they are secret bands and collect the letters S-K-A-T-E found in both. Overall, Tony Hawks Pro Skater maintains 2x the old Tony Hawk's Pro Skater vibe. <br /> <br /> History: - <br /> Fun Factor: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2x is by far, the most fun game on Xbox today. I've played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 and back then I didn't like them, but Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2x is for some reason really fun. There really isn't much to say, except that Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2x is by far the best game on Xbox today. One problem is that if you have already gone through the game once, you will play it a few times, but it will be repeated. Replay Value: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x provides a high amount of playback value. There are many cheats to unlock and many character videos. Overall, Tony Hawks Pro Skater has 2x lots of playback value, especially because it's so much fun. <br /> <br /> Best feature: You are not required to listen to the crappy in-game soundtrack. The worst move: The custom soundtrack is a bit messy. Final Declaration: Many people have previously complained that they did not like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x because there is nothing new, but they should stop complaining because you get a lot of games for $ 50.00. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 out of 10. Sound: 8 out of 10. Control: 10 out of 10. Game play: 10 out of 10. History: N / A Fun factor: 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Overall score: 9 out of 10.
