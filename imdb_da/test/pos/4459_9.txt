Being an experienced fan of Italian thrillers and directors Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado, I thought of Lucio Fulci as an overrated hack. I had seen The Beyond, which I think is totally overrated, I found The New York Ripper to be simply appalling and I didn't particularly like The House By the Cemetery. These three films left me to conclude that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian filmmakers. But my stubbornness rules and I had to check out several of his films. The City of the Living Dead was a movie I found very interesting, but not a torture a duck is almost a masterpiece. Seen in a small town on the Italian landscape in a repressive religious community where young boys are murdered. The authorities are clueless about who is behind these crimes, especially after their primary suspect has been cleared. An avid young reporter along with a rather dull girl (who seduces young boys) examines and eventually comes to the bottom of it. <br /> <br /> Brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good cast (not always the case with 70 Italian thrillers) doesn't make torture a duck a crackling good thriller. The plot is well constructed, not easily figured out, and the end is very satisfactory. Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of oppression and guilt in a very unforgiving and ignorant society and creates some very strong visuals, especially in a scene where a woman is killed by some local townspeople. Fulci's social comments on religion and innocence are quite brave, and all aspects are well managed. Thinking of his zombie flicks and his ultra-violent giallo New York Ripper, it's great how well he balances his criticism with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point. So far I have not seen any Fulci movies made as professional as this one. <br /> <br /> Although you are not a traditional giallo movie, Duckling has many of the genre's brands. Fulci shows complete control over the format, only once overboard with a convincing gore moment, but generally he seems to be even better at making mysteries than full blown gore epics. The extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really pack a blow. <br /> <br /> So far you can't torture a duck, Fulci's best movie is in my opinion. Edgy social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a crackling good mystery to start.
