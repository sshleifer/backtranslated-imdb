Both the book and the film are excellent in themselves. They differ a little, but it does not improve and detract from what is an excellent script and act. The historic atmosphere, the young girl looking for love, the stunning backdrop of the music story and the journey to the lesbian world of London in the early twentieth century make this a unique movie. Andrew Davies as a scriptwriter distinguishes himself as he writes this lesbian love story with such sensitivity. Rachael Sterling and Keeley Hawes are both excellent actresses and give these parts their best. The rest of the casting is very good. If there were more than 10 out of 10 I would give it!
