Don't look at the base This little forgotten gem has a special place in my heart and on the Video Nasties List. The flute-sitar-rattle box soundtrack is classic. The protagonist, although warmer than most low-budget starlets, is a fairly standard low budget management. Doctor Masters character is well-written and well-acted. Some of the smaller characters are a little stupid, but add to the film's nostalgia. It's Campy. I'm not trying to lie. The character that makes this big is a Faulknarian Man-Child called Sam, one of the patients in this sanitarium who has gone wrong. Gore is pretty standard, though I think the blood color is amazing. It's so .. Red. This movie, I think, was received badly by the advertising program. Some fun little, little ad executive got his scary hands on it and thought "let's tear off the AD campaign to the last house on the left, it goes well". Small chumps like this have destroyed the movie world. All balls and no brain. Also, the editor may or may not have been an alcoholic. Maybe everyone is intoxicated. You will see what I mean. A little small note. Don't buy this from the Wally-Mart dollar rack. They have cut it to and unbearable level. Try to find the longest cut you can.
