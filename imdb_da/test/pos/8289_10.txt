To this day there is no movie I have seen several times than The Chipmunk Adventure, and no movie has given me more happiness. It is by no means the greatest movie or even the greatest animated movie, but for an 8 year old girl in 1988 it was the coolest, funniest and most exciting movie ever! I'm still as impressed today with the musical tracks, each one enduring song with wonderfully dramatic lyrics in the epic tradition of the 80s pop (think Pat Benetar on helium, only catch). <br /> <br /> The controversy has touched on the blatantly suggestive tone of Chipette's song "Gettin 'Lucky With You", which for me seemed much more innocent at the time. But seeing it as a rational adult, I can fully understand the concern; you have three young girls in skimpy harem outfits passionately proclaiming luck is what it is about. The chipettes were determined sexualized for this film. <br /> <br /> But this controversial issue doesn't even come close to overshadowing Chipmunks otherwise fabulous feature-length animated adventure, I encourage both parents and childless adults to control this movie. Especially if you were a child in the eighties / early 90s like me. :-)
