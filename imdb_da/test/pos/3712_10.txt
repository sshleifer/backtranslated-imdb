A beautiful photographed and paced short film. It emotionally captures the feelings of this family and much of the country in the period just before and after Pearl Harbor. I appreciated the visual appearance of the film - naturalistic and at the same time poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd. <br /> <br /> Though a family movie becomes the story never maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe in the motivation that drives the young boy into his odyssey. I understand the younger brother's love for his older brother and do not ask why he is setting out to do what he does. I understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother during this time of crisis. The child is hard and the performance of Jonathan Furr is amazing, which is the veteran of Ron Perlman.
