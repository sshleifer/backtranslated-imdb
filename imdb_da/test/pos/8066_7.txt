Mary Pickford plays Annie Rooney - the daughter of a policeman living in the difficult part of town. She is a hard and tumble young lady of indefinite age (somewhere between 12 and 16) who loves to scrape but down deep has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> This is a very typical movie for Mary Pickford. Like so many of her films, she plays a young girl - even though she was nearly 40 when she made LITTLE ANNIE ROONEY. And like many other stories, she was both brave and courageous. As a result, I had a strong sense of déjà vu. Now, if you haven't seen her other movies, it's not a problem. However, she basically plays a character like the one in SPARROWS or DADDY LONG LEGS - although these two other films are much better. Now it is not to say that this is a bad movie - just that is certainly not among her best work - mainly because of a rather "schmaltzy" story that is very heavy in mood but not very convincing. Entertaining but not essential view unless you are a big fan of the silents.
