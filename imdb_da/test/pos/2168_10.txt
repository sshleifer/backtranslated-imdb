Black Scorpion is a fun flip about a groovy female super hero who wears leather pants and runs a car that can morph into his snazzy armored Scorpion Mobile. She is fighting the evil Breathtaker and all this is an excellent recipe for a good time IMHO. I loved a little about her having to say "Yo" to get the car's computer to take orders! Breathtaker is so bad he will give the whole city asthma! It's all so over the top, and that's the beauty of it! The scene where Black Scorpion "attacks" her partner steals the show. You know it when you see it. This DVD also has a fun interview with Joan Severance. She's a doll. Black Scorpion is a fun DVD. Loved it!
