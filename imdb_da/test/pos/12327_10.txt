This is my favorite movie all the time. And I always think of it as John Houston's claim. <br /> <br /> I must have seen it at least 20 times and never tired of it. The mood, the manuscript, the song, the dinner, it's like being invited to someone else's home and observing the events and not being able to attend even if you want ... It's a rare treasure, this movie, and I can't write enough praise for it. It's cast incredibly well, with a pair of Abbey Theater faces and also Frank Patterson's wonderful tenor voice. Lady Gregory's recited in the movie is one of the most moving ever written. Anjelica's scene goes down the stairs as she listens to the song, is one of the best performances seen every time on film. I cry every time I see it .. for all the right reasons. <br /> <br /> We've all had love lost at an early age and crying for our young hopeful self. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Donal McCann appeared in too few films, he just loved stage work and stuck to it, and it is our loss that we do not have any of his films on film as he does so much with this delicate role in expressing and portraying a deep love for his wife who is never reciprocated, and he conveys such inner sadness by knowing this. <br /> <br /> If you want your movie actions and plot packed, avoid this, there really is no beginning, middle or end just an objective on the characters of a dinner party in Dublin 80 years ago and all the little ones shades and shadows of the personalities portrayed so beautifully. <br /> <br /> Bravo to anyone involved in this production. 10 out of 10
