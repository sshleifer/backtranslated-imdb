The second "Mr. Eco" episode has some less interesting flashbacks than the first ("The 23rd Psalm"), but in almost all other departments, it is one of the best episodes in Season 2 that promotes the series mythology / background as as well as the signs. A new Dharma Initiative Station - The Pearl - has been discovered by Locke and Eko, and the orientation film they find and see inside completes Locke's transformation from a believer ("Orientation" - after the movie's ending: "We want to see it again "to a doubt (" SOS "-" Did you shoot that button, Henry? I need to know ") to a non-believer ("? "- after the movie's conclusion:" Do you want to see it again? - "No Terry O'Quinn's performance is powerful as usual ("every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as the button"). Meanwhile, Eko takes his place as the man who becomes confident that he was brought on the island as part of his true destiny, which must continue to press the button. Other high points of "?" are an amazing, unique dream sequence where person A has the dream of being person B (this is the kind of bold idea that LOST's current season could use much more), and the enchanting scene of Libby's last word f Ear h is death, and the way Jack and Hurley may not know his true meaning. *** 1/2 out of 4.
