Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a teacher who is getting married. Then one of his former students wins an Oscar for a movie where he plays a gay soldier and thanks Howard in his acceptance speech, where he is also gay! This film follows the aftermath of journalists coming down to Howard's village, and he is trying to convince everyone he is right. <br /> <br /> I love this movie! Kevin Kline is wonderful, it has some really fun moments, and it always makes me feel great with a huge smile on my face. That's why it's a movie I enjoy watching as often as possible. If you haven't seen it, you'll miss out!
