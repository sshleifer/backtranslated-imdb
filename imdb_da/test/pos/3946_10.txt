The weakness here comes from the confusing storytelling, the plots often come out of nothing. But it really didn't matter because I still enjoyed it to its fullest extent. When you actually accept that these movies should not be taken seriously, you will enjoy it even more. It's basically a love story, a confusing at first, but as it develops, it's really worth something. Sure it has been done so many times before, but the complicated version of this is quite inspiring and touching. <br /> <br /> Over the top fantasy and cgi were overwhelming at first, but I still enjoyed its purpose. And people stopped looking at how it borrowed from other movies !! Guess what we know !! And it's not really because its purpose was to humor and entertain. Sometimes people have to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start cheating. Comparing this with Hollywood standards is completely stupid and ignorant. It is a completely different style and audience. As far as I'm concerned, the best movies I've fostered are my eyes from eastern producers and directors. There is your police story 4, shaolin football, kung fu hustle, dragon tiger port, legman's hat, hero, crouching tiger etc. I for one like this movie and hail from the Philippines, USA, England, Libya and now Australia, I will always be interested in these types of movies. Now try to judge my perception, but I warn you that I can see things from the 5 countries I have lived in. So you are better than experienced and open.
