I'm rarely a part of movies about smart teens who have authority issues, but "Toy Soldiers" have grown on me with repetitive views. This is just as much a movie about Billy Carpets growing up and becoming an adult as something else, and I give credit to Sean Astin and author / director Daniel Petrie Jr. that they don't make much of it, but just let it unfold and sneak at you. The comradeship about the friends of Carpets, their grief over Joey's death, and their joy over their survival, are all in motion. And I have to admit that I take some patriotic (and perhaps a little reptilian) joy when the US Army guys finally come in and just kick some drug-terrorist bumps. Ooh-rah, General Kramer! And the heroic Robert Folk score is the cherry on top. I'm sure I could find a hundred reasons not to like "Toy Soldiers", but as long as we don't take it seriously, I don't see the need. This is one of the most entertaining "bad" movies in my pantheon.
