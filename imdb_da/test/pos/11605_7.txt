I agree with what mallicka.b has said. The film is portrayed in a way that appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. Feelings are not conveyed correctly. I think a few not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. In my opinion, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes she looks a little funny, which is not ultimately what the film should have portrayed. I also noticed a little overpowering in some of her scenes. I'm a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) Can't help it; sorry. 'Raincoat' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not at all impressed.
