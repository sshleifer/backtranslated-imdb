I was really surprised to see that, unlike most documentaries, this was written, directed and produced by a film critic - Richard Schickel. Most of the times I know of where film critics had great influence on movies, the films show themselves to be bombs (Rex Reed starring "Myra Breckenridge" and Roger Ebert writing "Beyond Doll of the Dolls" is top notch examples). But in this case, the critics' power is used for good and not evil - and the results are better (although it doesn't say much, since the movies I just mentioned are among the worst movies ever made). <Br /> <br /> As for the documentary, it is reported by Clint Eastwood (a pretty good choice) and manages to discuss his long career - from his quiet days to his death in the early 1960s. The only negatives and they are small are that the film is very short (like most movie documentaries) and there is very little about Gary Cooper as a human being - you really don't learn much about his life. But as a good overview of his film, it works very well.
