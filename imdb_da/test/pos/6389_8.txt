The Psychopath (1973) A trip down memory path. I watched this movie many years ago on an old black and white t.v. A children's show host Mr. Rabbey pays tribute to the brutal abuse that parents are imposing on their kiddie fans. Sir. Rabbey (who looks like he's always losing it) eventually breaks and decides to take a hunting trip. Beware of bad parents because Mr Rabbey is on prowl! What happens next is invaluable. However, trying to find this movie will be a little bit. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie remarkable was that Joe "Maniac" Spinell made a short promo for a movie based on this. In his unfinished movie he plays Mr Robbie, and so on. clown (resembling a pudgy out of shape Edward James Olmos) who wields his young fans child abuse by going after their parents. Unfortunately, Mr. Spinell never find the means to complete the project. The film was titled Maniac II: "Mister Robbie". The Rabbey or Robbie similarities are too close to comfort. Pretty violent for a P.G. movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
