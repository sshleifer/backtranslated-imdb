I must admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and fear. Louis de Bernier's bestselling game is one of my favorites, and anyone who has read it will realize that there is nothing in hell that any screen customization can be 100% faithful. <br /> <br /> Throughout, I found myself convinced that the movie was unsuccessful and had removed the book's plot as far as making it superfluous. However, the end is much better than in the short story, and I couldn't stop thinking about the movie afterwards. Still, I understood that the pluses (John Toll's magnificent filmography, Stephen Warbeck's great score, etc.) did not offset my original negatives (Cages miscasting, a heavily diluted script). But two days later, again to see Corelli, and even though it wasn't perfect, I must admit now that the movie is the best one could have expected. In fact, Cage is brilliant in a role that even the Berniere was worried was not a fully rounded character: his carefree spirit, allowing space for shattered remorse, is the spot on and complements the amazing double action of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt perfectly. David Morrissey is quietly effective as Weber, the Nazi officer trying to unite his feelings for his newly found Italian friends and his inbred superiority complex to those around him. And the fine Greek-Italian support cast brings the Bernier's sun-tanned world of Cepholonia alive. <br /> <br /> When I leave the cinema the second time, I finally release my passion for the novel, which prevented me from fully appreciating the story of WW2 Cepholonia on cinematic terms. My hat goes to John Madden, who, despite the almost expected critical drubbing he receives from British critics (any director who has been a great success as Shakespeare in Love behind them, is always a goal for those moody ninnies!) , Has managed to transfer a terrific book to the big screen with such a heart, enlist and humanity (the core virtues of the novel) that he has created another classical love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has settled couple of years from now. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the book, like me, it's hard, but don't try to make the same mistake on your first impression. Try deleting the book from your heart for two hours, bathing yourself in the glorious Mediterranean atmosphere, and discovering Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, Dr Iannis, as if for the first time (pretending to see something made from an original manuscript) and I guarantee that You will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> In fact, you are eagerly awaiting your own copy of this great video or DVD movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
