The details of The Big Trail were so incredible that I felt the movie was made at the time it represents. I have never seen carts that were so real! They were large, full of accessories, and even felt as if they were full of details under the canvas covers that should never be seen. Every alley, every bottom there was every splinter there. Modern computer technology could never restore the scenes of the many wagons as they move across land or circle to ward off the Indians. The wagons were all real, individual vehicles, each with its own real team of horses or bulls. <br /> <br /> The actors' clothing could not have felt more genuine. With the exception of John Wayne's buckskin outfit and Marguerite Churchill's gorgeous dress, the garments were very ordinary, tattered or dirty in an authentic-looking fashion. Many of the actors and actors were born before electricity and indoor plumbing were common, and they must have felt safe with the surroundings. All the Indians were genuine Indians rather than white extras that were colored. <br /> <br /> Women in the old vest had to be robust because there was a lot of work. In each scene showing work done by the people of the lorry, women are shown by chopping wood, tail logs, etc. This realism was so natural that it did not come across as a statement of today's role rather than a fact of survival. Plot of revenge and romance is played well. Nothing is exaggerated or overplayed. <br /> <br /> Something was lost during the 1930s in Hollywood. As much as I love the fake nature and the controlled environment of old movies, The Big Trail manages to feel real above all else. The more I see big budget films in the silent era, the more I like them. I can think of few films from the 1930s that I have seen that correspond to the greatness of the best of the 1920s. If there were home videos made during the carriage time, The Big Trail is what they would look like.
