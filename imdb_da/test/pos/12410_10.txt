My wife and I loved this movie. Smart dialogue, beautiful figures, smart plot construction. Pacing in this movie is non-stop. Couldn't even get to the kitchen for some munchies. We have never seen Corey Feldman so much fun. Taylor Nichols plays a good Fed ... my wife loves him on the "married man" HBO show. The ensembles were all strong. Twist at the end had us cheering. That's why we give this movie a "Standing O."
