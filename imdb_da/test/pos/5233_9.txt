This movie is important to those of us interested in Western history because it uses authentic techniques in its production. The scenes of the watch train are extremely authentic; As far as I know, it contains the only scenes ever filmed and illustrates the techniques of river crossings by a bluff. The horses and mules must be lowered to the river and the wagons drop by ropes and drums. The scene is such that I could see it again and again, just trying to get a feel for what a cross was like ... and the early travelers did it over and over while crossing the country. <br /> <br /> The melodrama aside, this image is as authentic in dress and style as they come and worth looking at it alone.
