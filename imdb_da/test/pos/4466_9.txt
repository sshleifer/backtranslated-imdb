I tend to be furious when I hear about Lucio Fulci's reputation as director. All too often he is categorized as a non-talented filmmaker, only to shock and awaken the entire audience with pictures of pure gore. True, his film contains more explicit bias and illness as your average ordinary American production, but his films are always of wide range and the plots are cruel morbid. Don't Torture A Duck Is Another Story! This movie is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I dare easily call this movie a masterpiece? It is an old-fashioned giallo that includes all the glorious aspects of true horror. The film shows the quest for an inhuman serial killer in a small Italian mountain town. The bodies of 3 young boys have been found, terribly mutilated. There are quite a few pseudo-madmen in town, but each track leads to nowhere. Among the suspects is a greedy bum and a scary woman obsessed with witchery and voodoo. Fulci knows, as a true mastermind, to find the right scary tone for his movie. He portrays the small town as a claustrophobic and inevitable setting of macabre events, supported by a giddy soundtrack. Fulci also evolves as a genius storyteller here. The script is always a step ahead of you, and the complex plot will mislead you more than once. In other words, this is a unique giallo (horror slash murder mystery). Gore is not presented as grotesque and explicit as in Lucio's later milestones (among them the legendary Zombie 2, The Beyond and New York Ripper), although there are still a few nausea and hard-to-see shock sequences shown. <br /> <br /> Not a torture a Duckling is the most compelling and effective performance Lucio Fulci has ever performed, and is easily placed among the largest Italian horror movies ever made. Right next to the masterpieces made by Mario Bava and Dario Argento. The movie is fascinating from start to finish, some plot aspects are alarmingly realistic and the excitement is adrenaline rushing at any time! One must watch for horror fans and an absolute priority for Italian shock lovers!
