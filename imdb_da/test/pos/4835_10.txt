I looked back at the "Path to Paradise" premiere and was stunned by the dramatic license and all. I lived in NYC (Brooklyn) for a few years and remembered. Today we see the link to groups like Al-Queda, Hamas and Islamic jihad, as a warning not recognized by our government. For I am guilty of our bureaucracy and leaders. 9.11.01 was a new tactic to pay tribute to two of our branches of the gov't, and there is no excuse for our government to prevent it, period. "Path to Paradise" was only a dramatic display of the '93 preview and no one used. Now, nearly 3,000 deaths are struggling later and years after we find an answer that is decades to resolve.
