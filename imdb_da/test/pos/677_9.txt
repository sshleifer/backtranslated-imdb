When I first saw this movie it was around 1956, and although I saw it again recently, I haven't changed it. I think it was Robert Ryan's best movie because he portrayed someone as my father, and he was the schizophrenic in real life (my father), even though he never killed anyone, but was more affected during World War II that made him worse. Having to humor him just to get past and get through the day was so apt. (My mother and brother had to do that). When I saw Robert Ryan from this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of person and I was impressed.
