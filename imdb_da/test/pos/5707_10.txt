As a long-term resident of Western Pa, I have an intimate knowledge of this subject and found it REGFRESHING to be so authentic captured on movies! Kudos to the producers of this epic !!! And what a great heritage for school children in the years to come. <br /> <br /> The attention to detail and realistic depiction of this complicated web of events make it a unique production. <br /> <br /> The viewers find themselves fascinated by the story and fascinated by the story. <br /> <br /> Grahame Greene is magnificent as the presenter. <br /> <br /> BRAVO !!!
