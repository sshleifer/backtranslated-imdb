I just witnessed a movie that should of all rights be feed to another installment MOW on Lifetime ... but trust Irish to keep it from anything but saccharine. The set up all but SCREAMS "Here's a message about what's really important in life", but the execution was well into "Let's see what we can get away with here." It helps to have two great players in the leaders - James McAvoy (like Rory) and Stephen Robertson (like Michael). While Rory is offered as the closest saintly - not against the language and attitude, he is "the life force" of this piece and could easily have been insufficient in his ultimate "caring" attitude - McAvoy keeps him sharp enough to keep him from being too sweet. But the revelation is Stephen Robertson as Michael. Not since Leonardo Di Caprio in "... Gilbert Grape" has anyone so perfectly caught a person with a disorder that I began to believe he was really an actor with cerebral palsy. And his eyes ... my God, he can tear you apart with them. <br /> <br /> This movie is to rewrite Rory, f **** n 'amazing. Go see it. Take a box of Kleenex and enjoy every well-deserved tear ... and laugh.
