Saboteur is a 1942 film, partly aimed at getting American support for the war against Nazi Germany. Propaganda or not, it's great entertainment. The leading actors are Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, although director Alfred Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck in the roles, which would have given the movie more stature. This is a great movie anyway with Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, bringing their own style to the characters. As in other Hitchcock films, we see the director's disregard for the social suave and the well-heeled. He often portrayed spies and foreign agents as a lovely upper-class music, while at the same time sniffing against democratic values ​​and concepts as guilty until they appeared innocent. These upper crust traps are the last thing the police pursue or even suspect. Hitchcock had a lifelong mistrust of the police. He wanted to raise the lighthouse, the bungler, and the guy who didn't care too much. You can see him wanting Gary Cooper as an icon in the Frank Capra form. Nevertheless, Bob Cummings puts his own stamp on the boy-next door and works well in the role. Priscilla Lane, like the spunky female lead, comes out as the all-American girl who can do pretty well when tested. Robert Cummings, defense officer Barry Kane, is framed for a bombing that kills his best friend. This leads to a cross-country hunting scene reminiscent of other Hitchcock heroes on the run. Hitchcock reiterates some of the well-established formulas of previous films - the reluctant woman drawn into the action, for example. Madeleine Carroll in 39 steps and risking her life to evade the authorities on his heels. We see scenes in America when Kane tries to find the real culprit in the bombing he is accused of. We see rivers, bridges, backwoods cabins, truckers, Hoover Dam and finally, New York City. New York is an appropriate backdrop for climax as we walk from Rockefeller Center to ocean liners (with a cut to the Normandy ship) and the grand finale of the Statue of Liberty. Great movie with uninterrupted action. Do not miss it.
