Chokher Bali ?? A passion game. <br /> <br /> Based on Rabindranath Tagore's novel of the same name, this is a classic tale of deception, adultery and exploitation of relationships. Director Rituparno Ghosh transformed the Nobel Laureates' acclaimed literature into a wonderful visual experience in 1900 Bengal. <br /> <br /> Tagore's history deals with Bengali society with its central character, the rebellious widow who wants to live his own life. We have entered the picturesque part of Bengal, where we meet our heroine, the beautiful young widow Binodini (Aishwarya Rai). <br /> <br /> Despite her beautiful appearance, two beautiful men, the rich Mahindra (Prosenjit Chatterji) and his friend Behari (Toto Roychowdhury) refused to marry her. <br /> <br /> Mahindra chooses a naive Ashalata (Raima Sen) over Binodini and marries her. Left behind the country life, the free sprouted Binodini Mahindra's mother accompanies Calcutta as caretaker. Soon her friendship with Ashalata is flourishing. It seems that the two address each other as 'Chokher Bali' (sand in the eyes), sharing a lasting bond. The English-speaking Binodini captures a special place in the house. But soon she unmasked her real face. Manipulating benign Ashlata, Binodini comes closer to Mahindra and fulfills his sexual desires. <br /> <br /> When she is thrown out of Mahindra's furious mother, Binodini seeks comfort from a restrained Behari. The remainder of the story shows how the lives of these four characters cross and culminate in an unthinkable climax? Aishwarya goes through the role of a manipulative, rebellious lady who still wins the viewer's sympathy with the elegance of a ballet dancer. The other leading artists ¨C Prosenjit Chatterjee, Raima Sen and Toto Roychowdhury are just as brilliant when they apply their characters. While Tagore wrote this 'mug-breaking' story at the beginning of the 20th century, the very idea of ​​widow marriage was a taboo, even among the upper classes! In explaining the nations' freedom movement in parallel, the author claims the importance of individual freedom from the bound life. Kudos to the art director who gave life to the band in the early 20th century and welcomed the filmmaker to capture these sets of enlistments. This 'Passion Game' from Tagore has been carefully converted to the screen of the best movie maker without losing its originality.
