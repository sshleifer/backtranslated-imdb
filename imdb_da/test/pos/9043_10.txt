An unwarranted neglected classic, "Intruder in the Dust", is one of the 1940's great films, which unfortunately have settled in ambiguity. Based on a story by William Faulker and shot in his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi "Intruder" tells the story of Lucas Beauchamp (the game of great dignity by Juano Hernandez), a black man unfairly accused of the murder of a local white man, and a white boy (Claude Jarman, Jr.), using this situation as an opportunity to pay a previous debt to Beauchamp. Great play, especially of two great character actors, Porter Hall (as the father of death) and Elizabeth Patterson (best known as Mrs. Trumbull on "I Love Lucy") as an old woman willing to stand against the mayors to see the real Is done. This fair, tense and sincere study of racialototry deserves to be seen more.
