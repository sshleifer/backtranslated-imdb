Chucky is back ... and it's time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this rate, the camp is back. This was the more cruel in this series so far. It has some good phrases and some good action scenes. <br /> <br /> This one was by far the most fun of the series, and successfully, if it accidentally bridges the gap between sheer horror and horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It will be a hoot! <br /> <br /> "Jesus, the music scene has gone to h3ll since I've been dead!" Chucky <br /> <br /> We needed levity as the doll stuff gets old. The added comic element and the better action scenes bring it to the quality of the first, as the idea was fresh and new-ish. <br /> <br /> 6.8 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
