As a teenager I watched this movie every time it was on TV (and it was on a lot) because of its witty, appealing teenage humor. It may not be what the critics consider to be 4-star viewing, but I love it for what it is - a fun comedy aimed at delighting the audience. The teenage actors are of my generation (probably why I love the movie so much) and were like a fantasy cast of everyone's favorite TV shows in the early 90s - Full House, Family Matters, Fresh Prince - all the shows were represented and the result was probably the best teens movie in the 90s. Although it may not include the high doses of naked and violence that so many teenage film printers consider essential to the success of the young demographic (or perhaps because of its absence), I highly recommend it to pre-teens and teens everywhere.
