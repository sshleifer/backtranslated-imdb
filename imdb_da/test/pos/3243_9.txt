Heath Ledgers, who appear in this movie, really bugs me, but generally it's a good watch. Bryan Brown is excellent when I don't usually like him, but then his whole gang is a good job. Jimmy is a rude wannabe gangster who can't seem to do anything right (SPOILERS: loses pandas money, accos car and almost bumbles a bank robbery) but still comes out on top. <br /> <br /> did not know what the two children were in it for the start but they tie some storylines together nicely. All in all, a wonderfully fine piece of Australian cinema 9/10
