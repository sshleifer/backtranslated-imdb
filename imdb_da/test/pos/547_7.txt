The main attraction everywhere, but here is the amazing achievement of Natalie Portman. She gave her pretty grateful character very much appreciated emotional depth. Susan Sarandon, a fine actress, is appropriately sincere as a mother figure. I thought the calf between the two stars was credible, a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involved script. I'm not saying the script was bad in any way, I'm just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times. I don't think it was the writer's fault. The movie suffers from being prolonged and sometimes unfocused in the longer scenes. The movie looks beautiful, with a good direction and excellent performance. All in all, you can probably see, but maybe more to an older audience. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
