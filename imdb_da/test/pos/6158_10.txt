Along with having minor flaws in it, this movie is a masterpiece, and definitely the best war movie I've seen. Not mentioning it is one of the best movies I've seen in all genres. I may have written this to No Man's Land before, but now I think it's better. It is very sad at the end and I almost cried for the two shocking scenes that came within 5 minutes close to the film's final. <br /> <br /> Charlemagne's performance was fascinating, though he was a rookie in view of his age. This movie makes you think a lot, makes you cry (or at least gets you close to it), and makes you hate any kind of war and political BS. The feedback to the prison hospital makes the film even more delicious. <br /> <br /> A slight mistake about the movie is the non-British accents of alleged British people. Most of the British people on the screen were actually British, but what about those who should be British and speak to a foreign accent? It really doesn't fit into this sweet movie. But that's pretty much the only mistake I've noticed. Effects can also be a little better, but then again we all remember many movies from a particular country that has a huge FX and absolutely nothing else. <br /> In short, this movie is a total masterpiece and every single person should see it. If you want to travel to Czechoslovakia in the 40s and if you want to see a huge amount of emotions at once, this movie is for you. If you don't want to do this, this movie will make you do it.
