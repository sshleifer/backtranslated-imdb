Hey Yall! The best drama is now on the Gospel Music Channel! Go to their website to see the schedule and find out what number it is on your cable or satellite. This was one of my favorite shows growing up. It has everything I want for a TV show, a purely family-friendly drama that doesn't bring me out. The story of a man who, after losing his job, decides to set off for a fantastic crossland adventure. Along the way they meet all sorts of interesting people and find themselves in the midst of all kinds of problems. This show was originally a spin off of Touched By An Angel, another great family show. Be sure to check it out!
