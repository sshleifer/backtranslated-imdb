I haven't been a fan of Madonna for some time now, but I thought I'd comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie fails. One of them, as well as Madonna, was conducted by the critics. They were very confused and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviews. <br /> <br /> First, Madonna does an excellent job in this movie, which was one of her first. She plays a ditsy blonde in the movie, she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life. Most critics were slightly condemned by her singing fame and did not give her a fair shake. When you watch this movie, I hope you understand that accent and goofiness only work. She was completely hysterical, like the movie. <br /> <br /> Griffen Dunne is another person who didn't get a fair review in the movie. If you look at his filmography, you will see that he is a successful actor. <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself, it is something that looks like a beautiful woman, but came 3 years before Roberts, Gere success. It's a goof-ball comedy with lots of site gags, slapstick and one liners. Some of the comedies are deadpan and take a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the more subtle humor. I know it doesn't tell you much about the movie, but I hope it helps remove any belief that this is a bad movie. It is definitely worth renting for an enjoyable night of fun. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Gary
