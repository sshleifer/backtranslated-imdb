Last days for me was a very moving movie, it just showed how hard and disrespected the gay community really is. The film etherizes true passion and truly explores the feelings of these two characters, the film holds a true deep sense of compassion for the gay community as it truly speaks for gay man / woman. Personally, I think it's about high time that the gay society of all religions no longer has to be ashamed, just to be there beautiful themselves. The movie was much of an eye-opener for me as I couldn't believe how anti-gay this world really is. Even in schools, if a child does not like something, they will refer to it as "gay". I really hope that more movies like this one are made and that they are not only labeled as a "Gay" movie but as a love story, as I believe gay instructors should stick to themselves and tell their story through their eyes.
