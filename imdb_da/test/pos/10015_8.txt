Although you are a fan of Jean Rollin's idiosyncratic form of work, you will be captured by this extraordinary science fiction field. For once there is not a single diaphanously dress-shaped vampire girl in sight! Despite the tradition, the budget proved too tight to realize the director's vision completely. Nevertheless, this is greatly compensated by his obvious love for the genre cinema, dedication to his craft and pure ingenuity. Jean-Claude Couty's atmospheric film makes the most of the perishable places, and Philippe Bréjean (a / k / a "Gary Sandeur") contributes an exciting soundtrack, which fortunately does not look like any of the stuff he composed for hardcore. <Br /> <br /> Shots in and around a Paris office block before and after working hours, the movie was largely thrown to porn regulars. Rollin was already well acquainted with his "Michel Gentil" fundraising XXX action, especially French f * ck film royalty Brigitte Lahaie in the demanding lead. Playing Elisabeth (quite well, I can add), she has picked to wander a nearby motorway one night by Robert (Vincent Gardère) who runs home at the end of a long working day. Hardly able to tie up the event that came her there, Elisabeth seems to lose her memories just moments after the events, and even to forget Robert's name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end in his apartment. Before being loved, she describes herself as a virgin (further honoring Brigitte's thespian skills, being able to handle the line so convincingly that it is one of the more active adult actresses of the 70's) because she can't Remember a single tap ahead of his. Because of this nifty bit of context, Rollin, the relatively long sex scene that follows completely deters the gratification of other "commercial" spaces that have been needed to include in other works to secure finance. <br /> <br /> When Robert leaves work, he is inevitably erased by Elisabeth's weak mind. A mysterious doctor (comedian Bernard Papineau encounters effectively against the type) and his threatening assistant Solange (striking porn star Rachel Mhas) move onto her during her protector's absence and take her back to the place she turned out to have escaped. Here we get one of the movie's strongest scenes when she is again introduced to her roommate Catherine (the late Cathérine Greiner a / k / a hardcore performer "Cathy Stewart" in a quiet devastating trip), both twice deliver desperately fictional shared " reminds one another in an attempt to eradicate their inevitable destiny. This deterioration is not only limited to the mind becoming painfully clear when served lunch and Catherine being unable to control her movements when trying to eat a spoonful of soup. It is also Catherine who gets the voice of the filmmakers' compromise on the need for trade, as she urges Elisabeth to be naked and keep her because sex is all they have left now that both the mind and physical faculties have left them. <br /> <br /> More quite explicit - if not quite hardcore - sex scenes make up the movie's mid section, and French porn movie players should recognize Alain Plumey (a / k / a "Cyril Val"), Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage with a blink and miss from future porn princess Marilyn Jess, whose rape on hands, mouth and member of Plumey was only present in the movie's rarely screened XXX version FILLES TRAQUEES. The pivotal part of Véronique, a girl Elisabeth, almost seems to remember, and who she is seeking to escape again, is handled beautifully by the exquisite Dominique Journet - in her unforgettable debut - who will continue to play a significant supporting role in Franco Zeffirelli's LA Traviata . The six feet below the end reveal the worsening condition caused by a nuclear discharge, the quarantine "patients" ultimately leaving a thin weathering that is uncertainly deposited in a furnace. The final shot gives a particularly heartbreaking variation on Chaplin's MODERN TIMES as Elisabeth, approaching complete degradation now, and a wounded Robert stumbled along the railway bridge and clinging to each other's outstretched hands lumped.
