I went to watch this movie out of curiosity and to clarify an argument. The film is now best known from the song of music Sergei Prokofiev retrieved from his random music to the movie, the Troika movement even turns up in pop events. The general outline of the plot is well known from the sleeve notes on various recordings. Unfortunately, a clerk generates a non-existent Lieutenant Kizhe on a list to be presented to the Tsar. The Tsar is interested in this person, and rather than telling him that he does not exist, the heads and officers maintain the shame that he is genuine. Kizhe is exiled to Siberia, recalled, promoted, married, promoted again, died, given state funeral, revealed as a curse and posthumously demoted to the ranks. <br /> <br /> I had heard conflicting stories about how the clerk invented Kizhe, which involved ink blowing and sneezing, but I had heard the movie was lost, so there was no way to figure out what's going on. Then appeared at the Barbican in London as part of their Prokofiev festival. It turned out that everything that happens is that the clerk confuses two words while he writes an order and makes Kuzhe to Kizhe. Since the tsar is busy seeing the order, there is no time to correct the error. <br /> <br /> After waiting for a historic curiosity, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is very fun, and the audience, even included, laughed all the time. Although most of it is filmed straight, set mostly in the palace, there are a couple of "trick" shots where several pictures are displayed on the screen. For example, the Tsar's army is represented by a small group, repeated across the screen. Four identical guards perform perfectly living in perfect union. Two identical servants scrub the floor. <br /> <br /> One small drawback was that it was very difficult to find out who everyone was. There were two women who might have been the Tsar's daughters or a daughter and a servant or something else. And very few people were named. But all in all, an enjoyable movie, and I am surprised it is not seen more often.
