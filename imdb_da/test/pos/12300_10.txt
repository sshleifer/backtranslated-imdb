I first saw this movie in Austria when it first came out and I was attracted to it. It is a passionate and in-depth work that should be experienced by all well-known film artists. What a shame it has never been released in DVD format. Perhaps one of those days that will be corrected as it would be a shame if one of the best movies ever was forgotten and left to fade away in some movie vaults forever. Why is it 'B' movie such as 'American Wedding' and 'Eurotrip' getting widescreen and fullscreen releases, and often a special edition with more comments and extras, while great pieces of art such as 'The Dead' are anything but forgotten?
