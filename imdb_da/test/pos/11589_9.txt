In Spain, former sailor Ramón Sampedro (Javier Bardem) has been quadriplegic for twenty-eight years and is fighting in court for his right to exercise euthanasia through an association defending the freedom of choice and led by his friend Géne (Clara Segura). Ramón is introduced to the lawyer defending his case, Julia (Belén Rueda), who has a degenerative fatal disease; and meets Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a lone worker who has been abused by men. Their relationship changes the behavior and point of view of life in Rosa and Julia. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Chilean Alejandro Amenábar is one of the best modern directors. His filmography published in Brazil consists of excellent and original films: "Abre Los Ojos", "Tesis", "The Others" and "Mar Adentro". Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain in the present. Their association produced this sensitive drama of a very polemical theme, the right to commit euthanasia. This drama is never corny or depressive, as the manuscript uses humor as a relief valve in the most dramatic situations. The performance is perfect, with characters having and defending different positions on this unpleasant theme. The dialogues and lines are very solid and intelligent. I noticed in the IMDb plot outline that this movie is based on the real story of Ramón Sampedro. Unfortunately, neither the movie nor the DVD provides this important information. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Mar Adentro" ("Sea Inside")
