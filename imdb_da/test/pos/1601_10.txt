I watched this movie many years ago and hated it altogether - I couldn't wait for it to end and would have gone out, but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder. You know what? I have never forgotten this movie, and more, I would say it continues to haunt me with its images and music over the years. How many movies have I cried over and laughed at the movie house, so forgotten as soon as I hit the street, as ... you can see, I can't even think of one! Rarely are films like the Death of Venice that go into your consciousness and work sea changes. The French would like to say movies are an art, and movies like this prove they are right. I give it 10 stars, up from 3 I gave it the night I saw it.
