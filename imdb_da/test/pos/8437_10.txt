James Bridges' "The China Syndrome" is a first-class thriller; a model for those who want to make a really scary thriller, but don't know how. <br /> <br /> Most thrillers end up with the standard shoot-em-up and chase that ends with the villain gets what he / she deserves. But Bridges understands that such a standard finale is not the case in some scenarios. "China's syndrome" is exciting in a way that one would not expect. It is the type of end that is so unexpected, yet so logical. The movie star three (then) current Oscar winners: Jack Lemmon (Best Actor 1973 for "Save Tiger"), Jane Fonda (Best Actress 1971 and 1978 for "Cloth" and "Upcoming Home") and Michael Douglas (Best Picture 1975 to Produce "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest." This is not your standard "spot the star" flick that became so popular in the 70s, the action is so solid and strong that we forget who is playing the roles and believes in The characters are real people, it is a testament to the three subscribers, they can be stars, but they are actors first. <br /> <br /> There is no music score in the movie, except for a few background songs from jukeboxes or TV shows are nothing, Bridges does not allow any direct style to get through the screen, just to present the material straight, with a strong dramatic story like this we do not need a score to distract us. predecessor of the Dogma 95 movie series, which was started by Lar s Von Trier in 1997. It focuses on the characters and the story rather than the style. The story is about a nuclear power plant located in Southern California. ** SPOILER ** An accident seems to have happened, and basically the film is about Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas to postpone the truth. In a way, it's not a spoiler, as the trailer, TV spots, video boxes and reviews all give it away. But from this seemingly simple premise is a surprisingly complex moral game springs, and the excitement comes from human nature and human actions rather than a villain hitting another guy (though this is an element of the movie). That's what makes "The China Syndrome" so good. <br /> <br /> **** out of 4 stars
