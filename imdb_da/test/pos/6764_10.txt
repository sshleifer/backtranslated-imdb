This is undoubtedly one of the funniest and most entertaining movies I've ever seen. I really enjoyed the characters in the movie. They are all wonderful bizarre in themselves. It's something I've never seen before in any movie. <br /> <br /> The story is almost non-stop from the beginning to the end. There are no dull moments. I was completely caught by the movie. And I thought the play was amazing. <br /> <br /> So if you want to see a funny movie. You have to look for The Green Butchers. A great movie. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10
