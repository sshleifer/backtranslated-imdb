In my opinion, the film is an excellent example of the realities of war and a tribute to the soldiers of all nations who fought and blew in the earth Gallipoli. The lack of violence in no way detracted from the extent of the story in hand. It is honest, true and courageous, just like the men who fought and died at Hellespont. The lack of brutal depictions of violence is fair and correct. These men suffered from freedom, freedom and the right to self-determination in a free and better world. They never wanted to see such a scene again. That's the legacy of Gallipoli. Suffering on the scene of free pyro techniques and blood and gore is best not shown to maintain the proper respect for the champions of this nationality crucible. This film glorifies in the grandeur of men fighting for their lives with honesty, courage, dignity and irrepressible spirit and humor in the face of appalling adversity. This movie is not interested in making a play for fool to cheer over. The brutal results that emerged from these personal battles of these men are nothing that those who survived ever wanted to see on a screen for entertainment. They saw enough of that at that time and would much rather have never seen it first and never wanted to review such scenes again on a screen called "entertainment". The brutal horrors of the evil battles fought in Gallipoli were scenes haunting their waking and sleeping hours for the rest of their natural days. It was the painful inner scars, the men in all the nations that fought brought into their graves. They all fought, and many died on the whole and somehow they, the strong men, managed to laugh at the teeth of constant terrible death, because they would not offend their helpers by not being ready to die next door of them. It is Australasian for brave, the game is, but it applies to a greater or lesser extent to all warriors, but words from the boy's struggle became that Johhny Turk was a game, it is as brave as you would ever want a soldier to be. <br /> <br /> ANZAC and Turks fought to establish their place worldwide, and from 25/04/15 onwards their respective demands for equality in Nationhood became known and undeniable to that world. The director has made a masterpiece that truly honors the spirit and memory of these soldiers and serves as a reminder to future generations of all ages, for children can be taken without fear of intimidating them for the visual "horror of guilt" and that is morbid and meaningless appeal . And children should participate in this movie to learn what happened on the holy beach before they were born. So they can remember. Because it is human nature that they soon forget.
