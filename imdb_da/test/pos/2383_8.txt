Scooby Doo and Monster of Mexico were undoubtedly the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo animated features. Loch Ness Monster is a significant improvement. <br /> <br /> This time, the gang goes to Scotland to see the Highland Games and visit Blake Castle, the home of Daphne's ancestors. And you wouldn't know that the castle is in the 'picturesque' fishing village of Drumnadrochit on the banks of Loch Ness. <br /> <br /> During their stay, they meet some interesting people. First there is Fiona Pembrooke, a scientist who has drowned all his money to find the Loch Ness monster. <br /> <br /> Sir Ian Locksley, head of the National Heritage Museum of Scotland, is a strong non-believer of Nessie. <br /> <br /> Haggarts, the own cozy inn on the banks of Loch. The son is a couple of local jokers who are always in evil. <br /> <br /> Del Chilman, a wild, paranoid hippie guy, convinced the monster is out there and will stop by nothing to find her. <Br /> <br /> And finally, Duncan MacGubbin, the harbor master who has seen Nessie counting many times. <br /> <br /> Most of these characters are stereotypes, which gets a little annoying as this teaches younger audiences a little shit and gives the wrong impression. But if you can immunize yourself with that, you're okay. Being from Scotland, I can't help twisting the much sought after Scottish accents. Fact: We don't sound like that. <br /> <br /> Soon Nessie sees, looks more demonic than "usual", up and causing chaos. It seems that the gang has another mystery on their hands. The usual hunting scenes, tracks and Shaggys crazy disguises follow. There are lots of laughs. The animation is nice, with some atmospheric scenes and places. And the plot much better than the Monster of Mexico. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing this time is the music. I miss Louis Febre's scoring, and the songs here are also pretty rat. Where is Hex Girls when you need them? Region 2 DVD is in crystal clear 1.78: 1 anamorphic widescreen (region 1 is not) with Dolby 5.0 sound. Some okay extras are included. Definitely worth getting.
