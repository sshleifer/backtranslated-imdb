Little Gus is a ten-year-old criminal. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a trip. Reaching the petal is something hard for him, so he creates a unit to help him. His goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called Motorama. He must find all eight letters to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows as it gets to the weather from hell. He runs into some terrible Lynch as signs. Most memorable is the gas station attendant who puts her picture on a dragon hoping that God will see it. Later, Gus gets a tattoo and an eye patch for his injured eye. He becomes one of the most rebellious bad 10-year-olds you can ever witness on the screen. This is not a child's flick! Look for cameos by Jack Nance, Flea and Drew Berrymore. Be warned, even though Drew is on the cover, she only appears in the movie in a dream sequence for a few seconds. Also, the movie gets confusing towards the end that reaches the David Lynch area, maybe you will see it a few times. "Motorama" was written by Joseph Minion, best known for his screenshots for "After Hours" and "Vampire's Kiss" So enjoy this horrible surreal road-trip of fun!
