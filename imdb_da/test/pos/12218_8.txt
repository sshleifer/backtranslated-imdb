*** SPOILERS *** Whatever may (or may not) be said about it, Surface is well designed. The cinematography is simply fantastic (to say the least) and is, for example, nothing if it is not state-of-the-art. Conceptually the show offers a bit of everything - and for almost everyone (parents, children, imagination and / or for example fans). CLOSE PEOPLE FROM THE THIRD CHILD using CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON with a little JAWS and GODZILLA thrown in for good measure, says. And there was not a single sour note that had appeared; something surprising solid casting, here. This series of SURFACEd, apparently, out of nowhere, and with the sheer narrative of the story, brought the viewer together for the better part of an entire season. All things considered, a job very well done. I only hope it reSURFACEs next season ...
