Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great end to a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s, there was an atmosphere of tolerance, openness and progressivity among the studies that made it possible to make great films by some of the best directors the US has ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (some of them are the violent deaths of great characters in the American political and cultural scenes, the race struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the increase of violence and the death of the streets ...) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to cultivate, be different and create entertaining and intelligent films. Coppola's film is a weird mix of humanistic thinking and talented filmmaking, following the parameters of war and fairy-tale films, while undermining them with its fluid reflection on the value of life, the cause of death, or the war of ethics. It is also a passionate work made against all odds, written in the 1991 documentary "Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"; a film picture that went beyond any previous consideration of the Vietnam War ever to reach the screen. It may not be the only Vietnam movie, but it's about Coppola. The purpose of the classic melodrama was found in two Vietnam films made simultaneously, "Deer Hunter" and "Coming Home", or the latter as "Platoon" and "War Accidents" before Vietnam was the starting point for making products of any genre, as horror in "Jacob's Ladder" or comedies like "Good Morning, Vietnam" among the more respectable. Coppola had the courage to take the economic and political conflict as a backdrop for a search for answers to questions that someone felt each day in his life without betraying the dramatic consequences of this war.
