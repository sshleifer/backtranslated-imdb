Although many have mixed feelings about this last day, Argento giallo-thriller, it still stands as another lavish testament to the cinematic brilliance that is Argento. <br /> <br /> A young opera singer has his first outbreak and suddenly finds her subject of obsession for a lunatic. <br /> <br /> In a way, Opera as a modern giallo is taking on the Phantom of the Opera blended with all the glorious style and color one would expect Dario Argento to deliver. Argento makes fantastic use of inventive camera techniques, repetitive symbols (like the ravens!), Gothic atmosphere, and really cruel murder sequences. A scene especially (which involves a hole and a gun) will knock the viewers straight out of their seats! Storywise also manages to capture the film with some strong excitement and give a good mood of Claudio Simonetti's beautiful music score. The game gives some satisfying performances. Cristina Marsillach is good as our leading lady. The late Ian Charleson makes a good trip as director, like Urbano Barberini as investigator, Daria Nicolodi as Marsillach's agent, and William McNamara as Marsillach's bad lover. <br /> <br /> Opera is amazing last day Argento, and perhaps the last of his great works. It is safe to please his fans and even make some new ones. <br /> <br /> **** out of ****
