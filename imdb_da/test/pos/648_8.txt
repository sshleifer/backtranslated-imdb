I found this movie on Netflix and had to add it to my queue. I was not disappointed when I got it, as it is just as fun now as I saw it at a local drive-in theater then. <br /> <br /> It builds on a climax with you to catch glimpses of various characters as they begin their trip across America on "Honky Tonk Freeway, America on Wheels." This was a strange comic role for William DeVane as I remember him as Kennedy in the 1974 television movie "The Missiles of October" and felt that no one could have drawn the dramatic character as well as he did. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a little Dick Van Dyke in "Cold Turkey", where Van Dyke played the local minister. DeVane's role as mayor, minister and activist was typical of small towns, so it makes his character look fun and right. <Br /> <br /> Howard Hessman and Teri Garr as the spoiled family in the RV were also on target for the time being. Anyone who has traveled over land with small children (Are we there yet?) Will appreciate these scenes. /> <br /> The scenes in a small town struggling to survive reminded me a lot about the small town I grew up in, but they handled it with the charm and humor that you often only saw in small towns. It is sad that many small towns disappeared because of the motorway system, and it gives a realistic, humorous view of what to do to survive. (Used zoo someone?) All in all, it is a lightweight comedy without a special message, but a humorous look at America in the early 80s. Worth looking at if you just need a good joy.
