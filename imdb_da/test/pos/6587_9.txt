Before I watched this movie, I heard a lot of praise for it and quite a few exclamations about how "terrible" it was. In order not to take any credit away from this movie, I think it was not so terrible or even shocking. It's just a movie about people living in the darker side of town. And a good to portray the point. <br /> <br /> There are some good actors here and a thoughtful manuscript. Paavo Westerberg is a well-known author on the Finnish film scene, and he is the best in what describes modern Finnish culture (although he is not the only author of this film, but I dare say he is the main author anyway. I have it wrong). The casting is excellent, except for Jasper Pääkkönen (the pseudo-protagonist who, in my opinion, should have stayed in the soap opera scene) and the sets, cuts and sounds are also very good and give good mood to this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a story of loosely-linked sad destinations, which, according to a well-known Finnish band's very well-known song (Eppu Normaali's "Tuhansien Murheellist Laulujen Maa", which translated into "Paha Maa") throughout Finnish society leads to a sad, dark end accompanied by splashes, loneliness and the bad choices. And it is since the daily Finnish life, about 80% of the population has no awareness of unless films like this are made.
