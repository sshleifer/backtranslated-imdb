Obsessed !!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls, and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, it's not your average comedy show, there's no break after a joke It just goes on if you missed you lost it. And it's not like a soap opera drama, even because it doesn't use dramatic music, and the actors never have the stupid cheesy surprise look. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the best shows on T.V. shows of his time. It's fun because they talk so fast that you can't get everything for the first time, it's great to go back and laugh at the other jokes. Also they have so many references, it's great how smart it is. <br /> <br /> And you can also relate to their characters so real, and where actors are amazing from the witty Lorelai to the hermit Luke to the immature Kirk the Vis is just amazing. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and spend sometime with that family, it is clearly the show for them. There is only one word that can describe Gilmore Girls .... CLASSIC !!!!!!
