As one of the other reviewers (perhaps having been @ Amazon), I was first introduced to the Tourist Trap by the beloved, discouraging old WOR-9 in NY, around January 1983. Devil Dog: The Hell of Hell I Had been waiting to see since it debuted in Halloween 1978, had just been completed and I thought I had gotten my scare to fill the day (stop laughing - the three eyes "Borgost" (sp?) monster Ike Eisenmann pulling up in his room is scary). For as much as I still enjoy Richard Crenna wearing his made-for-TV horror hat, it was the first 10 minutes of the Tourist Trap that followed the Devil Dog the day that really left a mark - and months later it ended up being it first movie I ever taped on TV. WOR used to play this quite often, often as Saturday afternoon Million Dollar Movie, as others have observed. It is one of the offers that delivers a powerful horror punch in front, a real left hook - and then you start practically with the rest of cast, dance and jabs, the opening scene puts a greater connection along the way and goes on to the real climax (see Night of the Living Dead, Re Animator). <br /> <br /> Two paragraphs and I have not mentioned a single mannequin. Face it - the marvelous things are scary enough, without the music and the script. I can also remember some scary dress dummies and the like in different relatives' ceilings and basements and say what you like about how relatively straightforward Schmoeller and Carroll's approach is - no one has ever played it well. In real life, a good mannequin will make you do a double shot - and here it is about the last thing you will probably see if you are stuck at Slausen's rejected wax museum and the roadside. Yes, there is a point ("I loved her a lot") where Chuck "Slausen" Connors is trying to pass Vincent Price. Yes, the plot could have taken up a whole section in the early stages; I can't see the script being so thick. It does not matter. From Direction to Competitive Play (Meryl Streep is not present, and here it helps instead of obstacles), to another useful and effective Pino Dinaggio score (see Carrie and various other de Palma films) for various lighting, film storage , using different sound levels ... I could go on - every element of this low budget production comes together and you get a job much larger than the sum of its parts. Did I mention it's scary like hell? Stephen King spoke this movie in Danse Macabre a year after its release and for good reason. As most of his work, it may not be a good art, but it certainly says a scary story and does well. The rest of the casting can be relatively unknown (wasn't Jocelyn Jones in the Texas car chase movie too?), But Chuck Connors and Tanya Roberts were and are just familiar enough to the audience to make you think - Stephen King style - that this could happen to you or to people you know. Comparisons with Psycho (plot) and Texas Chainsaw Massacre (overall look and feel), even though they are not the first associations in my mind, are valid. I only wish I could comment on the DVD, which I look forward to buying, since Tourist Trap has become notoriously difficult to find on the video since the almost complete eradication of independent video rental sites where it had a home except WOR and cable in the 1980s (although TMC / Showtime seems to have picked it up and played regularly now). No, no spoilers here, I'm afraid, no plot interruption - see it yourself (okay, there may be a little tiny downstairs, so roll away if you want - better safe than sorry). The mannequins are damn frightening, and I'd rather show than to tell ... :) <br /> <br /> For the record, Tourist Trap is also full of beautiful lines, from "we need a party! How do I look, how do i look? "" to "you are so beautiful", "you can't hurt me", "i shouldn't hide it - it feels good!" (listen for the Vincent Price bend there again), the inevitable " you're crazy!" (delivered in the right moment and in the right tone) ... and try - just try - to keep your hair on your arms when you hear the mannequin's head screaming "Molly!" - especially when you realize who the head it used to be ... :) <br /> P S ... Charles Band was the producer of this, I think, and probably owned the rights to Dinaggio's music. Band, from what I understand, was the brain behind Full Moon Entertainment, which could explain both the music's subsequent use in the puppet master, and also the commercial approach has characterized the full moon throughout, from the entertaining puppet sites and subspecies franchises, to, uhh ... Trancers and bad channels (sorry, BOC).
