What begins as a homespun comedy drama and so halfway becomes a melodrama made a great star by John Garfield - and rightly so. But Jeffrey Lynn must not be dismissed as the object of the four daughters. Lynn is very handsome and is so charming, it's easy to believe that all four daughters could fall for him. Although Garfield received most of the kudos, Lynn became an important leader on Warner Bros. as a result of this movie. Michael Curtiz insisted on shooting at the picnic scene, making it the highlight of movies. Through craftsmanship, it is enough to inspire awe. A soap opera by Fanny Hurst has been transformed into a cinema masterpiece.
