Just three weeks ago, Tipping the Velvet has been released in the UK, and I already see countless letters flooding the national papers and TV guides, claiming it has a thin plot, weak performances and an even weaker script. <br /> You find me asserted. This is heresy. <br /> <br /> I would really like to remove any doubts by first congratulating Andrew Davies on giving Geoffrey Sax the opportunity to create this wonderful dramatization of Sarah Waters novel by subduing him with such a fantastic script. Kudos. But I'm afraid I have to change my mind now. <br /> <br /> I saw one of the leading TV guides here in England (who will remain nameless), relentlessly describing Tipping the Velvet as a "lesbian love story". If they are and I suppose they are trying to promote the interest of the movie, then this is completely the wrong way to go about it (except that the sentence is a disappointing inaccurate description). By saying such a thing, they are either a) turning those who would be instinctively rejected by "the" subject or b) attracting a class of people who would only look to see some "serious girl on the girl". Buy a video! Through this display of serious consideration, this and other magazines are cheaper, which is a brilliant adaptation of one of the latest literature's greatest works. Tipping the Velvet is a story of love, passion, movement, loss and heartache. It's not a lesbian love story. No siree. The end result is a stylish affair with excellent performances all the time (especially from Stirling, Hawes, Chancellor and May). In terms of direction, it is intoxicating and discouraging - sometimes fast, sometimes not - but it never ceases to be less than convincing. As a whole, it is polished and well-delivered, the sex is done with tenderness and delicacy - and although many do not classify it as a real "movie", it will remain among my favorites for some time to come.
