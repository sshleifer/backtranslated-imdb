It is such a shame that an important film like this is almost unknown. <br /> <br /> I don't think Alan Bates has made a better movie than this. <br /> <br /> It is never shown on TV. The only time I remember being shown on British television was in the summer of 1998. I'm on tape, but unfortunately the quality isn't great because of a risky antenna at that time ... <br /> <br /> I Remember that I would watch this movie for some time before appearing on TV. It was shown on Channel 4 in the early hours of the morning to ensure that it still remained invisible except for a very small audience. <br /> <br /> I was living in Bristol at the time, and it was ironic that when I finally watched the movie, I realized I had gone VERY house where it was filmed several times before !! The movie enters a fine line; A married couple tries to shed light on their tragic difficulties in dealing with their severely mentally handicapped daughter by laughing at it and even involving the child in their jokes. The direction and play is so amazing that movies are always compassionate and moving and are never in danger of falling into bad taste. A couple of years ago I saw a clip of the filmed theater production with Eddie Izzard in the role of Bri and Victoria Hamilton playing Sheila. <br /> <br /> It showed that Izzard is improvising and lurking, and Hamilton tells the audience to ignore him when he is like this. <br /> <br /> I may take it out of context as I only saw a short clip, but after reading the game and watching the movie, it is clearly such a sensitive subject that such an approach is both insensitive and disrespectful . <br /> <br /> Izzard was praised for his performance, but I felt uncomfortable with what I saw. <br /> <br /> It may be surprising that such a successful game couldn't find an audience when it was finally filmed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best British movies from the 70's and hopefully it will be released on DVD one day.
