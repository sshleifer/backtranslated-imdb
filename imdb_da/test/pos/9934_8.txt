After the leading actress in the opera is killed in a car accident, the young driver, Betty, gets to the forefront. It is very fortunate for her with a problem: she has an admirer who has decided that he will kill all his friends and make her wrong. What is his connection to the opera, and what is his fascination with Betty? <br /> <br /> I love Dario Argento with all parts of my body. And I'm not an orthodox fan, I think. Many people, especially critics, praise her previous work ("Suspiria" and "Deep Red"), but really wrinkles on later movies, like "Sleepless" that I liked. My favorite, "Phenomena", is usually very undervalued. "Opera" tends to fall somewhere. Some consider it one of his last major films, others see it as part of his so-called decline. I loved it. <br /> <br /> The picture is sharp, the music is fantastic (unlike other critics, I love the metal soundtrack), the female lead is a person I can feel for (not unlike Jennifer Connelly from "Phenomena" ). And the picture ... wonderful. Great filmography and some amazing kill scenes. The concept of dropping needles for a person's eyes so they can't blink ... brilliant. My assistant Tina thinks this looked fake, but even if it does, the idea is more than enough to pay. And some great effects like a knife blade coming up in a man's mouth? Fantastic. <br /> <br /> Jim Harper calls the movie "Stunning" and draws attention to "innovative films, well-built shots and exceptionally violent murders." I totally agree with this - a shot follows the camera through winding tunnels, and there is a very interesting visual use of crows throughout history. Mike Mayo also calls it "visually fascinating eye-candy" and lauds the "sharp editing and floating camera work". It is truly a wonder that this is not one of Argento's more highly acclaimed works. <br /> <br /> Argento returned to the opera with the "Phantom of the Opera", which was a bit of a mistake despite his casting daughter Asia and Julian Sands. Even more interesting, the same year, offered the release of Michele Soavis "Stagefright", which (as "Opera") has a killer loose in a theater that kills the people involved in the presentation. Both are good movies, with Soavi more on the slasher side. (Soavi actually acted as second unit director at "Opera" ... you can make your own conclusions.) My only complaint with this movie is the length and pacing. While it is very beautifully shot and the kitten scenes are glorious, they are not as frequent as they should be. The first takes over half an hour, and then we come down times between them. The leading actress must be in constant terror, but she gets time between killing to calm down as if everything is normal again. Not so, Dario. We must keep the voltage low and the intensity high.
