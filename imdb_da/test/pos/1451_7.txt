Instead of going to the site and making a realistic movie on drug abuse in Windy City, contr. Director Otto Preminger to go the opposite way and make his film as artificial as possible and thus fly in the fashion of the way men like Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann made their images all over the world. Nelson Algren, on whose novel the film is based, was recorded as despising it. What do you wonder, was Preminger up to, and why did he make the movie this way? The seats in the film are as small as suggesting a Mr. Magoo cartoon. Louie, the drug pusher, is dressed to look like the kind of gangster the artists in Mad magazine used to draw. Arnold Stang, a wonderful comedian as he was, seems out of place in a serious picture like this, and his very appearance, topped by an exaggerated and oversized baseball cap, evokes laughter. Robert Strauss, another actor best known for humorous roles, is also out of place when his big, bursting face and runyonesque delivery of lines seem more appropriate for a Jerry Lewis movie. In contrast, the stars Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker work overtime to keep the viewer from snickering. Sinatra is jittery and manic throughout, suggesting a man who is dissatisfied with himself, and thus perfectly suited to the role of an addict. Miss Novak, plant-like and sublime stalemate, is sympathetic and seems to be the product of the artistic sniffing slums she enjoys in the movie. Parker is pure Hollywood and very hardworking as the crippled and crooked Zosch. She never convinces, but it is not the movie either. I would not recommend this movie to anyone interested in a realistic depiction of drug addicts' lives in America. Caligari alone makes it incredible. Premings may have been aimed at a dream effect, as cardboard backgrounds give the case the surreal sense of a nightmare peak that may be back to Premingser's early days in Vienna.
