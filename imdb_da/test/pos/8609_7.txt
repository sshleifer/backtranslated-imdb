Pretty darn good for a french movie. I have not seen any of Catherine Breillat's previous films, and then I have no opinions on this in relation to her previous work. French cinema usually sticks to the ultimate arty movies and leaves shoot-em-ups and stargazers for Hollywood. This is probably a good business strategy, as no other nation's film industry is likely to have the resources to compete for such projects. Films about film making are often a bore because it has little resonance for people who are not in the company. But this kept my interest much more than I thought it would. Despite the title, (oddly in English), it really isn't much of a comedy, despite a few droll moments. I have only seen a couple of Anne Parillaud's films, but she shows a generous amount of talent and range from the action / psychological drama "La Femme Nikita" to the evil comedy of "Innocent Blood". This movie also expands its reach as she plays a more or less ordinary woman, but is still convincing on the screen. Kudos also to Roxane Mesquida, with whom I was unknown. She plays a very expressive actress for most of the movie, whose talent is pulled out at the end. If you do not need car parking and explosions to be entertained, check this out.
