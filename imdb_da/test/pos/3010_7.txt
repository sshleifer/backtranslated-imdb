This started excellent. Photography and sound are the best I have experienced this year (okay months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colors in some sequences is amazing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh will do with it. <br /> <br /> Now for the minus. The acting was terrible. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to steal the movie alone to sell herself and the picture. The three beds seemed just too obvious. The child's baptism Carl was a psychologically underlined way to begin the motive under which Carl 'worked'. Etc. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie had a great way to show where Singh comes from. Why is it that the most talented directors seem to come from India today?
