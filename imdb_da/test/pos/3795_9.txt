Telling the story would not be the point, would it? The children's island, spelled almost as "boon√© aww", is the title of the brilliant novel in the late seventies that shocked many people, including myself. <br /> <br /> Children's Island is the title and which island. In the book, Raine, the main character is The Guiness World Record Book as its own Bible. And he is eager to break new records himself. Especially the youngest person under water for three minutes. The story is, like most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring. Bergman began his last film, and Cries and Whispers were hardly out. The expectations for some Swedish films were quite high. They taught us when the great theater, great actors, amazing writers and gifted instructors made a real team of perfection in the cinema. All this said, Children's Island is a story of discovery. It is also a story of alienation: cities are alienating and living in one of them making us aliens to most of its residents. It is a story of revelations and sudden encounters with our own destiny. It is a film of overwhelming hope and desperation. Of emotions buried under layers and layers of isolation and isolation from a world that could not fit less ... <br /> <br /> This approach is in itself a rather difficult way to weave a compelling tale. Here is the masterful guide of Kay Pollak on Ola Olsson's script of PC Jersild's novel, not only in an opportunity, but in one of these masterpieces of cinema. <br /> <br /> I disagree with anyone who said this work was anything but forgotten. It is not. Even when I write this in 2009, discussions on P C Jersild's history are conducted all over the world, and the film is shown at many film schools and small theaters. Why? Growing philosophical on the whole would be difficult, and many have already done it scientifically through writing and lectures. The reason why Children's Island was and is a special story is the cozy feeling that you get from the start when you discover that everything is told through the eyes of a small child. And so it ends. Perhaps it is a clinical view that another pointed out. But deeply disturbing, moving and satisfying. The concept is deep: As long as we have no shame, we can still live one day more like an angel. Afterwards, we become what Raine reflects as the rosary of his experiences: "Men are pigs". He finds his fear when he is fearless. He finds love when the world crumbles around him. He discovers a reason not to behave like the adults because he refrains from committing crimes. He relinquishes his inner purity and confidence in others, just to learn how touched a man's soul can be. <br /> <br /> Where love is expected, he finds hatred. Where compassion is needed, he finds suspicions and cold hearts. It's a movie of metaphors. A movie to think and raise issues that are difficult to ask, but more difficult to answer. <br /> <br /> Finally, the satisfaction of seeing such an excellent work (which really opened up for any other Swedish movie after) is a journey of joy and hope. Be aware that it is a movie filled with the dark side of our nature. But unfortunately! A film of hope and deep joy. Reine will still be an island in Stockholm, but there is great hope of living today fully, even when we found our first sign of sexual maturity show.
