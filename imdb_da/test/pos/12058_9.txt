Certainly not a good show, but better than most other sitcoms out there at the moment. It resembles shows as married to children and roseanne, as they go to places that are not traditionally treated in sitcoms. It is sometimes fun, even if you ignore the laughs but not rip-roaring fun. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters are pretty funny (gay friend) and some of the other drop-ins. This is also one of the few shows where the signs soliloquy (sorry for the slaughtered spelling) are actually effective and fun. Is this a whole family or Seinfeld type show? Absolutely not. However, it is definitely better than a show like 'To Deat' (probably the worst TV show of any type at the moment). Oh, my mother's not that bad, and Hilary's character is a little hottie.
