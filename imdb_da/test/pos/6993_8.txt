This was a "sleeper" for sure !! Much better than I thought! Never realize it was a horror flick ..... and who was this beautiful, baritoned voiced hunk, named Wine Diesel.adding spices and intrigues for this otherwise unmounted movie ??? The monsters in this movie were rather unusual, not the same ol round of the mill's gobble-up types! The ending was also great for a change, not all "evil boys are bad" !!! I give it 2 thumbs !!!
