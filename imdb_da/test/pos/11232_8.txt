When Northfork made his debut at the Cannes Film Festival, many people did not like it because they felt it was boring and too slow. While I agree that it was slow (one of the slowest films of the year), it was by no means boring. As Roger Ebert said, "there has never been a movie like Northfork." I don't normally agree with Ebert, but for once he speaks the truth. Although John Sayles 'Sunshine State may have some of the same immediate themes, nothing that I have ever seen or known can even compare to the striking originality of the Polish brother' Northfork. <br /> <br /> Northfork is a perfect example of how many times it is better to pull an extra few minutes to go to an art house instead of the latest Jack Black movie. The reason is not a hackneyed, cookie-cutter plot; It's just so strikingly original. A small town in Montana called Northfork has a dam nearby that is about to be taken down. Therefore, the whole city must be evacuated. However, some people just won't leave. In a side plot, a young orphan (Duel Farnes) is very ill and the bedding; he is taken care of by father Harlan (Nick Nolte). The boy imagines himself as a fallen angel, so to speak, who helps him out through his illness. <br /> <br /> Although much of the movie is straightforward, some of it can give David Lynch a run for his money. There are odd weather patterns, a strange tree, great dog day and symbolism that would make Fellini proud. It's not as generally confusing as a Lynch movie, but it's still pretty strange. That is what makes Northfork so good: It is so normal and yet so simple and plausible. Northfork has a magical feeling: It's almost like you see something you're not quite sure of what it is, but you feel excited about it. As I said earlier, I agreed with Ebert how this film is unlike any other. However, I disagree when he says it is `not entertaining '. He continues to say that it is just "exciting." Maybe he just thought he should give the good reviews because everyone else is, but instead of how slow it was, I still thought it was very entertaining, something that many dramas cannot do now. <br /> <br /> Northfork Don't be the fastest movie or the most popular movie, but if you can get to and through it, you'll be very surprised as I was. My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Classified PG-13 for short sexuality.
