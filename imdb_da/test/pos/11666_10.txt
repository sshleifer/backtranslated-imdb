In a world where debatable and misunderstood topics can be infinitely listed, this powerful 1995 movie takes on the top of that list; Moreover, it makes it objective and realistic and with a sensibility and sensitivity that makes it a really good movie of everyone's dipstick. And to add a bit of irony to everything, even the subject of this movie has become very misunderstood as it is mistakenly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; it is not. At the heart of Dead Man Walking, directed by Tim Robbins, is a subject that may in fact be the most misunderstood for all and for good reason, because it may just be the hardest thing for a human being to truly - and really - Understand. And that's what this movie really is about: Forgiveness. Real Forgiveness; Don't apologize for a criminal offense or its offender - not to say that what has happened is okay - but to find the strength to continue and to do so by choosing life. <br /> <br /> Director / screenwriter Tim Robbins has designed and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by Sister Helen Prejean, discussing her involvement with the prisoners of death who, over the years, she has served her faith in God. As explained in the film, what for her was to become a lifelong pursuit of not only justice but human dignity, began with a simple letter from a death prisoner in Louisiana State Prison in Angola. Judged to death for rape and murder, Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) reached out to anyone who would listen when his letter joined her sister Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who soon found herself in an area where she had absolutely no knowledge or experience. And Robbins has successfully captured Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey concisely while keeping it devoid of any maudlin sentimentality, making it not only genuine, trustworthy, and trustworthy, but making it an exciting and thoroughly emotional experience for audience. Through the cinema's medium it was once a personal, significant emotional experience for Sister Prejean, who becomes one for everyone who also sees this movie. <br /> <br /> For her soul-stirring, spooky depiction of Sister Prejean, Susan Sarandon won deserving Oscar for Best Actress. Sensitive and full of emotional depth, her performance is incredibly touching and real, especially in the way she conveys Sister Prejean's underlying natural fragility and vulnerability, which she adamantly tempered with the toughness she needed to continue her efforts at on behalf of Poncelet (and in fact, a total of five since she began). Regardless of your point of view regarding the issues examined in this film, Sister Prejean is undoubtedly an individual of heroic proportions, as Sarandon exquisitely exquisite; and she does it without resorting to any superfluous melodramatic, but rather by keeping it true by subtly and humbly exploring humanity in a very credible expression of characterization. It is an extraordinary achievement, no doubt the best of Sarandons brilliant career. <br /> <br /> Also in career-best performance is Sean Penn, nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Poncelet (he lost to Nicolas Cage, who won for his performance in `Leaving Las Vegas). Perfect for that part in every way, Penn has simply never been better before or since. He effectively presents Poncelet as a genuine person, rather than as an overblown caricature of a monster capable of committing the crimes depicted here. Not that it makes Poncelet anything less contemptible; just the opposite. It makes it really disturbing to be confronted with the fact that a person who looks like a guy who could live next to you could be capable of such things. And that is the strength of Penn's achievements - it's so disturbingly true, presented with depth and nuance; You just have to look into his eyes to find imperfections of a troubled soul. A great achievement, and - as good as Cage was in 'Vegas' - Penn should have received Oscar for it. <br /> <br /> In another stand-out performance, Raymond J. Barry is memorable in a supporting role as Earl Delacroix, father of one of Ponceling's victims. With a limited time frame, however, he develops his character in such a way that you can empathize with him as well as with Sister Prejean, as it is through him that we get an insight into how complicated and apparently her attitude is, at least on surface. Barry presents Delacroix in such a way that it provides the necessary balance and perspective to the story, which is ultimately extremely effective and helps emphasize the film's message. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes R. Lee Emery (Clyde Percy), Celia Weston (Mary Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Helen's Mother), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Farley), Roberta Maxwell (Lucille Poncelet), Margo Martindale (Sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet). It is doubtful that this film will change one's opinion in some way about the death penalty, but it was never meant; It was supposed to create a thought-provoking, emotionally involved film, which is exactly what Robbins has achieved with Dead Man Walking. Whatever your personal point of view, this movie will have influence and hopefully will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness. For as we look through Earl Delacroix's character, true forgiveness is not something that one simply decides to do, but is a task that can become a work of life. And it is perhaps one of the most difficult things in life to achieve effectively; and you get away from this movie with recognition for people like Sister Prejean, who has selflessly devoted her life to helping those in need and filmmakers like Robbins and Sarandon to bring her to life for millions of people who would never otherwise have knew her. I rate this 10/10 <br /> <br />
