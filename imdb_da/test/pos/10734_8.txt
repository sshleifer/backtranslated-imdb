The marriage of an upscale New York City couple with child falls apart when the wife wants out ("It took a lot of courage for her to leave the door!" Says a neighbor us); The busy, distracted man takes the "motherly" responsibility and grows closer to his son, but soon the wife returns. Very manipulative image does not give us a very realistic family unit (with young Justin Henry not at all resembling the product of a marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep!), But the dynamics are exciting and involving, and director Robert Benton keeps pacing with lots of cleverness , marvelous classical music, canny editing and surefire bits of humor. Streep's character is designed to be a cold, self-centered witch, but I was ready to feel much more to her than Benton would have liked. Everything must be painted in black and white, good and bad, with Hoffman learning how hard his wife had and getting another chance to be a good parent. The movie never falls from its predetermined path, and very fine acting almost saves it, but I'm not sure where Benton steered the movie in the final act, and the final scene is terribly abrupt. *** from ****
