In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stopover on a cruise ship carrying a particular canary and Granny, his owner. Oh oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny give many obstacles to the cat's attempt to get the bird. Sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times too. And for the second time, Tweety replaces it with nigroglycerin that goes on the spot on the ship, which has something that cures his ailments. So now Sylvester can blow fire! I stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by Friz Freling with the popular cat-and-bird duo. Tweety's S.O.S is highly recommended.
