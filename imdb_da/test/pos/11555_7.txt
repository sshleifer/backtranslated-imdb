This movie starts a little slow and runs towards the end. Not what is bad, it was done to illustrate the characteristics of the degradation of the protagonist. Therefore, if you are not in tragedy, it is not your movie. It is the thought-provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile. If you liked Dostoyevsky's 'Crime and Punishment', you'll probably like this if only for the comparisons. The exciting question the film is asking is: "What makes a famous writer completely disregard his publicly-accepted ideas for another set?" The new ideas are totally against the status quo. If you are conservative, you will not like this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to other philosophical issues, I must admit that the film was also quite aesthetically pleasing. The grassy hillsides and the beautiful landscape helped me get past the slow start. There was also the use of colorful symbolism to represent the smallest protagonists. If these kinds of things do not impress you, skip it. Overall I give this movie a 7.
