"Desperadoes" (1943) is a true classic, not for its history (which is rather routine), but for its technical production elements. This was a landmark western, the largest ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a Columbia production - a lightweight study with a feed's reputation. Only Fox's "Jesse James" (also starring Randolph Scott) from a few years earlier gave everywhere this lavish treatment to the genre. Although it would be darkened by a few years of "The Searchers" and "High Noon", "Desperadoes" was a groundbreaking effort and historic treasure. <br /> <br /> In 1863, the economy of the town of Red Valley, Utah is based on the rounding and sale of wild horses to the Union Army. The manuscript gets a little messy here with references to the railway (which was several years away in the future of Utah) and Custer's Last Stand (Custer was busy fighting Stuart in Pennsylvania at that time), but these are not important record elements. <br /> <br /> Red Valley has an honest sheriff, Steve Upton (Scott), but the banker and several citizens are corrupt; robs their own bank every time the government pays for a bunch of horses. The city is visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford), a famous criminal who is an old friend Steve. He wants to go straight, especially after falling to the beautiful, lively owner Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes). Cheyenne's partner "Nitro" Rankin (Guinn "Big Boy" Williams) is mainly there for comic relief, like Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and the city's judge (Raymond Walburn, modeling his character on Frank Morgan's "Wizard of Oz" crystal ball faker ). <br /> <br /> No chances with their huge budget Columbia packed this thing with lots of action and every western movie element but Indians and covered carts. There is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed, a spectacular barroom brawl, an explosive climax, romance and three-strip Technicolor. All these things do not necessarily fit together, but who would have cared back in 1943. Unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious act of Western and a comedy. <br /> <br /> The camera was probably the best ever at the time of the movie. The indoor scenes are solid but it is the naturist outdoor photography that is truly impressive; both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera film of the action sequences. <br /> <br /> Scott and Claire Trevor were top-shot, but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford, which would soon be their biggest star. And director Charles Vidor took advantage of the film to showcase his new wife Keyes (whose depiction of Scarlett's sister in "Gone With the Wind" had linked to the audience more than any small role in the history of the movie). <br /> <br /> The Ford-Keyes dynamics are "The Desperadoes" most unique and important feature. Instead of going to the clich√© "love triangle" with Scott and / or Trevor (as the first seems to happen), the whole romantic focus is on the two younger actors. This was probably the best role Keyes ever has, and she does the most. Plays a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks good in both leather pants and dresses, and who rides and fights like Kiera Knightley's character in "Pirates of the Caribbean". This was revolutionary at that time and coincided with the formation of WAAC in 1942 for military service in World War II. <br /> <br /> "Desperadoes" is a movie that has been well taken care of and the print looks like it's brand new. Unfortunately, there are no special features on the DVD. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
