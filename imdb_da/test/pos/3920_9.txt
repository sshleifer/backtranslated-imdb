probably the best horror movie for 5 years .. there have been lame remakes, attempts to scare you (when all they do is go out of the theater) and movies that just should not have been made. but this is worth it. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene constitutes it, believe me) .. <br /> <br /> .. so here they are .. SPOILERS of all the death pictures in the movie. <br /> <br /> 1. My favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's! After finding his girlfriend Blake lying on the ground with a knife sticking out of the neck, Paige begins to run. Well, the speed walk is more respectable. She finds it as a garage with all these cars in it. so (one of) the murderers cut her ankle from below (always keeping a big metal spike) so she falls and runs and hides behind this car. The killer picks it up, and as she looks through the window, he throws it through the window and shoots through the forehead. I have never been so exposed or relieved so hard in my life. <br /> <br /> 2. Paige's girlfriend Blake gets a knife stacked in the neck, and then the killer goes up to him (while he is on the ground) and steps on it pushes it further into the neck .. then he dies. <br /> <br /> 3. Elisha cuthbert (carly) (one of the hottest chicks ever) does not die PHEW, but she gets her lips super-glued together, punched in her face and part of her index finger chopped off (yes, I felt like raising) 4. Carly's twin brother Nick also survives, but not without getting his ass kicked and a stitch wound to his leg. <br /> <br /> 5. Nick's best friend Dalton is thrown down a staircase and then he is beheaded. his body is pulled away and we see his eyes blinking .. then he is covered with wax. <br /> <br /> 6. Wade (Carly's boyfriend) gets his Achilles tendon cut by a massive scissors, and then attacks the same scissors. He does not die, but he is covered in wax, and in 2 cases his skin is accidentally removed and reveals his unpleasant bloody flesh. YUMMY. <br /> <br /> So that's it. Definitely worth your money.
