A year after 'Love Your Neighbor' made its I.T.V. debut, followed the route taken by 'On the Buses' and 'Steptoe & Son' by graduating on the big screen, on a picture made by Hammer Films. It opens with an appalling patriotic speech adorning the virtues of England's green and pleasant land and then cutting into a shot of Eddie and Bill going up a street and warring rage. This escalates to a strange sequence of white and black neighbors who vandalize each other's homes. At least, the original theme is retained (though sung by someone other than Stuart Gillies). The local paper - 'The Gazette' - holds a contest to find the best neighbors, the winners land a Mediterranean cruise. Barbie suggests Joan to come in. The thing is, can Bill and Eddie keep friends long enough to win it? It is the most important part of the plot. The film is largely episodic. A chunk is lifted directly from season 1, namely Bill and Eddie, who go to the club, pretending to be on 'union business'. In fact, they will see a stripper (don't meet two girls). Another part of the movie has Bill along with other black factory workers (in the series he was the only one) who has hit a strike, Eddie has helped create at various ploys (including being smuggled through the gates in beer barrels). While another (apparently inspired by Powell and Driver's 'For The Love Of Ada') sees Eddie's talkative mother (the magnificent Patricia Hayes) becoming friendly with Bill's father (Charles Hyatt). The climate of episode 1 Season 1 again appears in expanded form. Bill once more paints and a towel to scare Eddie, but his friends go with him, and they dance around a drum containing a bare booth so they can pretend to cook and eat him. Eddie must then come home in the neck (surprisingly there is less nudity here than in episode 2 season 2). The movie ends with Reynolds and Booths, who win 'Love Your Neighbor Competition and Cruise Together, but there's an unexpected twist involving Joan's Six-Fed Brother Cyril (James Beck -' Private Walker 'by' Dad's Army ') who works as a steward. <br /> This is your typical 70's sitcom-in movie, with all the errors that usually occur in such movies. Laughter is scattered around, and interest decreases after approx. half an hour. The cast is enhanced by known faces like Melvyn Hayes (like "Terry", a character from Episode 2 Season 1 who played on this occasion by Leslie Meadows), Bill Fraser (as factory manager), Anna Dawson, Andria Lawrence who seems to have been in every 70's British comedy film, mostly cast as nymphomaniac and Arthur English. Director John Robins was also in charge of 'Man About the House' film. <br /> <br /> The finest moment - while Eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory, Bill paints his face black. The first thing he knows about it is when the manager's secretary screams in horror. The tables have been reversed!
