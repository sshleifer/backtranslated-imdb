I remember seeing this as a child as part of the Children's Film Foundations Friday Film Specials at CBBC and recently happened on a copy. <br /> <br /> In the twenty years since my last show, this movie has lost nothing. <br /> <br /> It is an atmospheric tale that lures with Cornish folklore and adds elements of truly eerie imagery of the young miner Billy's ghost. <br /> <br /> Shots in the wonderful scenic Port Loe area of ​​the Cornwall movie take advantage of the mix of rugged coastline and abandoned tin mines to make the setting truly credible. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of stuff in this CFF drama, something that has since been lost from children's television today and well a look if you can track a copy.
