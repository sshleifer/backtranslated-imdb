It feels like it's a Czech version of Pearl Harbor. It has the same story, both guys fall in love with the same woman. And add to the twist, the woman is actually a poison whose husband has been missing for a year. I don't think the story is too strong. The younger guy is pretty cheeky, it's cute. It kept me looking because of the emotional music and the pleasant scenes one after the other. It also has some strong visual special effects. Best of all, love stories are seamlessly integrated with history. <br /> <br /> I think if it was in English, it would be such a big shot across the states. It's too bad that not many people are open to foreign films.
