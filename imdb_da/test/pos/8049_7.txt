It's hard to imagine the "Battle of Elderbush Gulch" directed by the legendary D.W. Griffith was made back in 1914. It is a showcase for Griffith's new style. The story is centered around a group of settlers named Cameron Brothers and their families, which include a young waif (Mae Marsh) sent out from the east to live with his uncles and a newly-born young wife (Lillian Gish). A group of Native Americans are trying to catch waifs dog dogs and are driven by the men's folk music. During the confrontation, the Indian chief's son (Henry B. Wathall) is killed. The Indian chief plotted his revenge and launches an attack on the small community of Elderbush Gulch. <br /> <br /> It is this attack that is quite brutal and graphic for this or any other time that forms the core of the image. The Indians beat the cities, people, women and children, and drive them out of town against Cameron's homestead. The newborn child is separated from his mother and the whole hell goes loose. Someone goes to help and returns to the basement with the basement. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes contain some graphic violence. For example, we see a woman being shelled alive, and there is also an order where we see a horse being shot down. I have never seen an animal so convincing on the screen. Mr.Griffith continued to become a champion to build large-scale combat scenes, a talent he would use widely in his epic civil war drama, "The Birth of a Nation" released the following year. <br /> <br /> Although it runs a bit 29 minutes, the "Battle of Elderbush Gulch" is nevertheless an exciting and historic bit of filmmaking. See if you can see Lionel Barrymore and Harry Carey in pieces.
