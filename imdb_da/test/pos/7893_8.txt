If Archie Bunker was armed, he may well have been "Joe". But "All in the Family" would have had a rather short maturity because the censors would never have allowed it to run in accordance with this movie. Joe is a working class guy who is racist and a bigot, and has a big mouth, especially when he's full. One evening, he meets a man in a bar, Bill, who drinks to calm his fractured nerves after killing his daughter's junkie girlfriend, and he lets it slip on Joe. What happens is that Bill's daughter lived with the junkie and she was taken to the hospital after an overdose, and he goes past the opportunity to pick up her stuff, but don't expect him to actually run into the boyfriend who comes in fresh from a big drug deal. In the struggle that arises, the girlfriend is accidentally killed and Bill does not want anyone to really know it of course. But he lets it go to Joe, and then when the newspapers and television reports come out, Joe sees them, puts 2 and 2 together, and suddenly this man is quite in the eye. He is colliding with him later, and of course, Bill is worried that Joe will blackmail him, but not for money, he wants to hang out with him. It is, in a way, almost worse. Now, Bill's daughter escapes from the clinic she is in, and slips home and accidentally hears what happened and then escapes and most of the rest of the movie is Joe & Bill's infiltrating "The Underground" to try to find her. This builds on a rather shocking end, which for me was completely unexpected and ended with just the right note or a wrong note, according to your point of view. A kind of decent but weak prospect of life in the early 70s, mostly from a working bigot point of view, which doesn't make it for everyone, but it's not a bad movie at all, and it's a decent watch. 8 out of 10
