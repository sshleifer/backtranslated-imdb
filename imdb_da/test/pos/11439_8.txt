"The Gig" is a tight, fun and exciting little movie about a group of friends who have regularly gathered to play Dixieland for fun. The group unexpectedly lands a really paying job, in the musicians' perlance; and "gig". <br /> <br /> They travel to upstate NY for a two week concert on a summer vacation minus a member who succumbs to cancer. At the last minute, they hire a professional to take a seat. Things become sticky as an over-the-hill Frankie Valli type tries to get back to the resort and tries to exploit the group as his band. <br /> <br /> The attitude of the professional baseball player gave the guys real truth. By signing up to play two weeks of performance, they broke out of the mouth of someone who needed the job to feed his or her family. While Pop, Rock, Rap, Country and Western, and R&B stars make money out of albums. Jazz musicians have to travel abroad to live. Almost no one gets rich. The boys live their dream too, others cost a necessary income. I think almost anyone who can play a musical instrument with some clever dreams of playing a paying "gig" sometime, Woody Allen and Kevin Bacon are two popular examples of this amateur-to-professional crossover. I especially recommend this movie to anyone who has ever played music professionally. My mother, who was a musician, LOVED it.
