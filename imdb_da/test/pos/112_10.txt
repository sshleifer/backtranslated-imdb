'Water' (2005) is the final part of Indian film director Deepa Mehtas elemental trilogy finally completed, nearly ten years after the release of the very first controversial element 'Fire' (1996), which was followed by a slightly less controversial successor ' 1947: Earth '(1998). Mehta made his direct debut with a 24-minute Canadian short film 'At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch' (1975), but it was her Canadian feature film about the lives of Indians living in Canada that brought her fame back to the east , her country of birth, 'Sam & Me' (1991). Recognition internationally got in the way of 'Camilla' (1994) starring Bridget Fonda along with the actor, who in 1990 won an Oscar in Best Actress in a leading role class at the age of 80, paving the way for medieval actresses to have hope for her depiction of a stubborn old Jewish woman in 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1989), sent Jessica Tandy. <br /> <br /> 'Camilla' treated a friendship between two women from two other ends of human life, a May / December friendship. 'Camilla' was Tandy's last picture; she died the same year. International fame followed Deepa Mehta in 1996 with the release of the controversial "Fire" that spread in anger among the false patriotic consciousness of existing Indian extremist. After exploring friendship between two women in 'Camilla', 'Four' Mehta went one step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women. Viewed in modern India, the suburbs of the capital New Delhi, it shows two brothers and their wives, the older brother (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), who has joined a strange Hindu sect, leads a life of celibacy, faithful to his guru of sex existence. The younger brother (Javed Jaffrey) has an extra marital affair with a Chinese woman (Alice Poon). Thus, both wives, Shabana Azmi, who plays the older brother's wife and Nandita Das the younger wife, are neglected in their own way. A forced to lead a celibacy, thanks to his husband's eccentricities, and the other, whose only interaction with his husband is through sex, and no more. Living in a father-in-law and being the only two outsiders in the family who don't have anyone else to confide in, the two women fall into each other. Thus comes the issue of lesbianism. If there was an outer man's shoulder to cry on, there would probably have been a chance for them to fall into a man's arms, but if no one else trusts, their need for each other's support is quite obvious. It does not necessarily say that all neglected women would end up taking lesbianism, as is the case with the two women in this context. All in all, the film is excellent and dives far deeper than just two women who roll in bed. The main focus is not lesbianism in the movie, but the situation of modern neglected Indian wives, even in the capital, happens to the two female characters only to have a sexual relationship. <br /> <br /> Two years later, Deepa Mehta's second installment element of Mother Earth, published in India named '1947: Earth', was another excellent film by a fantastic instructor, this time in Hindi language, as opposed to "Fire", which was made in English. <br /> <br /> Now, Deepa Mehta has managed to finish the trilogy, despite many problems, having recently released the last installment recently, 'Water'. It is undoubtedly as big as the other two.
