With World War II, film studios quickly rushed to focus on veterinarians who came home. "The best years in our lives" were probably the best example. It portrays various people who return home and how to adapt not only to their pre-war life but to the superior world. Probably the most interesting cast member is non-actor Harold Russell. After losing his hands in the war, he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be and reminds people that he will be treated like everyone else; He continued to win the best supporting actor and a special Oscar for the role, making him the only person ever to win two Oscars for the same role. There will probably always be debate about whether this deserved the best picture more than "It's a wonderful life," but I certainly think they did a good job on it. Very well done.
