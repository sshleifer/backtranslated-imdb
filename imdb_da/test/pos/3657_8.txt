Hari Om is about an impossible love between a French tourist and the auto-rickshaw driver who agrees to take her to a rendezvous with her indifferent boyfriend. A kind of third world road movie that cares for the lush reverie for madcap comedy is characterized by the performance of Vijay Raaz star, which has become one of India's busiest actors in his appearance as an event planner in Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding. <br /> <br /> In an interview, Raaz shows being quite untouched by his success, responding fairly carefully and neatly to questions. He discovered a love of acting and joined a large theater group while at university, but for one with so much formal education is surprisingly artistic about his craft. He speaks of honesty and purity as the wellsprings of his approach, and the seriousness of his desire to communicate something authentic to the audience is clear. On the screen, Raaz creates an emotional integrity and dramatic security that elevates his characterization to an extraordinary level, and director Bharatbala has thrown and directed him perfectly. He has a wonderfully expressive face that the camera enjoys; Close-ups of that face are as convincing as pictures by Camille Natta, who are beautiful as Frenchmen Isa.
