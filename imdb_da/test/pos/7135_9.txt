I had heard of "gaming" and "Dungeons and Dragons" before, but I had known it could be like what I saw in "Gamers: Dorkness Rising." These guys are so funny and fun to watch. Especially the guy playing "bard" or "minstrel" or whatever, he has a gift for physical comedy and timing. There is so much background humor and energy in some of the scenes that make you believe that at least some of it was improvised there on the set. The special effects had to be worked a little, but I saw it on a convention last year, and that is one of the things they said they should do better and do better so it's probably bad now!
