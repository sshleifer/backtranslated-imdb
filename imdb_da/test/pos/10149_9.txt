I can't believe this movie only scores 7.4! This certainly matches the best of Hitchcock's films like VERTIGO or MARNIE. The only reason I can think of why the score is so low is that MAN mostly refrains from violence and certainly does not get a diploma in "sex and crime". <br /> <br /> What it skips is not violence, it is the criminal offenses of these criminals who take a child from their parents and are ready to kill the child if the operation fails. Today, having seen many hard-boiled kidnapping films like Mel Gibson's RANSOM, it seems normal, but in the 1950s, when the family was all in contemporary America, the idea of ​​such a crime certainly touched emotions a lot. <br /> <br /> And this excitement still works for me today. Yes, these guys are selfish, ignorant bastards, disturbing how they act: It is an agreement for them, and they will be "good businessmen", ignoring the fact that business here kidnap children and murder politicians in the opera !! <br /> <br /> What makes the movie great, but the creative aspects, Hitchcock's kinky ideas, the monstrous disturbing scene in the church (bringing it to the viewer attention, how alone how abandoned the protagonists are, no caring, no helper, the people in the church just go home ...), meeting with the owner of that store stuffing and preparing dead animals (which emphasizes the somewhat "oriental" flair movie has from opening scenes abroad), last not least the role of MUSIC in this movie. Music is the key principle here as *** SPOILER *** The murder of the targeted politician must be performed precisely at the moment by a high orbit tutti / gong; so Hitchcock lets the camera follow the orchestra score and you now it will happen in a second *** BANG *** And then, of course, DORIS DAY sings Que Sera, which became more famous than the movie itself; she sings it to let him know that his parents are in the embassy ... <br /> All in all: A classic !!
