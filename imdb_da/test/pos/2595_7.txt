... And there were quite a few of these. <br /> <br /> I don't like this cartoon as much as many others, partly because it was made in its period. I prefer a lot of cartoons with Daffy and Bugs, which are fifteen or more years before hand. Many people like this, especially people who always find violence fun, cartoon or not. <br /> <br /> The basic plot is quite well known for Looney Tunes: Elmer goes hunting, Daffy leads him to Bugs and Daffy ends up being shot instead. Also inserted are quite clever and very entertaining jokes (some do not enhance the episode), nasty recordings and animations that are a bit mediocre. The reason is primarily the gear of jokes - every joke keeps the episode going. This way to get started is not so unusual in Looney Tunes (of course, if you are a Looney Tunes boffin - or an avid one - like me, you already know). <br /> <br /> For people who love everything about Looney Tunes and Daffy Duck, and the sound of what I've said about it, enjoy "Rabbit Spice"! <br /> <br /> 7 and a half out of ten.
