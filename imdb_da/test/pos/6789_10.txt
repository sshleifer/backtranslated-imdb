I hope we will never be cynical as a community to appreciate the simple beauty of this movie: Beautiful looking at the romantic English landscape and beautiful in its message of faith and loyalty. See this with your kids, especially your young daughters - Velvet Brown is a wonderful role model for girls. This was one of my daughter's favorite movies. The story is based on Enid Bagnold's best-selling book about a girl, Velvet, whose entire life is her pi, and about her single-minded pursuit of her "impossible" dream. I don't want to say more about the plot less, I pamper it for first time. She lives with a large loving family in a small coastal town. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that made Elizabeth Taylor a star, and watching the movie is understanding why. She is a natural actress who exudes an inner beauty that matches her outgoing beauty - trusting, passionate, and innocent - she is the emotional core of the movie. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney gives a wonderful performance like Mi, the young man who comes to the door one day, remains, and helps Velvet coach Pi. This is one of his finest performances. Anne Revere also stands as Velvet's mother in an Oscar winning role. Her strong loving and clever character understands that life is not of great value unless you follow your dreams: "We are alike. I also think everyone should have a chance in a fantastic piece of folly once in his life." < br /> <br /> I heartily recommend this very sweet, very inspiring classic from Hollywood's golden age.
