Like Richard Pryor, Mason never got the material he deserved. Whatever you know about him, it's probably wrong. Get past the accent and see his stand-up. You'll be very surprised - he's one of the best stand-ups I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from Lenny Bruce to Eddie Murphy to Jerry Seinfeld to Chris Rock - Jackie Mason is absolutely up there ). He is known for being a cartoon comic. Even Howard Stern said he is one of the 3 most fun comedians ever. <br /> <br /> The accusation that Mason is no Dangerfield is ridiculous. Dangerfield is known for being a great Mason fan. Dangerfield's career was by no means long before he began following Mason's shows. That was when Mason gave Dangerfield inspiration for his "Get No Respect" routine. While I think Dangerfield is great, watch them both stand-up and you'll see Mason's the best comedian.
