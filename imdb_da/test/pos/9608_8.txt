A somewhat typical movie from this era. It was, of course, first understood in this world for the stage, yet a very good movie from the beginning to the end. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to do their stage business on the silver screen and both do it effectively. There is very little in the way of history, and anyone who is not familiar with this type of off beat character study can be a little discouraged by it. All in all, however, A good movie where Peter O'Toole and Susannah York are going to exaggerate.
