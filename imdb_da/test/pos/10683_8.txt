Fans of Gerry Anderson's productions recognize several actors and vehicles from the UFO (made after Doppel walker) - as well as sound effects from various Anderson series. Barry Grey's excellent music (mostly unique to this movie) adds to the feel. For these reasons alone, I think any Gerry Anderson fan would find Doppel walker worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Judged simply as a movie, it has to be said that Doppelgänger is flawless. It is known that there were major problems during production, and I suppose that is why there is a time consuming plot thread that ends suddenly and seems to have no relevance to the rest of the story. Probably time / budget constraints prevented the relevance of appearing! <br /> <br /> Distracting spans the special effects from excellent good - better than any 1960s movie that I know - to disappointingly bad. <br /> <br /> But even with these mistakes, Doppelgänger's main story is told and keeps the viewer (or at least this viewer) engaged throughout. Perhaps the end is not what you can expect from Anderson, but at the same time it is typical of Anderson, and it is certainly appropriate. To find out what I mean, see it yourself. :)
