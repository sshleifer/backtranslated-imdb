This episode so far is the best of the series. The story was told perfectly. I especially liked how the authors made it to a Desmond episode; It was his best performance to date, and he certainly deserved Emmy for his accomplishments. <br /> <br /> We had some of our questions answered in this episode, but since the show is called Lost, we know there will be more issues raised too. First, Walt finally reunited with his father Michael, second, Michael's betrayal is exposed to Jack, Sawyer, Kate, and Hurly and because of this betrayal Kate, Jack and Sawyer are all captured by the others. This was a great way to end the show. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the island we see Locke through a mental breakdown with the button. This leads to another answered question about how the plane really went down. There are, however, some unanswered questions: First, what happened to Locke, Eko and Desmond when Desmond hit the fault key, and what was it about the scientists in the Arctic looking for electromagnetic annamolies. Guess we'll find out next season, but great for the best show on TV.
