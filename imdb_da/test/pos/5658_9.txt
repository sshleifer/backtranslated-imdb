During World War II in the Philippines, Japanese soldiers are starving, dying, growing weak and becoming more and more crazy. A small group of soldiers trying to stay alive have finally threatened cannibalism. This movie perfectly portrays the madness that overtakes people under extreme conditions. There are a few humorous parts in this movie, but most of it is just a very slow moving and realistic movie. It follows these soldiers from a painful moment to another and finally to death. A very interesting movie showing the death and horror of what may have been the worst war the world has ever seen.
