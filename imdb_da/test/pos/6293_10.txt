One of our all-time family favorites. When we need a laugh ... we just put this in and laugh all the way, as if it's the first time we've seen it. This movie has good, clean family humor. Pauly Shore is brilliant! With no plans for the Thanksgiving holiday, Crawl (Shore) is invited to spend the holidays with a conservative coed, Becca. Crawl, a big-city boy, needs to adapt to the farm if he falls in love with Becca. But Crawl is not the only one who learns new things. Crawl teaches Becca and her parents how to be more open about their feelings and accept others. This is fun for viewers of all ages.
