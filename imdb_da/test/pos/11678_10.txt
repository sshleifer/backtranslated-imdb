This review may include SPOILERS! The decline of Western civilization ...... what a good title eh? And of a good movie. This is the best concert movie I've ever seen. One second is Talking Heads movie "Stop Making Sense". I first heard of this movie when Waynes World came out in 1992. I looked at the director's name Penelope Spheeris and thought cold name, what did he do more? I thought the first name was pronounced as an envelope. After some time in movie guides I came across the critically acclaimed Decline and realized Penelope was a woman ..... my mother corrected me. I spent 8 years of my life trying to track this. I finally saw VHS in Vancouver, where I currently live. It was worth the wait. This catches the LA punk movement very well. This is teenage anxiety on the best people. My favorite is the band Germs who need subtitles for the lyrics, because Darby Crash sings so crazy you can't understand it. I laughed when I saw this. The band Black Flag lives in an abandoned church, and the band X is a very intelligent pile. Also laugh at the letter, write an idiot to Slash Magazine about how we don't have to save the whales, there are countless miles of ocean for us to pour toxins into! I became a huge Penelope Spheeris fan after this and so all his punk movie Dudes were ok and Suburbia is a cult classic! I own both of these at VHS. She is a true underground film producer and I love her stuff. I would have loved to have seen this movie in 1994, when grunge was so popular. I was a big Nirvana fan, but unfortunately I saw this in 2002 and by that time I had grown out of grunge and now I listen to Crystal Method / Fatboy Slim. Quite a change of pace, I know, but what can you do? But if you want a real portrayal of the punk movement, it's better than anything else. Much better than 1991: The Year Punk Broke. It's a hard movie to track, but if you get your hands on it, rent it, even if you don't like the music, it's a great job. Now it can be easier to find with DVDs that are so popular. By the way, Penelope produced a little known Albert Brooks movie called "Real Life", which I also own. Very fun stuff in today's reality tv craptacular! Rent Decline ...... Recommended! Thanks!
