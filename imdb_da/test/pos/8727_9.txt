Goldie Hawn's depiction of a simple young lady caught in a love triangle with an elderly man, a dentist who played with such a taste by Walter Matthau, that she won the best entertaining actress Oscar for 1969. <br /> <br /> film is another tribute to Ingrid Bergman. Rarely did we see her in a comedy, and she literally jumps up her heels here as a dedicated dental care nurse who is pushed into a scheme for Matthau to tell Hawn that they are married. <br /> <br /> Seeing Matthau and Bergman fall to each other here is such a joy. Their is an unintentional love affair in the making. As Matthew's friend, Jack Weston is fabulous as his partner in the scheme. Rick Lenz provides ample support as well as Hawn's newly created boyfriend as well.
