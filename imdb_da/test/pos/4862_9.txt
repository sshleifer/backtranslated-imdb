Cleopatra 2525 is a very fun, entertaining show. You shouldn't take the whole show seriously, but if you want to have fun, that's your TV show. Being produced by Xena is a quality guarantee, and Cleopatra 2525 is not so different from Xena. The female war formula is brought forth in the future, where they do not have to fight for warriors or gods, but dangerous robots that live on the surface, and humans have to live underground. Along Cleopatra's two seasons, they develop an interesting and fun underground world, and we know the three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). They are all different, but as a team they work really well. The three main actresses appeared earlier in Xena, like most of the regular / guest casts (there are also some famous faces from Hercules or from both shows). I especially liked the character of Danielle Cormack (Ephiny in Xena), which is very different from any of her roles I previously knew. So if you liked Xena and Hercules, you'll love Cleopatra 2525. If you don't know them, try it: I'm sure you enjoy it.
