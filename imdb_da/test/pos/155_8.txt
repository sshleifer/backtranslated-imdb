The vampire "craze" has in my opinion actually proved its dignity of such infamous categorization. There were many subgenre films last year from a large number of countries. I have reviewed many and have a few more to discuss. Forgive my indulgence, but since I have recognized the trend as a phenomenon (as it is and randomly it has my favorite fear). I will now move outside of North America for a bit and introduce you to hopefully mean movies that you don't like now. <br /> <br /> Of the many effects of Twilight, the creation of "guy" and "girl" is vampire film. I hate this sexist categorization, which aims to polarize a whole generation of fans into "pages". I think men tend to have Stephenie Meyer's work (and its offspring) to some degree because they feel some sense that an archetype that was always theirs is now liberated. Women can hardly enjoy future "neutral" images since they grew up with ironclad expectations that were enforced four times. We need more directors to create vampire films that both genders are able to enjoy (odd) whose vampires must survive the craze and remain relevant. Cue: Thirst This Korean movie was directed by Park Chan-Wook by Oldboy fame. There are two ways to dissect it. Either it stretches between gender expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable, or it is a fiery mess that does not determine which target audience it prefers and therefore should be viewed by none. Don't let me convince you that the movie has no inclinations. Its director is a man whose fame is story-driven action movies. Its main character is male and has a passive-aggressive interest in his lover (more on this later). Nevertheless, his desire for a woman known both before and after mortal life has not been constructed and his attention returns. There is a male slope on this picture, but it is not so unilateral that women could not enjoy it. The same cannot be said of Daybreakers or New Moon. The plot follows a Emile Zola novel called Thérèse Raquin, which I have not read. According to Wikipedia, the story is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man. He kills his husband during a fishing trip and begins to dance her. The two of them are unable to have sex because they show the dead man's body between them. They are thus driven to insanity, but beware of the woman's weak mother. At the conclusion of the novel, they try to kill each other, discover each other's plans and commit suicide. Transcribe this nearly 150 year old French novel to modern South Korea and you have Thirst. Chan-Wook does not decorate the story enough to raise this in order to see. He often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration. I think the most memorable parts are when his flounder is unhinged by narration. His use of mother-in-law as a foil for their bad romance is just perfect. See it. The protagonist is originally a devoted Christian who becomes a vampire after a defective blood transfusion following his volunteer work for a new medicine. He thus becomes the god he once was merged with. People flock to him and see him as a grand healer. OKAY. It is really cool and could have provided a good basis for his relationship. Nevertheless, this idea is given little idea screen time as he turns into a realistic Christ figure trying to maintain his virtue, even though his lifestyle requires him to renounce it. Instead of confronting the errant people, he instead releases blood from comatose hospital patients. <br /> <br /> Let's continue with the Christian allusion. The woman tricks the vampire man to kill his husband. Her overprotective mother-in-law suffers a stroke and eventually warns family members of the daughter-in-law's betrayal (finger-birds). The man kills her, but revives her. The two invite former friends and the woman begins to relentlessly harass the people. The man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her to wait for sunrise with him. They both die, but he cares for his crimes (and his own, but the film portrays her evil more prominently). The woman's character is caricature, and her profession gives an explanation for her behavior. She is a housewife without education while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive. Vampirism magnifies their properties. She becomes a monster as one would expect from someone without knowledge. He becomes a demigod with a spirit. His life is how atheists see themselves and her life is how religious people see them without divine intervention.
