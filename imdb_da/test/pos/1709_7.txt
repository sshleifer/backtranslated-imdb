I've been a fan of Larry Kings show for a while, I think he does a great job in general, and I don't think he ever wusses out as so many people seem to believe. He is a subtle Scorpio, he gets his zinger in when he needs it, just as he managed to do last night with Paris Hilton during his first post-prison interview. <br /> <br /> The whole story case What really amazes me is that Hilton is still apparently unclear as to why Judge Sauer gave her what she thought was a too harsh sentence (and more, actually made it serve it). She was in prison all the time, presumably only 23 hours a day in her cell, she never even traveled the events that led her to the sentence that Judge Sauer was so apt to impose on her. She never even realized that it could just have averted a large red flag when she (1) appeared late for the court of the original hearing and (2) continued to inform him when he asked her, did she not know that her license had been suspended, she did not get the papers in the post that "I have people reading that kind of thing for me." <br /> <br /> All the time she was in her cell, she never came to the realization that this act (turns out late) and this statement - and more importantly, the attitude - the complete cavalier violation of the court system and law in general and her driving privileges, especially that she showed - could just have made Judge Sauer (excuse the pun) angry with her. <br /> <br /> Last night, at the King's show, after learning how to change her forever for her traumatic experience, how she "learned" her lesson, she replied to her question: " Do you think I have a raw deal? "With a resounding yes. And during the conversation (if you can call it), she said more than once that she didn't feel she deserved what had happened to her. King asked gently more than once if she did not feel she was creating situations in her life, which she "finds" in which she was basically staring at him. She therefore firmly holds the conscious belief that she has become the victim of this situation; she does not understand how she herself caused it, that day in court, by her cavalry attitude with the judge. I feel this is very sad - tragic, even considering what a great "role model" Hilton is for some people, and it does something she said last night about her so-called rehabilitated state in the realms of complete and complete cluelessness, contradiction and hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> During the interview, Hilton called for a lot of time in his cell, reading the Bible. At the end of the interview, King scored big points by asking her what her favorite Bible passage was. She responded by grinning disturbingly over her pathetic notes (utterly superficial non-insights as she had read on the air as if she were Nelson Mandella or something) and eventually slipped out: "I don't have a favorite passage." <br /> <br /> Judge Sauer, in my book, is a hero, and after last night, Larry King is also subtly exposing Hilton to what she really is.
