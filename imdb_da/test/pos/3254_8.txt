After watching and loving this movie in Australia, I was very keen to get me paws on a copy. I got a DVD back in the UK just to find out that it is a very different edit. <br /> <br /> The domestic Australian editing, I saw, is snappy. The UK, and I presume European editing, spends much longer on the narrator, played by Jimmy's death brother. And truly belabours it and gets other points for no real benefit. It's not a serious criticism, but the Oz editor is just quicker and I think more confident. <br /> <br /> I can't say why they felt it needed to expand into the overseas market? <br /> <br /> So carefully one you go to. <br /> <br /> I went to both.
