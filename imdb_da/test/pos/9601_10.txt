I can't add much to what has already been said except I have to because of minimal 10-line policy. <br /> <br /> I actually got this on a VHS to DVD copy, but the quality is pretty poor and I desperately need to be officially released. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine what extras I would like to see (Tim Healy's character, praying through one of those 'Football Bloopers' type programs would be great!). You can imagine it now, can't you? But of course, most people seem to have to continue to dream of a DVD release. <br /> <br /> Certainly to God, there must be someone in the DVD publishing department at ITV who also knows something about British culture, is web savvy and has enough about them to look at IMDb now and then? Oh yes.
