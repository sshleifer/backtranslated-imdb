Hope the summary line won't annoy you so much (it's a small tribute to the Chappelle Show / Charlie Murphy, but also to the Daywalker sign). But I will try to put all the things I liked about the movie in a section and everything I did not like in another section so it will be easier to read! <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good stuff! The quote "strong bloody violence" (which is used by the scorecard to describe the contents of a movie, fits here very well. This is not a movie for children! Or too weak of heart! It has Blade as a central character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal ) and a crazy enough storyline to keep / justify action scenes! The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. The action scenes are also good here, OK to the things I didn't like. The overall story is too thin. is probably as I have written above to keep the action scenes together, but there could be more, and a sign like Blade deserves more (imo) is not the best ... even that is the use of clich√©s does not help. ... That's it !: o)
