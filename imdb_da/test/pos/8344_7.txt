This film is apparently intended for a young evangelical Christian audience as a teaching tool. For that I give it a 7 out of 10 point vote. It's a decent movie showing a youth group, but I don't think it gets very well received beyond that. For any other audience I would rate it much lower. <br /> <br /> The reviewers who saw "It's a wonderful life" in this were right by, though I didn't think about it before they mentioned it. I was reminded more of a "Chick Tract", the small 3 "of 5" evangelical comics. If Jack Chick ever made a movie out of one of his channels, it would look very much like "Second Glance." It has a strong Christian message about the power of prayers and the influence we each have on earth, but it is somewhat hampered by Christian stereotypes. The Christians are all very handsome, a little passive and creakingly clean, while all the non-Christians seem to be bad people. Muriel angel plays a big role and he is the corniest, cheesiest character in the movie. He's the most incredible angel I've ever seen in any movie, and the biggest negative. I do not know if the directors intended to get out of his personality so much or if he just struck me that way. (I admit he reminded me of someone I know.) Dancing love for a very secular girl who is not at all his type drives the plot in this movie. Why he ever fell for her in the first place, the one question I wanted was answered. <br /> <br /> But the movie shows positive Christian values ​​and your youth group will be entertained as they see something healthy with a good lesson.
