This little-known comedy from the hit game of Ruth Gordon is a pleasure. The script, based on the game, is spicy, rich and completely dated. Ditto thrown, but I must emphasize the work of the leading lady Irene Dunne. Irene is simply amazing - as usual - and lights up on the screen with every frame she's in (and she's a lot in it, thank you sky). In addition, director Vidor has given her some unusual close-ups that are fascinating. What a mad! I know of no other Hollywood actress from any era who has its versatility and is so convincing in any movie. Why she stays so little known is a mystery. I've seen most of her movies and this one was a surprise, even for a solid ID fan like myself. See it all!
