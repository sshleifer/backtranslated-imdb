Somehow, somewhere, anywhere .. you can watch this movie. Breath taking antennas and incredible excellent performances from highly gifted actors. You think Cirque du Soleil is blowing in mind, wait until you see what these 2 women do - most importantly, the emotional journey and struggle Jane (Dreya Weber) faces universal in the theme of many women. An excellently directed movie that deals with the complexity of relationships and keeps going until you are ready to let go. This masterpiece will affect both women and men. Down Father (instructor / writer) and ridiculously talented Dreya Weber (star / producer) just had the courage to tell it honestly and sincerely. This movie gets big - watch it IF you can - or you won't be "in the loop" when it becomes one of the most talked about movies.
