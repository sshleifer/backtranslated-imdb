After growing up with GWTW, I scolded both the "Scarlett" sequel book and the mini series so far. When I recently watched the video for the first time, I was amazed at how much I enjoyed watching Timothy Dalton's depiction of Rhett Butler and Joanne Walley-Kilmer as Scarlet. I feel that "Scarlet" should be judged on its own rather than trying to compare with the venerable Selznick masterpiece GWTW. While the "Scarlet" story and part of the dialogue suffered due to lack of inspired writing, I generally thought it was a worthy dramatization of what could have been between Scarlett and Rhett.
