As a fan of history, mythology and fantasy "Mystic Knights" show pulled me in from get-go. It has semi-decent scripting, the costumes are amazing (there are exceptions), it's pretty good to trade, and heroes and villains all play well together. <br /> <br /> SCRIPTS - a half script is It's pretty good, the other half falls flat, but it all blends together, which means many episodes become uneven. Also, some of the key players are repeatedly given dead lines (King Conchobar and Angus for example) to be given something ... more. I'm not sure what, but the authors have to come up with something. NOTE - Except for some villains of villagers (horrid lines they end up putting too much effort into), casting did extremely well in choosing their leads and so on. Everyone, good and bad, works well together! COSTUMES / Weapons - The daily clothes that everyone wears are spectacular! Mystic Knight's armor, which is short, is Deirdre and Garrett's. A chainmail bikini would probably have better protection in her case ... and wouldn't look like plastic; He looks like a lot of snap-it-together pieces of brown plastic when it comes to bronze. Ivar's trident looks like it was bought at a discount store, and while Garrett's weapons look cool, they also look plastic. Recently, "Mystic Knights" have taken too many "Power Rangers" moves if you see the show you know what I mean. As the series progresses, however, it must find its niche and perfect its style. All in all, it is a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy (most of my friends and I see it and we are all 20+). The ground thickens and twists, although it gets a little young in places, and everything just gets more interesting. It may be of interest to fans of the movie "Willow" or the T.V. series "The Adventures of Sinbad". A lot of adventure, a dope of mystery, a touch of romance, a thrill of forces on nature ... Check it out! (Min score: 7/10)
