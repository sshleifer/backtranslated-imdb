Dennis Patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and then reveals his secret at a local bar. Joe (Peter Boyle), a bigot who gets filled there, first takes it as a joke, but then the story is confirmed at the evening news. Instead of calling the police or the like, Joe decides that when the guy killed a hippie, they must be related spirits! He chants the man to become his friend. In the beginning, the film seemed harsh and judgmental, but as it revealed itself, it actually became a complex portrait of the present society. Yes, I think it exaggerates a little, but in entertaining ways that do not really detract from the power of its messages. Susan Sarandon debuted in this movie and it's a shock to see how beautiful she was about 23. Well worth seeing.
