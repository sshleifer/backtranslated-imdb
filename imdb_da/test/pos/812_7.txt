... and I'm so disappointed because I can't seem to buy the DVD or VHS anywhere. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of mix of Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald is fabulous as it spoiled the teenager. This was made when Molly was still a brunette, just before she hit the big time with Pretty In Pink. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy with one edge! <br /> <br /> If someone has a copy of this or knows where to get one ... please leave a message to me - it will be greatly appreciated.
