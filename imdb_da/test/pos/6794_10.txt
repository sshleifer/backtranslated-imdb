This movie is ageless and would probably appeal to children today even though there is no Jedi in the whole thing. Of course, Elizabeth Taylor was the most beautiful child in the world, and her acting is also amazing. Even Mickey Rooney is good; the same is Anne Revere and Angela Lansbury. The world was somewhere else when this movie was released and it is definitely a great place to visit.
