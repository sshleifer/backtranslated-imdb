I caught this late, late Mexican cable, and I have to rant about it. The title was translated into "Secretos" (Secrets). Well, there is a secret that has an important role in the movie, but come on! We're not stupid. We know there is a novel behind this. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is quite interesting and it is worn by its solid ramic performances. The always beautiful and amazing Jordana Brewster and Christopher Eccleston deliver amazing performances and have so much chemistry between them. Cameron Diaz is also good, though she has minimal on-screen time. Blythe Danner is perfect, and his last appearance in the film touches, sad. Great performances. <br /> <br /> The character of the Earth and her sister's ex-boyfriend travel to Europe to get her to handle her demons and understand why her sister died. Through flashbacks, we learn the sad truth, and we can't help excusing the whole family. The end is really moving. <br /> <br /> So there's nudity, but it's minimal. In fact, the sex scenes are artistic and do not intend to be steamy or sexy. To be honest, I kept an eye out for Joranda Brewster's on-screen charming and beauty. And I ended up suffering the story and the dramatic presentations. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a try if you like solid dramatic features. Great film. The last last scene was very sad .. The two little sisters through flashbacks.
