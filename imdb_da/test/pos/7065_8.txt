I can hardly call this a good movie, but it is entertaining. In my case, at the time this movie was released, I was the same age as some of the younger campers in the movie. For me to watch this movie brings the memories of my camps back. While some of the pranks that take place in this movie, like leading the campman into his bed and leaving him on the side of a road, tied up in the trees or out on a lake, are a little over the top some of the others pranks are not. When I went to the camp bars and advisers, similar stunts like running underwear pulled up in the flagpole, canoe battles and boys raide the girls' cab. As I got older, I realized that these night battles for the girl cabins I attended were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so we couldn't find the girls in embarrassing situations, but at that time I thought it was right, and it was fun. This is what the BUYBOLDER (MB) is. <br /> <br /> MB not only captures the scenic beauty of camp surroundings but the beauty of being young and carefree. MB gives a good example of pre-teens, teens and young adults who live their summer without worries other than guys who are connected with girls and girls who quit the guys and the cabin who have as much fun as possible before they go back to junior high & high school and college. The open title song that goes "Are you ready for the summer? ... no more homework, no more books, no more teachers dirty appearance ..." describes exactly how summer is seen by school children. <br /> <br /> I personally enjoyed the two campers Spaz and Fink. Which boy, geek or jock, does not spend the whole camp trying to enjoy a beautiful girl campsite? Which guy didn't want to be accepted by the other campers and advisors? While these two characters are over the top, I strike with everyone who sees the movie, nothing more than like these two guys. These two characters are a mix of Charlie Brown from PEANUTS and Jack Tripper & Larry Dallas from THREE'S COMPANY. I bet most viewers are even cheering for Spaz in egg-burning competition and for Fink as he tries to "beat his stomach" in hot dog's eating competition. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie had normal-looking children and counselors. No supermodels for advisers or campers who had trendy clothes. It's fun to just kick back and watch this movie and remember when life was as fun as this movie.
