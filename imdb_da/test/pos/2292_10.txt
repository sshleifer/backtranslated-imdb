I agree with the guy above, it's so much fun I understand everything, but my friends just don't get it. Go to Japan and you will see another movie after being there. When I met my boyfriend's father in his home in Kanagawa. I swear I felt the same as Jack. scared, but at the end of the day it was good, so I give this movie a 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I've seen it at least 30 times, take it with me to look at the plane flying to Japan next month. One thing that is really good is the scenes of the ball. Makes me feel like I'm there again. This is a must see if you have any interest in Japan and Baseball. Too bad they do not make a successor. Does anyone know where the scenes of the temple were filmed and the argument with hirko in the walkway with a roof on it ???? need to know so I can win an argument with my Japanese ex-wife. thanks
