1931 also presented "an American tragedy", the original tale of "who will he deal with, poor girl or rich girl". This was a really entertaining movie. Bab's stanwyck was a beautiful, as she could be, sally blane. Monroe Owsley played unmemorably Bab's husband. I had never heard of him, but I thought he had a good physical resemblance to Bing Crosby of "The Big Broadcasting" ('32), even a retro hairline and velvet. Ricardo Cortez, the rich playboy with a heart of gold. a real movie pioneer goes back. The dilemma has been resolved at the end, to the tribes in the title, and I think Annette hanshaw had the hit recording, even though the screen voice did really well. I also enjoyed the dance hall scenes. I'm sure they were authentic; the band, a leading one of the time was fantastic. good work, Lionel Barrymore !!!!
