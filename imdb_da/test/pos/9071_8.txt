Very exciting surprisingly intelligent movie about five medical students planning themselves and then reviving to share their experiences with death and what lies outside. Joel Schumacher dishes with some skills - creates some very scary scenes as well as particularly beautiful. The visions of death are not what viewers can expect or what awaits us all when we go - thanks to the screenwriter Peter Filardi, who really did an excellent job coming up with this story. While the creativity of history is impressive, history also has many gaps, especially in the logic department and credibility factors. Despite all this, Flatliners is a good effective movie because of the script, the direction that is again very surreal at times, and the play that brings together four very talented actors and William Baldwin. This core of actors works and reacts very nicely. Keifer Sutherland does a very impressive job as the group leader - the one who comes up with the idea of ​​dying and being born again. He also manages to portray a man - a young man - with a devastating, devastating secret from his past. Kevin Bacon is fine as the most pragmatic and skeptical of the group. Oliver Platt is really good as the voice of reason and human fear. Flat has some really good lines and plays the paranoia well. Yes, Julia Roberts is also here and very good. The actors do the best, however, by playing each other and making us believe that they are such good friends. I was duly impressed by much of Flatliners, but more than anything else, the story affected me the most. The scene with the dog hobbling around the street, only one of the powerful images evoked as were many of the "flashback" scenes.
