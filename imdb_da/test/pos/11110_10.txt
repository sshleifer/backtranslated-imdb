Fame, I think, was the best movie I've ever seen. In ways it was fun and dramatic, but that's what makes a movie. True, it has a few loose ends, in fact much, but I still think it is a great movie. Some of the fun things happen in the audition at the start of the movie. I think it's fun when the girl tries to behave O.J. Simpson in "The Towering Inferno" and Raul / Ralph go to all the art departments and say his father was good to every one. He says his father danced with the Rockets and left Ralph his print shoe. The rockets, as far as I know, consist of women. And the shoe boxes were just regular shoes with bottlenecks on the bottom. Also, the guy reading the lines Juliet in Romeo and Juliet games was fun. One thing about the movie that just turns me on is the music. I have never heard anything like that !!! My favorite song is "I sing Body Electric" and my other is the theme song itself "Fame". Irene Cara has a good voice and is a great actress. I like the way the film focused on many ethnic groups. It showed all kinds of people actually found in what is now called "La Guardia School of Performing Arts". This film showed triumphs and trials of many young artists, including Angelo, Doris, Bruno, Coco, Montgomery, Ralph, Leroy, Hilary and Liza. They all had a hard time, but made it their own way. This movie could have added about. 30-45 minutes (before the exam), but it's still my favorite movie no matter what !!!!
