I saw this last night and voted it an "8". Since then it has grown on me and I will give it a "9". <br /> <br /> The movie has (at first) a seemingly slightly interrupted facade between the first and second half. The first half is a comedy, and there is a slight hint of the violent truths of epochs, life, wars, religious intolerance that will be revealed in the second half. Although it may be a bit confusing at first, because it is a slightly unfamiliar storyline, it reflects it. <br /> <br /> The action was good (Hultz in the role of Alex, the interpreter, was particularly great). <br /> <br /> I have scanned most other "User Comments" and see that some who have read the book are happy with the movie while there are some who are not. Both feelings are of course valid. <br /> <br /> For me, a retired family therapist and one-world believer believed that the film was relevant at two different levels. <br /> <br /> The first, like history, gave a strong reminder of how often polarizations occur - with demonization and trying to eradicate any of them with a different moral value system than our own. <br /> <br /> The second was to demonstrate the first one, also revealing something in common to each of us, all our families - that we should all go back to our roots to understand ourselves more. br /> <br /> TS Eliot expressed this exquisite in the fourth of his "four quartets" when he said, "We must not cease exploration // And the end of all our exploration // Will arrive where we started // And know the place for the first time. " <br /> <br /> Jonathan goes on a satisfying journey that some of us would find great lighting - exploring and discovering our roots; What were these people through then, who were they - really! - before, when and in the early years before and after we were born? Contract. Thus, the film first gives the impression of a comedy, then it changes to give us a lesson in history and human shortcomings, but through all that, it also gives us - subliminally - a message about each one of ourselves. We all would be rewarded a lot for going back and understanding the place from which we first started.
