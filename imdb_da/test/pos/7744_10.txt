"Tempest" is a somewhat self-releasing, uneven, discursive film. But as Lord Byron, another visitor to Greece, protested against his friend John Murray about his similar self-forgiving and discursive "Don Juan". "It can be disadvantageous, but isn't it life?" <Br /> <br /> The connections to Shakespeare's "Tempest" may seem like another commentator here claims a bit foggy. But watch the movie again after you read "The Tempest" and they will look much closer. What makes this movie flawed is its troubled mix of just normal narration and sudden discouraging apparent improvisation, especially between Cassavetes and Rowland. But to be honest, these scenes are the most remarkable and poignant in the movie if it is hard to see. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie, composed by Stomu Yamashta, is also overlooked. Particularly fine is the perfect little piece of game to accompany the afternoon teas, as humans, animals and apparently the whole island collapse to sleep away the hottest part of the afternoon. It is a sublime moment, and representative of the best aspect of this movie and the one thing that keeps it somewhat unified, that (apart from extensive flashbacks and the end) it is the story of a day on an island, from the awakening tonight. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'd rather watch this movie one hundred times than seeing any bombastic Hollywood piece of shit once. And in fact I've probably seen it several dozen times. Most times I see something I missed before. <br /> <br /> (Confession: I'm biased. This was the second movie I took my Greek-American goddess wife to see.) <br /> <br /> Trivia notes on this flick: <br /> <br /> - It was Molly Ringwald's first film, as well as Sam Robards'; <br /> <br /> - It wasn't actually filmed on an island, but in Gytheion, the southern tip of the remote Mani Peninsula on the Peloponnese Greece; <br /> <br /> - The primitive special effects (according to today's standards) were performed by Bran Ferren, who later became Disney Imagineering, and still later was a US intelligence adviser; <br /> <br /> - Paul Mazursky, the director, chose the title of his recent autobiography, "Show Me the Magic" from the "Tempest."
