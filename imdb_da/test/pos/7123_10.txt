I saw the original rough screen that showed 4 times at Gencon a couple of years ago. I was glad to have done what my daughter is in the movie. <br /> <br /> I was behind the living room with her and looked at the much younger fans sitting on the edge of the pitches, dead quiet, no one wanting to miss a line. The standing ovation afterwards was like watching the fans when the US hockey team beat the Russians at the Olympic Games in Montreal. <br /> <br /> I love great comedy and sighters. Taxi, Barney Miller, Bowl, Frasier and Married to Chilren are my favorite comedy shows of all time. Smaller shows, I don't even want to see. <br /> <br /> This movie will make for Gamers what Animal House did for College Frat days, what Dodge Ball did for strange sports. Forget the lack of a mega budget that supports production. This is pure art, it is so good. <br /> <br /> I couldn't be happier for the entire casting and manufacturing company.
