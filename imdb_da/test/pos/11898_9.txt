I just want to say that this movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> I loved it from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> The action was amazing. The director did a fantastic job and I would like to see it again. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly did a very good performance, The guy who interprets his father (Manny) was another great actor, but I can't remember his name. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for El Padrino II. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa looks so good and I think he's one of the most talented actors out there. There are desires of Latin actors who do a good job as shown in this movie! <br /> <br /> Rent it !!! Rent it !!! Rent it !!!
