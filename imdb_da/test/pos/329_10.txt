Hello everyone! I went to this movie with no expectation, even though I knew Maniratnam would have given a great movie! I was stunned !! The background is the struggle between the Tamils ​​settled in Sri Lanka and the government. The story is about how a young girl, Amudha, who lives with her parents in Chennai, India, leaves Sri Lanka to find her real mother. The high points of the movie are the performances of each actor and actress and of course, cinematography, editing and all other technical details. Full marks for the chestnut and the crew. I must mention cinematography as it brings the war out in such a way that you feel yourself there. Excellent work! Although the war sequences reminded me of saving private Ryan, such a work was never attempted on Indian screen. Overall, the movie is amazing! And hats off to Mr.Maniratnam. <br /> <br /> Once again, Mani Ratnam has proven that he is an instructor who can take Indian cinema to great heights! I would love to watch this movie again and again. An excellent movie and a must see.
