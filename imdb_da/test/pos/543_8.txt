Girly Movies? Of course .... been done before? Many times .... Predictable? Yes ..... worth seeing? You can believe that! I was fond of Sarandon and Portman's portraits of otherwise storekeepers in a known storyline. I'm a big fan of mother / daughter stories. What makes the difference between the good and the weak. IS the performances and character development. Although this is not the best of its genre, I will buy it and watch it again. I felt the characters were trustworthy and the actor was superior.
