*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** It's easy to see why the script for this movie won an Oscar. At least in the first half. My head spread from all the cunning lines that whizzing by. Noel Coward plays a New York publisher ('Why don't you publish books that you like?' - 'What? And destroy the public?') It charms and manipulates its many hangers. Then he dies in a plane crash, and the story turns into a bizarre Flying Dutchman start, where Coward must find a person who really grieves him before his soul can rest in peace. Very fun until it gets bizarre. Seen at Cinefest in Syracuse in March 2003.
