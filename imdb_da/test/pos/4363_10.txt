This movie is excellent! Fear of watching documentaries? Cancel your shrinkage and see a little Dieter's story. You won't believe how captivating this fine piece of filmmaking is until you've experienced it. I am eager to say that almost every Vietnam war movie, including Apocalypse Now, goes down. It's a real story, it's a personal story, a story of love of flight, the dream of being pilot and nightmare to be shot down over enemy territory. Everything is shot in a "return to ..." style - on-site Herzog asked the questions, Dieter responded to them in a memorable German-English accent, and with a good memory pointed out what happened about 25 years before. There is this part I told friends over and over again: Bailed out from his US Navy, Dieter becomes a POW by Vietcong. Blindfolded for most of the days he is pulled through the Southeast Asian jungle for miles and miles - on bare feet. Tortured, insulted, disoriented, starved and covered by infectious wounds, they arrive in a small, friendly village to stay overnight. The next morning, after walking for several hours, Dieter discovers someone stole his wedding ring from his finger. That is it. He can't take more. He begins to cry as a result of complete exhaustion. The Vietcong men react surprised. Diets manage to explain what happened. Immediately, the group returns to the village and begins to search for the person who stole the ring. They find the man, immediately cutting his finger and turning the ring back to Dieter. - The film is full of these insane and surprising situations. The enormous cultural differences, clashes between East and West, fear of the unknown (that is, all that stands for America on one side, Asian jungles and his secrets on the other) can feel the whole movie. Back problems? That's because you sat at the edge of your seat for two hours and didn't.
