I have described this movie as surprising ... this is true in many respects. The black man wrongly accused, the characters (people you expect to be stereotypes, often show uncharacteristic attitudes during the film), the production ... All these factors make it a refreshingly unusual movie, especially for its time (1949). The only possible spoilers are the sometimes cheesy dialogue and occasionally high moral attitude. <br /> <br /> But if you happen to do that when you're not planning to watch a movie, you might find yourself like me - staying in the middle of the night just to see what's happening. <br /> <br />
