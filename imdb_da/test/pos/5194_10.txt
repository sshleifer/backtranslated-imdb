Describing Stalingrad as a war film can be a little inaccurate. Sure it centers on the longest and bloodiest struggle in world history, in the most expansive theater of the most expensive war of life, money and matériel ever. Yes it contains action scenes depicting bitter fighting and horrible destruction. However, the visceral narrative and harsh images make it more than a war movie, even more than an anti-war film. Stalingrad is instead a film about absolute and undeniable hell. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with visual descriptions of the worst kind of war, a person who is intensely personal and close, where days are used to take a city block, only to have it resumed in a surprise attack. The early form of modern city war insurance, which the Germans came to call the Rat Warfare, is depicted in brutal and uncompromising terms. The characters wage in sewer tunnels, railway values ​​and from building to building in the hell bomb scape of destroyed Stalingrad, only to be defeated by the unforgivable Russian winter. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the issue of Nazism and the Germans' anger during the time that many other films from both Germany and the rest of the world do. Its characters are a group of soldiers swept together by the war winds and simply try to make it out with themselves and as many of their peers as possible alive. The characters do not fight the Soviets out of any ideological hatred between national socialism and Soviet communism, not for any great dream of Grossdeutschland or racial superiority. They only fight because if they do not make the enemy, they will kill them, and if the enemy does not, their own officials will certainly refuse to fight. This depiction adds another layer to the stifling envelope of trapped hopelessness that permeates the film. <br /> <br /> A kind of base companion to Das Boot, Stalingrad hits the epic battle of World War II in a personal light and from the unexpected perspective of the ordinary German soldier as a sort of hero became tragic by circumstances and a brutal government who would distort his victim.
