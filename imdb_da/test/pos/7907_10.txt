My cousins ​​and I have seen this movie ever since we were young. I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we locked this imaginative movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories. I absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good healthy family movies, because that's exactly what this is. The things that the four children get into are absolutely fun to see. It's an old movie, but don't let it fool you. This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong bonding to each other.
