I once caught a 20 minute part of this movie on Turner Classic Movies about 6 months back. I thought every minute what I was looking at was gold, and because it was somewhere in the middle of the movie and I didn't want to spoil it all, if I had to see it from the start, I decided I would rent it immediately. Well, the video store that I often didn't have a copy so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. I had previously experienced that only some Chaplin shorts were fun, but not very artificial, but after I saw The Great Dictator's edition, I checked out three of his other films, City Lights, The Gold Rush and Modern Times (City Lights were good, i found Gold Rush a little overvalued but still worth it, and i found Modern Times to be one of the funniest movies i've ever seen (other funniest behind Keaton's Sherlock Jr., more precisely). <br /> <br /> Finally, the whole great dictator, to be honest, it had its moments, both comedy and drama, but these moments do not always interfere well, Chaplin's comedy worked well when mixed with the melodrama (City Lights is the best example this), but it did not always work with social commentaries, and the fact that there was a dialogue that diminished Chaplin's talent was not wrong, I liked the movie as a whole, but I thought it was a minor consequence. I would have given it one solid 7/10 on the scale. .if not to the end The final figure given by the Jewish barber is enormously powerful. Yes, it is addressed to tempora et fun 1940, but his message is perfectly applicable to the world today. The speech led me to tears, and I consider it one of the best conclusions I have ever seen. Final score: 8/10.
