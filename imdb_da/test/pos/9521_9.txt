Beginning with a "My Name is Joe" as a scene in Alcoholics Anonymous TBM careers in a crazy spiral of adultery, dual standards and secret relationships. But what do you expect from a family of lawyers? A really fun movie with some of the most outrageous characters since The Birdcage, plot and subplot is intertwined with surreal scenes of decadent Parisian life (ever turned into a wedding reception in gents toilet where bridal grandmother and her spoiled boyfriend smoke dope and cracker blue jokes? No, I either!), Leading to a final scene of almost arcadic symbolism. <br /> <br /> Excellent.
