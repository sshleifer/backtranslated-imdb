It is said that this movie is or was banned in the United States since its release. Since there is no information about IMDb, I have to rely on my other sources and believe it. If this really is true, the movie is even more hurtful and scary, and it is. The film is a so-called mockumentary, although I think the topic is too serious, so it calls it. It creates a scenario where America is like a military state, and all revolutionary objects are immediately arrested without evidence. After a mandatory court, they must decide whether they are in prison for some years or choose the penalty. Thus, they have to go through the desert for three days to reach a US flag sent 50 miles ahead while being followed by police and armies. <br /> <br /> The film itself seems to be a documentary about these events and follows both the tribunals and the hunt through the desert, filmed by European film staff. All the facts are explained, the interviewers ask questions and film everything. People are staring straight into the camera and shouting at it. It seems very, very real. Talking about realism here is nonsense. This film is not about how to make a realistic movie, it is about how such a movie would look if it was genuine. And it would certainly look like this. If it would be filmed anyway. In a "utopian" state like this, there would probably not be a European film staff allowed to film these things. <br /> <br /> There are many things that scare us. The defendants are people from all social classes. Political leaders, musicians, writers, philosophers, unemployed, etc. They seem to be hopeless, rebellious, or scared. They're not heroes. They speak a lot in the tribunal, knowing that it does not lead to anything, yet say everything they said in speeches and books and songs before. One says he is not afraid to die. Is it true? Well, he doesn't have to run through the desert chased by the police. The defendants have no chance, or at least their only chance, the decision between the prison and the penal court, is really no chance. The way they ultimately determine and the way movies end up makes it clear that this kind of heroism is suicide. These tribunals remind us of many tribunals in the third kingdom. The officials use the same kind of idealistic speech, ignoring all the arguments of the defendants, screaming at them, and then telling them they should be quiet. They warn the defendants to "see their language" and offend them much more. They ask them questions that the defendants cannot answer, but they never intend to. These scenes are a statement of what we call justice. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the desert are on a different level. When we see the prisoners for the first time, we realize that they realize they don't have a chance. When you see the desert and the mountains, feel the sun and thirst, they have no idea how to stand on those free days. The movie staff follow them and talk to them as they try to escape this madness. They argue if they have to play the game or escape or rebel? It all leads to the same, and no one is surprised. Some will ask whether such parks would actually exist in such a state? Why not? It empties the prisons and allows the government to punish the revolutionaries they want. It is not a gas chamber, but the Nazis killed Jews before concentration camps were built. The comparison is fair, as they are no real difference. <br /> <br /> The movie is scary and depressing. The issues are that they are well known for ignoring. These are not science fiction. Talking about poverty, unemployment and crime is not utopian. The film shows us that the government and democracy as it is presented to us is not only useless but dangerous. It also shows us that the revolution is not the absolute solution. The defendants seem to be confused because they do not really know how to fight this. They do things, but for nothing. Even this does not provide a solution for us, it is still a statement. For me, it is most frightening that the ban on this movie is prohibited. Here we have a film accusing the loss of freedom, morality and peace. It accuses the government, a fictitious government, of being dangerous and inhuman. And such a movie is forbidden. Think about it when you see the American flag next time.
