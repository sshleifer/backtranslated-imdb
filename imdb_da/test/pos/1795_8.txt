His isolation and despair are apparently caused by a stereotypical frigid bourgeois mother, a nagging wife and a lover's rejection. And in spite of the complex depiction - Hans doesn't even make these claims - the above must also be an essential part of Fassbinder's thinking (his use of Freud and Marx). But the viewer cannot look beyond his sex and sexism to find the more threatened cause of his broken spirit. First, it is very unlikely that his mother's lack of love pushed him to join the foreign Legion. It was far more likely, and it is partly indicated that it was a quest for adventure, male companionship (escape from mother and sister's female world) and male identity itself - both offered by the legion and the war. <Br /> <br /> Second, Hans loses his successful job as a policeman because of his own sexism. Falling to a prostitute resting in the workplace, he not only clogs rubber projects as an oppressive institution, but shows that he cannot even control his sexuality in a professional arena - and is even willing to endanger a desirable career. <br /> <Third, he commits serious verbal abuse against his wife in front of his sheep-like male friends, not at all distinguishing between her absence or, when she appears to him, presence. In fact, he is more brutal in her presence. <br /> <br /> A few hours later, in a violent and drunk state, he strikes his wife in front of their daughter, who goes in for her mother's behalf. The terror he brings in her and his daughter is tangible. But both he - and the audience - continue with nary a conscience or protest. Why? Because his wife is criminally characterized as both nagging and sexually promiscuous (yes this may be Fassbinder's perception of what capitalism does for women owned, uncertain and a commodity - but this hardly escapes His brutality or Fassbinder's exploitation of her in the battery case). And then there is this male rally, which Hans could choose to reject and protest, but instead accept. He is too short for a male and too non-heroic to achieve the worldly success the male role recommends. But how can these be the causes of despair when he not only wins his lost love as a mistress, but marries a tall woman who is considerably more attractive than herself. Finally, Hans Harry allows his companion to remain over his wife's convincing plea on the contrary in their house. By this decision, he not only makes it clear that he is more tied to Harry than to his wife, but that male ties replace his love for women. And ultimately, replacing his own life because it is Harry's superior competency and spirit around the house that makes His star fall. Hans, the merchant, may to some extent be the victim of capitalism, but more to that point, he is the victim of his own belief in his own male identity. His inability to let go is the ultimate cause of his isolation and despair. <br /> <br /> This is something that is lost, I think not only on Fassbinder, but also on his sister Anna - though, only to a degree lost. For Anna's (and Fassbinder's) support from her brother - over her mother, it only goes so far. She is quite insistent that he can only save himself - that her support and love cannot end their self-suffering. Unfortunately, she does not offer the same support and love for her wife, who must be much more embittered than Hans, but ultimately able to gather the pieces and save herself and daughter and present a marked contrast to His fall.
