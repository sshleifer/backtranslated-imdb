I saw "The Night of Judgment 2" first before I saw "The Night of Judgment". Unfortunately, my old Blockbuster thought it was a good idea to have the sequel, but not the first one. Looney, huh? Now I think all horror fans need this movie. It's like McDonald's you know it's bad for you, and you'd rather have the Cheesecake Facotory (or what's more pricy restaurant you prefer), but you can't help but just want the cheap stuff. <br /> <br /> Night of the demons has it all: your innocent, sexy, go by the rules chicka-dee, your token black guy, who is surprisingly not killed. You're a stupid girl, you're a stupid guy, you're a dark girl or a guy, the goof ball, the haunted settings of a haunted house, bad acting and lots of unnecessary nudity. Aren't these things good? I mean, I know deep down in my heart of film that this was pretty bad, but it was good for horror movies. Horror fans must enjoy and dig in! <br /> <br /> 8/10
