This movie contains some of the best ensemble work I've seen in movies or on stage. The actors play each other with a skill and liveliness that can by no means be achieved through editing. <br /> <br /> "Love Jones" a good story, period. But it is also an excellent depiction of urban, middle income, twenty something African-American set that is not often seen.
