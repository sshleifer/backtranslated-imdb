There are few movies that have the massive amount of non stop ninja action like Ninja III: Domination. This is a story of love, redemption, and revenge, but it is primarily a story of flipping out and killing people for no reason. If you've been looking for a movie where a ninja goes absolutely nuts and takes all kinds of people to their graves just because he's a ninja and he can do it, it's the movie for you. I can't think of any movie to compare this with because no movie is this awesome. Wait, oh have you ever seen things with two heads? There is a role in it where the titular thing drives around on a motorcycle, and about a million police cars drive it around them, but they continue to crash and what not because you can't catch things with two heads !!! Well, that's how Ninja III is. I highly recommend this movie, especially if you like the following things: Ninjas, Swords, Lucinda Dickie from Breakin 'and Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, video games about being a bouncer in a bar, ambiguous and underdeveloped love stories or "good" ninjas .
