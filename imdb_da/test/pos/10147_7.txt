Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of fine shenanigans around a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a strange plot and some random taxidermists. As always, Jimmy Stewart is a great hero to Hitchcock, the story rides along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the tremendous threat in Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget originals. Nevertheless, another wonderful movie from the great master's stable.
