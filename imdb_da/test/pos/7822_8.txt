This is a wonderful Valentine's Day gift. A beautiful guy and a beautiful girl fall in love while trying to beat the competition in a baking competition. Very romantic. I am a real fan of Costas Mandylor since his days at Picket Hegn and he has not lost his appeal. Lauren Holly is still lovely and sweet and the two still have great chemistry together. The support molding was also good. Seeing all the wonderful desserts that were made was a delicious sight in itself. I loved that Costas and Lauren went together to win in the baking competition and in love. This is the kind of movie that satisfies all palates, romantic and otherwise. Hallmark always shows excellence in their programming and that is no exception. The whole family can watch this movie. Also shows that sometimes love to overcome any adversity. I found myself and sighed and wanted more for this movie and also longed for the wonderful desserts. I highly recommend this movie for all ages. A good treat for everyone.
