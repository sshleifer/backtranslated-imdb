If the end hadn't been so amazingly unexpected, I don't think I could judge this movie as well. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of unpleasant, disturbing "marriage falling apart" character interaction. That kind of thing is not my kind of drama, so the pace seemed to pull for me. <br /> <br /> In addition, the protagonists are difficult to relate to and are therefore very concerned about - the man (Alan Rickman) is pretty bitter and cranky and the wife (Polly Walker) is devoted and somewhat haughty. The action was just fine (Norman Reedus was very prolonged), but the characters themselves were perhaps a little too realistic flawed (for me). The setting was nice and appropriately insulated and a little scary. The cinematography had something for it that seemed a little old-fashioned to me in some way. <br /> <br /> But the last 5-15 minutes of this movie is so brilliant that any unpleasant scene, awkward conversation and inexplicable character behavior definitely worth it. I guessed any typical plot twist except the one that happened. The end definitely makes this movie worth seeing. The plot and the drama, not quite so much.
