(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> I've heard something about the special effects. But it should degrade the film. The movie is a thrill movie. And it's very good at it. So from this standpoint this film spells. Franke cliffs. Enjoy one's plastic hearts content. So no complaints about this movie. Unless you see the English dub, which is a total farce. It creates the illusion, it's a B movie. <br /> <br /> A complaint I have is the music video on the DVD. It doesn't say who sings it. I would very much like to know. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 5/10
