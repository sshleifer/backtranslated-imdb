This is the ultimate and I mean ULTIMATE, ADVENTURE CLASSIC! The ground is good against evil. There has always been an abundance of films depicting grayer areas and not enough of the basically good against evil to account for the real cases of good-to-evil in the real world. Only recently, filmmakers have even tried the odds. In fact, over half of the situations are black and white, but only a fraction of the film makes it that way. This film is the best example of a back and white look. It is best seen in black and white. The hero is in the worst situation. He is within a man who will murder him and among various enemies. The movie gives the feeling that he is hopelessly superior and cannot count on help. His enemy (The Count) has many resources. The counter's wife was forced to marry him, and she knows from her previous story that he or she will later kill her as he does all his wives. She and the hero become allies and fall in love with those who could win over anyone who sees (unless the person just wants to be abrupt). Anyone who helps them is killed. They have no escape. The situation is hopeless. So will they survive in the end? You will not guess unless you have read spoilers. The movie also has a lot of good mood, adventure and intrigue, along with Lon Chaney as a bad guy, and Boris Karloff in his best role ever as a decent guy. Karloff was usually cast as a bad guy when he was presented with more complex roles like this. Chaney was rarely given a complex role, even though he strutted his stuff in a few movies like "Of Mice and Men." This is a little more than a cameo for him. Yet the tension never stops. There is excitement and danger throughout. Perfectly written, perfect cast, and perfectly directed. It's how a movie should be - pure escape, pure adventure.
