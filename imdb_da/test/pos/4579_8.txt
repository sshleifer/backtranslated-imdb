This movie is funny and sad enough, I think it's pretty true. If you love Office Space then you'll love this movie because it's another Mike Judge hit, but it's not like Office Space. I told everyone to watch this movie. I only wished it would have been in several theaters, so it would have received the recognition it deserved. I love this movie and would like to see more from Mike Judge. Luke Wilson is also what makes this movie what it is. I'm so glad I won't be alive in the year 2505 because if this movie turns out to be true, we're all in for a lot of trouble. I just hope more people see this movie because I know they fall in love with it too.
