Walking with dinosaurs is a great documentary, educational for both the ignorant of dinosaurs and dinosaur lovers (like myself) alike. I admit that I was very young when I saw this at Discovery, but I was immediately obsessed with it. (Spoliers !!!!!) The series contains 6 episodes from late Triassic, as the dinosaurs first developed into the scrotum, at the end of the regimen of the dinosaurs. When I first saw this movie, it was as if I had really gone back in time. The majesty of Diplodocus, Opthalmosaurus adventures and the caring mother version of T-Rex banned my family and me. It's a great movie, and I think the BBC managed to do just that. Awesome job!
