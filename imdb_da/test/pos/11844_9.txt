I caught this movie the other night on one of the movie channels, and I haven't been laughing hard for a long time. This movie was so fun I went out and bought the very first day. I love this type of comedy. It just seemed so right in the way the actors react to the different situations here. I was Rollin. I had never even heard of it and just started to look because of the title "See Other People". The title made me give it a shot and I'm glad I did. I laughed so hard that it hurt. Now it's part of my collection. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys smart-ass-type comedy. I will look at this one again and again.
