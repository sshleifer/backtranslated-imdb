Starring: Kelsey Grammar, Rob Schneider, Lauren Holly, Rip Torn This movie is a classic family favorite. At least for most members of my family it is. One of us rolls our eyes with mention of this movie and thinks: "What a stupid movie." However, I am not the person himself. I still find this movie very entertaining. I just saw it again last night with someone who had never seen it and I laughed as hard as the first time I saw it. It's still very fun for me. Marine captain Tom Dodge (Grammar) is a bit of a black sheep in the fleet. He is the kind of guy who wants to play golf while he is on a lot, breaking a ball on a golf course while sailing past it. He is the kind of guy who gets drunk, goes out and wakes up with a hangover and a tattoo on his dongle. He is not the kind of guy everyone wants to order a sub. <br /> <br /> But Dodge is at the end of the line. He puts in applications to get command of his own sub several times, and if he doesn't get a sub this time, he is looking for a desk job, which means it's for marine life. Admiralty decides to give him his own boat, but they do not give him a new nuclear division. They give him a diesel part, an old relic from World War II. His mission is to clear her up and take her out to the Atlantic for a war game. Dodge is, of course, a little frustrated at having such a shit given to him when he has worked so hard to get to the point that he knows, so he goes and talks to Admiral Winslow about it. Winslow explains the purpose of the war game. Diesel subs are still sold out there in the real world, to countries like Iran, Iraq and Libya to name a few. Winslow wants to know what would happen if some derivative captains in a diesel part came to the states and tried to smuggle a nuclear weapon into one of the bases. Would they do it? Dodge and most of the admiral don't believe it, but Winslow would like to know for sure why he has devised this war game. Dodge's mission is to take the stingray into the ocean, so try to evade the US nuclear fleet and explode the American naval bases. In simulated match, of course. <br /> <br /> So it is as deep as the plot gets. This is not a plot-driven movie. It's a silly movie that's just a big gag. It makes fun of itself, and one is not expected to take it seriously. If you're looking for good silly laughter on a Friday night, I'd encourage you to check it out. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: 3 out of 4 (worth seeing)
