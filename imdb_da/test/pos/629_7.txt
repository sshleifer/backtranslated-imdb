I enjoyed the play in this movie. Except the sister. She reminded me of Janice's friends. I could never quite believe she was anything but unpleasant. <br /> <br /> My main problem with the movie was the anti-climatic end and the execution scene with sister and brother-in-law. The guy falls out of the exploding car? Perhaps if his hand had been blown and he ran for mute and she kissed him and hurried him to a hospital, I might have gone to the end. I think someone should die in the execution scene. Mainly brother-in-law. He was nevertheless such a pain in the row. Or maybe the sister accidentally killed the guy who saved the mute. I could even have bought into the brother-in-law's kill, and in the end the two sisters were put into snus film. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing again, and as I always say, it's much easier to be a reviewer instead of an author.
