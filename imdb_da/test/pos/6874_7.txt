Almost a wonderful mix of comedy, romance and medical chaos has a 50-year swinging single doctor, tired of going to rock concerts with nubile airheads and dancing a patient of his own age he met on his rounds. Manuscripts by Julius Epstein show a lot of sophistication, although he does not have enough material to fill the last third of the picture, and you can almost feel the movie slipping. The sub-plot of the hospital being investigated for its scary business issues is not being satisfactorily prepared, and yet it feels strongly absorbed. Still, Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson are a great team, Richard Benjamin and Art Carney very supportive. Director Howard Zieff holds it all popping, and even when Epstein's one-liners feel like Neil Simon is rejecting, Zieff is zapping properly. The results are dry engaging and occasionally pretty sweet. Followed by an erroneous TV series. *** from ****
