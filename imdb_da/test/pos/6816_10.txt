For a movie from a first-time director, this is a simply amazing little movie, although I have to admit it is a bit difficult to see and will probably offend the sensitivity of many who see it as the film takes a clear stand in favor of assisted suicide . But what I loved about the movie is that I had no idea what the film was about until the movie was more than half finished, and then I was already connected. In addition to the excellent In the same way as the subject was introduced, I was amazed at the very professional style of the film - with some of the best movie images I've ever seen in a short film. Plus, this camera work was combined so well with music and pictures that made the movie just beautiful. As I said, this is a controversial movie. I struggle with what I think of this debate, but the film managed to express itself so easily and intelligently, I really have to respect the team that made this movie.
