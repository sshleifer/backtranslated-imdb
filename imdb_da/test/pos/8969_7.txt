Charlie Wilson's War, based on a true story, tells the story of a Texas congressman and a CIA agent working to secure funding for hidden support from Mujaheddin in the 1980s Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion of the country. This conflict played a major role in the last years of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> With regard to film making, Charlie Wilson's war is a particular winner. It's well-written, well-behaved and well-shot. While most of the attention has gone to Tom Hanks for another good performance, I was even more impressed with Philip Seymour Hoffman's tour as CIA operative Gust Avrakotos. Scenes of Soviet attacks on underarm villages and refugee camps are effectively dragging on. The film also gives a good back-scenarios look at the whirlwind and handling that Congressman Wilson has to go through to ensure the desired funding. <br /> <br /> However, there are two complaints I have about the movie. The first is that there is a subplot that involves a scandal study that is not well-developed and as such only serves as a minor distraction to history. The second complaint is that the film lacks some of the context of the war. The film makes the Mujaheddin look like innocent victims, and while they hit big civilian accidents, Mujaheddin was really rebels trying to overthrow the Afghan government. This government ignored exclusively in the film, not surprisingly struggling to suppress rebellion, later invoked the Soviet Union in support of their efforts. The film also ignores the fact that the United States helped help Mujaheddin ahead of Soviet deployment in Afghanistan. The film voiced the unintended consequences of our hidden actions - the consequences we still feel today - but it seems as though scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols were willing to sacrifice a historical connection to give a coherent narrative. (Didn't read the book, I don't know if George Crile made the same compromise.) Despite that, I enjoyed seeing Charlie Wilson's war and recommending it. I would have preferred a movie that more accurately portrayed the situation Stephen Gaghan did in Syria, but the audience had a better connection with the coherent narrative of Charlie Wilson's war than with the ambiguities that were present in Syria.
