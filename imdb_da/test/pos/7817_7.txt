There are a number of reviews that comment on the cast of this movie. Suffice it to say that Alex Cord plays a strong lead opposite Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy. As for me, many of you may not be aware of (at least) two existing versions of this movie. In the American version, Clay McCord gets amnesty from Governor Lem Carter and then rides out of town. I agree that the end is less than satisfactory. In the original Italian section, however, Clay McCord runs out of town (gun-free, as he has turned in the guns to the governor) and is bushwhacked by bounty hunters who have slowly depopulated the bandit city of Escondido. Bounty Killers are thrilled with the prospect of splitting the $ 10,000 reward, but are disappointed to find McCord's amnesty deal in his pocket. As they drive away, one hears to comment, "If this amnesty stops, I'll start chasing buffalo!" . This alone takes a minute to ask ... Another to die and place it on a level competition with films like Keoma and The Big Gundown. As the final credit says in Italian cut "FINE".
