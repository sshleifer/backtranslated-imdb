With the recent release of Carlos Saura's 'Fados' in the United States (albiet a limited art house only release), it is high time for a re-release of this fine documentary at Amalia Rodrigues. This movie is a treasure trove of vintage movie clips of Amalia in Portuguese and American TV, as well as various other movie clips, including one of her and her mother, that could easily reduce the most macho man to tears. I first saw this fine documentary some years back when it received the unjustified "art house" release (it deserved much better). Fortunately, there are various recordings of Amalia's best footage on various "budget line" footage (which are generally available in places like K-Mart or Best Buy), or if you do a small search, you can fine up some of the original releases either on E-Bay or one of these distribution services specializing in expensive European imported CDs. There are at least two versions of this documentary in circulation (the original Portuguese version without English subtitles and the US version in Portuguese with English subtitles except the European version cannot be played on most USDVD players because of the PAL color line system). Not rated by MPAA, but contains nothing to offend.
