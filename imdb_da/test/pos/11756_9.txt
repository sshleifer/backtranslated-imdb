These prophetic words were spoken by William Holden (as a war reporter) to the beauteous Jennifer Jones (as a European physician) and explained his failing marriage on the beach. They start an affair, despite great odds of infidelity and racial problems. In Hollywood in the 1950s, interracial romance was allowed, but only with serious consequences at the end. Beautiful Hong Kong scenery (although some scenes seem to be studio-bound), a famous title line, poetic script, nice background music (by Alfred Newman), great costumes, great performances, especially Jones (directed by Henry King who also did "The Bernadette song - 1943, an Oscar for Jones) still makes it a world-class Roman weeper.
