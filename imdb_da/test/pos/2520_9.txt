A straight-forward X file that shows that action is always equal to intelligence. Rob Bowman's direction is sharp and sharp, the episode looks just as fresh as it did almost ten years ago. David and Gillian both give good performances and both seem to restore the lack of luggage - it is a standalone X file that even non-fans could do and enjoy. Junior Brown gives both managers a run for their money under their scene with them. He is so convincing that one could think that the crew drove to the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door they came to. Bryan Cranston is intense and energetic as Patrick Crump, he has since admitted in interviews that he hardly knew about X files prior to this role, making his hit-the-floor performance ever more incredible. A brilliant silly episode.
