Although this movie starts with the usual: something goes wrong, spacecraft breaks, people are stranded, etc. It still pulls out and introduces the viewer to some new ideas. Riddick is something of a bad ass judge and has changed his eyes so that he is able to see in the dark, which is a much sought after ability due to the situation the ship crew and he enters. The clip in the film is very good and emphasizes the mystery that crumbles around anti-hero and male protagonist: "Riddick." The story of Pitch Black is, as mentioned, to some extent very unoriginal and dissatisfied, but the mowing and cutting of the film mixed with some surprising elements that have been added to the story helps to still support very well and one is left behind with a hybrid sense of satisfaction and hunger for more. Vin Diesel works really well in the role of Riddick, and although his character is a hardcore, hard survivor, he still takes moral decisions almost on the verge of good, but that does not mean that his decisions do not turn to his full advantage in the end Why destroy an already perfect reputation? All in all, it is a very good movie, but not perfect. The story seems very unoriginal on the surface, but beneath it shines with enough originality to entertain. Some scenes have the wow factor, while the overall is slightly better than average. It may be described as a cult movie, and it is definitely a recommendation for people who want a spicy sci-fi story mixed with some lesser psychological moments and an exciting protagonist, Riddick.
