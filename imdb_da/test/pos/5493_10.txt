In LINE OF FIRE, in my opinion, I am an excellent, exciting and huge-for-your-seat action / drama / thriller! I thought Agent Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and Agent Raines (Rene Russo) looked great in the attire they had on the presidential dinner. As for Leary (John Malkovich), he was a sick man who loved playing with Frank by phone. He looked good in the tuxedo he had near the end of the film. One thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between Agent Horrigan and Agent Raines. Before I unpack it, I'd like to say that the whole cast and the crew did an excellent job, I loved the setting, and I couldn't get enough of it. In conclusion, to all your Clint Eastwood fans who have not seen this excellent, exciting and huge-for-your-seat action / drama / thriller, I highly recommend it.
