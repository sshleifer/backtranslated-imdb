Victor Mature, as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountaineer and staircase, may be on the poster, but Robert Preston as a failed Union Colonel who led his men to be "cut into ties" by the Confederate artillery in Shiloh, sent to a Oregon fort for his incompetence, has the most interesting part, married to a young and difficult to recognize at first Anne Bancroft. The unconscious mature lust for the Colonel's wife, giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot that goes as far as referring to another man's wife at a time by James Whitmore, who plays Mother's older and wiser mountaineering father figure. Directed by Anthony Mann, this movie is lost among his more famous westerns with James Stewart, but even then you really do not need the Indian threat to make this a movie worth seeing even though Preston gets to prove his bad judgment as a commanding officer again in an erroneous expedition to finally bring the Indians under submission in a well-staged attack among the forests that quickly become a routine.
