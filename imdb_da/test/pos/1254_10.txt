Now it's probably one of the lightest heart stories that Bruce Willis has been in so far and yet - it's still touching. I really like Bruce's style and persona, I have not loved everything he has ever been to, but he brings it to "Big Time" for me in most of his movie string. <br /> <br /> The story begins ..... He is power, confidence and style with a capitol 'S'. He runs a Porshe, he lives well in a palatial estate with a great view of the fair city. It's Russell Duritz. He is an image consultant for those who are on top or ascending to it. His acknowledgment, he is Russell Duritz, he knows what it takes to do it. It seems that when life takes place quickly and fundamentally, there is a problem, an intruder in the home, the alarm has been activated! <br /> <br /> Russell doesn't seem to find out (at the moment) what's happening to him. It is different and yet it is somehow familiar. A little boy who looks just like ... - him. As their lives blend in beautifully, there seems to be a reason to scream at him: "You have unfinished business to look after now!" <br /> <br /> Amy's supportive young lady of history is probably the best balance he has seen and has in his life. She works with him, sets up her 'ego' and yet she is merged with Russell. Very very. With Rusty's past 'self' now in the picture and speaking a mile in a moment, singing late at night, all the fundamentals become jelly! <br /> <br /> Willis is fun, self-centered and sometimes out of his head in this lovable Disney modern classic 'The Kid' and to add his little powerful sideboard Spencer Breslin is a perfect complement to this sparkling childhood story for adult and back for childhood adventure. Chi McBride is an inspirational support character as he is the heavier champion, teaching "little" rusty how to box to defend against the waves in the playground. <br /> Overall, it is a real winner of a movie with even Lillie Tomlin as secretary and assistant to Russell. I originally saw this in 2000 'and then again years later with equal joy. This is a shining family comedy that has a super ending that will warm the heart of any Disney fan highly recommended (*****)
