There are moments when you do not want the deep drama series. When you don't want heavy-duty series or a must to see each episode in order to hang on. There are moments where you just want to see a simple series of lots of action and cool characters. In those moments, you have Cleopatra 2525. <br /> I was one of those who actually enjoyed Charlie's Angels. Critics said it was shallow and stupid. But that's what it's supposed to be! People who can't relax and expect a serious movie hated it. It is exactly the same with Cleopatra 2525. It is superficial. It has stupid and unrealistic signs. And that's why I like it. It's not like any other series. <br /> <br /> The first season was not very good. The Cleo character was annoying and a little too much. The story was a little lame, and you didn't learn the characters much. But hey, they only had 20 minutes in each episode. <br /> <br /> In the last 5-6 episodes of Cleopatra 2525, the series finally gave full 40 minutes of length. And that was where I started to love it. The series finally began to grow into a very qualitative series. Too bad they had to cancel the series. Because the last episodes of Cleopatra 2525 were actually very good. I will never forget Hel, Sarge and Cleo. Unique characters that only the creators of Xena could have created!
