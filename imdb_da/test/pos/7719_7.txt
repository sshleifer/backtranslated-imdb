My comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator (extra on the movie) and his dissatisfied assessment of the movie. I think his perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director. The movie was cute, it worked adequately, the experience of seeing it a good diversion from a busy working week. It was not the "Timer" (Acting) or "The Matrix" (Special Effects), or even "The Color Purple". Most movies won't be. But it was not a screaming party that "vinny ..." would make you believe. Sorry guy, just my 2 cents. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie was very gay confirmed (+ # 1). It showed a world full of different and less than perfect people - you know like ours (+ # 2)! It opened a door on a culture without excluding other cultures (+ # 3). And I liked the music (+ # 4).
