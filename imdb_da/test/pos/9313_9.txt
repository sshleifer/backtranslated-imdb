How are carrying pads, the elephant's trunk or monkey's brain for dinner? Let Tsui Hark tell you in this wonderful and light hearted comedy about the art of making the traditional (?) Chinese way. <br /> <br /> This movie shares the common structure of an American sports film, but instead of focusing on baseball it centers around cooking, making it more interesting. I even think Leslie Cheung's character looks very much like Charlie Sheen in Major League ... This movie also contains a bit of Zhao Wen Zhao vs Xiong Xin Xin fighting (love to see more of it after The Blade) and quite a fun in-joke about a Leon Lai pop song ... <br /> Maybe not the ideal movie for the strict vegetarian.
