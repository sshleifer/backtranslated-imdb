OhMyGAWD !!! MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my most lively 70s childhood memories. Two hippie chickens with ponytails, Carole and Paula would swing on swings, tell jokes, they picked chuckle patches, dress with costumes, found in a huge chest called The Storybox and argued with an annoying pink squirrel named Sherlock who lived in one of their trees. They could also string an average acoustic guitar and sing a beautiful tune. This was a great childhood show. Very 70's feeling. But that's the problem: They don't do much more. Pity that. You could tell these two girls really had hearts of gold and beloved children, they were really sweet. MAGIC GARDEN is one of those shows that if they came out with a box, people would buy it because it is such a MELLOW go down Memory Lane.
