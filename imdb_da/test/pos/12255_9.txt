If you haven't seen this late 80s movie about the Washington Bureau of Network News station, then I highly recommend it. It is a sad commentary on the direction of news reporting in this country, but tells the story. The characters are well developed, and Albert Brook's performance is fabulous. He delivers all his lines with entertaining underrated comedy. I'm not at all an Albert Brooks fan, so it was a welcome surprise. I have a friend who works as a producer for a local news station and he advises that this is close to reality so kudos to the film writer and director to do their research. Fun movie with a lot of insight into World of Network News. It's almost not as dark as another movie, I also recommend in the same genre 'Network'.
