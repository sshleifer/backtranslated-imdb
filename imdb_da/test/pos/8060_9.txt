This is a movie that every child should see before they grow and become distorted, often delivered ideas from generation to generation of family. I grew up in two different places, although only 20 miles apart. I went to school and had friends of all color and religion in the first 8 years of my life. Then I moved to hillbilly country (though not anymore) where it was very unusual to even have an African-American child in your class. My high school graduation class had 2 or 3 African Americans (god why can't I just say black? You can call me an honky or whitey or anything! All this political correctness needs me like most others!) Anyway Back to the film gives this an attempt to see what happens when people get distorted vision or just what ignorance or lack of understanding makes for a culture or country! This is an excellent movie, everyone should watch especially children.
