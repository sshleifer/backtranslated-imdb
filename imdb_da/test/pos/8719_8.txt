Another "oldie but goody" from around the same time as "Out of Towners" is "Cactus Flower" with a great cast: Goldie Hawn, in her first movie appearance (preflex promises), Ingrid Bergmann in one of her later, and always funny Walter Matthau. The story is about a dentist who pretends to be married to get an excuse not to marry his girlfriend, leading to the need to come up with a fictitious wife for evidence. He notices his spinster receptionist (Bergman) in taking the role, which leads to more comics and surprisingly romantic turns. It's in the same vein as Doris Day / Rock Hunter comedies. Fans of them - as I am - will like this movie; If not, don't bother.
