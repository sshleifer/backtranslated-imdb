OK, yes it is bad, yes it is completely fluff, yes it makes the dobbin mule look like an Oscar winner, but look at it as if I did I was 13, special effects were basically not existent in 90% of the movies, back in the good ole days, when movies needed a story line .. OK so even the story is a bit risky .. but wow i got into this movie as a child in the 80s. cheesy stones, bad special effects, but flying an air fight and have queens a vision on the soundtrack. See even the worst things have a silver lining. All in all if you want a bad movie to show a 12 year old who hates computer effects (if there is such a movie) this is the ideal choice
