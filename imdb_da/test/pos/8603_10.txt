Black Rain is a great movie, but watch out for the DVDs that are currently being sold for as much as $ 300. I have the DVD and it's terrible. Very small non-anamorphic image to be blown up for dissolution. Acceptable sound. This is a primitive DVD that definitely has * to be re-rented. <br /> <br /> BTW, I also own laserdisc and VHS Black Rain. VHS is a big step up from the DVD! And the laser disc has by far and by far the best picture of them all ?? subtitles in the black, sharp, big picture, simple but very good soundtrack. Buy VHS and avoid the prestigious prices these scam artists demand!
