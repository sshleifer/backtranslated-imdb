I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie that made me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy at the same time. I guess that for fewer people will be aware of this movie. But I hope at least a couple will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends associated with their physical disability, which (as a team) strikes the medical well-danger system and fights for their rights. This film shows a page that some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated, but emotionally presented. Hopefully, this movie will help us understand some of their desires better and realize how important it is to have a friend in the world, especially when you almost can't express it.
