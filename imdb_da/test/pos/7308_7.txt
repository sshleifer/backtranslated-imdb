Norma had used most of the 20s to play beautiful ingenues, but her first talkie threw her as a brassy showgirl in "Mary Dugan's Trial" and she came through with flying colors. From then on, her sweet and delightful genres were thrown aside, and she sizzled into parts that threw her as sophisticated women in the world or community girls out for excitement. "Let's be gay" was made before but released after "The Divorc√©e" and was an unusual twist on the upper chimney drums that Shearer made his own. <br /> <br /> Norma appears first without makeup as frumpish Kitty Brown, the main purpose of life, is to pander to his very unappreciative husband Bob (Rod La Rocque). She hurries to get him to his golf game - but in reality he has to see his mistress. When Helen, the mistress, comes to the house for a showdown, Kitty faces the situation with courtesy, but behind closed doors she is a lot of emotions, and Bob goes for good. <br /> <br /> Three years later, Mrs Courtland Brown (Kitty) is going to be the guest of the eccentric Mrs Bouccicoult ("Bouccy") (Marie Dressler). Kitty is now a knockout and "Bouccy" has a job for her. She wants Kitty to romance a house guest who, in turn, is romantic her grand-daughter Diane (beautiful Sally Eilers). Shock!! Horror!! - The man is none other than Bob, her ex husband !!! Kitty holds the meeting with sophisticated and witty repartee - "there seems to be something strange about that man" !!! - and no one is wiser. <br /> <br /> The movie then sits down in one of the early very "talkie" boring "comics" comedies. Kitty throws a spell over all the men, and Bob is desperate to start again. The women have all the strong roles in this movie - men are just dolls. Raymond Hackett seems to be in the movie as an extra butler - "pass me a pillow", "get me a drink", "move this chair" instead of Diana's harassment fiance. Norma Shearer is of course the whole show, Marie Dressler adds "Bouccy" to her list of eccentric portraits and Sally Eilers is a real eye-catcher like the beautiful Diane.
