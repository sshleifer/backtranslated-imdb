Quiet historical drama based on the story of Anne Boleyn, newly arrived lady waiting for the queen who catches the lustful eye of Henry VIII, the bad king of England who loves to celebrate, drink, hunt, be entertained by his court jester, see you and hunt for young beauties jumping out of cakes and various attractive women around the castle. Well, he immediately canceled his marriage, married Anne and told her it is her sacred duty to produce a male heir. She fails on that score, and he soon sees another lady in waiting. Meanwhile, Anne uses virtually the entire movie that looks hesitant, perturbed or even ready to jump into tears. She just doesn't come across as a happy camper (or is it just bad acting?!). <br /> <br /> This movie is a solid piece of entertainment with an absorbing story that kept my interest for two hours - plus I enjoyed watching the very sumptuous medieval costuming highlighted here on a beautiful sepia toned print. Emil Jannings is quite striking and memorable in his well-written portrayal of King Henry the eighth - he really seemed like he was Henry the eighth. I'm not so sure of the performance of the actor playing Anne, seemed a little over the top. The DVD of this movie has an appropriate, nicely finished piano score that fits this story perfectly. A good movie.
