The last dinosaur was one of those "out of nowhere" movie-of-the-week movies in the 1970s that was pretty exciting for the time being especially for fans of Japanese Tokusatsu movies. Originally slated for a theatrical release (around when Dino King Kong was out in the previous December) it was suddenly pulled and made for a Friday Night ABC Movie of the Week. Rankin Bass - who was no stranger to Japanese co-productions, was the weapons behind this production, co-produced with Tsuburaya Productions of Japan - the people who brought us Ultraman in various forms. Starring mostly an American cast, including late Richard Boone, Joan Van Ark and late Steven Keats, told the story of a prehistoric pocket's time in what was an overheated volcanic caldera somewhere at the frozen sheet circle that contained dinosaurs. It plays a lot like the films The Land Unknown (1956) and The Land That Time Forgot (1975) in feeling and pace. Sure the dinosaurs were guys in suits (A Triceratops with front knees!), But they were filmed in such a way that the music and the score were so well done, and the cast did a good job, this did not matter for many of us brought up on godzilla. The film has a lot of class for it, from the opening performance of Nancy Wilson "The Last Dinosaur" to the overall "big" feeling of the movie - the hot spring sites in northern Japan were excellent and lush - and the undeniable feeling of Kaiju Eiga to it . There are some amazing sets of pieces-T-Rex's "bone yard" and a tracking shot that takes us deep into the jungle to see T-Rex eating a huge fish from a stream. Tsuburaya's FX people did their jobs in style here and apart from a few dodgy shots, they do their job well. This film is considered the best 1970's "kaiju" movie from Japan, even over the five Godzilla films made during that decade. Rankin Bass made several other co-productions with Tsuburaya, which provided creatures or miniatures - The Bermuda Depths (1978) and The Ivory Ape (1980) - but did not measure up to the epic appearance of this film.
