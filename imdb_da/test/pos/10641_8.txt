This is one of the best movies I've seen from the quiet era (sad to say, I haven't seen too many except Chaplin / Keaton stuff). Very visually brilliant, with insane influential style in editing and composition. Really unique (especially in his time) camera angles and extremely hectic editing. Definitely a must see for the movie nerd. The downside is that it's also a little in your face about its policy (I have no problem with politics in movies, as long as they are subtle or at least something scary as a back seat to history). It's also not an "entertainment" movie, which is fine, but it's not something I have to see a billion times. This is art, pure and simple, like it or not. <br /> <br /> Worth being an A + for influence alone, but based on personal enjoyment, I give it an A-.
