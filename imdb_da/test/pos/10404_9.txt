Being a big fan of horror, especially Asian horror, I've seen lots of movies, but this one is excellent. Why? It has a plot (which is unfortunately quite rare among horror movies). The actors did a good job. It feels like a real documentary (though not). It won't be boring for a moment. The director combines the plot with actions from a particular Japanese magic cult (perhaps this cult never existed, but still it is credible). It reminded me of the same great movie "Forbidden Siren". For me, the only and only annoying thing about the film was the Hori, the psychic, but this is subjective. <br /> I recommend this movie to all fans of quality cloud. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
