The 1980s 'My Dinner with Others' with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory are essentially a dialogue about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit. 2005's "You Are Alone" demonstrates how ordinary worldly events can destroy the soul. <br /> <br /> The story is about three main characters. There is Daphne, a beautiful teenage student who cares about virtually any decision in her life. Then there is a prostitute, or paid escort, Britney, as confident as Daphne is self-conscious. What makes them interesting is that they share the same body, if not the same people. Part of this movie's magic occurs in one of the early stages where Daphne approaches a door to an aged hotel room. She stops and is, of course, torn off the decision whether or not to turn on the door? but it is Britney who effortlessly slides into the room when the door is opened. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the door is Buddy, a middle-aged few with few, if any, personal qualities someone would find attractive. He goes as far as confronting Britney's chosen profession as soon as she enters the room. But we soon learn that Buddy is Daphne's neighbor neighbor and has seen over the years as she grew from little girl to femininity. This complicates things for the public. Is Buddy just a worried neighbor or does he want something else? <br /> <br /> If sex is what Buddy wants, it's here. Britney loves sex. Her definitions may be Clintonesque, but it does not teach her enthusiasm. She prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic bracelets, which her clients are invited to choose from. Each ribbon indicates a particular action she wants to perform? But exactly what action is not revealed until the band is broken by her wrist and the election is irrevocably done. <br /> <br /> Britney is or believes she is in control of all meetings. Even when she is blindfolded and bound as she is by one of her regular clients, she imagines that her arms and body are being hit by more men, but her legs and body area become loved by a woman in blood-red underwear. The movie's pictures just keep coming. Buddy's pathetic life is an acceptance. He has lost his wife, his dog, even his fantasies of the beautiful teenager next door. It is no coincidence that he has lured Daphne or Britney to this particular hotel room. There is a painting on the wall of a plate with only one fish head on the left. This is a perfect metaphor for Buddy's life; all the good parts are finished. So this is where he brought his wife when they were still college students that he is doing his stand ?? to regain some control over his own life to make his statement. The director of 'You Are Alone', Gorman Bechard, knows his craft. The main action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film, supported by a myriad of intercut scenes that add dimensions to the characters, their circumstances and conflicts. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, Britney asks Buddy if she has to undress. He says yes, but she only strips to her underwear. An actual prostitute would probably remove all of his clothes (one of the profession's five sheep). But it's not Buddy being teased, we are. As the film concludes, we find that there are far deeper human emotions and motivations in play. A battle does not work unless it actually delivers. Britney does, it also does 'you are alone'.
