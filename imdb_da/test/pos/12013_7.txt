A real surprise. Not exactly family entertainment from "Disney". Certain violence, lots of tense moments and a great story based on facts. The theme "Night Crossing" is determination wins. Never lose their goals, two East German families risk it all, in their bold balloon escape to freedom. The story is both harrowing and heartwarming. Time is not on their side. The East German police are closing in and the result is far from safe until the end. If you're looking for a good evening entertainment that doesn't include nudity and limited violence, I highly recommend "Night Crossing". It's pure entertainment. - NOTE
