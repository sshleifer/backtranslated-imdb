I danced like an idiot in the last ten minutes of this unusual piece of television. I have to say that the idea of ​​sitting down to see 90 minutes of what should be pretty depressing material on a Sunday was not a welcome one. The idea of ​​yet another, over worthy, BAFTA winning opportunity did not tell me ...... But the end result hit me 6. This is some of the best TVs I've seen in ages. For years, I was under the impression that all originality had left the BBC's drama department. Our friends in the Nordic countries were the last production that really blew me away, and it was 10 years ago. But faith is restored, and honor is satisfied. David the bearings were incredible! So many actors I can think of would really have gone to the city in such a way, but never once did I see Mr Bearer as an actor or as a doctor. All I saw was Alan Hamilton. I have not had my heart turned so much since Daniel Craig's performance as Geordie Peacock all these years ago. Sarah Parish was also incredible, and I really hope this role brings her better roles in the future. All cast was great, but special mention should go to the director who really placed us inside Alan's head. The toaster scene has made me feel quite boring.
