I really loved watching this movie. I think it's a brilliant, underrated Alfred Hitchcock movie. Everyone is familiar with the famous statue of liberty scene, but there is a really good movie before it. Robert Cummings is great in what I consider his greatest role and beautiful Priscilla Lane shows that she also has a lot of talent. But I think Norman Lloyd's the best performance. His character, Fry, is so vicious and rude. Although he is not in it for a long time, the film would not be the same without him. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is a great movie that every Hitchcock fan should see. I give it a 10 out of 10 !!
