This is another of Hitchcock's highest rated movies and rightly so. This is a tale of two men who meet on a train and legend exchanges murder fantasies. One of them (Robert Walker) takes it seriously and this leads Guy Haines (Farley Granger) to trouble with the law. Another fast-moving Hitchcock movie with lots of amazing scenes (the carousel scene and the tennis match are worth mentioning). Not a movie to be missed - it's a shame that no one will be re-released on DVD with lots of extras. Just a cheap Warner Brothers DVD is all that out there now.
