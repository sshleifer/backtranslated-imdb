If Western Union is not exactly the real story of the construction of the Transcontinental Telegraph, it certainly caught the spirit and dedication of the people involved in the project. <br /> <br /> Dean Jagger is the responsible man and a fine day he is thrown off a horse and maintains some broken ribs. A crime on the verge, Randolph Scott, finds Jagger and is ready to steal his horse, but changes his mind and brings Jagger to help. Later he is hired by Western Union and works for Jagger. Jagger also hires a young eastern player, played by Robert Young, an engineer. Young makes one of his few loan films away from MGM to 20th Century Fox. Both Young and Scott become friends, but rivals Jagger's sister Virginia Gilmore. <br /> <br /> Western Union has plenty of action, enough to satisfy all Western fans. The Telegraph crew must deal with criminals, Indians and your many different work problems. <br /> <br /> Slim Summerville like the creepy chef and Victor Killian as a border character assigned to protect him has some of the funniest scenes. They both give a good comic relief. <br /> <br /> Fritz Lang got good performances from his throw and kept the movie moving fast. Western Union is solid Western entertainment.
