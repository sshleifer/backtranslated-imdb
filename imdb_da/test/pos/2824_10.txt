OK first of all to all the hates: Get a life! I can't see why you even generate mail on these boards when you obviously don't know about cinema, robots or people. <br /> <br /> This movie has an important lesson for all of us to learn about gender, stereotypes, relationships, and DESTINY. Really, we are all robots, programmed to respond in certain ways to particular stimuli without thinking. How many times have we seen a sunset and made a little comment without thinking about it yourself? I say, thank you Aqua (brilliantly played by Bernadette Peters) to make me stop and think about the amazing power of Mother Nature. <br /> <br /> It is only when Val and Aqua begin to reject their programming that they begin to understand their true desire - to find love and to escape from the factory in search of a creative life. This film must be a mandatory display in prisons - just think of the dreams and hope it can inspire inmates. Maybe even they could overcome their "bad" programming and join the rest of us in a crime-free world. <br /> <br /> We can all learn a lot from these robots. I'm a better person to Heartbeeps.
