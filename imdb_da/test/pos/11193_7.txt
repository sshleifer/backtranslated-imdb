"Far" is a slice of Turkish life flip which follows the daily activities of two adult cousins; one a photographer and the other an unemployed subordinate. There is no doubt that author Nuri Bilge Ceylan is an ongoing work with a great talent. But this little foreign minimalist artistic drama is so full of empty filler and so devoid of history or anything engaging or provocative that it will probably appeal to only the most avid devotees in the cinema and the general public should look elsewhere. Personally, I grew quickly upset by the slow pace of the movie and quickly found myself moving through empty spaces - and there are many - between dialogue, plot development and degradation. "Remove" is a very nicely finished piece of esoterics. (B)
