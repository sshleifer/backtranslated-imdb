Okay, maybe it's not the most sophisticated movie you'll ever see. In fact, there is not a bit of "sophistication" in it. It's pueril, young, unofficial, idiotic. And fun. Basically, Richie and Eddie run the worst hotel in the UK. Cue some ridiculous antics with the guests while they beat each other up, trying to get the rent out of the only resident who is bold enough to stay, having all night drinking binge with the boys from the power plant next door ... And falling in love with the beautiful actress who will stay to avoid the press. Try it if you are a fan of Rich and Ade and their work. If you're not ... Don't get the movie. It's simple as that. <br /> <br /> * I'm not thick, it's a word from another of Rik's fab jaunts in the movie world ^ _ ^
