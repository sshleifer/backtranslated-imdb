I loved this show. Such a talent; And I'm so disappointed that it's canceled, just after just the beginning. I was looking forward to this show all week long. And so sad about the people who hoped to be the one. I would have loved to see who would have won. It has just begun and, in my opinion, should not have been canceled. I hope this young artist has been considered by talent scouts and has the opportunity to reach their goals. I voted and sat and waited to move on never knowing it was canceled. And I couldn't believe it was. I am surprised that it had low ratings; because it was in my opinion one of the best reality shows on television.
