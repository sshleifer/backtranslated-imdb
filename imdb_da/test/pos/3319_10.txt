If this isn't my favorite movie all the time, it's definitely in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect - the clothes, the set, the lines - yes, they are not so normal people are talking, but ... right down to small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office, girls are changing their shoes, choosing a wedgie, wandering the office in the river plant, puts lunch in the fridge ... Identical to what our office girls do today in 2005. I think all the little characters are wonderful. If someone like Joan Crawford is over the top, it's all part of the package. If you choose many things in the movie, it is very clear that this was the beginning of the sixties, when women did not "put it down", at least not if they did not. As far as signs are contradictory, for example, Suzy Parker's character seems to be too flings, but then too tied to Louis Jourdan's character, isn't that how many people are - contradictory? They interfere in real things with scenes such as Diane Baker's character who finds love in her life after losing her illegal baby in an accident - lying in the hospital with a large old bandage around her head. This is part of the package too, it's charm - glossy escapism. I like the mix of real stories that are relevant today (the stereotypical career woman who only has affairs with married men, therefore has no family when she is older) with those who make you want, "ah if i could only fall in love with a doctor and he will love me even though he knows my sordid past and saw me all messed up after the scandalous accident !! "Also, i just got dvd, widescreen, it's even more beautiful than full screen ... Yay!
