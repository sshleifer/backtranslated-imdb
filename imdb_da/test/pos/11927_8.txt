This came as a great surprise to me. I had never heard of this movie when I first saw it, and the title really pointed to something other than a great terrorist / hostage situation in a high school. Toy Soldiers have the best of their time in the early 90s, where action movies were light and very comfortable. The plot is good, the plot is interesting and far above the top, the bad guy is a one-dimensional hateful douchebag (which is amazing), Louis Gossett Jr. is in it, it's simply a good movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. <br /> <br /> You can't go wrong with this if you like action. I give it a solid rating of 8/10.
