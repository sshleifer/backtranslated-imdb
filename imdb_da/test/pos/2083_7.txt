Between 30 and 51 years when he died of a brain tumor, Zachary Scott made 70 films. He was introduced in 1944 in Jean Negulesco's 'The Dimitrios Dimitrios', where he played Dimitrios. The next year, 1945, he made three films, one of which is. He is best remembered by cineastes as the star of Jean Renoir's 'The Southerner', one of the 1945 films where he had a sympathetic role. However, he often played scary characters, and in this movie he is a sociopathic killing of women for money. So what's going on here? He lives in a house with three women, so beware! Faye Emerson, who also appeared in 'Dimitrios', plays the older of two daughters in the house. She falls in love with Scott and they are secretly engaged. Then she turns her younger sister's sister (played effectively by Mona Freeman, who looks like Bonita Granville both in appearance and behavior) back from the boarding school and accidentally reveals in conversation with Scott that she has inherited a tidy amount so Scott turns to her sights on her instead, with all the dry jalousies sweet in the household, as it was bound to awaken. Things get tense and they get tones. Meanwhile, murder plans are in the mind of Scott's calculation. But it turns out that he is not the only one with such intentions. He is also sought because of his last killing, which the film opened for, so we know his back story. James Wong Howe provides effective noirish cinematography for this story, which was directed by Frenchman Robert Florey, who had moved to Hollywood some time earlier. The movie is an effective psychopath-in-the-house mystery that can cause some wear on the edges of some seats, for those with such a propensity.
