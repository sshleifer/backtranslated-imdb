Then you will be a big fan of this movie. It's almost the same basic concept, a nice mix of music, soul and drama. I would admit I was a little worried about watching this movie, I had only seen examples of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I'm a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so I thought I would give it a try. <br /> <br /> I'm really glad I did. It turned out to be more than just the superficial story of a nymphomaniac southern girl imprisoned by a 60-year-old black man. The story had a heart and was very influential. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie also added a good touch. Craig Brewer blended his style from Hustle & Flow into this movie, except taking a new spin and using Blues. His musical scenes are still at the top of the charts as far as performance scenes go by. He also has very interesting flashback scenes and gives you only a general crazy feeling during some of the more controversial scenes. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, if you liked Hustle & Flow, you will love this movie and if you are a fan of blues you should surely go see this. I give it a 9 out of 10, very interesting movie, and it's extremely under-rated. shame. <br /> <br /> Get out and rent this movie.
