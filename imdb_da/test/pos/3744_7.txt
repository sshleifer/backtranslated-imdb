Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leaving him, his son (an unredited James Franco) does not respect him and loses a patient he is working on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has been cheating on her. They must both get away. She looks over a beautiful oceanside into Rodanthe while he books a room. They are alone together. You can almost figure out the rest. <br /> <br /> This is what is known as a weepie or a woman's movie. It is beautifully shot with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes. There is tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an uplifting ending (kind). The great play by Gere and Lane helps explain that this movie is not very much. Every part of the plot is predictable. I rolled my eyes a lot on some of the events. This too is too short - I didn't believe in the romance between Gere and Lane for a second. If come out of nowhere and move very fast. The movie still works. The inn itself is absolutely beautiful and I was in tears at the end along with most of the audience. So it's a predictable, but amazing movie with some wonderful plays. It does not deserve all the criticism it gets. I give it a 7.
