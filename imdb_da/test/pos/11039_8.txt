This short was the first short published by Paramount Famous Studios and was one of several completed by the study showing Popeye involved directly against the enemy, most often Japanese. While Warner Brothers, Disney and, to a lesser extent, other studios, shorts often constituted Germans as foils, the majority of famous Studios bets focused in Japanese. Considering Pearl Harbor and Popeye's naval bands, this is quite understandable. This is an average card. Seein 'Red, White an' Blue and Spinach For Britain, age is better. But it's still worth seeing. Recommended.
