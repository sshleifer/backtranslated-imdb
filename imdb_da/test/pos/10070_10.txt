Don't listen to what critics have always said about this cute, charming little movie. Madonna is amazing in this clever comedy. I worked in a video store for several years and suggested this movie to many customers - no one ever brought it back and screamed at me to tell them to rent it. Everyone always enjoyed it. It's actually a great movie for kids too.
