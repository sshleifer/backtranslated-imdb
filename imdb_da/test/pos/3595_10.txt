This movie is a love story set against the backdrop of the war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just watched the movie yesterday and I want my own DVD so you can see it many times. The story ends when it started I was very glad he came back and I was proud of her to become a doctor and fulfill her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also a phenomenal actor. Some stories have happy endings. Apart from the love story angle, I thought about how a beautiful, calm and peaceful island had been hit by war, and it made me realize that the true destruction war can have on its people ... the government makes the decision while the people are suffering. Her father was a very educated man and wanted more for her daughter while she had regular dreams. I loved the scene where she complains about not getting a dowry and I also loved the scene where both lived through the earthquake. They were survivors.
