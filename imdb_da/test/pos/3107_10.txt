Ghost Walks is a beautiful little mystery with a great twist, spoken dialogue, and best of all a pansy is played to the twittery hilt of character actor Johnny Arthur who never demeans or denies his character. Mr. Arthur is great in his role as Homer Erskine, who brings great comedy relief as the secretary of Broadway producer Herman Wood, played by another great character actor Richard Carle. <br /> <br /> They play excellently apart. <br /> <br /> Although the early sissys and the creamspuff's acceptable words are used to describe Homer's character, it never means being spiritual or meaning like denigration and not spoken by the male men in the movie, but by his employer who burns And rehearsing him every other scene and showing an almost spoiled love for his devoted employee. <br /> <br /> There is a big scene where Homer tells his boss that he has dedicated the best years of his life to him and has been anything but a mother to him. <br /> <br /> The mystery angle of the movie is very entertaining, and the twist at the end can only leave you in stitches. <br /> For a low budget poverty range image, this movie has excellent set of decoration and great costuming. <br /> <br /> Direc Tor Frank Strayer handles his throws and deals much better than some of his other low budget mystery attempts, but he had a good script to work with and some great actors to accomplish it. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must see for devotees of poverty series, ancient dark house mysteries (they have actually managed to work in the lines "It was a dark and stormy night) and it has the added bonus of be an early representation of a homosexual character in movies where nothing bad happens to them in the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is available for download in the public movie model on the internet archive at archive.org.
