I just bought a Zhan (Running out of time) on DVD, and that was an excellent movie I have to say. Not really action-packed, in terms of pistol games, but absolutely exciting and witty. I don't think I've seen Andy Lau in better shape. And editing on this movie was done very well. Go see this now if you are a fan of Lau or HK Thiller / action movies!
