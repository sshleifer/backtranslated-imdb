I rented this movie because it was a documentary and highly rated. It's more a study of a bastard son trying to figure out who his biological father was than anything about architecture. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, the film's underlying theme is that we have an eccentric, high praise, possibly brilliant architect who had little regard for anything or anyone outside is a profession. <br /> <br /> The tragedy of the movie is the broken families he left. His baby mothers encountered more like scorned fans than irresponsible women who can only have negative results on the children. <br /> <br /> It is said that Nathaniel, the producer of the film and his son Louis Khan, came across as quite stable and curious, if not bitter. The people he interviewed were, of course, more interested in talking about Louis Khan's buildings than his personal problems, but I find the mix of themes made the film interesting. <br /> <br /> Regarding his buildings, I found them abstract art - weird, non-practical, and usually only appreciated by so-called critics.
