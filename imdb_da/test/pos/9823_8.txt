Like many others, I had been attracted to the combination of Pollack, Ford and Scott-Thomas. I had enjoyed Pollack and Ford's work on Sabrina, a well-filmed movie and a careful rewriting of the old material. After hearing that this film was in production, I ordered and read the book. Immediately it seemed to be a more difficult movie story. The characters are not always sympathetic, there is little if there is any humor, and the author makes many plot shortcuts to focus on his main theme: that each one would see the other as the only one who shares the unique combination of loss and fraud the air crash , the spouses' totally surprised spouses would seek each other. In addition, he imagines that the dissolution could come to both sides through a bitter exploration of the hidden lives of the counterfeiters, and that this "thick and thin" experience could give a deeper love than they previously had. Although much of the book is about their bitterness and their hatred of their former partners, eventually acceptance and forgiveness are found. The film script preserves only the spouse's air crash and the common problem. Where the woman is the research agent in the book, it is the man in the film, and the woman is never a willing co-researcher. The movie features a brand new dramatic subplot for Harrison Ford, which seems even more constructed than the double collision of the air collision. The "congresswoman up for re-election" plot for the woman is also new, but it works better. Target audience expectations for pure romance or romantic comedy cannot be met because this story focuses on a very bitter pill. However, where resolution and forgiveness are achieved in the book, one lifts the burden of bitterness from the reader and allows levitation, there is no corresponding moment in the film. Although forgiveness has never been suggested, we are back to assuming that healing after a shooting does double work. Ford's character does not have to be such an unmanageable man with few words, and Scott-Thomas's accent change is a little disturbing at first. This movie is not the dead loss suggested by others. However, it is a difficult movie to appreciate because the rewriting and adaptation to the screen is below the standard previously obtained by the director's cast.
