I've been waiting for this movie for so many years! The best part is that it lives up to my visions! This is a MUST SEE for any Tenacious D or True Jack Black fan. It's just so good to see JB, KG and Lee on the big screen! It's not a true story, but who cares. D is the biggest band on earth! I had the soundtrack to the movie last week and listened to it without stopping. Watching the movie was pure bliss for me and my hubby. We both met Jack and Kyle after 2 different Tenacious D concerts and saw them as well when they toured with Weezer. We left the concert after D finished playing. No one can top their show! Long live D !!! : D
