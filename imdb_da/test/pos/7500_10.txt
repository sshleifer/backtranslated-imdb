36. HOSPITAL (comedy, 1971) A number of emergencies have seized Manhattan Hospital. Patients die left and right due to crowded conditions and incomplete staff. When a resident doctor is trapped in the death census, the main clinician, Dr. Bock (George C. Scott), to investigate. After working as a doctor for many years, and through a crisis of his own life, Dr. Check it hard. He decides to commit suicide. But then he meets Barbara (Diana Rigg), a young hippie beauty. Powerful insight into life helps the depressed Bock. <br /> <br /> Criticism: Black Comedy has a "tour-de-force" performance from veteran actor George C. Scott. He is good at playing loud, serious characters whose rigorous morals are severely tested. The first half of the film unfolds as a melodrama that gives a pretty good account of the hospital's life, and they sometimes creep. But as it seems a dramatic climax, it differs in slapstick comedy. If Paddy Chayefsky's script had retained its dramatic feelings, I wondered if Scott would have gone out with another best actor Oscar (he had previously won it 'in absentia' the year before). His collapse (suicide) scene is one of the most gut-wrenchingly genuine in cinema history. <br /> <br /> NOTE: Dr. Bock: "... last night I was sitting in my hotel room and reviewing my life and considering suicide. I said 'no Bock does not. You are a doctor, a healer, you are a necessary person you are life is meaningful'. So ... I find out that one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses ... How do I maintain my sense of meaning in the face of this? "
