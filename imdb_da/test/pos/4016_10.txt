Really unique and amazing movie by Jules Verne's "For the Flag" by Czech master leader Karel Zeman. Although the story is issued in a rather undervalued late Victorian style, the imagery is a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create cherish atmosphere that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel diggers from Dore and Bennet and Riou, which illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety. There are underwater sequences where the fish swim about, so are exactly drawn that they can be used in a field guide. There are pictures of ships, submarines, flying crafts, castles and machines drawn with such precise details that one has to have a freezing frame on his VCR or DVD to stop the scene and study the remarkable detail that went into this production. The late Victorian atmosphere is designed to resemble this world, which was never and rejoices in the magic of science that made Verne the great father of the genre. If that is not enough, there is also a movie score that is probably one of the best ever created for a fantasy or sci-fi movie. Really a forgotten classic, one is worth chasing and buying. Always one of my favorite movies all the time, it's also sure to be one of yours. And remember - this was done decades before CGI or computer animation. Kudos to the great artists who of course put their heart into it. It shows. Jules Verne himself would be proud of this movie. A movie that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it, love it - and treasure it. An outstanding achievement, this remarkable movie just gets better every time you see it. A true film work by a visionary director.
