Out of all the parodies of Star Wars I've seen, this is probably the most fun. Not because of the premise, Star Wars with simple electronics instead of spaceships, but because of how bad it is. This is intentionally exaggerated, and it makes fun, and since everyone knows it intentionally overloaded, no one complains. The special effects were intentionally as horrible as possible, and brought a toaster on a visible string that shoots toast and an egg beam on a string. This short is fun for any Star Wars fan (which I am not) or anyone who has 15 minutes to kill. Big card !! <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out of ****. 13 minutes. Not rated.
