As a Czech, I am very pleased when I read these comments here. I'm sure this movie is great. And what you may not know is that the story was specifically written to Mr Brodsk√Ω. The man you can see is him and his typical attitude - living and resisting death. He was one of the great actors, and we are very fortunate that we have made so many beautiful films in his life. You're lucky you could see at least one of them. Enjoy.
