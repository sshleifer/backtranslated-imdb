I just watched this movie tonight (November 5, 2005) for the first time. I wanted to see it because I saw the basketball diaries (Leonardo Di Caprio) and loved it, but it was much heavier. I think it had a good production of substances to a degree. I mostly empathize with Nick Stahl's character, probably because if I was crazy about it, I'd like to help them get rid of it. A promising student and athlete who constantly uses to train and study. It is understandable that he wants to try teenage life (the crazy side of it) and, in his effort as what begins to help his friend, he becomes dependent on because he wanted to see what it was all about because of his terrible family situation, resulting in his most tragic death. A really sad movie, but an error I've noticed is that you don't get a good enough insight into the damage it does for families, but apart from that, great performances on a truly heartbreaking movie.
