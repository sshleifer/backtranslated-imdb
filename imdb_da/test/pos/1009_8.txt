I hate football !! I hate football fans! I hate cars! But this movie was the funniest thing I've seen for some time. <br /> <br /> I had the great opportunity to watch this movie over the weekend and all I have to say is I laugh until I cry, and when should it be available in the UK and Denmark. Girls, this is a football movie you'll have to see, it's fun! <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie started out as a crazy advertisement for a telephone company is just amazing that guys may not be well-known actors, but this is well down to earth humor, with real people and I for one applauds them to take this on the screen. GOOD YOU!
