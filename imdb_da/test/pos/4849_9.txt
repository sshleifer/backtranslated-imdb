MPAA Rating PG-13 <br /> My rating: 10 and up <br /> <br /> My * Rating 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> William H. Macy delivers a great performance as Mr. Neuman's role. He makes you feel sympathetic and afraid of him at the same time. The story begins as a comedy and slowly but steadily becomes almost like a horror movie with twists and turns that Macy is strenuous gentlemen. I couldn't take my eyes off this movie even after it ended and I couldn't believe it ended when it did. ONE MUST SEE. <br /> <br /> THIS POINT MUST BE LIMITED TO A SPOILER OF SOMET. After watching the movie, look at the plot this way: Neumans is the United States as a whole, and the charactor Meat Loaf Aday player is the people of the United States who are anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> This was a very enjoyable movie and would recommend to anyone I saw on the street.
