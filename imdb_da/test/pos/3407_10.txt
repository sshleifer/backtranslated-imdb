A story of love and hatred, tragedy and happiness, and most of all friendship put on the very interesting time of American civil war. Interested in history, makes you feel emotionally involved and makes you feverishly wait for the next episode. <br /> <br /> In addition, the casting was fantastic. Many superstars appear in short sources, the leading roles are played by a large selection of talented mimes - Kirstie Alley and Terri Garber should be mentioned here - this is simply an excellent example of a television production as it should be. <br /> Not to mention the beautiful love Wendy Kilbourne that reflects Constance :-)
