Somewhere on IMDb there is a discussion about the greatest instructor of all time (Spielberg, Copolla and others are named there). The biggest argument was about Spielberg and whether or not he is a good instructor. The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a master technician, most of his film lacks depth. Spar Ryan is really excellent from a technical point of view, but its message is boring, and while it's very entertaining, it doesn't make you think about anything. AN is the best movie I have ever seen because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things, from war in general, the clashes of the civilists, the state of the soldier in wartime (is soldier a hero or an assassin? Brando says that He is also not, the French lady says he is both ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they try to argue whether these points are true or false. But a fantastic movie and a great work of art generally have to rub arguments, not to solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right, or maybe he's not, no one has the truth anyway. You can watch this movie for its utmost beauty, amazing scenes, great plays and memorable quotes, and you'll be completely satisfied. But what really makes this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality. You can't help comparing with the recent Fahrenheit documentary. Both Copolla and Moore solve similar problems, but while Copolla presents something from the outside, it's an objective point of view, Moore takes a very partisan attitude that really compromises the whole point of a documentary ... It's really a shame that a movie like Fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious award like Cannes. But anyway, if you want to begin to understand a little of the Vietnam War, the Iraq War, the Second World War, and any war in general, you should definitely see this movie and not the other ...
