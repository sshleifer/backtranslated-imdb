This is a wonderful comedy card - one of Keatson's absolute best. Through a large number of stupid mistakes, Buster fails for a desired killer. And as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the police and especially a detective. While generally not a fan of movies with many hunting scenes, this is the absolute best in terms of pure athletic and acrobatic ability. I have seen some who have had wasteland stunts, but no one where the star was so limber and could move with great grace. In particular, there is a scene where he runs over a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through transom as easily as possible. Plus so many of the gags are fun and perfectly timed, for example, how he really believes he actually killed someone. By the way, this movie is very similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing. <br /> <br /> This movie is brilliant and the only Keaton card I can think of, I liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE - where Buster plays every role in the theater.
