Although it stretches away from the book a little, you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings. The scenario in Bath is just how they should be. Although you have seen it as many times as I have noticed that the background is the same in each scene, but aside, I like the scene where they are in the hot baths, but both men and women really get together such? You could see all the men hanging out of the classroom on the women. It also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but maybe it was the style at that time. The ballroom scenes were very nice, dancing and outfits looked beautiful. I especially liked Catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene. <br /> <br /> Northanger Abbey looked appropriately impressive, but I enjoyed both scenes better. <br /> <br /> Schlesinger gives a good but not unique performance like Catherine Morland. Googie Withers provides the best performance that Mrs Allen I feel. Ugh Peter Firth as Mr Tilney, he just speaks a rubbish and is not a priest he should be, it's hard to think He's in love with Catherine, but then the book has never really given that impression. <br /> <br /> General Tilney is played fairly well by Hardy, and Stuart also gives some kind of good performance like Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance like Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, well, he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character depicted in the book, but I like it. <br /> <br /> I can handle scenes cut from a book fit, but when new scenes and characters are added, it usually disturbs me. Marchioness! I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story, nor is it his cartwheeling side boy. <br /> <br /> some of the script is peculiar. When Catherine asks Elinor Tilney about her mother's death, she asks, "I suppose you saw the body? How did it look?" What a silly thing to say! Elinor's quiet answer is also stupid. <br /> <br /> tell me if you agree or disagree with me
