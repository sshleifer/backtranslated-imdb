I have never been so surprised by a movie that was the old one. Only "Sierra Madre Treasure" stops this well, performance-wise. As one who has seen heroin addiction firsthand, I was shocked at how realistic this movie was. Frank Sinatra's performance is completely uncompromising, realistic and heartbreaking. Otto Preming's direction is perfect for the movie, with long features and a very mobile camera. <br /> <br /> The performance of Kim Novak is good, as is Eleanor Parker. In fact, the entire support support works very well, with underestimated performances that fit this movie's style. The documentary is part of what keeps this movie updated. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8.0 out of 10
