A fantastic movie with amazing Aussie talent. Director Mark Lamprell dealt with the potentially sob-inducing topic in a way that was humorous and refreshing. Absolutely the highlight of the 2000 Brisbane International Film Festival. Australian film veteran, Sam Neill was as always fabulous in the role of Frank uni professor and new talent Matt Newton gave a performance that will make people say, "You know, Bert Newton, Matta's father!" Come and see this movie !!!
