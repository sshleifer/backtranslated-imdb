Saw this at the Newport Beach Film Festival the other day. The movie is really unusual. The amount I went with everyone loved it. Fun, exciting and big acting. I'm tired of the tried and true Hollywood romances that can relate? David Krumholtz (Max) is truly amazing as the safe and genuine lover of the ultra-screwed Grace (Natasha Lyonne, who is also excellent). When Max falls to Grace, we think so. Why? Because love at first sight is crazy, and we are dealing with two lost, and perhaps not so crazy, souls. Also noteworthy is Giullmo Diaz as Hector and Rosanna Arquette as a sexless / sexy neurotic, both "room men" by Max and Grace before going on their trip to Sheboygen, WI and finding themselves. Don't miss this, it's something special! P. S. The audio track, led by Kevin Hearn (Bare Naked Ladies Fame) is really super super cool too.
