I think Josh Duhamel is so wonderful !! The rest of the show is fun to watch, but I think it's the beautiful and sexy Josh Duhamel that makes the show "Las Vegas" really fun! In the days of "Magnum" I loved Tom Selleck, I thought he was the sexiest man on the earth's surface !! A hunk on a TV show is a must for women to enjoy watching something, especially just for the sake of innocent entertainment !! I would have done something to "win a date with Tad Hamilton" !! Josh Duhamel is amazing and I always want a super crush on him !! Josh is definitely a HUNK !! and i will see "Las Vegas" all the time, Josh Duhamel is a great reason why too !!
