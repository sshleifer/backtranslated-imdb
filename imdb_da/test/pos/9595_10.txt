As a reviewer has already commented, this is for television comedy up there among the best football parades ever. But .... having failed to know when it was first sent, I find that it is not in any format. OK, so it only polled 17 votes to date, but an average of 9+ seems to suggest something special. Basically, I suppose it is a case of good luck if you missed it because it is no longer possible to see !! Aaaaaaaargh.
