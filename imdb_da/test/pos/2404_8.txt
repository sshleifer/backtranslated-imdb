I like this movie because it has a good approach to Buddhism, for example, the way Buddhist uses to care for all kinds of living things, combines some fancy and real-life situations; In some parts, the photography is very good and many messages about freedom, such as the hawk period, are always focused in every moment, even in difficult situations. It also has fun situations like Swank's birthday and speaks this twice academic awards her plays show us how the people who use to live in this kind of culture are trying to have resistance behavior when Miyagi takes her to a Buddhist temple and how she slowly change. And of course, Pat Morita has always been great
