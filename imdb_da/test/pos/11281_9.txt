God cuts himself with a straight razor, after which he gives birth to a mother who then feeds through the seed of the earth, the earth. <br /> <br /> This is a one and a half hour movie showing a dark version of how God created the world. It is surreal, dark and poetic. The most important aspect of the movie for me is the pictures. Its shot in a very grainy black and white film that uses both slow motion and normal recording. Sometimes even quick movies and stop-motion. The scenes are long and drawn out, which puts a very strange mood. No sound was recorded during recording (in my opinion), sound effects were added afterwards, e.g. Criccets, water and other surrounding sounds repeated again and again. As you may understand, this movie is definitely not the impatient person ... I've often felt like it was like David Lynch's Eraserhead, but only this one is even harder to understand and even more drawn out, but it's okay for me, I likes that kind of thing. It's certainly not entertainment (at least not Hollywood kind), so if you go to check it, I recommend you set yourself up for it. Be open minded and except something like the end of 2001: a space odyssey.
