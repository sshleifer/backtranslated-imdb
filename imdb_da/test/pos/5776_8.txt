I saw this movie when it first came out. Patty did not want to be separated from her siblings. But the Juvenile Justice system doesn't care. When Patty looked at the case, the judge sent her to a youth prison facility. He claimed that she violated privacy rules by looking at private files. She just wanted her family together. I couldn't blame her. The parents were not even suitable parents. One of the smaller children had to have a toilet. The father stopped and let them go. He drove from him and left the children stranded at the gas station. Patty had to take authority to protect them when she was the oldest. They were placed in foster homes. The good part is that the social worker got them back as a family. Mainly responsible worker kept telling him to mess up and not interfere. He was power crazy. He was the one who had Patty placed in the youth facility. Why didn't they go after the father who was released from prison for leaving. But the kids are trapped in the middle and made to feel insecure.
