This begrudging and angry movie is against not only the war, when it was made, but all war. It doesn't matter which war it is. It may be the most emotionally involved experience I have ever had with Ingmar Bergman's work. There are no pages for the two main characters in this impact drama, which does not intimidate a point in any ceremonial symbolism as per Bergman's usual, but clearly shows people and their lives and exercises that Bergman has already proven to understand about a person's reaction for a movie. <br /> <br /> His top-team regulators Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow play an internalizing but bickering married couple who were once orchestral musicians. Now they live in a weathered farmhouse on an island. Part of the building frustration that we grow to share with these two people fertilizes in detail that nothing in their house seems to work. Nor are they reclusive intellectuals. They are a fairly well-known marriage which has more or less dismissed itself from life and is essentially apolitical; They only get rid of distant rumors of a war that has been going on forever. Ullmann is concerned about the dangers of their lives and for her desire to bear children. Her husband Von Sydow shrinks that the war will pass them by. Their tranquility is interrupted by screaming airplanes flying low over their house, killed by a parachute man, the arrival of dubious troops, their inquisition and ultimately their catch by what seems to be the local side, but loyalty has long since splinteret. <br /> <br /> They are returned to their homes, witness to free destruction and suffer from the tremendous consequences of such a cruel suspicious marriage. This, one of my most popular Bergman bets, is a study of a pair of jarred from their safe self-knowing life and offended by a manipulative despair, and testing both of them to reveal who they really are. She lacks compassion to some extent, to self-serve and restless to have any patience for her capricious breakdown in crying. His suppressed emotional problems have led to the suppression of the very initiative and the excitement that attracted them to begin with. The enormous last 20 minutes, occasionally interrupted by images of the overwhelmingly gray sky, are among the closest to the real feeling Bergman has ever filmed. <br /> <br /> All systems of dogma and faith are the antagonists of this very important and downbeat portrait. The basic clearcut personalities in Ullmann and Von Sydow's characters are thrown into the degenerate world of war because they are accused of being "sympathizers", but the film, shot at Bergman's small home island of Faro, gives no information on where or when it is set who the two sides are and for what they are fighting for. For an effortless civilian who is trapped between them, the knowledge base is probably very similar. Ullmann and Von Sydow are not sympathizers for the apparent enemy, but they are partisans for who appears to be their side. This 1968 reactive allegory could be about the common non-cooperating Iraqi or Kosovo or Vietnam or Israel or Palestine or ...
