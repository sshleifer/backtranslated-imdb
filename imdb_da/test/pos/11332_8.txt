The Chinese movie title "in the mood for love" is "get ye nien wah." It can be interpreted as "the thriving years (it was once)." <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a well-composed piece. A complex love story told in simple visual approach. Writer Kar-Wai, writer director, has choreographed a dance of hearts - she is, it is he, that is love. I can hear Galasso's theme: Stupid Dum-Dum, Dum Dum-Dum and Strings - almost like a heartbeat. A piece with prelude, punches and epilogue. The director optimized the use of music (Michael Galasso's score, Nat King Cole sings in Spanish and Chinese songs / tunes). The rhythm and lyrics give viewers what she and he feel / think instead of verbal dialogues. I can hear Nat King Cole give us the tracks: "Aquello ?? ojos verde" (the thing fling, eyes green) plays when the two meet, and "Quizas, quizas, quizas" (maybe ??) when she is uncertain . <br /> <br /> Nostalgia permeates the entire movie. Design details ample: handbags and ribbons; Japanese rice cooker novelty; It scratched pattern green glass cups and plates and plates (I remember Father loved them at home); mahjong session; kitchen area; bedroom furniture; the thermos for the extracted noodles, which she swings when she walks. Maggie Cheung, slim and charity, looks exquisite in the fashionable patterns and colors of the traditional Chinese woman's clothing - 'cheung sam'. Every change of its dress indicates another day, another time in history. Wong Kar-Wai is so resourceful. <br /> <br /> The scenes may be in the same place, but it's different mood, advanced to next stanza. Up and down the stairs to waterproof noodle stand. Standing by the wall around the corner to the apartments as the rain is pouring. Along the corridor back and forth to his writing corner. <br /> <br /> Trivia: Then she helps him write his martial art novel. Maggie could help as she has been in kung fu / martial arts movies. "Eastern Three Heroes" 1992 is a fun action movie featuring Maggie Cheung (Thief Catcher Chat), Michelle Yeoh and Anita Mui as three superheroes who fight evil. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate Tony Leung's performance, don't miss the "Chungking Express" 1994 (in second segment - Romantic Rhythm with Difference) and "Happy Together" 1997 (an intense, emotionally colorful painting of friendships, faith and fate), written and directed by Wong Kar-Wai. <br /> <br /> Understanding the Cantonese and Shanghai dialects, and after visiting the official site, I realized that the epilogue was not completely translated. Here's my version of the Chinese captions: <br /> <br /> It was a bit of an unbearable meeting. All the time she has kept her head lowered. Gives him a chance to get closer. He didn't have the courage to be closer. She turned around, walked away. <br /> <br /> The time and place had come to the past. Everything that belonged no longer exists. _______ <br /> They disappeared years, apparently separated by a glass that collects dust, can see but can't understand. <br /> <br /> Slowly, he has longed for everything that is over if he can break through the dust-collecting glass he will go back in the time that disappeared. ________ <br /> <br /> Wong Kar-Wai's "In the Mood for Love" is reminiscent of Rumi's simple poetry and wisdom, the sufi philosopher - "inner and outer", "spirit of life and body", love and living. <br /> <br /> [Resend.
