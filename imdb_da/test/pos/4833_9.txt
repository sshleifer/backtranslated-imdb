This film is bone cooling in a way that is difficult to describe. Although it is quite precise in its description of the events up to and subsequent investigation into the first attempt to destroy the World Trade Center in 1993, now after 9/11, it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> It would be a mistake to call this movie prophetically, but it certainly makes the common playground wisdom of "fooling me once upon you, fooling me two shame upon me", come alive. <br /> <br /> Our government learned nothing from the 1993 experiment at the World Trade Center and subsequent readings of the 9/11 report show that many of the failures that led to the 1993 bombing were repeated. <br /> <br /> Some people have criticized First and Fourth amendments to the US Constitution as partially responsible for the Islamic terrorists who are capable of performing their evil plans, but that is wrong in every way. <br /> <br /> Surely the people who make this argument do not support a free speech ban, a free press, or religious freedom? I certainly hope that they do not support our officials who are able to break into a person's home or office to seek without cause or without a warrant. The fact is the FBI, INS and even the local police could have got warrants based on the information they had in their possession, but they chose not to for a number of reasons. Moreover, no matter how unpleasant or ignorant it is, it is not illegal to speak badly about America or its leaders. Likewise, it is not illegal to either own guns or pray against mecca. <br /> <br /> Consider this until Lee Harvey Oswald actually fired his rifle on President John Kennedy, he didn't really split any laws. Living in a free society has its drawbacks. <br /> <br /> Still, Path To Paradise is a must see movie that I'm afraid of, never seen by the many people. As far as I know, it is not on DVD, and 2007 is its 10th anniversary, and there are no known revivals of it. <br /> <br /> I'm not really surprised, people don't like documenting their mistakes and this movie certainly shows that the various agencies that were supposed to protect us didn't do their jobs right and for the most beautiful reasons as jurisdictional disagreements and a refusal to share information. <br /> <br /> It's a pity as the road to paradise is well done and gripping and, as many have said before, the last scene where Ramzi Yousef (played by Art Malik), the bomber who built the truck bomb was used In the first attempt to destroy the two towers, flying past the World Trade Center after his admission and extradition simply says "Next time we will bring them both down", is a movie moment that froze me in place for several minutes.
