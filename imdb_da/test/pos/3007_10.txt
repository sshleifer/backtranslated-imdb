I just started to see The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a vacation. It's a good show, I just wish it wasn't that late in the evening. It is at. 12:30. As a working person, it makes it difficult to see all the time. <br /> <br /> I read some comments. I did not agree with the late saying that I did not grow up in the 60s and did not believe that these things could happen. <br /> <br /> I grew up in the 60s. I'm Hispanic and I had a "white" boyfriend plus we had black friends in high school. I think people come together because of their interests and personalities, and that has nothing to do with being a particular breed or color. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the show to go DVD so I can buy it. This way I can see it from the beginning.
