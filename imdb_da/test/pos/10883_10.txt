This game requires stealth, smart and a stable hand. The gameplay is simply the best; Apart from that, the interesting extras - bullet holes remain in the walls, enemies react to specific points where they are hit by bullets, there are lots of motion-captured animations that make the enemies seem very real (eg when looking through a window at a vaguely he will stand there and swim flies away, sneeze or scrape himself), the list goes on. This is the best license / movie conversion ever, and it puts you in the shoes of the supreme super vomit. This game is the best reason to own a N64.
