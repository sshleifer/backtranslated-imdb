In 1850 in Yorkshire, a boy chimney sweep is mistakenly accused of theft of his lopsided master and runs away. He falls into a treacherous local river and is transported to an underwater area where he makes many friends and saves the mythical water children from an evil shark. <br /> <br /> Based on a book by Charles Kingsley, this is a delightful children's movie, half live action and half animation, both a grim and evocative depiction of Victorian times and a wonderfully enjoyable underwater adventure. It's really two films in one that somehow complement each other and combine into a much richer whole. The animation by Tony Cuthbert, Jack Stokes and Miroslaw Kijowicz is wonderful, as does the photography of Ted Scaife and the music of Phil Coulter and Bill Martin. Pender has a great raw diamond quality as (literal) fish out of water - I love the moment he is at the top of the mansion, sees all the chimneys and shouts "Blimey !!" on top of his voice. Mason and Cribbins are the scariest, nastiest waves you could hope to see in a costume drama (if you want to see real Victorian values, don't see Sense and Sensibility, see this), and Whitelaw, Pertwee (who makes umpteen votes) and Percival are all good. Such a good children's film should be - good old singalong fun, but also just a little thoughtful, sad and scary. High Cockallorum !!
