I thought this was very "different" than in most modern interpretations of Shakespeare and thoroughly enjoyed it. It would not be useful for those who studied it in school, etc. Since it does not show the traditional Shakespeare character interpretations (ie, Miranda is depicted quite punky in relation to your traditional Shakespeare lady) but for understanding the game and on the basis of history it is a very strong piece and great to see. It also does not include the correct format as in the layout of actions and scenes as I currently play Miranda in a production, and most of her lines have been cut and some scenes are split and mixed, but it is very useful and I would definitely recommend it as a must-see though just to say you've seen it! Shakespeare fans would love this!
