Don't watch this movie that expects the Jane Austen joke, the sharp dialogue or the clever social comment. This time, the prizes in Northanger Abbey have been updated in a very sensual way! <br /> <br /> In this version, Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just stupid fantasies, but a connection to the world of sexuality in adulthood she just looks into with her daylight adventures. During the day she is very prim and demure, and her weak Henry treats her with extreme courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydream changes so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid! <br /> <br /> Early in history, Catherine's vision of gender is based entirely on the Gothic novels she consumes in bed. It is both heartwarming, sexy and provocative to observe the way in which her dreamy image of beautiful Henry "dissolves" in a lurid dream of being carried and ravished by romantic villains! At the same time, it is angry and touching to cut back on her bed in the morning - Catherine sleeps peacefully looking so innocent that you will never guess what is really going on in the beautiful little head! <br /> <br /> Later, after being invited to Henry's castle, Catherine hears a family argument and completely misunderstands her opinion. She jumps to bed, she covers herself with bedding and lies awake and listens terribly, her striking blue eyes are the only visible sign that she is alert. Little by little they kill pretty blue eyes and close as she runs into another heated dream of innocent desire. This time, Catherine dreams of being in Elizabethan times and waiting terribly outside the castle for the approach of "banditi!" It is quite clear that she is more excited than scared of the idea of ​​being carried by bandits. She is all moving with excitement and expectation! But then, after a shot of her runs frantically to escape, we are back to the daylight world, where the girl scolds her for having made a mess in her room before falling into a good sleep. It is worth noting that Catherine's strong eyes in the morning light itself is a pretty sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been! <br /> <br /> Ultimately, of course, Catherine's haughty and imaginative lover Henry tells the nature of his fantasies and gives her a strict lecture. Interestingly, Catherine's immediate collapse in tears does not symbolize a retreat, but an advancement in adult relationships. In the next scene, she cleverly burns her Gothic romance and throws herself shamefully and sucks on the bed. Significantly, this turning point is also characterized by Catherine falling into a deep sleep - except that this time there is no dream of making faith passion. Probably Catherine has matured enough to be ready for the right. <br /> <br /> Although Katherine Schlesinger has lovely blue eyes and a lively expression, and all her performance is charming, it must be said that beyond the heated dream sequences, this movie adaptation is tirelessly boring. I give it only 9 stars because the really romantic can enjoy it purely at daydream level. <br /> <br /> If you would like to read a book about a truly wild young heroine who overcomes the real darkness and danger in a real gothic setting, I highly recommend the perilous garden by Elizabeth Marie Pope.
