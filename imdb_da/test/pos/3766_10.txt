From the generation of "druggie" I thought this movie was fun. It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They do not go into drugs, but they probably know about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it, I can't remember, but a few things. I would have to say that the funniest part was when Dr. Jekyll knocked out the lab word and inhaled the straw while snoring, then spun the powdered fabric he had invented. The funniest thing I had ever seen in a movie.
