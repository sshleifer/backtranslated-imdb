Never been kissed with starring Drew Barymore as Reporter Josie Gellar is a sweet, extremely juicy and sometimes quite painful story of a modest woman named Josie Gellar, who although brilliant is quiet and shy and has never been kissed by a man. She has awarded her first major news story for the newspaper she is working on - to go undercover as a high school student who turns to the popular fun kids and gets a boost on what's really going on in the world of high school. Only problem is Josie has never been popular. In fact, High School was a traumatizing experience for her when she was the recipient of many teasing and cruel jokes. Josie tackles this task, as much as eventually "fit in" to get a scoop-what she finds is the most important prerequisite for history. <br /> <br /> Never been kissed is one of the films that is so juicy and Schmaltzy at times, especially in a few scenes at the end that the limits of credibility are severely tested and many a cynic cannot like this movie. However, it is very sweet done. Drew Barymore is perfect as the bumbling yet lovely Josie-she breathes a fresh breath into the character and makes her seem completely realistic. I also enjoyed Leelee Sobiesky as the intellectual student who turns to Josie on her first day at school. <br /> <br /> Never been kissed, have some really fun moments that Josie unravels in his hectic efforts to be cool. Example-Reggae bar scene. I also loved the look of Josie's brother Rob, who also goes back and registers as a high school student, the way he helps give Josie her "dream" of final adaptation in just fun. At the same time as Josie's horrible story of her original year in high school is shown in flashback, it is extremely painful. You don't have to have similar experiences in Josie's high school to be touched by her story. Drew is wonderful to make her character a personal connection with the audience and we love Josie from the start. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of "mean girls" a 2004 release, in this movie, but average girls were honestly very gritier. Never been kissed becomes a very romantic image, as Josie develops feelings for a particular man and the question becomes, they will come together. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. It was really beautifully done in some areas. The film is corny in some places yes, the last scene-realistic-no way-does this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious Hollywood way? Oh yes yes yes baby! But it manipulates beautifully, there are some lessons to be learned here. The film never preaches, but manages to paint a precise picture of which high school was for a selected few. I actually met people who have had similar experiences to Josie. I have met people very much like all these signs - I think many people simply do not know or cannot imagine the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school and how harmful it can be, but it is there. Not unrealistic at all. What struck me was Drew's talk on prom as she demonstrates "getting the mentality" that can exist as widely-as Hollywood and produced as many think it might be, it was well done and very true. <br /> <br /> I have never been kissed, sound much heavier so it is true, it is a perfect movie to choose when you want a sweet, good, good, heart-warming image. It is engaging, sweetly acted and just Rufus. I'd say check it out. 8 out of 10.
