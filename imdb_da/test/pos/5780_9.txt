I only give this movie 9 out of 10 because there are not enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy required to produce food to satisfy science haters. mdixon seems to believe that the pre-biased commentators do these things up, but even a basic understanding of resources and the thermodynamics law would indicate that they are at least in solid scientific reason when they say we can't Continue to rely on oil, we need to move to different types of energy and don't have a plan that will replace the amount of energy we get from oil. Other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life and have died. Read Jared Diamond's "Collapse" which is a popular book or any elementary ecology or earth science textbook and you can verify the basic premise of this movie. Go ahead, fidle while Rome is burning!
