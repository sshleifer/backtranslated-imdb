It looks like a ho-ho Porky's rip-off turns out to be quite a moving movie about being young and in love. The story relates to three friends, Gary, Ricky and David, who spend their after school hours looking for sex. When a new girl arrives in town, Gary falls over her heels in love with her. <br /> <br /> The movie goes from being a fun sex movie to a teenage uncertainty study. It's fun and sad the same. It never really goes into the love story formula that seems prominent in every movie. You know, guy meets girl, guy loses girl, guy gets girl back in final frame formula. This formula is thrown aside after guy meets girl. Maybe that's why I liked the movie so much. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is particularly good, and the end is a particular tear row. It can also be one of the most realistic conclusions I have ever seen in a love story. <br /> <br />
