With "Anatomy", the German film producers have tried to make something completely new. Normally there is only drama or comedy film - in the horror genre is (or was) brand new at that time. The story is also new and shocking. Franka Potente plays her role brilliantly, and I bet you will not find out who is the killer. It is possible, but difficult. A really good movie with many talented actors.
