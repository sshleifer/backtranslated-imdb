No doubt about it. This is the animated card that puts Uncle Walt on the map of success. When Walt's older brother suggested Roy that the next Mickey Mouse card should contain sound, Walt jumped at the chance. The result: Steamboat Willie was a round here for 1928. After all, it was the first animated card subject with a synchronized audio track (mostly music and sound effects, as the dialogue was minimal). Not to sound like a wet blanket, but the short one is far from perfect. The pre-1935 animation was creaky and pretty hackneyed (but when equipment was improved and better artistic techniques got going, the rest was smooth sailing) and the sound was primitive (Disney wanted to use the so well-known RCA Sound System, or western electric silent system, but was rejected by both companies and asked Disney to use the photo phony voice that PA Powers experimented with at that time. The plot (there is an actual plot line here?) Relates to Mickey (like the aforementioned Willie) pilot of a steamboat terrorized by Black Pete (Captain Pete to you) and decides to have a jam session on ship, using the various animals on board as musical instruments (ASPCA, take notice). If you don't think too much about the technical flaws, Steamboat Willie can be eight minutes of fun (and a piece of history).
