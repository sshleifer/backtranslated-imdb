I can never understand why people take time to review movies that they have not fully understood. I know people will read reviews on these pages of this movie and it will enable them to search for copies of this pretty forgotten, late 20s style, but 1932 movies that are likely to be termed "Incentives" , as there are names of the main titles. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy, best known as a comic actress in countless calm roles, proves to be overlooked in all of them. She was a true dramatic actress, something I didn't know until I saw this movie, which runs all its famous roles. She is exciting and moving here, two things she was never against the graceful and refined William Powell. I'm still a little shocked at how good she was. <br /> <br /> Becky Sharp (1935), the first three-striped Technicolor feature, is more well-known, but it is far better artistic and customizable. It is also very exciting as an expression of a film style that was about to die. You can't take my word for what you need to see it.
