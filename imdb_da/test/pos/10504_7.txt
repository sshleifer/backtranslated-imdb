<----- Minor Spoilers! -----> <br /> <br /> A woman becomes pregnant but not by her husband. She develops 'something' inside her, or at least that's what her husband thinks. They go through a lot of hard times while she is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The man contacts a UFO professor, and with her help, they try to find out what's wrong with her. <br /> <br /> <----- Less Spoiler! ----> <br /> The story could have been a little better or at least made less predictable, but the movie is eye-catching, and it got me and my sister hooked on the whole movie without any problem. The action is very good and the movie is much better than normal if you compare this to your normal b-alien film. The effects are good and something happens every second of the movie. The characters are really comfortable, and apart from a stupid nurse in the on scene, they are all very convincing in their roles. I thought it was a good movie and can recommend it if you like alien / monster abduction movies! <br /> <br /> 7/10 - History could have been a little less predictable.
