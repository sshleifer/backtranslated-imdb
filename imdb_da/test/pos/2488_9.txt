Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> This is a Peter Watkins movie. If one has seen his BBC masterpieces "Cullodden" and "The War Game", one will recognize the style (and his voice) within seconds of the start. Created in 1971, it is set in a very near future, as the Vietnam War has escalated even more and now appears to involve China. Nixon is still president and civil disobedience and protest is dealt with tremendously by drumhead tribunals (outward civilians with "everyday citizens" as judges). Because "prison building can't stop", an alternative is introduced: The Punishment Park. Kills can choose between severe prison sentences and a man hunting in a hostile environment, in this case an 85 km trip through the California desert at 100 Â° F. If they reach a US flag at the end without being caught by the National Guard or Riot Police, they will be liberated, or they will serve their sentence (or be dead as we will see). The film is made in a completely documentary style with three European teams covering a tribunal and in two groups already convicted. Scenes jump between the tribal tent, the hunting forces and the hunting condemned. Watkins' missing comment gives us raw background information (time, temperature, etc.). Tribunal scenes show a kangaroo court on the one hand and a wide variety of personalities on the other range from real terrorists over "unwanted" to clearly innocent (for example, a total pacifist who can't even hurt flies). The defense lawyer (who takes his work seriously) must take assault from both sides. What makes these scenes particularly scary is their resemblance to the rhetoric of today's administration to the detail. Meanwhile, some unfortunate desert events show that 'game rules' do not really apply. The question remains open whether it is rigged from the troops' start or arbitrariness because of the events that lead to the result (I suppose it is both). At the end we are back in place 1 with the next group going to "Punishment Park". This description may indicate a highly biased (or even demagogic) propaganda film, but it would be misleading. The performance (all participants were nonprofessionals as usual with Watkins) looks and sounds right (tribunal scenes may even contain text material from real modern trials). I would say that this could be sold as the 'real' without any problem. With Watkins' The Forgotten Faces, the reaction was "We can't send it, or nobody will believe in our real news reader anymore (because it can't be distinguished from the right thing)". With "Punishment Park" it should be the same. Effectively banned in the United States as far as I know this is a must that has not lost its power or its relevance (especially today).
