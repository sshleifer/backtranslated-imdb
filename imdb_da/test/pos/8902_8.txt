Having been a faithful Asterix fan all my life, I have to say that "Asterix and Vikings" are probably the best of all Asterix movies. It has some very fun jokes in it and the animation is fantastic. As many people have pointed out, it does not really follow the comic plot ("Asterix and the Norman"), but in many ways it is just as good because the book looks in my heart as one who poked a lot of fun at 60 number, and much of it is very dated today. What really rubbed me the wrong way though is how they incorporated a Disney style plot into movies that took a lot of focus away from Asterix and Obelix. We have a misunderstood boy who doesn't fit in, Justforkix. We have an empty girl who does not fit in because she will be treated like men, Abba. They meet and fall in love, but their love is threatened because boy is ashamed to be honest with the girl, but ultimately wins their love. This has been plotted for so many Disney (and also fair, other studies) movies that are not fun, and the plot was old twenty years ago. I think they even gave Justforkix a whimsical animal tip. <br /> <br /> I found not only this derivative and clich√©, but it really detracted from the story and left me unhappy. <br /> <br /> I think it's telling how amazing the rest of the movie was, still thinking very much about it, despite how the plot was hijacked.
