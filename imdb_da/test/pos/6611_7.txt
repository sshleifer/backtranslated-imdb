This movie for me deserves great praise, because even though I'm not surfing or skating, I was inspired throughout the documentary. The depth of history and the development of these two extreme sports highlighted what they were able to do for two groups of individuals. The dedication that these people have / has is really inspiring and it was because of them that others can now enjoy and do what these guys founded. <br /> <br /> Contrary to most other documentaries, this one was wisely put together, the amount of footage recorded and survived over the decades is outstanding, and because of this, some of the The biggest edits I have ever seen were put together and resulted in the topic being left behind. Without the need for them to retort to newer footage of the more famous surfers and skaters who are still popular today. <br /> <br /> The movie explores areas as success, such as performing new tricks, winning contests and fame. As well as faults such as injury or burnout. <br /> <br /> It was also fulfilling to hear the experience coming from skaters and surfers themselves and not from used information. This resulted in a better image that was drawn. <br /> <br /> All in all, a truly outstanding effort.
