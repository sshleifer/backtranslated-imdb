Despite the pedigree, the most interesting things in this series are not animatronics or doll hat, which, while charming, is a little more than side shows, at least in the story I saw, a story short. In fact, I wonder, although I admit, that the program's main joy lies in the most ancient art, storytelling. John Hurt, in Rowley Birken QC fashion, grotesque, medieval make-up, relates to a story of storytelling sitting by the fire accompanied by a cynical dog. A winter day, starving and poor, he spots a colleague's beggar thrown out of the royal kitchen by the unpleasant cook. The Story Teller tricks the latter to give them an excellent soup. Furious, the chef usually uses the king for permission to cook the villain, but the monarch is happy with the storyteller's wit, and he gives him a statement - for 100 nights he has to tell the king a new story: if he doesn't, he'll hand him over kitchen. <br /> <br /> The story can be old, but it is told with great pleasure. Anthony Minghella's script is extremely dramatic (as a playwright), witty and with some disturbing worries of fun, as fear of the self or the culturally self-propelled power of the narrative associated with the continuation of ideological power. For a program aimed at children, it is bracingly self-reflective (with a little nonsense about movies being the new oral culture); In spite of the American style, there is a charming sense of medieval bustle, its great quintessence and arbitrary terror as well as its magic and power.
