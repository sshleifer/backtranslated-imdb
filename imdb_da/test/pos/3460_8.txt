This is definitely a movie that makes you think of the daily struggles that a person can go through every day. The great play of the two leading roles exemplifies this further and you will not regret watching this movie in any way. <br /> <br /> It's a heartbreaking tale of two new friends exploring everyday ups and downs from a wheelchair seat. Their friendship is tested as well as their spirits when they get their own apartment outside the nursing home. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who likes buddies or just wants to see a wonderful and hearty movie that controls all clich√©s and pitfalls and doesn't even get soggy.
