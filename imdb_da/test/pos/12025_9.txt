This Bravo special is one of the most pure entertaining things I've ever seen on television. Unlike me first and Gimme Gimmes (the world's leading Punk-Supergroup / Cover-Band), Dan Band must really be seen as appreciated. On paper, The Dan Band is just a one-joke act-guy sings girly songs and inserts gratuitous profanity in the lyrics. If you listen to their "Dan Band Live" CD, it's all you get and it gets old fast. (I only bought it because it had some songs that weren't on the TV.) But what has Dan Finnerty done as a Hollywood coal hero, is his amazing scene presence. This guy OWNS his audience for every second he's on stage. And backup singers are also a big part of the visual punchline. Regarding the actual band, they remain mostly out of sight, but are certainly much more energetic and enthusiastic than your typical lounge-act backing band. Hopefully a DVD version will be released soon - there were almost certainly some songs cut, and even though the heavy censorship adds a bit of accidental humor, it also removes the INTENTIONAL humor. <br /> <br /> If there is any sense in the world, Vegas casino owners will soon struggle over who can build Dan's own showroom faster. <br /> <br /> "Re ------- my name ... FAME!"
