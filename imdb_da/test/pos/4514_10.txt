I just looked at an advance screening, I haven't read the book, but heard many good things about it. <br /> <br /> The movie was amazing, very moving. With a roller coaster of emotions, you completely associate with the characters. Shaun Toub was amazing, it was a complete departure from his usual roles, and his action for those who understand Persian / Dari was incredible. One thing to note is that Khaled Hosseini actually loved the movie, which is unusual for book adaptation films. Even after watching the movie several times, he "talked". <br /> <br /> Also, the animation from the intro was exquisite, with names shown as if it were Persian calligraphy, very unique! At times, the translation was not clearly conveyed the message effectively, but overall it was a good movie.
