I don't usually comment on movies since I'm in the film distribution business, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite movies all the time. The action is amazing and the script is even better. There were no cheesy talks or exploitation of the disabled to try to make this movie more "Hollywood". James McAvoy is such an excellent actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was also impressed with Steven Robertson. I can't believe it's his first real movie. Brenda Fricker plays a small role, but as usual she is unique. This is a movie for everyone to see how lucky we all are. If you like Awakenings and Mask, you will enjoy this story. You owe it to yourself to check out this movie.
