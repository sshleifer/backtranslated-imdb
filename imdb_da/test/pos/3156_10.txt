USA The movie is like this: You take a nap on a long hot Sunday afternoon. It's great to close your eyes and let your worries slip away. Soon you are lost in one of the intense clear dreams where you know you are dreaming, but you still can't wake up - not what you want. You go with the flow, and soon you are in a kind of strange Alice in Wonderland story complete with characters you didn't think you could dream up. They tell you all kinds of crazy things about war and peace as you take you through a walk in the past and even the future. <br /> <br /> The dream is getting heavier and you want to go down a path you can't control. Maybe you want to wake up so you try to open your eyes, but you can't. Now there is destruction and grief and confusion and frightening voices that tell you what could be truth or could be lies. You see pictures that flicker and change and become so clear, but will you see for yourself what you have the brain to create for you? <br /> <br /> Finally, you are lost in a myth world and you realize that the end has come. The end of the world and the end of the dream. It is over. What are you waking up to? What are you doing next? <br /> <br /> Perhaps you write that dream because you know that dreams that don't happen too often - and when they do, be aware. <br /> <br /> Or maybe you want to break a beer and forget about it all. Bad idea. Do not forget.
