I was not even born when this series was released in the United States. It took about a decade before British television networks got hold of it. <br /> <br /> I was actually lucky enough to see the very first episode where The Lone Ranger was one of a bag that ran into an ambush and was slaughtered. TLR was the only survivor. Although he was hurt a lot, he was rescued by a passing Indian named Tonto. I think he was wearing a mask to hide his true identity for fear of retaliation. But instead he made himself more recognized. Dunno if he had it in sleep. <br /> <br /> This was Saturday's teatime staples. The Fan Tell bugs from William Tell's overture pursued a dash to the telly, still food in hand. Although it quickly became repetitive, predictable lofts. No one has ever transformed him. No one ever landed a blow, no one has ever shot him. He was a little too good and just a little to camp in his dress for most children. Poor Tonto, on the other hand, became his aunt Sally. He was always slugged and tied and kidnapped and stuffed. <br /> <br /> And what did he call The Lone Ranger? 'King Savvy' was the general consensus where I lived. It seemed to mean "the great know-all" in Indian speech. But sounds like something else, as if Mr Silverheels had a speech error. 'Kemosabe'; What the hell is that? <br /> <br /> A later and less well-bought duo called 'The Range Rider' and 'Dick West' eventually won my vote. This highlighted a naked face by Jock Mahoney, who was looked up quite thoroughly in each episode and was entirely less camp, less super and more credible. <br /> <br /> Still; Even today, I can't hear William Tell's overture without expecting a canopy of hooves and a hearty Hi-Oh Silver. <br /> <br /> Devine deafness.
