For once a story of hope highlighted over the tragic reality our young people are facing. Favela Rising draws one into a scary, insecure and unfair world and shows through beautiful color and moving music how a man and his dedicated friends choose not to accept that world and change it through action and art. An entertaining, interesting, emotional, aesthetically beautiful movie. I also showed this movie to a number of high school students who all live in neighborhoods of poverty and gun violence, and they were enchanted by Anderson, the protagonist. I recommend this movie to all ages over 13 (due to subtitles and some pictures of death) from all backgrounds.
