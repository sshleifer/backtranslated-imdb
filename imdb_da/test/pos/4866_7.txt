As I have said in previous comments, there are some programs that should be 'Light entertainment'. So I get a little frustrated when commentators seem to expect a program that will reveal the meaning of life, you won't get it from Cleopatra 2525 and it doesn't suppose to offer it. What you get is a girl who was frozen and brought back to life about 500 years later, and her adaptation to this new life is realistic. She does not settle within 10 minutes as what happens with other travel times, nor is she the female equivalent of James Bond who is ready to take on any future. Cleopatra is overcome by her new surroundings and afraid of some of the weapons shown on the display that most of us would be. But it's easy entertainment, the stories have a beginning in the middle and an end in fast time, and their are some surprisingly good moments of acting. The episode, when there is a double of Cleopatra, moves in particular, and Jennifer Sky thinks I give one of the best performances that someone dies for a long time, and to be a movie and television buff I know what I'm talking about . Finally, to prove my sincerity, I have bought all four of the episodes and I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The only reason I didn't have the complete set is because I bought the other episodes before I realized there was a complete set of boxes. Victoria Pratt and Gina Torres complete the trio creditably and for easy entertainment Cleopatra 2525 certainly entertained me.
