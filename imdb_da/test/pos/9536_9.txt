The book "The Railway Children" is a children's book published in 1906 by Edith Nesbit, an early British socialist who had very strong views on the importance of family values ​​for the upbringing of children, and the story he told is supposed to be modern. Somewhat surprising, it seems to maintain a significant appeal to today's children hundreds of years later. <br /> <br /> A movie adaptation of an Edwardian classic children's story with the main roles of the kids doesn't sound very exciting for most movie-goers in this day and age. But a really good performance by Jenny Agutter, who (near the start of her long and prominent acting career) played part of the oldest girl Roberta (Bobby) combined with remarkable work by the screenwriter and director Lionel Jeffries and unique photography by Arthur Ibbetson, has This for a movie that still cannot be missed, and one that most of its viewers find quite memorable. It is noteworthy that this book, set in 1905, was filmed five times between 1951 and 2000 (four of them by the BBC for British television), and all of these versions are not only still very much admired but also highly regarded (something that user comments on this database will confirm), although it may seem almost inconceivable for a nostalgic period story designed to appeal primarily to children. Since I haven't seen the four BBC TV versions, these comments relate only to the 1970 movie version produced for cinema viewing. Unlike most films in children's books, "Railway Children" can appeal more to adults than children. The structure of family life has changed so much in the last century that many children can feel completely lost by the way it is depicted in the film, while many older adults find that it has a significant nostalgic appeal. Perhaps compensating for this is the children who are in the movie, full of life and vitality, while the adult characters, although well-rounded, mostly tend to be "stuffed shirts". The story is a mature one that deals with love, support and encouragement, it is not only timeless but able to attract for all ages. It can be pretty much described as sentimental and more than slightly idealized, but it is never mawkish in any way, and the rarely reasoned adjective "uplifting" fits it like a glove. <br /> <br /> Spoiler forward. <Br /> <br /> The movie starts with its upper middle-class Edwardian family celebrating Christmas in a comfortable and quite spacious home in London when two unexpected visitors call and take dad (who is a senior state manager) away with them. The mother will move to a very small cottage next to the railway in a distant part of Yorkshire, and the children gradually build a new life that is mainly connected to the railway and the few trains that pass. This life turns out to be quite eventful in small ways, and the older daughter Bobby is growing rapidly as she takes over several responsibilities from her mother. At one point, she deviates an accident to the train when her sharp eyes appear to have a landslide created a natural danger. Father's history never gets much weight, but he is never forgotten, and it becomes clear that he is imprisoned and suspected of treason. Finally, these suspicions are resolved (we are not told how or why) and he unexpectedly arises at the local station to become a member of his family. <br /> <br /> For many years, this movie was not available in any home format in North America, but Anchor Bay created a DVD from it three years ago, so they realized that this rather simple movie has not yet lost its appeal. For anyone who does not already have one, I would highly recommend hurrying to buy a copy of this DVD while still available - you would be most unlikely to be disappointed unless you have become completely cynical or your minimum requirements for a films include trousers of blood and / or intense sex scenes.
