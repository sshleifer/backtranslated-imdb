I had my reservations about seeing The Return to Lonesome Dove after seeing and enjoying the original so much. Without Tommy Lee Jones representing his role as Woodrow Call or Anjelica Huston as Clara, I figured it just wouldn't seem authentic enough. When displaying 'return', I can honestly say that it is a worthy successor. The actors really do the show with Jon Voight, Rick Schroder and Oliver Reed all preforms at their very best. I admit the story cannot be as exciting as the first, but the 'return' certainly has its share of excitement and captures the romance of the old west in a way that few other films have. Anyone who still has reservations can be sure that The Return to Lonesome Dove succeeds in capturing the original 'feel' and will not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and check it out, Ol 'Gus would be proud!
