Let me first say that although I generally appreciate Mike Dommer's work, I have only been weak in my response to Office Space, King of the Hill and Beavis and Butthead. I generally prefer more intelligent comedy, and in it lies the irony of the idiocrat. In a future where the performance of Beavis and Butthead's views, basic instincts and intellectual abilities is the setting of a chaotic rage, semi-Mad Max semi-Blade Runner community, where every trailer-trash guy's imagination becomes reality, a man of even average intelligence threatening and accused of talking gay, and the mob mentality takes over. And this world is also incredibly fun. Yes, it's obvious that Carl's Jr., Starbucks, Costco, and Fuddrucker's executives will be horrified by the twisted values ​​given to their products in the year 2505. <br /> <br /> There were some missing opportunities with the movie, and the relationship between temporal travelers - the other is an average intelligence who is concerned about his boyfriend (pimp's) retribution - could have been stronger; Chemistry is there. And there don't seem to be too many women in the future. <br /> <br /> I left with a laugh on my face, but the experience is a little better than the memories. So it's my kind of popcorn movie and it will be fun to watch video again. Recommended! FYI stays through the credits for an extra scene.
