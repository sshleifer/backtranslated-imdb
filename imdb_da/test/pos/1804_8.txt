Valley Girl is an exceptionally well made movie with an all-encompassing great cast. Although the dialogue is a bit dated now, when the film was released, it was very hip. To this day, I know many people (including teenagers) who cannot form a sentence without using the word "like". It is undoubtedly the legacy of this film to leave. A rating of 8 was given to this as the most outstanding movie.
