This was recommended to me by a friend who said it was sweet and fun for a "lesbian sexuality Flick". Boy was he wrong. I think he just didn't get it. Growing up without understanding and then discovering yourself through trials and tribulations is more like that. <br /> <br /> The characters are full and vibrant, and the story has enough fun thrown through the theatrical performances to keep everyone interested. /> <br /> Rachael Stirling as "Nan" goes through so many attempts to find the love she wants only to find out that it was the only person she was afraid to reveal too and ran out on. Johdi May as "Flo" was remarkable. spent a couple of hours trying to remember where I saw her before, only to find out she was The quiet sister "Alice" in "Last of the Mohicans" Fortunately, I grew up in a liberal family and had no problems trying a movie like this. So many people miss out on flicks like this. I'm glad I took my friend's advice and tried it. But I'm sure I enjoyed it more.
