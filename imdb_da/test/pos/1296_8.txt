Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye is a great family movie. Salman Khan looks great and amazing than ever! There is even a scene where he takes off his shirt! What a surprise!!! Rani Mukherjee is also fantastic. Pooja Batra had very few lines to say, but I'm glad she has been recognized for her role because she certainly has potential. It's about Prem (Salman Khan) and he is a honeymoon. He is getting married to Nisha (Raveena Tandon), but is getting up. Prem goes to Nisha's house and asks her why he's convicted and that's because her brother is ill and she must marry a NRI, Rahul (Inder Kumar) to get the money dealt with him. Prem goes on and in comes Priya (Rani Mukherjee). Prem falls in <br /> <br /> love with Priya, but it's a shame she's getting married to a NRI! Who could this NRI be? Priya falls in love with Prem, while Rahul is with her. Prem gives one day an abusive comment on Priya, and she goes out and goes to Agra for the wedding with Rahul. Will Prem stop her? See KPNHJ to find out! <br /> <br /> The movie was a lot of fun! The songs were great, especially the song "O Priya O Priya" It's a shame that the movie flopped in India and I don't know why? Every movie in India goes flop today !! This movie deserved to be a hit. The only problem I found with the movie is that they had an NRI obsession! They think all NRIs are rich! The movie deserves a 9/10!
