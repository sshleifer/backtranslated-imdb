This movie blew me away - I've only seen two episodes of the show, never seen the first movie, but went to a feasibility study where Johnny Knoxville himself introduced the movie and told us to "quench our sense of moral judgment for an hour and a half." He was right, as a movie, this would probably judge a 2, as it has zero plot, no structure beyond coincidence and very little production value, but it is not the meaning, everyone in our theater laughs and gasped all the way through - not just some of the creatures creative (see the trailer if you need to know, but they saved some of the best (or worst depending on how you want to look at it)), but some of the things they did took us quite surprised. These guys do some things that don't make your newspaper listings (and probably can't even be published here) that involve many things under the belt, however, nearly 3/4 of the stunts are terribly hysterical (though moral condemnation, but so-called Knoxville statement) and if you are in the right mindset this movie is hysterical to see. Only about 20 minutes of this movie could actually have been shown on television, so consider yourself warned about what you are getting into - some things are disgusting, but instead of being rejected by it, you end up laughing at it all stupidity of it all. As a person who believed Jackass, the TV show was an overheated dish with only a few funny sketches and lots of unnecessary pain. I had the fun I had in this movie, realized that there are no limits to the best environment for these guys to work in. It's very fun and should be a great comedy solution until the Borat movie comes out. With this movie you may think you know what you get, but these guys are a few steps ahead of you - I guarantee you'll be surprised at the 3rd sketch. So do not enjoy and worry: you will not do almost any of their things at home.
