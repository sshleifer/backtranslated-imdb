An interesting film by Jordana Brewster as a young woman traveling to Europe in an attempt to find out what was left of her older sister (Cameron Diaz) who mysteriously died years earlier. Brewster is very good and keeps you involved despite some unrealistic plans, such as having her amazinly find and starting a romance with her dead sister's much older boyfriend (Christopher Eccleston). Still, mostly good. GRADE: B
