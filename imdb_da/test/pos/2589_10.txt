Having just got the "Loony Tunes Golden Collection" (which I highly recommend, by the way), I will try to comment mostly on not all the cartoons individually. As such, the start guide may seem superfluous to those who read more reviews of them because I apologize. Rabbit spices are in the midst of a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two are "Rabbit Fire" and "Duck! Rabbit, Duck.") Tasker and Daffy argue who Elmer Fudd should be short, which makes me laugh every single time! !! On the DVD it has a comment, featurette and the opportunity to play it only music. <br /> <br /> My character: A + <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Disk 1: An introduction by Chuck Jones; Termite Terrice's Boy Part 1; Clips from the movies "Two Guys from Texas" and "My Dream is yours", both with Bugs cameos; Bridging sequences for an episode of "The Bugs Bunny show"; Astro Nuts audio recording session; 2 vintage trailers; " Blooper Bunny: Bugs Bunny 51st and a Half Anniversary "with optional comment by author Greg Ford & Still's Gallery
