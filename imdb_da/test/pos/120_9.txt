There are questions that sometimes hover over us and have no answer. Two women gradually find themselves in one another's arms (like corny as the term sounds, and that's exactly what happens) and find that they can't answer their own question about what defines their relationship when their own community doesn't some name of what they are. Deepa Mehtas somewhat mis-titled FIRE is the first of a loosely connected trilogy, linked here by the theme of the element and more symbolic than consumption. Fire as uncontrolled erotic passion does not look here, as the women - the older and more feminine Radha (Shabana Azmi) and the younger, more masculine-hardened Sita (Nandita Das) become aware that they share much more than ordinary ideas and devotion to each other and stands for what they believe is their passion for each other despite the opposition to their very traditional husbands and families. As in water, BRAND is deeply spiritual, though technically it falls into the state of sentimental melodrama (where water, like the weight of the word, carries a stronger meaning that ultimately transcends its definition). Yet it is a very beautiful picture and a strong voice from a strong instructor.
