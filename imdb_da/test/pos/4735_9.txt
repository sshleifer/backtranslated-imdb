When I started to see, I thought I saw some pro-Koresh amateur documents. However, I had never seen 3/4 of the footage they used. They interviewed people who said the FBI / ATF embarked on all these things that sounded so far, but then followed the FBI video and testimony. I was amazed at it. The documentary followed with the senate after the fire, and after seeing the interview and video recordings, you will be shocked at how the Senate and the attorney general put their back on Davidians to cover the aggression of the FBI / ATF. If you start to see this, quit it. Otherwise you will think it is propaganda of something like that.
