One of the most sublime American masterpieces, Morrissey opens the film by sexualizing Dallesandro, with his open mouth snoring on a pillow. We wonder if he comes out of a heroin high? We just see his face, so flash, his body, flash, his naked back. I can't think of another movie that used this flash blip form of editing so well to create a hypnotic, druggy mood, an editing method that works wonderfully as both pacing and style. After this introduction, when Dallesandro opens his mouth, his accent crushes - we expect him to be a kind of soft androgynous; instead, he has a street god's voice - Morrissey is not comfortable letting our assumptions go uncontrolled. The long opening is very sexy and playful - it's a combination of fighting issues, Dallesandro's fascinating lip-rubbing kisses and early morning sexual escapades; It all flows together, if not always smooth, so emotionally realistic. <br /> <br /> What I got from this was the same as what I got from "The 400 Blows" when I first saw it - this is like a 20-something continuation of that story. There is a sense of companionship between the buyers and the buyers; When Dallesandro is on the street looking for men (to fund his wife's abortion), there is the feeling of a secret handshake, as boys do business with each other. I have never found it boring, even though nothing happens - nothing great happens, the boys are hanging around as they do and waiting for tricks. The most important trick Dallesandro finds is fascinating to look at, using Greek descriptions and only touching his back, a form of aesthetic play on the man's side. It's also terribly fun ("I'm not talking to an empty bed, am I?"). It's one of the most revealing scenes in the movie - in every movie I think; Definitely any movie dealing with sex and sex for sale. When Dallesandro's eyes appear red and swollen, we cannot tell if it is because he is full, ashamed or embarrassed or all. <br /> <br /> The talks in the movie are cut - they are indifferent. (The movie is silent in some scenes, some of the most exciting and beautiful you can ever experience.) But when Morrissey chooses to include one, the way he includes it (we see it together), it is sensational, such as. a conversation between Dallesandro and a newbie hustler - and none of them ever mention the word "gay" or "hustler". What follows is a scene where we listen to a few transvestites that Dallesandro is servicing - it is just after explaining the beginner being used for the job. <br /> <br /> Dallesandro is a topic worth paying attention to paid to him both by his clients and Morrissey. He is less than effective as an actor, but as to reveal something, he is incredible - he is a person we will immediately feel over, but we go through his experiences with all their complexities, and we have to try to know him. He is the kind of shiny slate that we are attracted to, but we can't get it. And of course he is incredibly striking - forgetting everything else, this is partly a testament to the beauty of the male body, Dallesandro's beautiful torso and permanently rebellious nipples. <br /> <br /> The movie has a devastating scene, but like anything else you can't really master it - a girl says she's been raped and her only self-defense is to say that if the rapist only asked for sex , wooed her, he would have got a better plunge. It's crushing. The film has feelings for everyone, but even better than that, it is not only sympathetic, it actually tries to help us understand people - and without ever dictating what it is, we must understand. Nor does it look or glamorize the people in the film. It feels inclusive when we see Joe's arm around a transvestite. When he reads a letter (he is talking about not getting past grade eight at a time), he is completely charming as he pauses a word ... then says "woteva" and continues. <br /> <br /> You can learn something more profoundly from the interaction between Dallesandro and one of his clients regarding homosexual relationships than you can from any case study. Here we have the young boy smiling (his top lip disappears as he does) when a 30-something gym bunny Korean war veteran runs his fingers through his hair; It's a scene that feels very deep, this adult man shares something with a younger version of himself - it's not two gay men together or a gay man who pays a straight man, that's something else you can't put your finger on ; questions about sexuality are next to the point. (Never before have you smashed a pimple, it seemed loving.) After sharing something with each other emotionally (but with Dallesandro as he is there for the money, it is never clear why he is there, even if he is never less than sincere, which may be his most disconcerting quality), "So ... can you help me out?" The man says for sure. "I don't mean my pants!" 10.10
