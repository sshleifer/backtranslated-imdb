I really wanted to write a title for this review that didn't come out as corny or gushing, but still described my feelings for this show. I can see now that this is not possible. "American Family" is one of the best shows I've ever had the pleasure of watching TV. Several reviewers here at IMDb have mentioned the word "beautiful" when describing this show. Never has a word been more appropriate. The kinematics of this show are amazing. Each scene and shot looks like a masterpiece. The lighting, the camera moves, the scene composition and the colors ... I must remind myself that I see a TV show and not a masterpiece with Motion Picture. The result of Lee Holdridge and Nathan Wang brings tears to his eyes. And most importantly, what is about the amazing casting, honest and sincere. I do not want to see performances ... I want to see real life. If only real life could be so beautiful. <br /> <br /> The American Family has actually raised the bar for quality entertainment on TV. I highly recommend this show to anyone who is willing to see it. I could easily chase CBS to pass this show, but I have to say that it doesn't matter to me who floats it. I'm just glad it's out there for everyone to see. Then I thank PBS for not leaving this show in nothing. <br /> <br /> I must give special recognition to the way each season's finals ended. The first was pure creative shine and it moved me to tears. I was waiting to see if season two would end up in a creative way too, and that was probably enough. Again tears. <br /> <br /> My thanks to everyone involved. You have really made a special work of art with this show, and I rightly think so. It's a shame that we only have two seasons, but we have a miracle at all.
