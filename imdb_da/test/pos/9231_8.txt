The 221 episodes of "The Lone Ranger" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1949 to 1957; and for many years they played in local syndication. In most of the original broadcast years, the ABC series was the most watched piece of programming. <br /> <br /> The new DVD set from Pop Flix contains the first 16 episodes (September 15 - December 29, 1949) and for some reason not known episode 22 from the fifth season, a total of 17 episodes ( the same 17 available on last year's Mill Creek Entertainment release, so these are probably in the public domain). These sets roughly make the "The Legend of the Lone Ranger" movie redundant as all three episodes combined in 1952 to form the movie are included in these releases. <br /> <br /> Early episodes go back to the radio, as much more voice-over narrative is used as an introduction and introduces key plot moments. <br /> <br /> The series itself was pure kiddie western with clear good and evil differences and no romance. The title character (played by Clayton Moore) started Texas Ranger John Reid. The first three episodes provide the background for his conversion to Lone Ranger status, his partner with the Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels) and the taming of his "Silver" horse. <br /> <br /> There is a unique code of positive morality that infuses each episode. The Lone Ranger is quite good, but he adopts the fate of evil. While a masked man in the west was usually feared by the good citizens and an Indian was disturbed, the Lone Ranger feared those who would hurt. A persistent theme is that when Lone Ranger and Tonto first meet an average citizen, they are met with suspicion, and at the end of the episode the citizen has been convinced of their value. The mark ended was a secondary character asking the question, "Who was the masked man?" <br /> <br /> To truly enjoy the series, you must accept it for the simplified moral narrative it was supposed to be. If you don't take it seriously and still want some self-reflective campy parody items, you'll only get frustrated. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
