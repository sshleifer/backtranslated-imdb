My husband and I both loved this movie. First, my husband was skeptical and asked how many points he got to sit through this. But after a few key scenes he was completely sucked in and at the end he was convinced that it was one of the best movies. Kathleen Bates has never been so wonderfully gracious, and the rest of the casting is simply amazing. Thanks for this beautiful movie.
