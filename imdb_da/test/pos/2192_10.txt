Not having seen the 1936 version of this story, I can't offer any comparison there. However, I can say that Stephen Sondheim's musical treatment of this story is absolute genius. Only Sondheim could come up with music and lyrics that are star in themselves, yet perfect for the very bizarre topic. If anyone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is, they should see this (and "Dr. Strangelove" too). When Mrs Lovett goes from having the "worst pies in London" to a thriving business with high recognition, we do not speak "Soylent Green" - but the ingredients are the same. Particularly brilliant is the song where Mrs. Lovett pitches her idea to Mr. Todd. Even in the introductory number, the line "... they went to their maker impeccably shaved ..." gives a great indication of the premise, drama and comedy that comes. Excellent!
