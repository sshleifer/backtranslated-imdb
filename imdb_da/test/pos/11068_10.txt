Ingrid Bergman (Cleo Dulaine) has never been so beautiful. Gary Cooper as "Cleent" so perfectly cast as a laconic Texan who knows that this gal is up to nothing good. When they lock their eyes on the French market, we know that this fight will be full of sparks. As they stroll in her garden in her restored French Quarter and the love theme, it is a dream for all of us romanticists. The costumes are lovely; That put the decor on you wants the "quarter" to be just like that. And that Saratoga still had this hotel with the wide veranda with all the old biddies gossip. From Edna Ferber's novel, the story is revenge for the old clock and the struggles of who would drive the railways in the early days of that industry. <br /> <br /> In Saratoga scenes, Florence Bates steals as a grand lady every scene. <br /> <br /> But it's Cleo's scene that takes the little lawyer her New Orleans relatives have sent to buy her away, it's a magical movie moment. After Cleo has spoken to him in the negotiations, he looks at her longing and says "I must say - you are very beautiful." And Cleo with a bright and evil smile says "yes, it's not lucky." You will shout "YES" !!! <br /> <br /> One of my all-time favorite romantic movies.
