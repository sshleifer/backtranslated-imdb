This was a movie that ultimately thought "It was an enjoyable 2 hours!" I hate spending about $ 20 (not including baby-seated $$) for my husband and myself to have it "It was OK" feeling. I think I like Will Smith better as a comic actor than an action hero. He was well thrown into this. His character was very sympathetic as it was Kevin James'. <br /> <br /> There were several laughing scenes. It's also a romantic movie, so boys, if you want to impress the lady in your life, take her to this. Women would like it as much as any chick-flick, but I wouldn't categorize it like one. There is lots of guy humor in it for men to enjoy. I think this is one of the reasons why this movie is as perfect as a dating movie. It has romance and slapstick. I don't usually like to slapstick so much, but it wasn't overdone, and I can't think of any of the scenes that didn't deliver laughs. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. The first thing my husband told me after it was over was "I want to see it again!"
