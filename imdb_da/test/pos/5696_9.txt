While many people found this movie simply too slow and simplified, I was really connected to it. There is no plot as such, but the film takes the form of a human survival story of three people caught a tree with a man eating crocodile who lurks somewhere in the water beneath them. Personally I thought the play was mostly very good, although the roles were often demanding and I felt a sense of warmth for the characters. The situation they were in was quite scary and I felt really nervous about them. I found the whole movie quite nervous because of the sheer helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival. The crocodile effects were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget film and believe me, I have seen my fair share of risky Croc movies. The creature moved well and had real threat, and although the audience I was with did not seem to be preoccupied with the movie as a whole, they still jumped and gasped when the crocodile appeared. <br /> <br /> Script-wise, I would have made a few changes, especially at the end, but it wasn't a big problem. For fans of slow-burning survival fear, within reality, this will be an engaging movie, but unfortunately, for many audiences seeking an exciting trip and higher production values ​​from their cinema experience, the point will simply be missed.
