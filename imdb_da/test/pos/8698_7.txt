Some years ago, while renting some movies, I came across subspecies 4, ended up seeing it and actually liked it, we needed a good vampire gore flick that didn't hold back. But when I went back to the video store, they said they didn't have other sub-videos, unfortunately the same went for any other video store I checked out. I gave up until someone on youtube actually posted all the subspecies and I had to see them all last night and I'm hooked. I am now a fan of the Full Moon Subspecies series. I think because it was the kind of horror movie I've been looking for, I have long after a good cheesy scare for a long time and subspecies have filled the place. Radu is one of the coolest vampires on the screen and gives almost Nosferatu a run for his fangs! <br /> <br /> Radu is an evil vampire who is after his bloodstone, his birthright, the stone contains some blood that is absolutely incredible and gives him strength. Three American girls studying Romanian history and culture encounter a man, Stephan, who offers to help. They remain in Radu's castle, where we find out that Stephan is Radu's brother; Radu seduces and turns two of the girls, but Stephan falls for one of the girls, Michelle, and will do anything to protect her. Subspecies are a fun series, despite the cheese effects, in some ways it makes it more sympathetic. Plus Radu was a perfect villain as Stephan was the perfect angel as a romantic vampire. The story is chilling, and I think it was a fun vampire movie. This was also the first in the series, the best part is, the sequels are just as fun. I would recommend this for a scary movie night, watch it in the dark, Radu is sure to send shakes down your back or even your throat ... OK, cheesy joke, couldn't resist. <br /> <br /> 7/10
