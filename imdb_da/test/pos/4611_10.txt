This is an excellent example of unobstructed film production at its best. Richard Greene (who is good at the role) searches for his two missing friends, takes him to the Black Forest area and the castle of the etogon Count Bruno (Stephen McNally), a former enemy of him whom he has never seen face to face. Incredible movies have so many amazing elements combined (once) into a single movie - a crocodile cave; a hulking mute (played by Lon Chaney, Jr.); a whimsical doctor (played by Boris Karloff); a leopard hunt (very well done and very atmospheric); A love story; a castle; a swordfight; a sadistic, county's count and his two evil accomplices (played by John Hoyt and Michael Pate !!!); a fascinating background story that makes the movie even more interesting; and more!. Jerry Sackheim's script does not allow itself to be bound in - making a movie that is highly advisable to anyone who is in unlimited crap with a touch of horror and atmosphere to it.
