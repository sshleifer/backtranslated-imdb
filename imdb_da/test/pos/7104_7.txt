The House of Dracula really has nothing new to offer in the way of chills or tensions or new twists on an already tired story. This film was made as a rapid successor to the relatively better made "House of Frankenstein" from a year earlier. In the "House of Dracula" you can see the factory as production values ​​from 1945, which take their way on an otherwise potentially scary movie. Stock footage from previous movies in the series and then the end of "Ghost of Frankenstein" used as a conclusion here, just makes for an "el cheepo" girl. Thus, the studio's shame and the producer is considering that they had top talent and only wasted everyone's time and effort on a quick cash-out scheme. But it seems to have been the trend all over Hollywood at the end of 2. world War. This is what was brought on some of the thoughtless Scifi images of the 1950s with all their close-ups of harmless lizards to make them work like dinosaurs. The days of James Whale and Val Lewton, to name two, were as far as creating a true mood and atmosphere in this genre. Also, remember that the make-up Jack Jackce, who actually did medical research to create all our favorites, was summed up just after this movie was released. A less skilled makeup man named Bud Westmore was then hired as head of this department at Universal, soon to be Universal-International. Not to deny Mr. Westmor's ability, but horror movie was just not his forte. OK to see or not to see. See this movie, but only as part of Frankenstein's chronological order, and you can see how all this ended up as a comical feed to Abbott & Costello.
