Three of the things you can say about Spalding Gray are: He certainly marched to his own "drummer" he was never lost to words; and of course he felt that those who looked at and listened to him would be interested in all aspects of his life, experiences and thoughts - no matter how trivial it is. <br /> <br /> Most of us are not quite as far "off" the wall "as he was. Most of us are not as interested in sharing the most minute parts of ourselves with others - even one To one or in small groups, let alone on stage. <br /> <br /> But it does not make it any less interesting to see and listen to this extraordinary man, and after seeing one of his beliefs, we can, after reflection, find many of his articulated musings may be more relevant to our own lives and thoughts than we might have thought. <br /> <br /> Granted, he was a "New York / avant-garde" type of personality and undoubtedly a little "strange. "(There are those who would maintain describing someone like" New York "and strange" was unnecessarily superfluous.) <br /> <br /> I give him a "10" for the talent he presents in this genre that is his specialty.
