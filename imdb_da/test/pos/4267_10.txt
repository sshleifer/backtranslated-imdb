I see lots of movies and had no idea that it would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (although I find Nirvana overvalued). It sounded like it would be lots of fun, but it was more than that. Jansen puts in small details like the books (including Kubrick's book), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director take his time and put his heart into a movie. And you can really feel it in this. There are lots of scenes and moments that I love, I try to think of some other movies that are like this, and I would say the only thing I can think of is Cameron Crowe movie. Take small moments and make them stand out and special. The soundtrack is amazing, and each song works perfectly with the scene and feel of the movie. This movie is great shot and editing is excellent. I could really go on and on about the movie. I can't really recommend it enough. If you want a fun story with great tunes from a director who clearly puts his heart into his work, check it out here.
