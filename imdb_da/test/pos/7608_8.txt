Of course, really experienced reviewers who like things like Star Wars and professional crap will definitely draw this movie and say really bad comments about it. But it's really a lovely teenage comedy with a great story and good actor. Josie Gellar (played well by Drew Barrymore) is part of a news reporting team and she has been offered a ('real') job - she has to go back to school and find out what teenagers are like these days. Now it's okay until Josie remembers his terrible time at High School and gets freaked out. But she has never been hip, never been cool, never been popular so far! <br /> <br /> Sit back and enjoy with Never Been Kissed! <br /> <br />
