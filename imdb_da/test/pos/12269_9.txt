For me, this wonderful roller coaster of a movie repeated the bears pleasant views. Its about the mixed life of three very different people. Holly Hunter is the obsessive workaholic producer. Albert Brookes plays the unprepossessing but brilliant journalist. William Hurt is the beloved, but stupid new child in the block, news anchor. <br /> <br /> The classic love triangle emerges with the astoundingly witty and self-defeating Brookes, who are in love with Hunter, but of course she is attracted to Hurt. <br /> <br /> This movie works on many levels. At least it's a brilliant comedy with the one lines flying so thick and fast that every view carries a new harvest of those you might have missed the last time. It is also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romance. But perhaps most importantly, films examine the modern occupation with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over intellect as a valuable human trait. This is personified by the success of the fast man as opposed to Brookes' relative decline. <br /> <br /> Despite being fifteen years, the film has some emerging relevant messages about modern news values ​​and the continuing decline in journalistic standards. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic in every sense and it is difficult to understand why it has been so neglected
