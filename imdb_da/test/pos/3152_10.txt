I have a little hobby about finding really cool pictures out there that are pretty much unknown - and then let people know about them. This is on my list to get the word out this summer. This indie film (and I really mean indie - not Miramax, Fox Searchlight indie) can be easily overlooked in the large labyrinth of celluloid, but if you want something completely different - check this out. <br /> <br /> Basically, I thought it was amazing. I should have known from the DVD cover, both front and back, that this should be something completely different, but they all say their stuff is different than crochet. Now this one is really quite different. It's in your face: beautiful and scary and uncomfortable to tell you to wake up. War, peace, 9/11, poetry, even a creepy kind of music video set to an old "patriotic" song and a strange guy in an RV. Should I say more? Just see it.
