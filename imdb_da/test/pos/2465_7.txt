Emilio Estevez really directed a good movie - who would think? I sat through two previous films Estevez directed - "Wisdom" (then dearest Demi Moore) and "Men at Work" (with brother Charlie Sheen). They are miserable movies --- badly acted, directed, stupid and offensive. Estevez is a good actor, but miserable as an instructor. I did it in pure curiosity - it has a big throw and I had nothing else to do. Condemned if it didn't take me in. <br /> <br /> It's about Estevez coming home from Vietnam, permanently frightened by what happened over there. His parents (Kathy Bates, Martin Sheen) and sister (Kimberly Williams) are trying to reach him but cannot. Something in Vietnam has affected him deeply ... and he's about to explode ... <br/> <br /> Slightly slow but still very good. Much of the material is familar, but the cast is so good that they make it seem new. Estevez is good, Sheen is fantastic (and Estevez's real father), Williams touches and Bates is just extraordinary - trying to keep the family together. It all leads to a powerful ending, which really surprised me. <br /> <br /> It's worth catching. <br /> <br />
