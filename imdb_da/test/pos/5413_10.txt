This film is a strong commentary on family life in North America today. The story is so well constructed, it almost feels like it's happening across the street right now! If you are connected to your family and community in any way, this movie will grab you and transport you to Travis's home and not allow you to leave until the credits are completed. <br /> <br /> Our imaginary heroes, through a myriad of innocent circumstances, often lead unconscious paths to grief, confusion and isolation. The Travis family, after a terrible tragedy, invites each of us; father, mother, brother and sister, into their respective lives to share their experience in a dynamic set of circumstances that just do not end. We see all of the above and finally the joy, in powerful performances of the big players and the rest of the casting, making this film a absolute treasure for a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> In a movie as well done as it is usually difficult to find something special, but Sigourney Weaver's depiction of Sandy Travis was excellent. I would be surprised if others did not recognize it as such. <br /> <br /> Clearly a 10. Well done!
