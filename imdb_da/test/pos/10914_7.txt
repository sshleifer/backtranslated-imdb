Hollywood movies since the 1930s have treated homos as lepers. By condemning homosexuality, the film industry has only reflected what the daily repressive society constituted as ideology. For example, straight actor Don Murray in 1962 Otto Preminger's melodrama "Advise and Consent" was cast as a queer congressman who commits suicide rather than recognizing his alternative lifestyle. Gay characters have covered a lot of reasons since "Advising and Consent". In the 1997 film "In & Out" (** 1/2 out of ****), the heterosexual actor Kevin Kline is cast as a gay teacher coming out of the closet on his wedding day. While the conservative Hollywood of yesteryear stated that the congressional chamber of "Counseling and Consent" had to commit suicide, liberal Hollywood today determines that the gay English teacher should be embraced rather than maced. "In & Out" preaches good citizenship at the edge of a politically correct comedy. Director Frank Oz and Scenario Scott Rudnick adhere to honesty as the best policy because honesty always ensures happiness. High school teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline of "The Big Chill") will only be happy when he comes out of the closet, just as his lone fat-but-now-thin fiancee Emily (Joan Cusack) will only feel happy when she can ditch his diet. Ultimately, the film claims that equal society will accept homos when homosexuals can act with greater honesty and joy in themselves. The happily outed gay tabloid reporter is played by just actor Tom Selleck here effectively dramatizing this open-haired comment. <br /> <br /> Rudnick's lightweight script adorns the true life event that occurred at the Oscars as Tom Hanks praised a high school teacher. In "In & Out", Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), a blonde Brad Pitt-style bimbo-type actor, Oscar wins to publish a fruity foot soldier. Drake honors his mentor Howard Brackett during his acceptance. Don't claim to stop there, the obvious Cameron reveals to a live television audience that Howard is gay! Suspicion, paranoia and horror are set as the media down on the sleepy town of Green Leaf, Indiana. (When would a non-naming English teacher from the English school's sexual deviation rub such a massive media mission?) Among those journalists, Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck from "High Road to China") is wondering, and he will make one week's exclusive one at Howard. However, Howard will have nothing to do with the witch hunting medium, especially the gruesome Peter Malloy. Howard denies Drake's gay charges to everyone, including his fianc√© and his mother. Malloy dwells because he smells a scoop. Revelation has turned Green Leaf upside down. High school director Tom Halliwell (Bob Newhart) is nervously in crisis with all media coverage. Halliwell warns Howard that his marriage was not imminent, he had to give him a pink slip. Meanwhile, Peter Howard asks his marriage to Emily to come through at the last minute and he will be there to record the result on camera. <br /> <br /> Howard resorts for macho men's tapes. He struggles to reform himself. But Howard's efforts are in vain. Should swell inside him. And then there is Peter Malloy, who makes him clean about his homosexuality. Finally, Howard breaks the altar in God's eyes. Of course, the bride-to-be Emily Montgomery is the floor of Howard's gay confession. Predictably, the school burns Howard, but he turns to the exam. Drake also appears and hurries towards Bracketts defense. Not only has the school removed Howard from his job, but they have also given his teacher-of-the-year award to another. Drake appeals to the principal and wins Howard's unanimous support from the community. <br /> <br /> The greatest lack of Rudnick's constructive script is Howard himself. Rudnick has created a character for throwing to be true, either by gray or even standards. Howard Brackett is woven more like a saint than a sinner. He helps a student access college, and he trains the track team. How often do you hear about an English teacher doubling as a coach as well? Everyone at his high school offers Howard. He doesn't have an average bone in his body. In addition, Rudnick and Oz ask us to believe that no one else in Green Leaf is gay. Where are Howard's gay friends? Are they also afraid of coming to his defense? No, "In & Out" is not strictly targeted to homosexual audiences. Oz, whose screen credits include sweet comedies like "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" and "House Sitter" as well as Rudnick teeter on a politically correct tightrope. "In & Out" is not a gay recruitment movie. The filmmakers show no interest in what was asked that Howard or Peter Malloy prefer homosexual lifestyle. Instead, Oz and Rudnick are only interested in obtaining a thin premise: Is he or not gay? They meat it out to involve the community's response to the answer. Finally, when Howard admits he is gay, the filmmakers use the rest of the films to show how a conservative, Norman Rockwell-like city can accept him despite his difference. <br /> <br /> The most shocking scenes in "In & Out" are probably when tabloid reporter Malloy makes a lip lock on Howard. Just guys kissing each other in a movie about a gay identity crisis is as fun as they are fake. Kline and Selleck put their faces together in what appears to be more of a main collision than a closed mouth. Nothing like the controversial 1994 British film "Priest", "In & Out" appears as an engaging, but working on social propaganda with its okay-to-be-act message. If "Ellen" was not the TV equivalent, "In & Out" would probably be heading for television as a new sitcom. Seeing "In & Out" is not so much about dealing with the issue of gay or straight, but how to be a decent person in the last days of the 20th century. What makes "In & Out" a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is its equal opportunities bowl and jeers of queers and steers.
