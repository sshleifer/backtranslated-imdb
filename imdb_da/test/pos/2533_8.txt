When released in the early 80s, Pixote brings Brazilian society's problems with young criminals and its implications in Brazilian society. I can't see the movie at that time because I was too young, but now I got a chance and looked at it a few days ago. It's a very brutal movie, but everything is absolutely true and sad. pixote is the name of a 12 year old boy living in the streets and surviving with misdemeanors; He remains for a moment in a detention center, and as he left, he continues to plan robbery with other buns and a prostitute, played by Marilia Pera. The boy is still a marijuana dependent and smells glue with other teenagers to forget his sad reality. The quality of the pictures is not the best, but the film is completely realistic about Brazilian problems and must be seen and admired.
