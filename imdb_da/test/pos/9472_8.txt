I saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and was simply happy. <br /> <br /> I saw a review saying something that the reviewer thought it would be just another teen movie, but then found it was based on Shakespeare's twelfth night ... and then began to try to justify to like this flick on Shakespeare grounds. I really think this goes way overboard: the only connections I could see with twelfth night are (a) the basic objection of a girl who masks like a man; (b) the comprehensive male female humor derived from this fundamental objection and (c) some names (including violin and duke). <br /> <br /> Apart from these names, the thematic commonalties (a & b) are really good themes for a script and this movie is the no-exception script. Besides that, this really is a simple lovely and very modern / traditional teenage girl. And it's a completely legitimate genre, though highbrows have to find an excuse to like it ... like highlighting Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The movie is light, fast, emotional, stylized, fun ... full of teen hormones and teen humor and man / woman humor suitable for all ages. And that's really the best part IMHO: Really almost every male stereotype, and every female stereotype is depicted in a meticulously appealing over-the-top fun. These stereotypes are parodyed mercilessly but lovingly, with such an inventive complexity that I am still a little confused ... but really do not feel disappointed in that respect, it is not such a movie: things come to you quickly and fun, and you get a laugh and a moan and then move on to the next split-second event. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is really just lovely like Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful duke; David Cross makes it wonderful over the top Principal Gold. All plays and characterizations were fine and targeted. Cinematography was excellent. <br /> <br /> Fantastic entertainment from start to finish ... check it out!
