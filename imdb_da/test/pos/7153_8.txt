It is always a pleasure to see characters in a movie that is completely kind hearted and well-meaning, even when surrounded by those who are neither. The movie's moderately stupid premise is that the conservative, religious Franklin family (mother, father, teens and girl) are involved in an accident where the parents and brother have a near death experience where they meet Jesus, a pleasant but slightly enchanted soul that removes their burden on "original sin". When they return to their lives, many of their views and attitudes have changed a lot to the daughter's confusion that didn't share the experience. The religious side is, in my opinion, presented with a good balance, from the good (Jesus) to the very dreadful (those of its "followers" who are obsessed with other people's sins and totally ignorant of their own). It's a movie that makes you think, give you a couple of good laughs along the way and leave you with the pleasant feeling that the world can just be a nicer place than you think it is.
