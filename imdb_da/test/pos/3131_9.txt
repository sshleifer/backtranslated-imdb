It has been discovered that John Ford made the "big" blockbuster movies so he could afford to make the "little" movies he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best if not the best of his little movies. The location, the wagons, the intricate work of horses and the inclusion of the plains of Indian are all trademarks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great Russian director's influence in this film is seen. The support model, including Ward Bond, Russell Simpson and Jane Darwell, is excellent as well as the many minor character actors Ford used, including his brother (the drummer). While Ben Johnson continued to win a well-earned supportive Oscar for The Last Picture Show, his co-star, Harry Carey, Jr. did not reach these heights. Although his father, Carey, Sr. became a Western leader in Ford's early films, Carey, Jr. most of his career in supporting roles. For fans of John Ford, and for fans of Western movies, this is a must.
