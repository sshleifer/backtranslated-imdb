Dracula (John Carradine) visits Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), who believes that everything can be cured by science. He wants Edelamn to heal his vampireism - Edelman agrees. Then Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) pops up and seeks a cure to become a werewolf. Thr Frankenstein monster is also discovered, but does nothing. <br /> <br /> Very ambitious plot for a universal horror movie from the 1940s. Attempting to cure monsters of science is actually an interesting idea. Also this movie has beautiful sets (LOVE castle for the doctor lives in), tons of atmosphere, is very well-decorated (great use of shadows) and has pretty good special effects. The play is all good except Carradine - he tries, but I could never accept him as Dracula. Lionel Atwill also pops in to play (as always) the chief of police. This is pretty much forgotten and foggy as a silly movie, but I think it's very good. It is also the last time that the universal monsters were made seriously - the next film was in 1948 in "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein". It's a great movie, but the accent is more on comedy. The only real mistake here is that there is a lot of plot in 67 minutes and some gaps in the logic: Why is Dracula trying to bite lovely Miliza (Martha O'Driscoll) when he gets healed? And why (and how) does Doctor Frankenstin get into his castle? Still, these are small complaints. Recommended.
