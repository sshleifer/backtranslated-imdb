Maybe once in a generation a movie comes together that is perfection. For me, "The Railway Children" is the movie - a timeless classic that was instructed and performed most beautifully. It depicts all that is worth in humanity and climax in the conquest of love and belief in cruel injustice. Every performance is a gem, though Bobbie stands out, and as Judy Garland as Dorothy for her, Jenny Agutter makes it impossible for us to imagine others in the role. The world is the better for this movie and today's children would be much better at seeing it. Of course, like many young men in my generation, I fell in love with Jenny Agutter hopefully, and her team was so strong when I had the great happiness of meeting her a few days ago - was the enchanting smile and voice like dripping honey there to send me weak on the knees, as they first did years ago!
