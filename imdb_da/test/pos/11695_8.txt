Crackerjack is a hit and miss movie set in the Australian suburb lawn forest club Cityside. Mick Molloy plays a scammer who has scored free parking spaces at Cityside. When the club is under pressure to install poker machines on their premises, they must raise $ 8,000 to prevent this. The club needs new members to help, and this is where Mick Molly's character comes in and has to bowl to save the club. With many up and coming and aging Australian actors Crackerjack is a hidden gem. Be warned, though most jokes are for those with knowledge of lawn bowls, but there are many entertaining synagogues that give comic relief. Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy co-star. Generally, the movie is recommended for people who play lawns or have played, but there is plenty of other material in there for an entertaining game if you have a little understanding. If you enjoy Australian humor, suggest that you get bowling white and go out to the theater because this is the year's premier lawn comedy (also the only one).
