"It's fun, your worst nightmare always works so far away!" <br /> <br /> Dark Habours, a married couple (Alan Rickman & Polly Hunter) and a vagabond (Norman Reedus) slip into a game of hidden sexual energy and treason. Occasionally tantalizing breaks increase tension and provide much room for interpretation. Good play and a story that, if you don't use the brain, will leave you in confusion. You must see it at least twice. The very strength lies in its unconventional character and in Alan Rickman, of course. Those who love him will love this movie. Conclusion: It's not a typical first class movie, but well done!
