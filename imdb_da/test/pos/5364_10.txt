An excellent movie for those who just want to turn off and enjoy Scotland's beautiful landscape. In fact, the film takes you on a journey of love in the midst of spectacular surroundings. The cast is 'dressed' for the parts they play, so no glamorous costumes or coiffured hair in this movie, where plays are amazing, gritty and down to earth. Each character is credible and gives a convincing portrayal of the life, faith and culture of Time One destined for those who themselves have the smallest drop of Scottish blood ..... as it will draw on the heartbeat and touch the soul. Something that can be shared with the family and looked at time and time again .................. a real classic, one that I am sure will go along with some of the big ones movies that never die.
