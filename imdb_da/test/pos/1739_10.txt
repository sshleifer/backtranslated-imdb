I remember being so excited on Saturday night when I was a kid, waiting for Dr. Who. I thought it was the best show ever made. Then I grew up, Dr. Who went out of the air and no one I knew had ever heard of it. Then I found out that there was a new series. I was a little nervous about it. Was it up to the expectations I had worn around when I was a kid? Would they screw it up? Wanted Dr. suck? Would his assistant suck? Would they create a more intimate relationship with Dr. and his assistant? Yes, no, no, no, no !!! This show is wonderful !! I love the new Dr. I love his assistant. I love the show. And I'm excited about the Friday night and waiting for the "new" episode. Right now I see 2005 episodes that I live in the states, so I'm a little behind the rest of you. I hope the next Dr. is as great as this one!
