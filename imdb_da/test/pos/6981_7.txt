Reasonably effective horror / science fiction la "Alien" is quite well done considering its limited ambitions. Some fine special effects and successful action sequences put sufficient patch in the rather tired dialogue. When a spacecraft crash lands on a remote plane, the survivors soon become aware that a horrible terror awaits them in the dark of the coming total eclipse.
