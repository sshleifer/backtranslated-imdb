I absolutely love this movie about a lady columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) for a great homemaking magazine that delivers an inviting article every month that details the amazing home life of a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home. The problem happens when the owner of her monthly publication requires her to have him and a WW2 hero as guests during the Christmas holidays. Why is she worried? Because she lives in a small New York apartment, isn't married and doesn't have a baby - and can't cook at all! Hilarity (and romance) comes along as she tries to put a credible action in an attempt to save face / stay away from being fired by the leaf owner (played by Sydney Greenstreet). This is a nice comedy; one that I highly recommend for classic movie lovers !!!!
