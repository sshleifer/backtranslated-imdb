Nemesis Game is a thought-provoking movie filled with puzzles, death, mystery and philosophy. In the simplest sense, the movie is about seeking answers, and what happens when you finally find them all. The search for answers leads Sarah Novak down a path that gets darker as it becomes more convincing. The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth, but Sarah is so close to understanding it all. What would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life? <br /> <br /> The film was written and directed by Jesse Warn. Although this was Warn's first feature length movie, the film does not reflect it at all, but instead shows Polish and an artistic approach to telling the story. Carly Pope starred and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to see. I would absolutely love to see more of her work. <br /> <br /> Being based on puzzles, this is a very cerebral movie. These are your things as it is mine, so I totally recommend seeing the Nemesis Game. Rating: 4.5 / 5
