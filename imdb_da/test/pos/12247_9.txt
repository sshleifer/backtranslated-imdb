I'm typically a comedy guy. I rented this in the video store during comedy and thought "Albert Brooks! Awesome!" and rented it. It looked like the romantic comedy, and I remembered that I hated them and had the full mindset of hating this movie. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong. <br /> <br /> While this is a romantic comedy, it is traded by a fantastic lead & support cast (Brooks, Hunter, Cusack and Nicholson), and everything works well in itself. The script sounds right and not forced, so it can happen in the news station you see at night. It takes your feelings and makes you enjoy Hunter and Brooks and scare Hurt, making the end a little unkind and fruitless, but it shows how you don't need a happy end to finish a movie you just need a truthful ending, which is what everyone got. Not everyone's life ends well and it shows in Broadcast News. Maybe people don't like the end because it's not your typical happy ending in romantic comedies ... but it works, it's right, and it's genius. Broadcast News is a classic of its time, and a nice romance movie up there with "Casablanca". Well, maybe not so loud, but that's the only other romance I can think of that I like. <br /> <br /> Broadcast News: 9/10.
