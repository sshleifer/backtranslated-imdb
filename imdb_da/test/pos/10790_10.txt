Never having seen an Oliver Stone movie before, or any movie with Eric Bogosian, I didn't know what to expect from this movie. After playing with the idea of ​​buying it for a while, I finally got it free as a supplement to a Sunday newspaper, and I was very impressed. It tells the story of Barry Champlain, a talk radio host who can be incredibly rude to his callers, and often puts them in their place before they can understand what is happening. Although this has made him a popular radio program, it has also earned him many enemies. The action in this movie was hugely impressive with not a dud actress in it. Eric Bogosian is brilliant as Barry Champlain, the troubled talk radio hosted by Alec Baldwin, who is a strong performance as Barry's boss, Dan. It also includes the voice and cameo appearance of Michael Wincott (my reason for wanting to see this). The story was very well written as despite its arrogance, you feel like Barry is more about his troubled life being revealed, and you see how vulnerable he really is. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone, as it is captivating and, more importantly, real on many levels, two of which are inspired by the life of an actual speech radio host and the fact that you are clean actually get radio program hosts and calls like those shown in the movie in reality. High recommendation and 10/10. <br /> <br /> Your Aye, Cat Squire
