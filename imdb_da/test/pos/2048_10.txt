When this movie came out, I had seen Geena Davis only play soft, feminine roles ... This film was anything but soft and feminine. Big lines, good action ... she and Samuel L really clicked. Too violent for the kittens, but if you and your significant other are trying to agree on a movie, try this for size. Go Geena! Go Geena!
