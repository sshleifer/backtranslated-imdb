Perhaps one of the first slasher movies that came out after Halloween (although made by Irwin Yabalans from Halloween), I must say I honestly found the "Tourist Trap" to be scary and funnels. The "Tourist Trap" is one of the remarkable treats you find every now and then and is back with the most pleasant sense of surprise. It was fate I was telling you, but one night I was with my local blockbuster (one or two months before it went out of service) and had nothing to do. Then I stumble over this movie, I think she seems like a ridiculous B movie, I rent it and took it home, boy was I in favor of a good scare. The "Tourist Trap" comes out as a bad movie, it certainly has cheesy moments, but in the end you have a lot of fun with it really. <br /> <br /> The things that impressed me the most and the things that made this movie one of the most scary I have seen are the number one option. A horror movie without a good attitude is not that fun, not here. I just love love love the location, it feels like we can relate to it, it almost feels like we have been there before. Which makes it creepier. Next are the characters, not of them are really stereotypical, and they all have a genuine personality. For example, they are not stoners, alcoholics or even sexually occupied people, they feel like normal young adults. Plus they look realistic enough, and then their Chuck Connors. Who gives a good performance like Mr Slausen who we all have an instant taste for, because again he is so real, he feels like the lovely guy, grandfatherly figure we love. The last and probably most important thing that makes this movie scary is how they get us (the audience) jumping halfway out of our seats and beating the rights for the right reasons. For example, most of the time in horror movies we jump mainly due to a sudden change in the music track, but in the "Tourist Trap" you prepare yourself, this is not the case. With it's perfect use of lighting, mannequins and weirdness you feel completely spoiled. Plus I love because even though they might be a little over-the-top with some things, you still feel that this could happen. That's exactly what a horror movie that takes such a ridiculous premise should do, and that makes us (the audience) insecure and frightened. <br /> <br /> Generally, as far as major issues go, I have none, only that it is odd may be a little too odd at times. But in the end, "Tourist Trap" has a place near and dear to my heart, to be one of the few horror films that make me turn on the lights and feel unsure about traveling.
