I'm from Ireland and I thought this movie had the odd minute or two, where accents were a bit off but no worse than any Brad Pitt or other American who did accent. In addition, I have rarely seen any British actor dealing with an American or Canadian accent except Colin Farrel in the Minority Report. This movie is a small movie and it was entertaining. No, it wasn't a Blockbuster Hollywood production, but honestly I'm sick of that kind. I laughed more than a couple of times and had a good time. It was definitely worth renting. The protagonist is a spear on other hard British gangsters. At least that was the way I saw it. If you go in expecting a $ 100 million production, you will be disappointed. Enjoy it for what it is - a small entertaining movie.
