Best Cinematography I've ever seen ?? Considering the year the movie was made, I was totally amazed and thoroughly impressed by the amount of attention dedicated to the scenes and with what appears to be authenticity. Although I am not particularly a Western movie buffer, every scene is given the utmost detail and it is scary. There is a sincere connection with nature. At times I am overwhelmed by the amount of actions that go through the scenes, but I never get bored. I feel like I'm really peering into a time machine and looking back into the old west. I recommend this movie to anyone studying set design, location planning, and for that matter photography in general. It may be a humble movie to experience with the pictures given this age of digital touch-up that we are now experiencing.
