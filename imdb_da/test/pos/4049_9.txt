This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna and Priss are all back as knights in their hard suits fighting with the robot bombs. The animation is sharp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in his regular job, so the series also contains some amazing songs. There is a lot of violence, but most are against robots and there is some fan service, but nothing too nice. The DVDs also have many extras, including comments that really enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the show. A necessity for any anime fan. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: Burst Angel, Armitage III
