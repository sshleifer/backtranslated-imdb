The first in a new style with films for Lamas - no tattoos, motorcycles or karate. I miss them for one. But it's a serious movie. He plays an FBI profile that has lived so long with the evil heads that he no longer trust anyone, including himself. Gary Busey is either a great actor or someone I don't want to meet in broad daylight on a crowded street. Kristen Cloke pursues Lamas as doggedly as she pursues the serial killer. There is a surprise after another, as the story unfolds, not least the end is the end. It never seems to come - there is always a layer for the story. Cloke and Lama's starts as the good people, become the evil ones and somehow end up bright. But it is definitely worth the rental price. For maximum enjoyment throw in a candy bar, a bag of popcorn and a soda. You're going to the movies!
