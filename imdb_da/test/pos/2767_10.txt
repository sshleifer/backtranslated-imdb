This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel, when I was a little younger, and I really remember to like it. However, I did not have good taste back then (not to say I do it now), so I cannot reimburse my nine-year-old myself for good. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had a good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, well worth a look. I know some fans of this movie are wondering what a particular song is - the one that appears when she is in the car accident. The song is "Play a Love Song" by the Jaguar, and it is very difficult to find and achieve. In fact, this movie is too. I can't find it anywhere online or on DVD or on VHS. I'd like to see it again so I can measure whether it was actually a good movie. Oh good.
