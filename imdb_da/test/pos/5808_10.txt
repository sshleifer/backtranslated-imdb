This is a spectacular production! I've seen the show twice in Chicago, and my only problem with the production was that I could only see fragments of what was happening. The scene consisted of three giant catwalks and the platform, and as the action moves from one part of the stage to the next, you lose track of what's going on wherever you are. As always, this is a thought-provoking sensory overload, skillfully captured in high definition with 15 cameras! The recordings were masterfully edited, one of the best concert DVDs of all time in my opinion! I just hope and want them to release this on Blu-Ray HD DVD so we can live this extravaganza over and over again.
