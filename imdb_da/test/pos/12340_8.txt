ONE DARK NIGHT is a much-overlooked and little-known movie from the early 80's that deserves an audience that I fear it will never get, and it is a shame. I have seen this movie compared to others who have a bigger name over the years, especially PHANTASM, HELL NIGHT and MAUSOLEUM. This is a very different movie than them, and I do not see any comparisons other than the mausoleum, which is a bit similar to that of PHANTASM, but not enough to make any real comparisons. I'm not sure how this slides through without a wider acceptance. Maybe it's all in marketing, I don't know. Perhaps a remake would revitalize it, unless Raymar drained his life out of what it is. I'm not too big on all the remakes that are abundant these days, but I think they work well with lesser-known movies (except for the horrible GHOST SHIP remake which, besides the opening scene and Mudvayne's Not Falling blaring was complete shit). So if a remake of ONE DARK NIGHT would happen in the right hands, I think it would make many people go and see the original. I know that's what I do if there's a remake of a movie I haven't seen before. So anything but a remake, I fear, wouldn't bring this movie back to life. Unless of course Raymar got his eyes on it. Anyways, ONE DARK NIGHT is a must see for horror fans, especially 80's horror fans (because we all know it was when the best horror movies were made). Creepy setting. Very good play. Very good story. Campy. What's more, from an early 80's horror movie? What is it ... nudity and doing? Oh, sorry. No nudity or doing in this movie, but it's still great anyway! A solid 8 out of 10. Enjoy.
