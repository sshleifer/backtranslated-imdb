This is a clever and entertaining movie about the backlash that continued to pick a sequel to Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show. However, the film's ultimate treatise is that David Letterman's superior comedian talents were overlooked for his controversial character, and the show diminished by a subordinate Jay Leno's interference in the premier television comedy program is simply untrue as anyone who has seen both Leno and Letterman perform can see for themselves. The hard and simple truth is exactly like an NBC exec in the movie "Jay Leno is the funniest man in America." And David Letterman is not. When you realize this, much of the machinations in the movie become irrelevant. Ultimately, the whole movie is more than sour grapes by Letterman fans who just can't accept that the better cartoon was chosen by people whose business it is to know these kinds of things. The final proof is that Leno's show, despite Letterman's early lead, possibly due to the hype that arose from the battle for the Tonight Show sequel, has proved to be more popular, and therefore at least in my thoughts that rejects Letterman's allegations of being unfairly robbed of his legitimate heritage.
