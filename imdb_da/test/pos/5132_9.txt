Hoot was amazing. The owls are cute, and the film highlights an interesting environmental problem that I didn't know existed. Florida is full of so many fun characters, and the movie does a great job of bringing it to the screen. My kids especially loved all the different animals, from snakes to owls to alligators. It is really a simple story, but also one that they need to hear at this age. When the kids are young when they really develop their valuation, and yes, one of them must take care of our environment and all the creatures that live in it. I think it was good that the movie itself triggered a conversation with them on the trip home about animals and how to help them. It was just really sweet and lasting to hear my little girl talk about how she would save the baby birds. Anyway, generally it was really a good time and I would recommend the movie to anyone looking for something entertaining and meaningful.
