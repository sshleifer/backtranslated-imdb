When I watched the trailer for this movie, I said loudly to no one especially "this movie will bomb." I also said about MATRIX and look at what happened there. Now I'm not a box office guru on any stretch, but I usually have a pretty good gut about what needs to be good and what really needs to be sucked. In this case, I was dazzled by my complete and complete apathy to David Duchovney. Let me tell you this in another way: I do not like his as a person (from what I have read by him in interviews, he is incredibly pre-madonna like and he is full of himself considering everything has done is X-Files) or as an actor. GAME GOD was a really bad movie, but he came out and thought that for some reason he deserved big money on the big screen. But I am happy to say that although these things can still be true about the man, Return To Me is lovely and has the heart in the right place. Bonnie Hunt has directed a beautiful story and she has told it with class and grace. This is one of the most romantic movies I've seen, and although it may seem a bit sad and maudlin in its premise, give it a try and you'll join. It must be said (and it makes me bad to do so) that the reason why this movie works so well is because of the story and the cast. Duchovney and Driver are so wonderful and trustworthy here that I honestly would cry with them. There is a particularly powerful scene when Duchovney comes home after his wife is dead, and he slumberes on the floor of his house. As always, the family dog ​​looks out to the door to wait for his wife to enter. She does not say that he does not come home with him, never with his shirt collar still colored with blood, and Rob (Duchovney) tells him. He then calls the dog over to him and they seem to share a cry together. The dog leaves a little groan and then Rob cries. And this is one of the most realistic moments of pain I've ever seen in any character in any movie. You can feel his pain and at that moment I forgot that I was watching an actor I generally dislike, and I felt I was watching someone I knew warned his loved one. These are powerful things. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the movie is the supportive cast. Bonnie Hunt has combined an ethnic melting pot of Irish and Italian signs sharing a common bond. They share a pub called O'Reilley's Italian Pub. It's a nice name all alone. And on the diametric scale of adjoining cultures are Carol O'Connor and Robert Loggia. There are two proud old men who love their homeland, but love their grandchildren and niece (respectively I think it is). And that's the character played by Minnie Driver. This scenario is ripe for comedy, and Hunt doesn't miss anything here. Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi also share some fun moments as middle-aged married couples and Belushi get top marks as he accepts humility gracefully and shows off his abundant keg of a stomach for laughs. With his family of three or four children, there is very little time for him and his wife to have quality time. And again Hunt handles this with perfect elegance. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful story of finding true love, knowing how lucky you are to have true love and the power of friendship and family. Back to me is a wonderful romance, and although I still don't have a great admiration for David Duchovney, I must admit that he was perfect in this role and I couldn't see anyone else playing his character. He was sensitive and trustworthy, and the movie was good because of him, not just because of him, but he was sure to add to the taste. <br /> <br /> If you are a sucker for a good romance and you want a good cry, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10 I want to see something that Bonnie Hunt puts out with her in the director's chair.
