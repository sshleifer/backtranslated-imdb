Michael Jackson is the greatest singer and dancer ever to live, and this movie proves it. It is brilliant to see and the dance is amazing. When Michael becomes a werewolf is a bit of a part on the edge of your seat the first time you see it. and vincent price rap adds fear when all the zombies rise from their graves. if you like this then i suggest you buy 'making michael jackson's thriller' which has the movie then do it after that. The presentation shows an incredible performance of 'Billie Jean' by Michael, which is when he first made the television moonlight. see it.
