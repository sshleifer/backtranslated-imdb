Authors and directors, according to the nature of their craft, are left behind a frame of action in their work to show insight into signs and situations. Here Huston and Joyce have drawn a bigger frame yet to show us the ultimate view of what it means to be human. Until it is completely over, the film seems to be almost nothing, the kind of typical circumstances that fill everyday life. It is only at the end of the final scene that we realize that it is actually about everything. It is not possible to see this last scene without the simultaneous feeling of compassion and also deep love for oneself and the rest of fellow human beings.
