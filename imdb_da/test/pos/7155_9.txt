In this story of a heavily wounded Christian family, having three of its four members "born again" after a cake-caused car accident, what really stands out is how much it is where there is so much potential to go over the top and how truly inspired most of the actor is. Where most of the movie's moments, especially its honest and "innocent" discussions on sexuality after three of the four family members have their guilt and shame removed, are fun, it's also thought-provoking and the characters remain with you. <Br /> <br /> How often does a character in a comedy go e.g. from the nearest caricature to the rich emotional being during a scene? How often do we see a throw that can retreat from the showboating mid-sentence to show a bit of humanity under the character's skin? Even many of the "evil" in this movie have moments of heartbreaking honesty, though much of what they do can be ridiculous and horrible. There is truth and history behind even the most dubious actions in this movie, which is a difficult task in satire. How refreshing it is to see a darkish comedy that can dare to be humanistic. How nice to see the actors so fully engaged in character that they can dare them to be ridiculous and sublime. And as a gay person, I don't think I've ever been so touched by a heterosexual sex scene as I was at the first sexual encounter between parents of this family after their accident. <br /> <br /> Bravo. Bravo. One of my favorites at Outfest this year.
