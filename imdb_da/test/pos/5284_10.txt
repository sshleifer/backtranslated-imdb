Ponyo, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is a small tale that speaks of respect for the sea, respect for people young and old, and respect for cultural differences. It's a new story about a little goldfish who wants to be a girl, rather than a story about Disney's little mermaid. Miyazaki has animated with the hand, a whimsical, magical movie for the young and the young at heart. The film begins with a slowly rolling blue-green palette of sea anemones, jellyfish and scores of little imaginative goldfish with childish faces. There is no need for narration, the movement of creatures and the music of Jo Hisaiahi tells the beginning. Released last summer in Japan, Ponyo won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Animation Film and Best Score (Jezebel.com). The imaginative little goldfish, Brunhild, leaves his sea home on a jellyfish. After reaching the surface she is caught in a fishing net filled with other fish, waste and sludge. She is driven to a jar rolled to land where the five-year-old Sosuke (voice of Frankie Jonas) fetches it. He cuts his hand when he breaks the jar open to release the little goldfish. Brunhild tastes his blood, which heals Sosuke's cut and sets his transformation into a human being, while throwing nature out of balance. Sosuke puts the little goldfish in a green bucket and names her Ponyo (Noah Cyrus), which means soft and jelly like. Sosuke's mother, Lisa (Tina Fey), lets him take Ponyo to school, which is right next to the nursing home where she works. Lisa loves to drive down the picturesque winding road past a dry dock, through the busy fishing village, and up a tree-lined road to the nursing home is representative of Miyazaki's wonderful action and perfectly illustrates a parent's hectic morning. Miyazaki has created another strong, independent, female character in Lisa. Make her a loving, sensible, modern mother to both Sosuke and Ponyo. Lisa's phone call with the non-coming home-again man, Kiochi (Matt Damon) because the ship he captains must make another race is a typical wife's reaction. Later that evening, Sosuke intervenes with a signal light to talk to his father as the ship passes the cliff that their house sits on. Lisa refuses to acknowledge Kiochi's excuse and jumps up and signals "Bug-off, Bug-off, Bug-off", it's a fun scene. But when Sosuke takes the signal light and tells her father, "Good luck, loves you," Lisa hugs him and tells him he has a good heart, it's a very exciting scene. <br /> <br /> My personal favorites Miyazaki are older, grandmother in wheelchairs at the nursing home, Yochi (Betty White), Noriko (Cloris Leachman) and Toki (Lily Tomlin). Their exchange over Sosuke's little goldfish is wonderful and reminiscent of the bitterness of the witch's witch (Lauren Bacall) and Sophie (Jean Simmons) as they pull up a long staircase in Howl's Moving Castle. Ponyo's magical sea godfather, Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), similar to Howl's guide, will take Ponyo back to his ocean home. Fujimoto uses one of his elixirs to try to balance nature, but the magic little Ponyo once again escapes the elixir of the process and causes a tsunami. Riding on the back of giant dolphins to get to Sosuke, reminds the little girl, the little girl audience of the stubborn, adventurous little Mei in My neighbor Totoro. Ponyo is just as adventurous and curious as Mei. When Fujimoto realizes what Ponyo has done, he calls on Gran Mamare (Kate Blanchett), the goddess of the sea, to help with the situation. This clever, calming goddess comes in a blue liquid garment that never ends. She has a private talk with Lisa about discussing the future of the young children, which helps the audience understand Sosuke and Ponyo's relationship is not for lovers, but for brother and sister. The vital stylish ending is typical of Miyazaki movies that leave the audience full of hope.
