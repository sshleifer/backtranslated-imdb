An absolute classic of the 80's scare flix. This one is not like any other as it pints pint-sized, wild-eyed, psychotic youths with an urge to kill against all the adults in the city. Bud from just one of the guys (80's gold again) plays one of the killers and he is mated with one of the little girls Jake Blues is trying to buy in BLUES BROTHERS. There is a third blond boy, but he stays away from the movie for whatever reason. The violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly cruel in spots. The demonic gang of smiling children, who somehow possess extra-planetary means, bears little resemblance to the dead children they condemned who never thought to use pistols, bullets and shovels to kill the annoying adults. Julie Brown (not Downtown Julie Brown-the other) shows her rack as three times as she dances around the bedroom. This movie is a rarity that I can't believe I missed growing up in the 80s. This would have been my absolute favorite movie as a kid if I had seen it. Where is the sequel, what the end asks? This movie is just incredible. Seek it out at any cost.
