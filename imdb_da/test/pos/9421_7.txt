Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, the second of the Universal series, where it is again established by a written prologue that the famous detective is legendary and spans time. This helps set things up well here in the "current" era of the early 1940s. In this offer, Holmes goes through a couple of different disguises (with Rathbone's very prominent feature, it is likely that people really would not recognize his true identity?) As he protects a physicist from the Nazi hands as well as from Holmes's greatest nemesis professor Moriarty (now played by Lionel Atwill). The scientist has developed a bomb vision that will provide great help to air bombardment, and he has promised his plans for the British. But Moriarty wants to get it so he can sell them to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> A good post enhanced a bit by joining the real crooked Atwill now thrown as Moriarty (although George Zucco wasn't beaten himself in the adventures of Sherlock Holm). It is always exciting to see Holmes and his biggest enemy engage in witty scratches together ("the needle at last, eh, Holmes?").
