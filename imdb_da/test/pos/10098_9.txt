This film certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of scare but not for obvious reasons. The fear of "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is not in sudden shock or great helper of CGI gut and gore; It is a psychological horror movie that points to the viewer's curiosity from the start and builds an exciting aura of mystery and questions throughout. Best of all, the end does not provide a clear answer, and pushes the viewer to analyze what they have seen and make their own mind about what really happened. <br /> <br /> Don't be put off by the seemingly slow pace at which the movie begins and don't expect to jump out of your seat right away. This is not the conventional hack-and-slash movie with orchestral stings designed to make you afraid of nothing in particular. "A Tale Of Two Sisters" slowly builds up an atmosphere of terror, an unknown terror and a fear of things that avoid explanation to the end. Even when the final conclusion is revealed, it is not so heavy-handed and obvious that the whole movie falls in place. The film requires the viewer to reflect on what they have seen, and to squeeze this with the frightening revelation of the final scene. Some things will still be open to interpretation, and this is one of the joys of watching a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The real fear of "A Speech Of Two Sisters" is not in shock or eye-catching; It is a psychological, gut-wrenching horror that challenges the convention and expands a genre to proportions so far unexplored by the traditional horror movie. It is no exaggeration to say that this film is separate from the so-called 'Asian Horror' genre. It would actually be a mistake to adjust "A Tale Of Two Sisters" with movies like "Ringu" and "The Grudge". This film can be understood from a variety of standpoints, some requiring no suspension of credibility, others caring for the supernatural wholeheartedly. Whether you choose to interpret this movie is one that requires an open minded approach, rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions of Asian cinema or horror in general.
