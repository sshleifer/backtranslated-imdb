This movie received less attention than "their own body", possibly because it only has a "name" star. But while women's professional baseball only had an eight-year, Midwestern town existence, Japanese baseball is a much larger entity, both in financial insurance and popular support. That alone would make it the better movie. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Baseball" shows the facts of the Japan ball's life: the regimented cheering, respect for judges, pressure from business owners on leaders, extreme conservatism in the game - and no hot dog players welcome. <br /> <br /> It also affects the isolation that any gai-jin - but especially an American jock, not the people most famous in foreign cultures - feel in Dai Nippon. And the Japanese are, for their part, not comfortable about foreigners and let it turn out in different ways (the "gai-jin strike area", an American player complaint, "greater than a Buick.") <br /> <br /> The script has may not win any prizes and play again on the theme of "redemption by improved game", but I found it considerably more fun to see than pokey "League". Definitely recommended for those who want to see a different angle on this great sport.
