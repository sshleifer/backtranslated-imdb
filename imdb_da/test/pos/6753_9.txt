I agree with most of Mr Rivera's comments and I just want to say a few reservations. This movie, "The Mascot" is criminally neglected in its present form. For that matter, it is also "Vampire". "The Mascot" is not a "bonus feature" - it is tackled as a chapter in "Vampire". Although it is very clear that this is a separate film, it should have been treated as such by the producers. And while I'm in it, "Vampire" needs some of the same respect and tidiness too. I have the feeling that the decision to put The Mascot on there went something like this. <br /> <br /> Dude A: "We just transferred Vampire to DVD, but it comes up to about 20 minutes short. We need to put something that doesn't cost much money. talk about movies! "Dude B:" Don't worry. I have this little animation thingy that's been in my drawer. Just go ahead and throw it as an extra chapter. "Dude A:" You're great, Dude B. "The Mascot's animation is great and I don't have to repeat what Mr. Rivera has done so well. This thing, however, needs a lot of greater cleaning and recovery, especially the sound. The plot comes through in the dialogue. And in my copy there were so many withdrawals, pops, and places where the sound just fell out (I wouldn't have known what the dog was after without reading the box). No volume would make the words more understandable, it just brought tinniness and made hoops and pops higher. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: Starewicz's movies must be put in a respectful collection, cleaned up, spiked, liner notes, and the entire nine yards. In other words, they must be "Criterionized" 9 out of 10 for the movie, not the product that would get only a 5.
