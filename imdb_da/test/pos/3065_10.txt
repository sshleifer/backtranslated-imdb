Like all Mel Brooks' other comedies, men in pantyhose are funny. But by seeing this as a disgusting comedy, I think many fail to realize that the reason why the movie is so funny is that the characters themselves work so well. Elves is the well-known former British noble, Lewis is an eternally annoyed king (I hope it's worth every NUOOOOOIIIISE!), DeLuise is a great godfather, Roger Rees is a worried and cynical sheriff .... The actors and actors are so loyal to their parts, the jokes flow forward with ease. Yes, we have seen this kind of comedy before, but in my opinion the only comedy to achieve better character development is The Big Lebowski. Very much fun.
