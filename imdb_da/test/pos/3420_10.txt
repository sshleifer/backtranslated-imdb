What was the quote of Archbishop Tutu at the end of the movie of a person's past? this film was very disturbing to see in the sense that it was a true story and to believe that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed <br /> <br /> everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their lives in peace and harmony <br /> <br /> live and let live <br /> <br /> If anyone knows the quote, please let me know. <br /> <br /> This movie should appear much more publicly as true events as horrible as those shown in the movie should be known to everyone in the hope that things will change rather than later.
