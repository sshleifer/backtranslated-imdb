Sometimes it's hard to see movies with subtitles (in this case Danish), but it's worth watching. As history progresses, the idea of ​​choosing two sisters, taking care of their father, is questionable, but their society is different. Their choice leaves them alone until a French woman comes. There may be a question as to why the French woman came to their place of residence and it is never fully developed. The party that happens later due to unexpected funds from France is a source of extraordinary pleasure for everyone who is present and something they have not experienced before. It gives an appropriate thank you for the kindness given to the guest. Filmed with a dark aura and the display of poverty, it is a beautiful experience for the viewer.
