I want to see this since my French teacher recommends it to me over forty years ago. Perhaps the long wait was worth it as the Criterion Collection DVD restoration is impressive. In his disposition, this film follows the time-written script: A quartet of men diligently elaborates a difficult hoist of a bank vault, the hoist takes place, a small seemingly insignificant event leading to the ultimate death of all. Though the heist footage is transfixing, it seems pretty early and is not the core of the movie. This film differs from the typical heist movie by giving us insight into the characters' characters and their motivations - it plays as much as a drama as it makes a thriller. Relationships play a major role and a kidnapping is tackled and gives us two movies for the price of one. John Servais plays the idea man Tony le Stéphanois (always called "le Stéphanois") with such a world power that he could just have pulled out of a Camus novel. Tony has just recently been out of jail and resists resuming the crime's life until he has a very unpleasant interaction with his ex-lover (who has taken up with another man) where he punishes her immediately with a belt. Fortunately, the scene is out of the camera, but you won't forget it. After the novice event, when there is little hope of reviving this relationship, Tony meets with two of his old partners in crime Jo and Mario and decides to join them in a last major hoist. They use Cesar, an Italian safe cracker - played by director Dassin himself - and we're out for the horse. <br /> <br /> The heel goes without a hitch. But Cesar's femininity is a personality that turns out to be fatal to everyone concerned. But we can understand his attraction for the nightclub singer he has fallen for as there is a brilliant set piece where she performs a sexy and cinematically inspired nightclub act - it must be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir movie. <br /> It is early established that Tony has a close relationship with Jo and his family; Jo's son actually refers to him as an uncle. I think it is partly to help Jos's family that Tony agrees with the hoist. Final scenes where Tony rescues Jo's kidnapped son's life, partially resolves his more brutal and amoral actions. But only partially.
