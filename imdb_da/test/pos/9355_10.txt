Crossfire is a great film noir that is both a product of its time and a timeless classic. This movie achieves this by solving issues that have not come on the screen before its release in 1947, and being a high-quality movie that stays up to this day with a good script, great looks and amazing performances from its actors. The first American film that addresses the issue of anti-Semitism's head is Crossfire cemented in classical standing. Seen in post-Second World War America, a lurid develops whodunit after a Jewish man is found murdered. <br /> <br /> The story is amazing, its anti-hat theme is wrapped in a dark multi-war criminal, and alongside, the angle of anti-Semitism is also a great dialogue after World War II and themes. Unlike other mystery thrillers, the audience becomes aware of who the offender is almost immediately. However, the story of the film is still exciting because of the struggle for all the big characters involved while trying to make sense of the situation. Outside the great overall story and themes, the entire script is simply clever, complete with meaningful messages and razor-sharp exchanges between characters. <br /> <br /> The film's captivating story is wonderfully played out of its excellent cast. Robert Young is amazing as Capt. Finlay, the leading investigator of the murder. Finlay is my favorite character in the movie, he is just a cool character - dare as bone and tough as a two-four and stop nothing to bring the killer to court. Robert Mitchum is also great in the movie, very alive in his softly spoken army sergeant character because of his amazing screen presence. Gloria Grahame gives a memorable performance in her little Oscar nominated role; George Cooper also does a good job as the sick and distressed Corporal Mitchell; Paul Kelly gives a frightening portrayal of a bizarre character; and Steve Brodie, Sam Levene, Jacqueline White and William Phipps also provide strong supportive notions. Robert Ryan ends up being the most talked about filmmaker, giving a chilling performance like Montgomery and also nominated for an Oscar. Crossfire has a fantastic look. Director Edward Dmytryk does an extraordinary job with the film's performance and film photographer J. Roy Hunt makes a masterful job with his black and white image. Crossfire's image is so dark and dank as its themes, covered in shade with an almost glossy overtone, but also very raw in parts. Ironically, the film's beautiful appearance was not the result of hard work - or even intent. My heart wanted to spend more time and money on the actors than the lighting - so that was what he did. Less light, less preparation (about 6 hours working day), and it resulted in a fantastic movie. Not only a well done piece of biographical art, Crossfire is also a good example of a cheap movie that ends with a rich classic.
