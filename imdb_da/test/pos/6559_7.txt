<br /> <br /> Horror movie time, Japanese style. Uzumaki / Spiral was a total freak party from start to finish. A fun freak party on it, but at times it was a bit too dependent on kitsch rather than horror. The story is hard to summarize briefly: a carefree, normal teenage girl starts to face face with extremely disturbing events, as the small town she lives in seems to come under the control of spirals. The spirals are everywhere, in the air, clouds, dirt and everyday objects. The spirals take control of people and bad things will happen to them. Oh, another thing people get random at snails. Why? Who knows or cares, people turn into snails, that's enough for me. It was not as scary as just insecure, as it does not have many tensions or crushing attacks that horror movies often do. Uzumaki prefers to crawl and crawl (like a snail perhaps!) Rather than pushing. A favorite scene: A woman is in a hospital room when this long, centipede centipede creates herself into the living room and slowly up the bedspread, over the sheets, over the pillow and into her sleeping ear. I curled and curled my toes. Uzumaki has a handful of scenes really violent, but it's also humorous. For example, a man possessed with spirals, he enters his washing machine because he sees a spiral in it, when it spins, he commits spiral word himself inside the washing machine. The last shot we see of him is with his body all flushed and rubber like a human flesh spiral with a gaze single eye that blinks in the midst of excitement. A bizarre picture. Uzumaki has a blatant psychodelic slope for what adds to its charm and fun. I love horror movies like this. It's not about killing, a la slasher movie, it's about an evil's power (the spirals!) That takes you and tries to kill you, forcing you to kill others. Movies like Uzumaki show that there are many ways to make a horror movie and thank goodness for it
