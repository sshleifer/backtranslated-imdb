Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and Jo McKenna (Doris Day) travel to Morocco for a vacation where they meet a mysterious man named Louis Bernard (Daniel GÃ©lin) on a bus. The next day, this man is murdered, but before he dies, Ben tells a secret; a murder will take place in London. The scouts kidnap the couple's son Hank (Christopher Olsen) and make sure Ben doesn't reveal their plan to anyone. Fredfred Hitchcock's men, who knew too much (1956), are a very intense thriller. is great as it always is in Hitchcock's movie. James Stewart is wonderful. Doris Day is a lovely person and actress, and she also shows her singing talent. The song Que Sera, Sera has an important role in the film. This movie is a movie of many classic scenes. In the last scenes in Albert Hall, without dialogue, you can hardly blink your eyes. This film is fifty years old. Time has not reduced its power in any way.
