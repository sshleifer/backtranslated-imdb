While both this movie and the signature billiard have been shown lack of respect from many critics, both are far above average. Roy Scheider does an excellent job with his best type; a hard, courageous policeman who works hard to get the job done despite the desk drivers and politicians who should support him rather than prevent. (He played a suburban version of the same role as the tourist town chief of police in Jaws. Not as ugly, but the same "get the job done despite the politicians" and the gutsy approach. If a man who can't swim and is scared of everything in the water, going out on an old boat with an Ahab wannabee and a geek, to confront a big killer shark, is not gutsy, so tell me what is ...). <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain; Most of the bad guys actually have a depth and complexity. This is one of the movies that gets better with repetitive views. Overall, the atmosphere in parts of NY City captures: gritty, unglamorous, often dangerous, but filled with energy. The story is extra, tight and subtle; It gets the job done without foreign elements. It may not be one of the all-time greats, but it's an exceptionally good movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has an opinion on car chases. Mine is that this is just up there with the Mustang vs Dodge Charger Hunt in Bullitt. Pontiac Ventura / Chevy Nova looked like Mustang in being a compact car chassis with a slit suspension and a powerful small block V8 filled in a motor boat intended for an insipid 6. Ventura / Novas got a little respect from the drag strip, but with the right suspension they opposed affordable performance cars that could handle both road and track. Bawling of these GM V8 is when they open up music to the enthusiast's ear. I have heard this hunt criticized for "imitating" the Bullitt hunt. The truth is, they are two works of the same master, Bill Hickman, who also choreographed and drove to the French Connection Chase. In addition to running most of the carage scenes, he created a brooding, malicious presence and a good fight with Richard Lynch as a couple of cold evil killers. <br /> <br /> Yes, chase has "realism error" often noted as the use of 3 different NY roads to represent the Palisades Parkway, the end of the hunt in a crash with an 18-wheel on a roadway to passenger vehicles and the miraculous timing that allows all pedestrians to escape injury. It's next to the point. Let's see it: movie bribes are "unreal" by nature. In Bullitt, The French Connection and The Seven Ups, Bill Hickman and Phillip D'Antoni created chases far more realistic and therefore more thrilling than the flying, rolling explosive vehicle fantasy hunting so commonly in recent films.
