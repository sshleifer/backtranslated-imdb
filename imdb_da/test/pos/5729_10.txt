Ladies and gentlemen: The show begins with this documentary. It is structured in three chapters, each chronologically arranged. The first presents the classic physics and links to Einstein. The other studies in depth quantum physics and enters String theory. The latter reveals the Alt theory ... The difficult concepts used here are introduced in a very simple way with daily objects; even if you have to believe in them without checking yourself - if you are not a scientist - (and even if you are a scientist !!). The film is not a masterpiece of its amazing technique or the way it is produced; what is really imported is the story and what a story !!!
