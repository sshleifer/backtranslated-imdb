I never dreamed when I started watching this DVD that I would be totally fascinated by it within minutes. The story was completely absorbing and entertaining. The action was excellent. The biggest surprise was how I would be so enchanted by the love these two young women radiated across the screen. Their first physical encounter for me was by far the most tender, romantic, lovely, vicariously enthralling love scene I have ever seen in movies. I literally stopped breathing. I couldn't believe the chain between the two actresses. With no nudity or graphic sex, they led more passion and titulation than any American production could ever hope to overcome. Bravo to the author, screenwriter, director and cast.
