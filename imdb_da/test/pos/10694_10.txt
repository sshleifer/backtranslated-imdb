This is an action movie that makes me feel very peaceful and relaxed every time I see it. The film (in contrast to its conclusion) shows that in the face of extreme odds, it is still possible to win. <br /> <br /> This movie is very refreshing and will probably be banned at all times. Get a copy of it before the thought police burns every copy they can find. They do not want you to have the hope of the future or to have a chance. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Political Correctness should not suppress it, it would be an excellent movie to release on DVD. Such a publication could include interviews with the author and the director and related treats. I'm sure it would sell some copies and I would be one of the first to buy it. <br /> <br /> - Decrease
