This was a great movie. Something not just for the Black History month, but as a reminder of the people's goodness and the statement that it really does make a village to raise a child. The performances from S Eptath were excellent. Mos Def and his song were from the hook. Had to make a double take when I saw it was Rosie Perez there. But the supportive cast of actors and actresses made this worth seeing. All the different stories they had were amazing. And how Nanny protected Jr and literally everyone else who was in her presence. I really understand that she is the matriarch of that time and even more so how tired she was in helping everyone. Can't wait for it to come out on DVD. It would be a welcome addition to any movie library.
