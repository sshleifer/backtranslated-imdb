I described Woody Allen's Manhattan as perfect for someone the other day, and she thought it was a strange way to describe a movie ... I've only seen a handful of movies that I would call perfect. Manhattan is one, McCabe and Ms. Miller by Robert Altman is another, and once in the West by Sergio Leone is also another movie that I believe achieves perfection. There are a few others, but apart from the fact that I do not find fault in the three mentioned, I must also admit that all three directors are acquired taste. <br /> <br /> If there is a movie I could stand behind and bet on the house, anyone I wanted to show it would find it flawless, it's shoulder weapon. City Lights, The Great Dictator, The Gold Rush and even Pawnshop are 10, but not only Chaplin does everything right in this movie, all he did is fun and touching to a level without explanation.
