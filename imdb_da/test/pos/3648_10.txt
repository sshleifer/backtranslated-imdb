People who say some of what the Looney Tunes cartoon shows are inappropriate because the children seem to have forgotten something: they were not originally intended for children. They were produced for the cinema, which was to appear before feature films, and then they could show everything they wanted. "Tweety's S.O.S." Have the bad puddy tat Sylvester find Tweety on board an ocean liner and boarding ship to try and get him. But two things work against Sylvester: Granny strongly protects the canary, and Sylvester becomes light seasick (we don't see him throwing up, but with his green face they make it quite clear he just did it!). And then, of course, the seemingly sweet Tweety has a bad ride. <br /> <br /> It's just amazing to see how these cartoons were not afraid to go out; Whatever they thought of showing, they showed. We must understand that comics should not always be cute entertainment for children. Really fun.
