this movie was brilliant! I absolutely loved it! Wesley snipes were great for this role - and I'm sure knife 2 would be just as good. <br /> <br /> Sheet is by far one of my favorite actions / scary films out there! and if you haven't seen it yet and like vampires and blood (all those things) you really should rent it, for I assure you that you will love it!
