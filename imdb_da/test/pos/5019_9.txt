Why would this movie be so good but only grossly estimated at $ 95,000,000 and has no price nominations? John Travolta knows what he's doing. He knows he's Michael, a cigar search, female, magic arch angel who came down to live with a dying lady, and is now on the road with the staff of "The National Mirror" and their dog Sparky on their way to Chicago. It then becomes a road trip that is both terrible and great. I don't even think the death scenes (3 to be precise) make this a tower cherry. The soundtrack is best with "Heaven is my home", "Up around the bent" and "Chains of fools". I have very high expectations for this, and I say it should have had a little more respect in the 90s. Read my comment. Goodbye!
