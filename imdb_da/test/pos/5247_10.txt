In contrast to the comment made directly below, The Big Trail (1930) was not filmed in a three-camera process "like the later Cinerama." It was the final of Napoleon (1927), another movie entirely! The Big Trail was shot in both 35mm and 70mm (Grandeur) versions, and both versions appear on the Fox Movie Channel from time to time, making it easy to compare. The Grandeur version (posted in mailbox @ about its original 2-1 ratio) is more impressive cinematic with its wide-angle panoramas, but suffers from the same problem that occupies early CinemaScopes, missing close-ups forced by director Raoul Walsh due to focus problems. Scenes involving individuals instead of crowds or long shots are much more effective in the standard version, because the camera can move closer to the players and thus gain greater sense of involvement for the viewer. When you see the two versions simultaneously, you get an accurate idea of ​​what shots Walsh chose to shoot close-up in the standard version, but could not in the Grandeur version. There are also a few sequences involving El Brendel: a shell game with Ian Keith and a business with his wife and a jackass that is in the Grandeur version, but lacking in the standard version. <br /> <br /> For the album The Big Trail is the only one of three Fox Grandeur movies that have survived in its original wide format. (The other two are Fox Movietone Follies from 1929, completely lost and Happy Days, which survive only in standard format.) Other studies also experimented with broad films at this time, but the only other that still exists in both formats is The Bat Whispers, filmed in both 65mm and 35mm, and published by United Artists. Other broad films were MGM's Billy the Kid (1930) and The Great Meadow (1931), RKO's Danger Lights (1930) and WB's The Lash (1930), all of which can be seen in their standard format versions at Turner Classic Movies. WB's Kismet (1930) was also filmed both broad and standard, but seems to have disappeared completely; It's rumored to be lost. Why did big film fail in 1930? The theaters were reeling (pun intended) under the impact of the stock market crash in October 1929 and the burgeoning costs of installing sound equipment and it was therefore inappropriate to take the extra expense of installing additional new projection equipment and new wider screens to accommodate only a handful of films, photographed in a variety of systems that were not always compatible with each other. It wouldn't be until 1953 when Fox, now Twentieth Century Fox, would try again and this time succeeds in introducing widescreen CinemaScope.
