This is a great James Bond movie. Although it is not part of the original and more famous series, and it is an independent film, it is very well done. Closing Sean Connery to return to the role he made famous was a brilliant blow that titles the movie in a way that refers to his earlier promise not to play Bond again. Connery was as big as he was in his former 007 look. The script is outstanding, like photography and performances. It's the earliest movie I remember with Kim Basinger, who became much more famous after this movie; Barbara Carrera was excellent; and Klaus Maria Brandauer was absolutely perfect as the biggest villain. The frequent references to Farmer's aging and the changing times and attitudes of British secret service were most humorous. The 007 gadgets matched those of the other Bond movies. The only thing missing was the famous 007 music theme, which of course could not be used by this competing production. It was pretty amazing to me to see two excellent James Bond movies released that same year, this and Octopussy with Roger Moore. An interesting aspect of the movie is an emphasis on video games and computer graphics. The early 80s were the first glare of such things, and their use in this film made it a very modern movie. The movie is actually another version of Thunderball, updated with newer technology. Whatever the repetitive theme, there are sufficient differences to make the most enjoyable. I want to see this here often.
