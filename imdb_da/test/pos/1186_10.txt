It couldn't have come out in a worse time - just as the nation entered the Reagan years, boom-boom 80s, time of no regret, no worries. It got no mouth open and badly opened. The study ditched it. But hair may be the best musical ever made - with Forman director and Tharpe choreography, it is an exciting, beautiful, well-groomed, well-written triumph that few people remember. The casting is perfect, the musical numbers are unforgettable, and even the decline in an end does not diminish the indomitable spirit of the film. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, you haven't seen the best musical all the time. Seriously.
