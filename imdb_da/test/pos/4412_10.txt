A pile of human flesh is sleeping on a red pillow. This is the hunk of nude meat that is "Little Joe", a New York hustler who lives with his bisexual wife and baby child. The film follows a day of his life after waking his wife's sleep and demanding that he go out and do the traditional male thing - be a breadwinner. But the use she wants to put on the bread is to pay for her new girlfriend's abortion. We are certainly not in the traditional family unit here ... After playing with his child, Joe hits the streets for johns cruise. Clients come thick and fast: The ordinary gay man who wants to meet him again because they "work well together", the old English classical teacher who pays $ 100 to see Joe, constitutes an old Greek athlete; the female topless dancer blowing Joe boasts of being raped; the aging gym bunny who doesn't believe what he and joe do together is queer. After a hard day's work, Joe turns home exhausted, just to be put down by his wife and boyfriend. He goes back asleep when they harp and undermine him. Meat is fascinating as it requires what is a traditional classical mainstream structure - it has an incentive event (money for abortion) and setup, a confrontation and a resolution (albeit a very downbeat), even a protagonist with a highly motivated goal and then continue to concentrate on the details of the daily routine of these people, who are quite common to themselves, but extraordinary to most "ordinary" people. It all seems very authentic and natural - it is hard to see the play, the actors are so completely their roles - yet it is all a piece of clever work of art - a beautifully drawn portrait or an intricate carved statue. Director Morrissey carefully prepares each event, each meeting around his human meat theme, to be packaged, but with such a clever little hand that you hardly notice him doing it. The wife "packs" Joe's sexual organ, paralyzing the old Englishmen with a long-standing sequence of classical beauty that created art and poetry from human flesh beauty, transvestite friends of the stripper pack themselves as women while reading a Hollywood magazine in which "real" women are packaged as products; gym bunny buys jos friendship and love, believes artificial porn is real and can't tell as we can't, joe does his friendship and intimacy for cash. The film itself presents itself as ne plus ultra cinematic realism, but what we might as well have to do with here is art or an early example of concept art. Genius - a word that is not easily used - by Morrissey was to find a way to take Warhol's artistic pretensions to film making, which was interestingly safe but boring as hell, and made them blissful products that remain among the most exciting works of cinema art ever made - commercial cans labeled "Flesh" and "Trash" and "Heat" with a product brand - "Andy Warhol" - which sells an idea of ​​the product as much as the product itself. Yet, as you roll from Morrissey's cynicism, you are spelled out of his ability to still maintain the highest standards and depth. The constant, what looks like the camera is constantly flashing, draws attention to the cinematic nature of what you are witnessing, but you are still drawn into the illusion. Meat is probably one of the most extraordinary pieces of cinema magic that ever spellbinds an audience.
