Approved ... let's see. The only reason I had chosen to watch the movie was the hot topic shown in commercials when Shrader (sp.) Said, "ASK ME ABOUT MY WEINER". Then I had to watch the movie and I saw it with a couple of my friends ... and WOW fantastic. One of the best films of the year. The whole movie was laughing like crazy! The reason for this story is that Bartleby (Justin Long) is not accepted to any of the schools he used to make another false college for him and his friends so he can fool his parents that he did it to college. So he does the last thing and he fools his parents ... until more students look at the website and see clicks (ACCEPTANCE IS ONE CLICK AWAY) and all those rejections come to this school. They face a lot of problems and they just can't seem to get anything right 10/10 LOVED IT NOW CHOOSE IT
