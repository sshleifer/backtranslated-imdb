This movie is a joy to watch and must do well on DVD and video. I suppose you really have to be Irish to appreciate some of the subtleties like accent, colloquialisms and the feel of some of the characters, but let me assure you that when Dylan Moran publishes 'Barreler', the imitation is quite known to most people from Dublin because we have many signs in our fine city that look, act and speak like that! The pure simple comedy employee and Michael Cain's genius appearing alone is worth the money, but on top of that the plot is amazing, the script is amazing and the dialogue quickly moves and catchy. A perfect light entertainment film without Jim Carrey's madcap humor.
