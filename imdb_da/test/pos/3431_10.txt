This thing works at all levels - it is intense as a thriller, full of Lars von Trier's tribute, but also very much his own movie - and it has a message: happiness comes from within, best personified in the wounded soldier, who practically (and Believe it or not, humorously) disintegrate limbs of limbs throughout the film and apologize for others to impose on them. You laugh at him, but you also envy him. The central character is a well-meaning but clumsy writer who uses the whole movie to try to help those he turns to on a train from Stockholm to Berlin just after World War II. He ties parallel stories together and really screws people up in the process. To say things go wrong is an understatement - and structurally, the characters are all in perfect contrast to each other. It is like every one of them has the opposite - as close as to see anti-material collide. You will not believe in the sick things you end up laughing at. To say more would qualify as a spoiler - all I can say is a pity, this movie has not been released in the United States, not even on DVD. Some moron told them enough that the Americans would not get it - which is scary because we not only "get" but produce things like South Park ... If this movie is marketed in the US, it should be sold as a mainstream black comedy, because that's what it is. Over-the-top, sick and twisted, but fuuuuunnnnnyyyyy!
