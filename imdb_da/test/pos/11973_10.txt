Watchers is a funny movie, if not taken too seriously, the novel Dean R. Koontz is obviously much better, but the film itself is entertaining in its own way. The film has many changes for the novel Watchers, the one difference being the main character Travis. In the book he was an adult and a retired Delta Force soldier, while in the film he is a teenager. The guards have the good point, the film has some yellow scenes in parts. I am a fan of Micheal Ironside and it was cool to see him in this movie, he always does a good job in all his films. The OXCOM costume looks a bit cheesy, but the camera never quite shows the creature right up to the end of the movie. The dog Einstien was impressive, as it was well-educated. <br /> <br /> The movie sees two genetic experiments flowing from a laboratory, dog, and monster. Both experiments are linked telepathically, as the two animals are part of a military project where the dog would infiltrate an enemy base as the creation would attack and remove them. The dog finds a teenager named Travis, who takes him home and discovers that he is intelligent, and so he names the dog Einstein, while OXCOM roams around killing people and deepening his eyes. Two government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident comes out of hand. Soon Travis learns that his not safe as OXCOM is drawn to the dog and will stop by nothing to kill him and someone that way, so Travis and his mother go to rescue his girlfriend who is kept in the hospital by the two agents. They then hide in the woods, while government agencies and OXCOM are not far behind. <br /> <br /> Watchers is not a major adaptation of Dean R. Koontz's novel, but it is a contribution to the 80's horror flick, some fans of the book may not see this as it is not true to the book, but fans of the cheesy 80's horror movie might want to check this out.
