Like so many other reviewers here, my memories of this show are universally warm. In fact, so pampered said valued memories that I recently purchased the DVD box to display the joyous and carefree childhood period where I used to sit quite fascinated when I looked at the continued quest for Monkey, Pigsy, Sandy, Tripitaka and later Yu Lung a horse / dragon / man (you really need to see it to understand), as the very beloved show originally broadcast on BBC 2 on Friday nights as I recall. <br /> <br /> I am happy to say that even after all these years, and now it looks with adults, ie. more cynical (!) eyes, the show has not lost its endless charm. <br /> <br /> Just wonderful entertainment, from the magic characters and their comical interactions with each other to the perhaps not so special effects (which actually serve to increase the silence) and of course not to forget the very memorable opening title sequence from that first season, time has passed In no way form or shape diminished any of Monkey's spellbinding charm. <br /> <br /> As Monkey himself would probably say, 'Oi! You there! Go out and take some nostalgic fun. '
