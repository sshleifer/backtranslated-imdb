Movie writer Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depth of love, passion and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest movie BLINDSPOT. <br /> <br /> BLINDSPOT's diegetic world explodes with excitement and takes the audience on a twist to the heart of the human soul. As a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from his actor's performances. With excellent editing, especially in flashback scenes and beautiful filmography, BLINDSPOT is a thought-provoking excitement from start to finish. A thriller that leaves much to the mind's eye. <br /> <br /> What an amazing achievement for Stephan Woloszczuk. Cheers Stephan! Angela Sander
