The rushed approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot while maintaining an effective maturity. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is immediately transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is crucial to understanding the position of the doctors in. History suggests that these two people are generally happy to provide medical practice to those who are less fortunate. By suddenly cutting this scenario into the morally conflicting occupation (the personal doctor of the mob), the viewer is encouraged to experience this sudden event. The Nelsons (Kay Francis and John Eldredge) are employed by Gurney (Bogart) with no objection. This stylized perception of organized crime is too influential and powerful to overcome has become a standard component in each gangster image. One aspect of this movie, which raised some questions to me, ironically addressed the pacing of history and the speed at which it was told. I think character development and social identity may suffer when certain aspects of a story are not fully explored. This paradox is due to the result of personal taste, as I believe the movie experience can be improved through strict character development. But for the purpose of this film, I must admit that the quick action contributes to more dynamic glare for the film's impact. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 (off ****)
