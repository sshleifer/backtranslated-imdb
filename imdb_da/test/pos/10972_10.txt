MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a fantastic movie that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time. You know that the signs, after finding out that the so-called "gift from God" was actually a loan, will pay back the money and that everyone will be happy at the end, but how they get there is not so obvious. The scenes are often fun and occasionally touching, as the characters assess their lives and where to go. The game of veteran actors is more than just a nostalgia tour. Frank Gorshin, Shirley Jones and Cloris Leachman prove they are capable of playing more than playing Riddler, Mother Partridge or Mary's friend Phyllis, while Jill Eikenberry and Wendie Malick play other characters than we have seen on their television series. Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and fun at the same time without making fun of nuns or the church. If you are looking for a movie with a fantastic cast, give some good music (including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight") and an uplifting ending, this test. I don't think you will be disappointed.
