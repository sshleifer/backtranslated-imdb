The film "And the Earth did not swell him", based on the book by Tomas Rivera, is an eye-opening film for most people. It tells about the exploitation that migrant workers go through to survive. <br /> <br /> Sergio Perez uses Impressionist techniques to portray Rivera's history. He uses sienna and grayscale effects to depict some of the scenes, and he uses specific photographic techniques to make the scenes look like they were in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Perez also gives life to the movie of I use the temporal music, including ballad and guitar. <br /> <br /> I feel it's a good movie to watch because it shows in detail how migrant workers live what they do for entertainment and their beliefs.
