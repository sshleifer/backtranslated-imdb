In my opinion, the dads army is your best British sitcom all the time. I think if you just watch an episode of the show, you can't judge entirely on one episode (this includes the movie). You should at least see a series of this show, get in the characters, get familiar with the surroundings and the situations they are in. When you get to know the show, it will start attracting you. Now the film has a few changes in the series, which is a little disappointing, but it still works. See a series or two of the show first before you see this. You will not be disappointed. Good episode to see is "No Spring for Frazer"
