Lucio Fulci's cat in the brain is an inventive and somewhat selfish tale of a director decent in madness. The director in question is Fulci himself, who is the star of the film. Fulci has been known to scare fans everywhere as "godfather's godfather" and for good reason, having given us some of the nastiest and most gruesome movies ever to reach the silver screen; from the foal of violence in films like 'Zombi 2', to a man hacked to death with chains in 'The Beyond', all the way to gore party known as 'The New York Ripper'; If you want gore (and let's see who doesn't), Fulci is your husband. But all this catering to gorehounds like you and I have taken his toll on Fulci's mental state, and he quickly displaces madness caused by what he films. Fulci's problems do not end in his mental state as his psychiatrist that he has gone to see about his problem has undertaken to take murder as a hobby using Fulci's films as blueprints for the murders! <br /> <br /> I have to say that the actor in this movie is horrible. In particular, there is a scene that involves a hooker, and it is only suitable for laughing because both it works and it is stupidity. Fulci takes the film's lead role (of course). He is not an actor and it shows, but his performance is actually the best in the movie. It's even safe to say that one, the actor is bad for an Italian horror movie. Of course, no one goes into an Italian horror that expects good acting so it's a bit forgiving, but I think Fulci could have hired some better. Poor dubbing also doesn't help. But something that helps is the fact that the horrific spectacle is counteracted by lots of gore, and it's extremely mild! People get their heads cut off, a woman is beaten in the shower (and unlike Psycho, here we really see it), people are hacked up, fed with pigs, and there are plenty of cinema's finest melee weapons - the chainsaw on the display that I was glad no end. The amount of gore is massive over the peak much of the time, which gives the film some of a 'spoof' feel, but Cat in the Brain is of course a heavy in the cheek film anyway. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to make a movie about yourself and not cross like being a bit of a big head and Fulci actually comes across as a big head in this movie. His name is often mentioned, and he is almost always on the screen; It's not too much in contrast to 'New Nightmare' in the ego effort, but it's obvious he was good at doing this and I for one had fun watching it so we can forgive him a little selfishness. The film's end lets it down - I saw it come a mile away, but then don't seriously think the movie would take that route, but I was wrong; unfortunately it did. The end left me cold, and the movie is a better watch if you turn it off just before the last two minutes. But in spite of the fact that it ends and works terribly, Cat in the Brain is very fun and wants to satisfy Fulci enthusiasts no end, and it is therefore recommended.
