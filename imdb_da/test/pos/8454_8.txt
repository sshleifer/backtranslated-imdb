Bridge's drama about a reporter who discovers some flaws in the security measures at a nuclear power plant is well-aimed and a very interesting film from the late 70's. It's not amazing, but its solid play is pretty good, especially Jack lemmon, but Douglas and Fonda were also good. It was a pretty good manuscript and Bridge's direction was solid and suitable. This is certainly not one of the best movies in the 70s, but it is one of the better ones. A good early Michael Douglas movie and Lemmon in his prime .--- IMDb Rating: 7.2, my rating: so in simple words, solid but not amazing ... that's what this movie is solid but not amazing 8/10
