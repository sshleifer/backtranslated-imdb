I was plagued by nightmares involving Sesam Street and the Muppet Show in my childhood. I loved the programs, but when I slept, I would dream of the muppets, not unlike them on television ... but not quite on TV. <br /> <br /> They would talk gibberish and laugh and sing with eating each other and killing each other. They would take a bite of their sweet felt meat and it would tear apart followed by arterial bleeding. ON A! But it was the past ... I love this show! I saw Peter Jackson's MEET THE FEEBLES many years ago and wondered why there was no work out there. Well here it is so sick, twisted and in a way socially potent the old Hobbit's vision. <br /> <br /> If you like this show and you haven't seen MEET THE FEEBLES, get it on Amazon or such a movie source. You're in for a treat. <br /> <br /> By the way, Clarence would totally kick Triumph's dog bags.
