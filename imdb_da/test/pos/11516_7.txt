"Lights of New York" originally started as an experimental two-reel Vitafon card that finally snowballed into the first all talkie movie. Helene Costelle was apparently one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood and sister to (in my opinion the right beauty) Dolores Costello, who seemed to get all the breaks. Bad Helene is best known for appearing in this beautiful movie that bought a revolution in Hollywood !! <br /> <br /> Two backbones on the Main Street pocket convince a couple of small town bears to try their luck on Broadway. Hairdressers Eddie (Cullen Landis) and Gene (Eugene Palette) are unaware that their hair salon is soon a cover for illegal launching. They realize it soon and regret the day they left their small town. The only thing that keeps them going is the loan that Eddie's mother gave them and they desperately want to pay back. Eddie is again acquainted with Kitty Lewis (Helene Costello) a girl from her hometown who has done well on Broadway. Kitty is worried about "Hawk" Miller (Wheeler Oakman) who is always hanging around her, but Eddie believes innocently that she is exaggerating when Hawk already has a girlfriend Molly (Gladys Brockwell), but to assure her that he is giving her a little gun to scare unwanted admirers away. "Hawk", who has killed a police officer and has "Feds" in, decides to hit Eddie. Meanwhile, Molly gets her right in the "Hawks" treatment of her and after a showdown where he tells her he is after a chicken and not an old hen that the scene is set to - Murder !!! <br /> <br /> The fact is that it is not terribly horrible, except for gangsters and showgirls who speak in their best elocution voices, and it still happened in movies in 1930. Gladys Brockwell (if a little melodramatic) and Eugene Palette (quite natural) was okay and was the most experienced actress in the cast. There was no John or Ethel Barrymore to see - Cullen Landis and Helene Costello soon returned to the turmoil from which they had come. I also did not notice much of the "hidden mike" - where people had to be grouped around different objects, ie. a phone or sitting on a couch before they could participate in conversation. People who saw it at the cinema probably believed that all policemen spoke in the flat monotone as it continued in many early talkies, ie. "Little Caesar" (1930). In any case, they were probably fascinated by the news of an all-talkie - with some song and dance videos in 1928. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
