This movie I would like to say was amazing. I can see how many people would think it is just a choke movie. This is not entirely untrue, but it is just as much of the choke fiction as Chuck Palahniuk's books are. One of my favorite movies from time to time, Bijo no Harawata, is a certain kind of ugly movie that you can have almost any reaction to. It is scary, fun, silly, brutal, full of off-the-top material and some people who wake up. The time I saw this, it was with my friend, and his mother had brought it home to him to see it. He said it was just some screwed Japanese movies, but I saw a lot more of it. It is badly made, yes, but it has some kind of poignancy to be beautiful too. As the director says, this is a shocker movie made for a particular reason. It's like atrophy. If you leave the audience soft, then all of mankind becomes soft. I think it's a good philosophy, and I agree with that one hundred percent. Bijo no Harawata is the kind of movie that the gang rapes in hell out of fitness, yogurt and all this new wave question.
