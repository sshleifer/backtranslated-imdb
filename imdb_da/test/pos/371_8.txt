I knew the premise of this movie, and of course I can't miss a good sound film, especially from the "Master of Suspense" director Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Basically, tennis master Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets eccentric strangers, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train traveling from Washington to New York. Bruno talks about a perfect murder, Guy hates his wife, and Bruno hates his father, so Bruno "suggests" to change murder. Of course, Guy hasn't taken him seriously until, of course, when Guy's wife Miriam Joyce Haines (Kasey Rogers (or Laura Elliott)) has been murdered in an amusement park. Guy is, of course, the biggest suspect, and Bruno keeps "bumping into him" and reminds him of their "plan" and gives him more things to help him kill the father he wants to die. This murder inquiry and Bruno's stalking threaten his tennis career and his relationship with the daughter of Sen. Morton (North by Northwest Leo G. Carroll), Anne (Ruth Roman). Bruno realizes that Guy won't do his murder, so he decides to plant evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty, Guy's monogrammed cigarette lighter at the amusement park. After his tennis game, Guy and Anne (who, of course, found out the murder "plan") is driving to the amusement park to stop Bruno and they have a fight on the fast outbound carousel. Also starring Patricia Hitchcock (director's daughter) like Barbara Morton, Marion Lorne as Mrs. Anthony, Jonathan Hale as Anthony, Howard St. John as Police Capt. Turley and John Brown as Prof. Collins and Hitchcock's cameo are the man boarding trains that carry a double bass. Some interesting dialogue and character interactions, some good tension moments, and of course the unforgettable carousel finale, a good classic movie. It was nominated Oscar for best cinematography. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 at The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the movie was number 32 in 100 years, 100 Thrills. Very good!
