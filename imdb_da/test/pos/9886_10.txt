I watched the premiere of this movie during the 2005 Phoenix Film Festival and was very impressed with the skill director Jeff Hare exhibited to bring this current topic to the screen. The play threw it perfectly and made us examine the question of a senior who wants to die on "his own terms" in a very warm and humorous way. Peter Falk was brilliant as Morris and the supportive group of family members and friends were perfectly cast in their roles. The interplay between family, friends and outsiders with Morris created a realistic picture of how families address the issue of their parents' aging and their desires to die with dignity. Although this movie seems to be a film about a Jewish actor and his family, it is really a movie about all families. The jokes, the family and Morris are breaking under this drum through the life of a "Force of Nature" are fresh and realistic. Childhood rivalry, adult successes and failures, and hope for the children are integrated into this manuscript. While many will question how to make the suicide theme "humorous", I thought the treatment logically and timely. If you are not afraid to throw a few tears or laugh at twittering of a family struggling with this problem then watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was awarded "Best Picture" at the Phoenix Film Festival.
