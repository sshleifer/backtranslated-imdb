This amazing movie captures so many elements in what makes a family comedy fun, entertaining, sweet and memorable. It's hard to decide where to start. From the opening number "Rainbow Connection", Paul Williams' excellent score is sung with gusto by Kermit D. Frog, who gives us a prologue on what the whole adventure is all about, throughout history it's a fun movie. It's basically a roadmap where Kermit travels cross-country with a dream of pursuing a "rich and famous contract" to entertain. Along the way, our green meets a number of other hopeful actors, comedians, singers and musicians, who by chance are muppets like Kermit himself. Is that how Muppets really started? "No matter how it happened," Kermit tells us. <br /> <br /> Not since "It's a Food, Food, Food, Mad World" has the cameo formula been used so diligently and successfully. The hopeful stars encounter many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; some just blink over the screen, but others have very memorable cameos. Steve Martin's entertaining bit as a rude servant is probably the best. Puppetager Jim Henson's key to his inspiration, Edgar Bergen, particularly touches. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has ever seen the Muppet TV show will see all their favorite characters, they are all here. The doll work is magnificent; Pay special attention to the fact that Kermit bikes (how do they do that?) Inside and references to old movies are everywhere, but the best one-liners are reserved for Kermit itself. An example: When the villains terrorize Kermit and Piggy, she says lovingly to her short, green and beautiful beau, "I wouldn't give up tonight for something, would you?" "Uhhh, make me an offer ...." I also love the war party at the OK Corral scene: Brilliant absurdly stupid. <br /> <br /> Get "Movin" right now "but to sum up: a good natured movie that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age or movie genre taste. Highly recommended.
