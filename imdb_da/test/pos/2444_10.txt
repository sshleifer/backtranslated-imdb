Looked at this when it was first screened and then missed it as it disappeared from British screens. It showed another side of Old Australia that we need to see more of. Good assembly of old hand and young turkish. Then, the realism of the hard back was fantastic. Unfortunately it was missed. This show was cold in the old way to look at Australia. Hard living and hard work. The young idealist collides with the old practical head. Real Politicka is struggling with the young start-up of New Labor. To add modern political peoples. <br /> <br /> This show was the first of its kind that I encountered, not trying to do a tourist job in Australia. It was a fantastic display of the realistic <br /> <br /> upcoming documentary realistic type show. Some good movies were out at the time that did a similar job. It would be great to see more of this type of TV coming from Australia, because unfortunately the last twenty years have been missing. For everything we have fed, the soap powder is of varying quality.
