This is a funny movie and I like it a lot. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood to a tee. This is of course the usual good vs evil with Robin against the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. Humor is mostly kind in your face, but still works well. A one-night comedy when you don't want to think much, it's worth renting!
