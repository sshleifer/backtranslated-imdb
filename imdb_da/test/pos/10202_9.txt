This is a kind of hidden gem. It has little to no promotion, no fanfare, no classical status, and it deserves all of the above! One of the great film directors, Fritz Lang, has created a true gem in this superb western. A fine cast led by Randolph Scott (the probably one of his greatest performances), the always robust Dean Jagger, Robert Young as a surprisingly accomplished guy plus many veteran character actors: Chill Wills, Slim Summerville, John Carradine, Barton MacLane and others in an exciting Zane Gray story about laying Western Union cable over land. It has tense drama, sprinklers of humor and great effects. It resembles DeMille in ways, and yet Fritz Lang leaves his own stamp on it. At least this is a damn good western!
