When I watch a movie, I usually seek entertainment. But of course, if I know which genre the movement is, then I will seek what it is supposed to do. For example, if it is a deep movie, I expect the movie to tear up my skull and make me think what it says. But who is that girl? is not a deep movie. But it's entertaining, anyway. It's a campy kind of movie that is a joy to watch. There is hardly a dull moment in the movie and there are lots of humorous parts. I've seen it when I was younger. The casting is always entertaining as usual. I had a little crush on Griffin Dunne, though he wasn't the typical male heartthrob at that time. Haviland Morris also stars. And then Austrian actor Bibi Besch is also here! Overall, a pleasure!
