I was surprised and impressed to find that this film was released in 1940 before the United States entered World War II. On the surface, satirization of something as solemn and terrible as Nazi Germany could be misunderstood as a rash. But Chaplin's shine is not limited to making a joke out of everything. In fact, the seriousness of his message would not have been nearly as valid if it were not the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of sharp drama that were mixed in. Drama alone would not have had bitter and resonance that this movie did. Laughter in someone (Adenoid Hynkel) can be the best way to attack them while laughing at someone (the Jewish barber) can be the best way to love them. In the last speech of the Jewish barber, for a moment I forgot that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. They are words that have meaning now and in every wartime. Therefore, I think the film made it much better than damage, as it still has the same deep effect today.
