The sexy murderer Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) still longs for a life of beautiful bliss with her boyfriend, Charles Craig 'Lee Ray. Having the hands of the mutilated Good Guy doll, who last played host to her spirit and makes a patch of repair work, she completes a satanic ritual that returns her life to the toy. Unfortunately for poor Tiff, the reanimated maniac shows no interest in marriage and so she traps him in a cage with a bridal business. Eventually, a rather surly Chucky (pronounced by Brad Dourif) escapes its borders, electrocuts Tiffany in the bath and traps his soul in his 'bride' as retaliation. <br /> <br /> Realizing that they are both in the same problem now, the plastic pair sets aside their differences and decides to head to Hackensack, New Jersey, where they can put their hands on the magic amulet that can move their spirits to human hosts. Tricking trailer park hunk Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his tasty girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) to take them to their destination, begin the psycho dolls on a murderous rage, with their ignorant companions fighting for the blame. <br /> <br /> Although the idea of ​​a child's doll is obsessed with the spirit of a mass murderer, it has always been rather comical, it was not until the fourth movie in the Child's Play series that decision makers fully embraced the noble lunacy by the premise and choose to play things much more for laughs than for scary though (although there are still plenty of OTT splatter for us that gorehounds can enjoy). Talented Hong Kong director Ronny Yu oversees cases that carefully translate the witty heavy-duty script into a smooth and thoroughly enjoyable cinematic tour. In the same way, the excellent throw handle the rental material perfectly, as Stabile and Heigl make a good pair, but rumors hot Tilly steals the show as blonde, boxing, pouting, PVC mini-skirted temptress Tiffany. Kevin Yagher's impressive expressive doll effects also go a long way in making the film such a success. Overall, this movie is unlikely to find many fans among "serious" horror aficionados, but those who enjoy the odd spot of mindless popcorn entertainment, full of twisted, black humor, crazy death scenes and magnificent cleavage should have blasted.
