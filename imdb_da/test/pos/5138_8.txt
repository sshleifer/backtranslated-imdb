I read the book in a summer book club and we all loved it. My friends from the club agreed not to watch the movie, so the book was destroyed. I did not agree and saw it recently with my younger brother and my parents. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised. The film was very true to the book without losing its own spirit. The "New Kid" theme was shown just enough, so we get a feel for it, but it's not about the story. The action was not the best I have ever seen, but it was still good, and the children especially had a lot of energy. The characters were interesting and the plot was sweet and not too exaggerated. It was a children's film that also works fine for adults or teenagers. <br /> <br /> I wish there was a bit more tough girl attitude from Beatrice, but she was still a great character. Mullet Fingers was a little like I had imagined, except that his hair was a little obviously colored with blond hair and dark eyebrows. Roy worked very well as the little guy and the new child, especially interactions with his parents and friends. The message and the ending (which I will not discuss other than I liked it) went along with making a good cheer-up movie for a rainy day. All in all, this was a great movie that you can see over and over when you need to remind yourself that the world is not a terrible place.
