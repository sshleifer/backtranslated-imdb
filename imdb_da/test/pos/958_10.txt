Big Fat Liar is the best movie ever! It's fun and cold. Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz) proves he is not lying and goes to Los Angeles to get his paper back from Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Along with friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) clear his life when Marty won't call Jason's father and say he wrote the paper! Still, it turns out well, and it's a good movie to watch!
