There is not much of a plot for this movie. There is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife must sue the hospital for neglience. Not much more than that, but .... IT DOESN'T! <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter because you have some real actors who give their dialogue life, and because of the cast you have some hysterical fun scenes and even if you don't laugh, you have a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Matthau plays Charley, whose wife has recently gone away, and is looking for more women in the hospital. He is very happy to taste everything on the menu available to him. Then he meets Anne Atkinson (Glenda Jackson), who is initially a patient in the hospital (their first scene together is a lot of fun) and then they meet again on a television panel discussion program where they disagree on almost any topic being discussed. <br /> <br /> Charley begins to suffer from Anne and vice versa, except that she is very big on monogamy in the men of her life (her husband was a cheater) and they decide to give it a shot - two weeks off faithfulness. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give away anything else, but I would like to mention the chemistry that Matthau and Jackson have on the screen. She is usually not the first person to think of a romantic medieval comedy, but her touch with comedy is very light and comfortable. She is matched every step of the way by Matthau, who is more charming than ever. He doesn't have to play Mr. Sensitive or Mr. Macho to get the girl, he just has to be himself. <br /> <br /> Art Carney is a rebellion of himself as an almost senile physician. The scene where the baseball team owner's ashes are buried at home plate is invaluable. He also has a very fun scene in a parking lot with Richard Benjamin. Richard doesn't have much to do in this movie and more often than not just the right man for Carney and Matthau; the role does not tax his significant talents, but he should have been good at making this comedy. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended ... 8/10 <br /> PS /> PS. FYI - Matthau introduced Jackson with his first best actress Oscar, and Jackson presented best actor for Art Carney for his role in 'Harry & Tonto' ..
