I was lucky enough to see this at the Tribeca Film Festival this year. I was stunned by how well made and how entertaining this wonderful little movie was. Director Griffin Dunne has done a great job collecting this movie, which has more characters and more story lines that blend so smoothly and smoothly. The main story involves the family, and it's very thoughtful and entertaining story that involved the viewer in all scenes. The movie as a whole has credibility and integrity, but still has the commercial edge - an "indie" movie for the masses if you want. The performances from the cast are all excellent, but it is Diane Lane who shines the brightest. Diane Lane is simply sensational in this amazing movie and should be Oscar nominated. Early days I know, but Lane works her socks out here.
