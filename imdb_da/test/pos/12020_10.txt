I think that just sums up this movie. See it and you will find out why. The action of the protagonist John Keem is really, really bad, and he has no one on the screen charisma at all. It is very fun because of this thinking, just as it is the end, where Keem mocks the evil guy despite being unarmed and surrendered. Brilliant!
