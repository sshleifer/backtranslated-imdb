The idea of ​​a young girl who becomes pregnant at the age of 16 is nothing new for the drama writer. But it's pretty new if you look at the comedy genre. There is this basic plot of Lorelai and Rory, mother and daughter. Lorelai comes from a wealthy background, got pregnant with 16 and ran away from her parents' house at 17. But this series does not start there, it starts when Rory is 16, and everything is just about the problems of a single mother having terrible problems with her parents and all the problems you have when you are 16. <br /> <br /> Okay, now again it sounds pretty normal, but there is this little thing called joke. Gilmore Girls speaks incredibly fast and they make 60 jokes for a moment. Although you do not understand all the jokes, they contain hundreds of references to movies, music, gossip, history, literature, and politics. Sometimes you get confused yourself, but it's really fun. And not only is it fast, it's smart and wonderfully sarcastic. Besides that, it's not just fun, it has big dramatic parts in it, and you can take some lessons from it yourself at home. It's a thing that doesn't go to every TV series. <br /> <br /> See it! It will ease your mood and help you through tough decisions!
