This is the first sci fi series that I have been seriously connected to since Star Trek (and I haven't seen Trek this year). It takes the invasion theme in slightly different directions, but has done so in a very exciting way. It also borrows from the soap opera format, where it continues bow throughout the year running of the series. CGI does not overcome the plot or characters at all, except Nim, the bubbly creature that is a pet with a particular attitude. (All that would show what he really thought of the neighbor's yippy dog ​​is A-1 in my book.) He was a brilliant blow. <br /> <br /> I am back at the end of the finals asking (intelligent, I hope) and crossing my fingers and toes as NBC or another (Sci Fi, perhaps) will continue to run the series and answer these questions. <br /> <br /> A really good classic show.
