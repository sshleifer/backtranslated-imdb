* SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> Great WrestleManias was still a few years away. But this one was certainly good, with lots of good matches and a big fight. <br /> <br /> Demolition was always best at WrestleMania. I like their last WM hoorah (I refuse to include the other version) was a victory over Colossal Connection. I liked Andres gag never noticed. <br /> <br /> Few fans know this was the first time anyone ever hit Mr. Perfect. For some reason Brutus Beefcakes feat was never recognized. Or the fact that he did it pretty easily. The Hart Foundation's victory over the Bolsheviks was the shortest in WM history, including the 24/9 second match between King Kong Bundy and S.D. Jones. <br /> <br /> I'm happy that Jake and DiBiase are fighting at WrestleMania. This allowed the celebration to be put on hold for such a long time. I expected the Big Bossman-Akeem feud to warm up, but the bosom just spoke him. As good as Bossman was like a heel, he was just amazing as a face. He was always intense and of course loved his job. <br /> <br /> If the Warrior had only a better work ethic and perhaps tried to fight, he would have been a great WWF champion. Worth to see, especially since the boring battles are too short to complain about. And the tag team matches are all very exciting.
