Yes, this movie has many gay characters. It also has equal signs, signs that are not sure of their sexuality, people who are searching for a truth about their existence. <br /> <br /> This is not a sexual orientation movie. It is about loneliness and the difficulties that people often experience in connection with each other. Denically, Denys Arcand wisely balances the different dimensions of the relationships and the contrasting, constantly changing relationships. The serial killer element is a little less successful (it feels more like a way to unpack different plot points and, unlike the rest of the movie, is thematically heavy-handed). <br /> <br /> Thomas Gibson centers and justifies the movie; It is a quiet achievement, but behind the beautiful, arrogant exterior, he slowly reveals a frightened soul who is afraid to show or accept love from those around him. The support supports are strong, especially Mia Kirshner as Gibson's friend, a judgment-for-hire with precognitive powers. Her role is more metaphoric than a literal endowment â€” oddly innocent and depraved at the same time, representing the bright and dark of the character's sexual consciousness. <br /> <br /> The movie involves and often surprises in its character development. The effect is a bit like Robert Altman directs a David Mamet script --- the dialogue does not shrink from some searing observations except for a few intricate moments at the beginning. Often, in our quest for love and a conventional "relationship," we ignore the love that exists around us --- in our friends, family, those who can see us as we are. Arcand and the author, Brad Fraser, make a few observations in the different ways people try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial returns to haunt us in so many unexpected ways. <br /> <br /> This movie is a rewarding experience. It cannot be for bigots who cannot get past the sexual orientation of some of the characters to see the larger, transcendental message of hope and redemption. Loneliness is a universal experience. A movie like this that dares to explore the darker side of our lives with a wise and convincing eye, deserves applause and an open mind.
