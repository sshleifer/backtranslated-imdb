One of the many speculations about Y2K was that the world should end at midnight on December 31, 1999. In The Book of Life, writer / director Hal Hartley takes a look at the possible ramifications of a new millennium Armageddon beginning with Jesus Return to Earth on New Year's Eve, 99. History examines the Son of God, who will open the remaining three of the seven seals contained in the Book of Life (now contained in a Mac laptop), where there are also the names of the hundreds and Twenty-four thousand good souls will be saved on the last day. Jesus (Martin Donovan), along with Magdalena (P.J. Harvey), arrives in New York City to make the preparations necessary to accomplish his father's will, but he begins to have other thoughts; must he judge the living and the dead? Do they deserve what should fall to them? It is a cup he prefers not to embrace at this time, which encourages Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) who fears that the fruit of all his hard work must be washed away at midnight, for he can only continue his work as long as there are people around who cling to their pitiful hopes and dreams. Hartley presents an artistically rendered high-concept movie in an intelligent, thought-provoking way, taking great care in dealing with the sensitive subject, to make it unofficially even the most agitated fundamentalist. The dialogue between Jesus and Satan is exciting and stimulating, as is the impact of their presence on those they encounter during their legal stay in the city. It is an exciting meditation on the spiritual side of man's fragile existence and a contemplation of what has been prophesied in John John's revelations in the Apocalypse, the last book of the New Testament. And there is logic in Hartley's approach to the second coming; He maintains the aesthetic of the modern setting while using altered film speeds that visually give the film an essential quality. Christ carelessly carries a suit and tie that blends in effectively with the people, while Satan's clothing is a little more relaxed, his appearance is somewhat scruffy; he sports a blue mark over his left eye. Donovan is well cast as Jesus, lends a benevolent me and a sense of restraint in his character, which is very effective. It is, of course, a unique portrayal of the Savior, and possibly the best, when Max von Sydow is in "The greatest story ever told." He successfully conveys a sense of inner peace and quiet, of calm, that is the essence of the very essence of the character. And Ryan is thoroughly engaged in his role as the prince of darkness; He has a clear way of speaking and a resonance quality to his voice, which makes him absolutely fascinating to see. His eyes penetrate dark into a move he uses effectively with furtive gaze and captivating gazing. He is the guy who could sell you something in exchange for your soul before you ever knew what hit you. It is a memorable achievement that contrasts so well with Donovan's portrayal of Jesus. The support molding includes Martin Pfeffercorn (Martyr), Miho Nikaido (Edie), Dave Simonds (Dave), D.J. Mendel (lawyer), James Urbaniak (True Believer), Katreen Hardt (lawyer's assistant) and Anna Kohler (Hotel Clerk). Hartley, in his own incomparable style of 'The Book of Life', has designed a perspective of the last few days that is interesting, entertaining and completely unique. He has a way of capturing life as it is just outside the center, a method that works particularly well with a movie like this. Compared to a feature film (running time of 63 minutes), it's still one of Hartley's best and more than the price of access. It's a movie that stays with you and maybe makes you think of some things you might have hidden away in a corner of your mind later. And that's part of the attraction of this movie; It makes you realize that "later" is probably now. I rate this 9/10.
