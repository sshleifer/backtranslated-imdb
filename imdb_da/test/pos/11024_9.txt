Niagara, Niagara is a wonderful and heartbreaking story of the two outsiders Seth and Marcy. Robin Tunney gives a fantastic performance as Marcy, who suffers from Tourette's South Chrome, gets sick and sick as the film progresses. This film is not very optimistic, and it is very difficult emotionally, but at the same time very romantic. It's hard to explain, but see it and find out for yourself. It is definitely worth it.
