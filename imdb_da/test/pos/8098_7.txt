Being a fan of Charlie Chaplin after good vibes after first seeing 'The Gold Rush' and then 'City Lights', I was eager to see The Great Dictator, whom I was told this was his best movie. I was also fascinated that it was a talkie; my first, Chaplin-wise. The beginning is typically Chaplin and blatant evidence that when it comes to sound, Chaplain can cut it while not relying solely on music to set mood and talk; It's fun, well-timed, and the elements of slapsticks like falling from an anti-air gun are well tied in the jokes. It was good to draw the viewer in with this' classic Chaplin 'opening, and at the same time put the actors' tale on knowledge of each other. What was also well done was the way Hitler was spoofed. Any scene with Hitler or 'Hynkel' in this movie was fun and even now; makes you think back as you know exactly who he is spoofing and creates an internal reaction of some kind. The way in which English intervened in German German during dialogue scenes is further evidence of how Chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era. My favorite joke was the five-minute speech that Hynkel gave, only for the English translator to translate it into few words; makes you think back to footage from Hitler, you may have seen giving a speech at some point in your life and really laughing at him. <br /> <br /> Historically, the film has also had a few things. Hynkel is seen getting his photograph taken with children; something Hitler did for recognition when he manipulated the media, but here Hynkel is seen to yawn and seem bored; Stabbing by Hitler's underhand technique to win over German public through sympathy (Oh, he hugs and kisses children. He must be OK!). The film also gets a great prerequisite for a Jewish citizen to be reinstalled in the ghetto among all the travesties going on, but with the catch he is unaware of. Films such as 'The Pianist' and 'Come and See' are two good examples of Nazi atrocities against 'inferior' people who today we can all look back and shake our heads on while it was back in late 1930 The guys, when this was filmed, the fact that he had cruelty and exploited it, makes it even more astonishing achievement. Chaplin has managed to replace pistols and truncheons for tomatoes and pans and still pulls it away. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like about the movie, however, was that it happened in an actual story after the opening. This lowered the film and it is very noticeable when the foot was taken a little out of the gas. The film began to hint at stories and sub-stories. These included the barber and the female neighbor who fell in love and the supposed destruction of Hynkel's palace, whereas none of them were actually developed. "Giving a woman a shave" and "the one who has the coin in their pudding, hung the gagger of the god on these plot paths, but eventually it only became excuses for drawn, scary gags that were disappointing. <br /> <br / > During the final round, The Great Dictator gets a boost from the fact that the Italian dictator is introduced, adding something much needed life and excuse for comedy to the movie, it seems like a treat as we see them arguing, and more subdued tactics exploited when Hynkel tries to "overpower" his Italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (though they are humorous people). Despite a few weaknesses in pacing under the middle segment, and the fact that I felt the message at the end, was a little forced Down my throat, holding the big dictator up for viewing today, but that's only because he took the gambling by utilizing things that no one else really knew was there.
