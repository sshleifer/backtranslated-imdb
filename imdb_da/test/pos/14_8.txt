I participated in an advance screening of this movie, not sure what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; Both have delivered less than memorable performances and films. While the underlying "general" story is somewhat known, this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances that played very well together. The human fragility and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; The scene in which Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue team was the movie's most unforgettable emotional moment. The "specific" story was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training that elite Coast Guard rescuers have to undergo in preparation for their only job and responsibility ... to save lives at sea. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and "wowing" ... I haven't seen such angry seas since "The Perfect Storm". Co-star Clancy Brown (HBO's "Carnivale" - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guard's Kodiak, Alaska base in a strong convincing role as leader with the premise and necessary ice water in his veins. The movie is wonderful and finally gives long-term exposure and respect for the Coast Guard; it had the audience applauded at the end.
