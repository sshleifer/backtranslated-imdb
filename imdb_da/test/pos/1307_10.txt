This was a great movie. It had a "soot-so-nice" outbreak. In addition, there were some very intense (drama) scenes that could make it inappropriate for younger viewers under the age of 6. <br /> <br /> For one under the radar movie, the play was quite fun and touched our family room for an almost perfect landing. It was our entire family's attention and we were very sad to see it end. <br /> <br /> This movie had elements of spy children with young people who saved the day, but got a somewhat more credible scenario. The dream scenes were a distraction at first, but did a great deal to establish the plot. Pranks and hi-jinx were also very funny. <br /> <br /> We hope you enjoy as much as we did.
