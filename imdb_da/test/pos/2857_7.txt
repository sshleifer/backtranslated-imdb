As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly sees her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the avid hit men Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her soft sense of reality is completely immersed in her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty avoids physically and mentally from his disgruntled, small city life searching for "Dr. David Ravell" (Greg Kinnear), the beautiful and loving hero of "A reason for love", a soap opera sat in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles. Intangible against reality, Betty arrives at L.A. and become "Nurse Betty", which she tries to hear in her dream company hospital world. Meanwhile, the angry Charlie and Wesley track Betty down, convinced that she is a dangerous witness, also by their compromising relationship with Del. <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty creates comedy and excitement by contrasting the protagonist's extreme innocence and optimism with the obvious hypocrisy and violence surrounding her. By clearly defining the protagonist's difficult life, the nurse justifies Betty's tendency to turn away from reality. Thus, Nurse Betty also gives a comment on the widespread dependence on television and its celebrities while commenting on the popularity of the soap opera in the movie. In addition, Betty takes advantage of the effective manipulation of the protagonist's mental state, especially in the scenes where she cannot distinguish between "Dr. David Ravell", the character and George McCord (Greg Kinnear), the actor who plays him. Bette's inability to acknowledge George as an actor leads to fun misunderstandings which emphasize the magnitude of her misleading state. However, despite these successes, nurse Betty suffers from the worrying characterizations that the narrative develops. For example, Charlie and Wesley consistently undermine as a comic couple that the brutality of their actions undermines any kind of recognition or acceptance that the viewer might have originally experienced. Similarly, even though the original scenes establish Del as a despicable man, the humiliation and violence he experiences with his murderers aggravates all the humiliation and violence he caused his wife Betty. Finally towards the end of the movie Charlie undergoes cumbersome transformations as he develops an occupation for Betty; an obsession that results in noble feelings of love and ultimately destroys him. Since the characters' role as victims lacks consistency, history's disarmament processes occur randomly and negligibly. All in all, nurse Betty's weaknesses - less than excitement - weaken her signs and contaminate her plot. <br /> <br />
