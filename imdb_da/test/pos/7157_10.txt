Forgiveness of Franklins is the best movie I've seen this year. The action was amazing .. especially Mari Blackwell, who was really remarkable in the role of Peggy Lester. She brought Peggy to life with incredible skills and made her as real as my own neighbor. I've also had Robertson Dean in the role of the father ... he's a true professional and managed to pull even the most intimate scenes with a rare grace. The performances from the whole cast were very good, excellent, in fact, but Peggy's role played by Blackwell made the movie. The cinematography was beautifully done throughout and was most impressive. The only criticism I have to offer is a weak weakness in the final scenes, which was overly drawn, repetitive and overly focused on the wrong character. I would have liked to see it end up with forgiveness .... but despite the weakness, it is very worth seeing and applauding everyone involved in making it.
