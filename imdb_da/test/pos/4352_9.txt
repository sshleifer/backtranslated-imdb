Warning: Herzog is a film producer and as such tends to be a little overly dramatic. So obsessions about closed doors may or may not be a real part of the character's life, but a dramatic decoration by a filmmaker - or both agreed at the San Francisco premiere. But Herzog's usual fascination with character, dreams and perseverance is well-suited to this story, which was first published in the Fortune Soldier and now a full-length autobiographical book. (The soldier of the Fortune commentary boasted loudly from the politically correct SF audience, and both the filmmaker and the protagonist had to secure the audience who had just seen the movie that SOF's interest was wrong - so warning, it's not Rambo, just survival. )
