Wow, I think the overall average rating of this movie on this site is incredibly low. There really is no reason not to like this movie. "Michael" is a simple but quite original, and easily enjoyable romantic comedy. The plot involves a group of journalists / experts who are to examine the mysterious appearance of an angel (John Travolta) in the Midwest. The angel turns out to be less saintly and mundane than we would expect, and that's what makes it entertaining. His interest in women and the Beatles takes a new spin on the angel's things. The romantic side of this movie involves Michael, the angel, trying to get Andie MacDowell and William Hurt together. The two of them may not have the best chemical chemistry full-time, but they certainly have enough to make it work well. Anyone who rated this movie so low (a 5.4 ??) came again! The movie is not that bad. In fact, I found it quite fun and memorable. Sure, it's not the best you'll ever see, but it's still good. This is a movie I feel has been remarkably undervalued. It's fun, romantic and recommended by me. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
