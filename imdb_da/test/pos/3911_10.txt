I loved this movie !! I've been waiting for this movie to come out so I could see it. I saw it open at night and loved it. Some people told me that this movie was not good and to stay away, but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a good job for her first movie, all giving her a hard time as she did well, and she didn't even have that role. The set was great, it was made of all wax and how it was made. The two brothers did a good job and the sense of death was great. The murderers were really scary and made me close my eyes and didn't look at them. I can't wait until this movie comes out to Video so I can get it and watch it again and again. The overview of my review is to watch this movie if you like Hororr movies and you won't be sorry I loved this movie. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 IT ROCKS !!!
