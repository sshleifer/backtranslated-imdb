This movie is beautiful in many ways: the plot, the depth of the characters, the amazing photography and the play, the colossal-like scenes in fighting (no computer graphics here, only thousands of people). Someone said the story has something to do with the Sheakespean tragedies. I also find some connections with the Greek tragedy tradition. The emperor, who acted exceedingly, struggles between power and love, but he is forced (for the greater good of his ancestors' will) to choose power (and loneliness, hate his subjects and relatives) as his destiny. He was like Creon in Antigone, a good guy before he became Emperor. Once he has gained power, he must be merciless and cruel (with innocent children, his mother, his father, etc.) to defend and expand the empire. Captured by force, he becomes a monster. Overall, Qin emperor is a majestic Greek tragedy figure. The murderer develops towards another direction: from pure evil to heroism and morality. Even this character is forced to his fate of love and by his new ethics. This character is also truly unforgettable. Lady Zhao, a wonderful Gong Li, is the wrong morality, not even by power or love or hatred. She is moral against power, somehow as Antigone. Her conspiracies (for and against the emperor) always have a moral justification. Conclusions, a wonderful movie. If you love cinema and you want to try Chinese movies, start here.
