I saw the SEA OF DUST as part of a NYC screening audience several years ago. I enjoyed that movie at the time, so I was a little confused by some of the changes that had happened since. Maybe it's my memory but there seemed to be clumps of exhibit missing from the version shown at the Rhode Island Film Festival. I'm really not sure which version I prefer, but I can honestly say I found something to appreciate it both. Let me start by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie. Although it has been promoted as a Hammer Film tribute, people expecting a showdown between Van Helsing and Dracula will be very disappointed. There is some cleavage, but no nudity (a staple from the British production house's later film). And while the SEA OF DUST is full of beautiful eye lights (it's really shot as a sixty movie) and has Hammer-starlet Ingrid Pitt, it's not some of the company's pictures in tone or performance. This movie is very dark, very confusing, and (sometimes) a lot of fun. I don't remember the previous version being as nutty as this, but it's not a bad thing (especially the Black Forest showdown that plays like a Three Stooges card). And some of Mrs Pitts rantings are quite entertaining. It's like someone hurt her and turned her loose. <br /> <br /> The unique character of this movie is not in the details. It's in the ideas. As an occasional Sci Fi Channel viewer, I have regularly commissioned the network for its one-tone variations on a theme (CGI monster kills, then gets corrupted). The SEA OF DUST is so full of ideas that you start to ride over them after a while. <br /> <br /> Don't take me wrong. I'm not complaining. If anything, I welcome these guys to make such an entertaining low budget picture and to have the courage to pack it with so many concepts. It's not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think in the cinema (you know who you are). But for the rest of us, those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror movies, the predictability, the lack of respect for the audience, maybe just your ticket.
