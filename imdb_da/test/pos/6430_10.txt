This is a scary job. It's only ten minutes long, but I'd rather pay ten bucks at the cinema to see this than to see a full length movie currently doing the rounds. It is a simple piece of a man's reflection. He arrived at a young man in this place and was fascinated by a room and the music comes from it ... and now he sits down in his old age at this place, so boringly joins his youth. the music in it is brilliant, the guitars have the jazz space twang as neil young people's music in death. If you get the chance, watch this movie. It is worth it. If rutger hauer made more movies like this, I think he would get more respect than he gets. The moment you hear him put under sentences like "everyone's favorite psycho". Sure it is not which routers will be rememered as an actor for. He has also directed this movie, so in this he shows that he is a very artistic actor / director.a change from the b-grade films he has made since the early 90's.i hope to see more of this rutger hauer as he is a of my favorite actors.
