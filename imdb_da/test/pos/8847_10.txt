For me, a ten-star movie is one that never dies in my memory, and yet one can see again and again with the same pleasure as the first time. This could be a technical flaw; The pleasure has nothing to do with saliva and polish (my personal top ten is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of very few films that fit this criterion. <br /> <br /> I've been a science fiction fan since I was a kid in the 60's and I read John W Campbell's brief story where the movie is ("Who Goes There") before I saw the original , black and white Howard Hawks movie (as with many people, the view was illegal on the TV when I should have been in bed!). The movie, which with as many as you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed almost perfect: the excitement, the inexplicable nature of the alien, the photography; it all just seemed to work. I saw it many times over the years (and still do when shown on TV). Because of this, I avoided the Carpenter version for years - seeing remakes of one's favorite movie is, I thought, always a mistake. When I finally saw it once in 1988/9, again on TV because there was nothing else on, I realized that I had to change "always a bug" to "usually a bug"! The carpenter had produced something other than the original film, closer to the original story and truly wonderful. From the helicopter's and the cow's opening space, through the viscerally disturbing scene in the dog pound, to the end (sorry, no spoilers here!), I was hooked. The soundtrack alone lives with me - all I need to hear is a close resemblance to the bass-over-snare drum beat, and I'm * in * the last scene again ... <br /> <br /> See "The Thing ", I had Carpenter down like just another gore monkey, based only on comments and reviews in the mainstream press. Since I have seen "The Thing", I think I have seen most of his films - I have not gone out of my way to do it, but if you come up, just look at his name as an instructor enough to think about seeing it. He is thought-provoking and knows how to build a movie to reach a point where something will stick to memory. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen "The Thing" and you enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favor - sit down in a dark room, pack it warm and prepare yourself to get your memory enhanced !
