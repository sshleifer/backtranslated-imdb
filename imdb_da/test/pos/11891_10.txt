I just finished screening El Padrino in Germany. A good movie. We look forward to seeing more movies from Mr. Chapa in the future. It was great to see such a well-composed film with such excitement and a story that must remain an instant classic. The end with a little ambiguity leaves the story open for a successor. Watching a movie of great quality really outlines Chapa's serious potential and his talented skill as an author, actor, instructor and film maker. Chapa has impressed many with his triumphant "blood in and blood out" performance, and now he has proven to anyone who has seen his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed film producer with genuine artistic control. Something that few filmmakers can afford.
