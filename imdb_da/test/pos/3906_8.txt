I remember watching this movie as it came out as a tsv. Movie of the week in the early 1970s. Although I haven't seen this movie for over 30 years, I remember how scary it was ... the sister's dead body in the basement, the storm raging outside, the creepy house without electricity and a murderer still on the spot. <br /> <br /> They just don't make TV movies like this anymore. Elizabeth Montgomery was a very underrated actress and I liked her in not only "Betwitched" but several of her post-Bewitched roles, like this and 1975's "The Legend of Lizzie Borden". <br /> <br /> I really want someone to come out with a DVD that has several of the 1970s TV movies of the week on a DVD. Wouldn't it be great to see "When Michael calls", "Bad Ronald", "Don't be afraid of the dark", "Crowhaven Farm", etc. All on a DVD? I know there is a market for a DVD like this for all of us baby boomers that grew up in the 1960s and 1970s. Perhaps, if we are lucky, someday somebody will offer us a DVD with a large selection of t.v. film like this.
