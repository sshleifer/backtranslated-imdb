Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa was actually stolen once and was missing for almost two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a small thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly tried to turn the world's most famous art form into its original Italy. His actions after the theft make him more likely to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.) The Mona Lisa returned to the Louvre on the very first day of 1913, still there, apart from occasional lending. When "Arsène Lupine" was released in 1932 (twenty years after the theft), most filmmakers would have withdrawn this crime in 1911 and their knowledge would have provided some plausibility to this film. "Arsène Lupine" is very fun, with MGM's usual high production standards and Jack Conway's usual fast-paced direction. This movie does not lack pleasure; What is missing is plausibility. John Barrymore is the title teacher of criminals: he specializes in committing "impossible" crimes, which he makes even more difficult by telling them in advance ... but of course he always commits the crime and deceives the gendarmes. Tully Marshall has a good scene as one of Barrymore's victims. Lupine has a penchant for elaborate aprons that allow Barrymore (an American "Grade A" ham) to pamper his own love of tomfoolery. John's older brother Lionel Barrymore is Guerchard, the Javert-like Surete detective sworn to catch Lupine. <br /> <br /> Karen Morley was an extremely beautiful actress whose private life was filled with populist political activities; On the screen she was most impressive in the roles of the working class who had their own political beliefs (like her fine performance in 'Our Daily Bread'). In "Arséne Lupine", Morley's natural dark hair is bleached in a horrid blonde tone, and she is all tart in clever clothes that make her look uncomfortable rather than sexy. SPOILERS COMING. Finally, Lupine decides to steal the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. He strikes the paint from his frame, rolls up the canvas and then smuggles it into a flower basket. We see John Barrymore's casual feel a tightly rolled piece of cloth that is supposedly the greatest work of art throughout human history. I had to laugh at the filmmakers' mistakes. In fact (but not in this movie) da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa on a plank of poplar wood, so a thief would have trouble rolling it up! <br /> <br /> Finally, Guerchard captures Lupine and leans him to Le Calaboose. The scene between John and Lionel Barrymore in the police car is pure joy, as their true love for each other wastes in their people's dialogue. I would have found this scene incomparable with two other actors. As it is, I can't imagine anyone, but the Barrymore brothers play those roles. Well, maybe Dennis and Randy Quaid, but just barely. Don't look for a good plot line here, but "Arsène Lupine" is a nice example of old-fashioned film making. I rate this movie 8 points out of 10.
