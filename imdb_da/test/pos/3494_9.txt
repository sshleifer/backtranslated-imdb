i love this movie !! Maybe it's my generation, but I can really connect with what he's talking about and means to do. It kept me laughing for the duration. the film's duration, the next day and beyond. I think this movie is not one to see if you primarily worry about the plot and character development. This movie is just about for the generation who will understand it. There are lots of things you are just getting up in the generation that you wouldn't have if you were 40. I think Sacha Barren Cohen was a lot and I think very well. he is a genius. and the reason h is such an idiot is because he can make people believe he is a complete idiot and makes fun at the same time! <br /> <br /> Very good movie. highly recommend !!!! (not so strong if you are over 30)
