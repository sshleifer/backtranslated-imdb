It is true that "the dead with their boots on" give a very fictitious account of the life and career of George Armstrong Custers (Errol Flynn), but a remarkable one, especially with regard to the battle of the small-sized horn. Because it is not a prerequisite that a 1941 movie tries to portray both the American and American cavalryman and the Indian leader Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) in a favorable light. I'm almost tempted to say that "Little Big Man" in his unqualified anti-Custer attitude seems unbalanced by comparison. Moreover, one should not mislead the image title ?? This is not just a film about the Battle of the Little Big Horn, it's a film about what shows the unreliable West Point Cadet, the famous civil war hero, the Indian fighter, and last but not least the man. /> <br /> The movie begins with Custer's time at the West Point Military Academy, where his recalcitrance and monstrous behaviors lead to frequent demerites. During a punished military exercise, he meets his future wife, Elizabeth Bacon (Olivia de Havilland), who, as Custer himself, resides in Monroe, Michigan. Custer intends to prosecute her, but the outbreak of the civil war calls him away. Custer legendary courage is shown in a series of battle scenes, most of which are devoted to his involvement with the legendary southern cavalry General Jeb Stuart during the Battle of Gettysburg. While on vacation, he travels to Monroe and courts Elizabeth, who promises him his hand in marriage. Immediately after the war, Custer and Elizabeth Bacon are married. <br /> <br /> With the Civil War over, Custer is demoted, doesn't get a real command and is going to undergo the carefully slow process of advancement in the small, professional US Army. When he starts drinking, his wife intervenes on his behalf with former Director-General Winfield Scott. Custer gets the command of the American 7th Cavalry, which he trains to be an elite unit. Neither Custer nor Crazy Horse want to fight, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through Indian countries in clear breach of former treaties. Custer explicitly recognizes Crazy Horse's cause, but rides in battle to perform his duty as a soldier and postpones the merger of the money-settled interests into a letter he writes on the day of war. <br /> <br /> "The Dead with their boots on" but with short historical accuracy it is as good as war movies and western in the 1940s got: both Custer and Crazy Horse are played by big players, neither Indians nor Southern confederations are denied and the courts scenes with beautiful Livvy de Havilland are just charming. The only minus, and therefore I cannot give this picture a full 10, is the undercurrent of racism in the exhibition of African American servants; Elisabeth's servant Callie is the stereotypical, overweight, good-natured, superstitious black mother. It is also interesting that the film does not find fault with either Custer or Crazy Horse, but with the greed of the railway companies, Washington pushed politicians with semi-criminal methods to break the assurances they had given to the Indians. Just a couple of years later, the notion that American entrepreneurs even think of doing something far beyond doubt could be supposed to be suggested that the filmmakers were communist sympathizers. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, "the Dead with their boots on" precludes the fact that Custer's overly aggressive tactics often adjoin the stupor, greatly exaggerating the importance of his engagement with Stuart, and does not mention the lack of reconnaissance before the battle of the small great horn. Nevertheless, Custer was considered a hero of war by his contemporaries and had some spectacular exploits to point to in Brandy Station, Gettysburg, Trevilian Station, and others, although his weaponry was not as crucial to the civil war as "the Death with their boots on" suggests. "In any case," they died with their boots on "a well-established war film with Western elements, three excellent artists (Flynn, Quinn and de Havilland) and give a positive picture of the Indians as well as a negative on big money, which is not would be seen in major Hollywood productions for decades to come, it would deserve a 10 if it wasn't for the racist minstrelization of African Americans.
