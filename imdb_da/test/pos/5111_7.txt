This was easily one of the Wender films from the Ernest films, especially in terms of production design. What were the pink watch uniforms? Unfortunately, this movie probably destroyed the Ernest series and turned the series into a straight-to-video series. However, Jim Varney gave one of his better performances by playing Nash, his criminal alter ego. An error in the series, but was not so bad in most respects. (Electro Man routine was classic)
