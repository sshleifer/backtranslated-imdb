I was very moved by the young life experiences of a man who rose so high in the academic world. A hard life surrounded by love for a close family and extended family of companions created a person who could manage in the world. For the most part, the Spanish culture is shown as I have always observed and admired - hardworking, optimistic and truly family oriented. The points of religious superstition were quite authentic to the Catholic Church. Without a doubt, the actor who played the mother deserves an Oscar. Her prayers for her missing son moved me to tears. I would recommend this amazingly thought-provoking movie to my friends and family.
