A group of unpleasant teenagers go to a former funeral home for a Halloween party. They are trapped inside and become obsessed with demons, which they have accidentally awakened. The occupied teens start killing the others and seem to be led by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) who floats and speaks in a really deep voice. The remaining teens who have not yet been occupied are forced to fight for the demons and try to escape the house. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty decent horror movie with great special effects like Linnea Quigley (who has a pair of bare scenes as usual) elaborates on a guy's eyeballs and pushes a tube of lipstick into her nipple. There is also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin, and a guy gets his tongue bitten out. This is a great movie to watch with a bunch of friends late at night while eating some pizza. The horrible spectacle and terrible dialogue, however, ruin it. Overall, I would give it a 7 out of 10.
