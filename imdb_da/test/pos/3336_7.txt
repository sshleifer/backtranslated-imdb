This is a better than average recording in the Saint series - It holds your interest and as mysteries you should guess at the end and have several suspects to choose from. Many films from the Golden Age are not for every taste, especially younger viewers. They date themselves to clothes, cars, settings, etc. Who asks today about highball? Or do you wear a dress and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a lack of lawyers since then. Frankly, much of the value is missing from those days. <br /> <br /> In any case, take it with you and enjoy it. It's good - in old-fashioned opinion.
