hey i think this movie was great and it had great graphics and i was very happy to use the final fantasy 7 i think the game was the best i've ever played, it's a great movie and I loved it. They should make another one, but maybe they should eat using the last fantasy 7 again or final fantasy 10 who both pretty awesome from: Tyler Sheena I hope you can send me an email again if you have some details if there is one other. People for everyone else reading this, I suggest you watch this movie it's animated, but it looks pretty realistic, and it has amazing fighting situations, I haven't seen so fast in a movie for a long time. The game's final fantasy 7 is also really good, not good graphics, but it is really fun and challenging
