Business vs. Personal Belief. Profit vs. Art. As with any documentary that sets the capitalist big corporations against the small producer, the viewer must always take the side of one or another based on their own beliefs. This is just as much a documentary for the new standardized way of doing things as globalization brings us to the old traditional ways in which character and art do things, almost more than getting the product sold. <br /> <br /> Remembering one thing from this movie is that the masses can no longer decide for themselves, they just follow the taste of one or a few critics who tend to equalize and standardize taste just as MacDonalds used to do for the quick bite (something that Parker himself admits in the movie against a background of a Burger King character). "It's about image" against content that another interviewer says. It's the easy way, the standardized way. Easier than taking time for a good wine to mature, easier than forging your own taste by trying and trying again. Controlled branded flavor is easier. <br /> <br /> There is a glimpse of hope as even some of our cousins ​​over the sea agree that a few people "level" the taste of wines to maximize profits and ensure a maximum of it becomes sold to the "gray masses". Individuality and difference are sacrificed for the extra buck. It's nice to see that not all or all is about standardizing itself over the sea. As in many other areas of today's world, a few's dominance and reduced freedom affect us all ... let everyone make their point of view and decide what to do. Too much standardization kills the mind and taste; difference brings innovation and healthy competition and allows for choice - and not just vacuum-packed "more of the same". Standardization sells light and much, and brings everyone to the same level - the bottom. <br /> <br /> On this I have to open a nice bottle and wish you a hearty "sante".
