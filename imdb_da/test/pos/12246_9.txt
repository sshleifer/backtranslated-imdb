Movie consultants often say that big movies must have 3 memorable scenes to be considered really big. Broadcast news does not have <br /> <br /> three, it has twice that. This movie is extremely well written by <br /> <br /> James Brooks. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never been <br /> <br /> better. I love this movie for many reasons. It's good because it <br /> <br /> makes you laugh and it makes you cry. Albert Brooks has several amazing lines and many unforgettable scenes: # 1 (laugh) "I can <br /> <br /> sing and read, I sing while reading" with Midnight Train at <br /> <br /> georgia playing in the background. # 2 (laughs) Tells <br /> <br /> William Hurt's character, "You really blew the cover of nookie," <br /> <br /> after seeing Hurt's rape report. # 3 (crying) When Aaron <br /> <br /> (A. Brooks) finally tells Jayne (Hunter) that he loves her and she <br /> <br /> can't end up with Hurt's character because he represents <br /> <br /> everything about journalism Jayne finds dispicable. Finally # 4 (grin) that can forget the scene where Aaron <br/> <br /> anchors the weekend news .... hilarious. This movie should have won an Oscar! It has everything I love in <br /> <br /> movies, big, intelligent script and even a Jack Nicholson <br /> <br /> cameo!
