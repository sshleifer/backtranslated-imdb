Eliza (Elizabeth Moorman) is a farmer from the country who comes to town looking for love. She has met a man who has told her about an astrologer who wants to show her the stars. This is a journey of souls ... Eliza is tested, can she realize her true love when she sees him or not? Tommy (Tommy Lee Jones) is a construction worker trying to find his original heritage. They show each other different ways of looking at things. Still, Eliza still tries for love, and Tommy tries to protect the reservation his grandmother lives on. This is a twisted story of looking beyond the obvious and finding beauty in the simple everyday things. The style is artistic and shock full of symbolism. The psychedelic camera styling can scare away the average moviegoer, but the deeper message and the interesting frames make this movie worth seeing. It is a film that explores the underworld of the weird, miserable and destroyed individuals. This strays from the trail but certainly worth seeing!
