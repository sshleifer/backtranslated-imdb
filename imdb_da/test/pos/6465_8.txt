Although this little movie became wild in the wake of On the Waterfront, Edge Of The City can surely stick to the star-studded classic. It's another story about the docks and the rules of clarity that govern it. <br /> <br /> Alongside the corrupt union that Lee J. Cobb ran on On the Waterfront, Jack Warden is really little time corruption. But he is really enough as the gang leader at one of the ports that scares the other workers by being practical with his fists and bailing hook and he gets the rest kicking some of their hard earned money. And it's all hard earned money in that job. A guy Warden can't scare Sidney Poitier another gang leader and when he tries to scare the newcomer John Cassavetes, Poitier takes him under his wing. The two quite develop friendship and Poitier and his wife Ruby Dee directs herself Cassavetes up with Kathleen Maguire. <br /> <br /> Warden is really an abominable creature, and it is boring how, by the force of personality and physical skill, he queues almost everyone else for submission. In that sense, he is tougher than Lee J. Cobb, who had to rely on an impression collection of goons to enforce his will at On the Waterfront. <br /> <br /> Edge of the City marked the big screen director debut by Martin Ritt, who did a great job with a good cast of New York-based players and the spot on-site movie. The film's low budget shows, but you are so impressed with the ensemble cast, you are not really interested. Cassavetes as lonely with past and hip and hard poetry are both fine, but My personal favorite in this movie is Ruby Dee. She should have received a prize for her performance, her last scene with Cassavetes being excellent. Capture this if possible. I wish it was out on DVD or VHS.
