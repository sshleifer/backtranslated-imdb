Why is it better? Because it's true for the dark vision of the comic. Because the image is inventive and unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos in it. The first one had too much of Jack Nicholson's shtick, too much prince music and an awkward "romance". Here there is instead of a villain three. No Robert Wuhl, and the leading lady is more than just a beautiful face. In fact, Pfeiffer No. 1 is in this movie. Her transformation is what drives the ongoing theme that stretches on the edge of hygiene and insanity, good and evil. She gets really awful. Costumes and makeup are excellent. Danny DeVito's Penguin is inspired and attacked, not just a nut. His circus gang pose is the only element of comic relief (besides the gigantic duck). Max Shrek is the only sign I would have toned down, Walken is pretty hammy as the ruthless businessman. Danny Elfman's score is a perfect fit as usual, and the Siouxie and Banshees song ("Face to Face") is easily the best of any of any of the movies, a perfect match of musical artist and movie soundtrack. The smallest campy of the movies, it's macabre, doesn't pan and requires second and third viewing as an amusement park. Bravo Tim Burton and cast!
