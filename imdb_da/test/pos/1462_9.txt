A spin off comedy talk show from the creators of 'Garth Marenghi's Darkplace' The new series, Man to Man with Dean Learner, focuses on Garth's leader, publisher and advertising agent, as played by Richard Ayoade. <br /> <br /> Nightclub owner, restaurateur, publisher, international playboy - Dean Learner is a one-man brand. <br /> <br /> Following his co-funded Channel 4 TV hits Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, he now invites you to his luxurious penthouse apartment for a brand new, entertaining and immensely stylish TV talk show. <br /> <br /> Man to man with dean Learner will work with all the dean's remaining celebrity friends, as well as lots of live music and fine fish-dish cuisine in a show as a series of class - but not fish! <br /> <br /> I attended two of the live footage and it was stitching me. There are clear comparisons with Alan Partridge's Knowing Me Knowing You in the layout, but Richard Ayoade and Matt Holness's unique writing style takes it to another level. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Darkplace then you can't miss it. Catch it when sent late in the summer
