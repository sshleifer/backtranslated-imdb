Sometimes you are late in the evening turning through the stations, bored out of your mind and want a bright and fluffy romantic comedy that doesn't make you feel bipolar. And this movie fits the exact billing. Of course, the plot was completely torn out of the 1930s .... the writing as schmaltzy as the Hallmark Greeting Card company's legendary poetry, and the one-dimensional characters were played by a caste picked right from Central Casting - but it was CUTE and exactly what I had need last night. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly and Costas Mandylor have good chemistry together - I liked it at "Picket Hegn", and I am happy to say that they still have it over 10 years later. Costas Mandylor, at 41, is still possibly one of the most beautiful men to grace the screens since ol 'Rudy Valentino kicked the shovel 80 years ago. RRROWRR! Bonus points to cast the funny man who used to be on the skates of the comic strip show. I always thought he was just out of a Hepburn-Grant comedy. BRAVO! <br /> <br /> Some people will probably say this was the most graceful piece of cinema ever made and I would probably agree - but come back! It's on the Hallmark Channel. What did you expect? Just sit back, relax, eat some sesame sticks and watch a cute little movie with two cute people and down a bottle of Zinfandel. Trust me, you will love and accept schmaltz much more, and then you can go to bed dreaming of Costas Mandylor swimming in a sea of ​​hardened chocolate that gives you petit fours with mintreds fresh chocolate ice cream. YUMMO! (PS. Now I have a hankering for petit fours. THANK YOU VERY, HALLMARK!) I really want the evil girl to have been thrown with Rachel Ray, and perhaps the crooked maddened Alton Brown who announces instead of the creepy guy with Van Dive the beard. Thriller! <br /> <br /> It would have made my night. But hey, check "Just Desserts."
