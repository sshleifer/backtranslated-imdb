A nice romantic war story that should have had more exposure. The Czech pilot who played the piano gives a gentle touch to the story. The flying footage may not have been enough for airlines like myself, but then it's really not an action movie again. Although it has nothing in common with the James Salter short story "The Hunters" that became the film of Korean war 86 Saber pilots, Dark Blue World had a similar feel, but with more of a romantic element to it. Better in some ways than the Battle of Britain because it doesn't rely on big name actors. Suggest to watch this movie with some Czech beers and some Czech dumplings called kneldniky (sp).
