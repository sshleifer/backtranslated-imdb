Michael Radford, director of "The Merchant of Venice", is doing a tremendous amount of work on opening the game as he makes it more accessible to everyone to have a good time in the cinema and look at this thorny account of a terrible time in history. The delicious production of Shakespeare's play is a feast for the eyes with its rich details in Venice in the XVI century. <br /> <br /> This is a story of revenge, prejudice and justice, as imagined by William Shakespeare. After watching the game a couple of times, we were not prepared for what we could expect. Mr. Radford takes care of presenting the story with such details so that it can be easily understood by everyone. He also used a version of English that makes sense more than relying on the original text. In fact, the way Shylock speaks in the movie is not shocked at all, he is a member of a minority who has been marginalized by the Venetian authorities and the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino's huge account of Shylock shows a man who is vulnerable, arrogant, revengeful, medieval, and completely human, all at the same time. Mr. Pacino throws light into the character of the man who is defeated in court of a technical nature. His own daughter has left him, and his whole world seems to be grabbing him. At the end of the film we see a man who has been reduced to the goal of hatred and ridicule of all. <br /> <br /> Lynn Collins, like Portia, is a happy discovery. After seeing her in light fare, she not only surprises but she does the best of her role and time in front of the camera. She shows us that she is a woman with a high intelligence who comes to the aid of her husband and his best friend, who risked his own welfare, and tries to help Bassanio get Portia's hand. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays Antonio, the man seeking Shylock for a "brolan". After all, he knows that his ships will soon return with fortunes from abroad. Antonio gets much more than he talks about accepting Shylock with the terms of the loan. Antonio's best plans go astray when he is suddenly unable to fulfill his obligations. Mr. Irons gives a subtle performance. <br /> <br /> Joseph Fiennes makes a good look like Bassanio. His good looks and his charm give an impression on Portia, who clearly sees a soul-mate in this young Venetian, knowing that he is one for her. Also in smaller roles, Kris Marshall, Zuleika Robinson, Charlie Cox, contributes to making the movie an enjoyable experience. Ultimately, it is Mr Radford's triumph because of the vision he gives us of Venice and its citizens in a terrible time in the history of mankind.
