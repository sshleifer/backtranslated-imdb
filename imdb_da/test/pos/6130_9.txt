"Pink Flamingos" is a cult classic. Plot of this movie is about the throwdown challenge to Divine supremacy as the most beautiful person alive. "Pink Flamingos" contains some memorably repulsive scenes like a sex scene with a chicken and the scene where divine eating fresh dog feces.Yes, the movie is shocking and fun at the same time, but the biggest laugh comes from the actors' lines. Look especially at this line from Divine: "Kill All Now! Condone First-degree Murder! Lawyer Cannibalism! Eat S ***! Filth is My Policy! Filth is My Life!". On the whole, I really enjoyed this movie. Put its tagline "An exercise in bad taste" should be taken to heart and even those who used to coarse films today can find this gem difficult to stomach. recommended
