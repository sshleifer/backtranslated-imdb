I can honestly say that "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" was a much better movie than expected. Allow me to clarify the plot if the movie's title is a little too vague - there is a bed that eats. An evil bed. It eats people. More unsuspecting women on an "outing" of some kind stumbled upon the creepy "sack" and eventually fall prey to it's hunger. The devouring process of the bed consists of a yellow foam that softens people into the inner ... stomach acid; all with chewing sounds. This is a very strange cult girl and the only movie from George Barry who had forgotten that he did it until it was newly found cult status came to him again and he decided to release it on DVD. Not a bad movie at all, if you can see past the miserable spectacle and enjoy the hokey effects - the most ridiculous is the guy whose hands are eaten off and he's left with only plastic that sees skeletal fingers ... Precisely dreamless tone to it also across as very surreal and deviant - mostly all with the artist behind the painting and the demonic back story of the bed. If you like the bizarre no budget then you'll find oddsball flicks than definitely "Death Bed".
