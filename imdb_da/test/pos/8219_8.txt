This is a typical Sandra Bullock movie where she plays a mousy (but profane) woman in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero. Sounds good? <br /> <br /> There are lots of gaps in this story. Just don't put up and some of the excitement is a little corny. But - the excitement is very good. There is much excitement in this story, which has strong paranoia that runs through it. The story starts slowly but kicks very soon and stays that way, making it a involved movie for the viewer. That's why I give it a pretty good rating - the movie gets you involved in it. Bullock is more sweet than annoying, as she usually is for me, so this is my highest rated movie with her in it.
