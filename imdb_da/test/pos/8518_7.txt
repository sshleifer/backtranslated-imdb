1983 was "Farmer's fight". That same year, both Roger Moore and Sean Connery were in two separate James Bond films, the former (Octopussy) produced by the "official" decision makers of the Bond movies, while later (Never Say Never Again) was produced "unofficially" by a group led by Kevin McClory who held the Thunderball movie rights. Surprisingly, the "unofficial" movie is better despite the obvious error and the fact that Never Say Never Again is a remake of Thunderball. Never say never again has the distinction between sporting one of the best casts ever assembled into a Bond movie. It all starts with Sean Connery, who returns to Play Bond for the first time since 1971's Diamonds Are Forever. Connery may be older when he was then, but he looks better here when he did in Diamonds Are Forever. The connection of never saying, Never is the smooth and dangerous shark of Dr. No or From Russia With Love, just a few years older. Connery's delivery of a liners and dialogue is just as dead as it ever was. The only drawback to Connery's age is his credibility, especially when it comes to the ladies in the movie. Let's see it yourself Connery despite being in top physical shape, looks just as weird as Moore when he strives for women half a year. Despite this credibility issue, Never Say Never Again shows Connery in one of his better Bond performances and a tangible improvement on his two former Bond performances. Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of her early film roles. Bassinger plays the role with great confidence in a relative beginner, and she makes the sign credible. Bassinger keeps himself against his fellow stars and has great chemistry with them too. In fact, she would rather overlook her Thunderball counterpart played by Claudine Auger. <br /> <br /> Then there is the villain Maximilian Largo played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer's Largo is all that a James Bond movie villain should be: suave, charming, evil and above all credible anyway. Brandauer makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap, many other Bond villains have fallen in by going over the top. Brandauer plays Largo with a silent threat and charisma invisible in many opponents of 007. <br /> <br /> The excellent casting also extends in the support. Barbara Carrera makes a nice henchwoman in Fatima Blush and the screen lights up when she arrives. Max Von Sydow looks good as Blofeld, although his appearance is more akin to a cameo. Rowan Atkinson looks like Bond's bumbling contact, giving some of the best scenes in the movie. With all the highlight of the support cast comes from the MI6 employee from Edward Fox's M, which creates a great contrast to Bernard Lee, Pamela Salem, who makes s affine Moneypenny and the ice cream on the cake with Alec McCowens wonderful Q. The support model has a few misfires however form of Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter and Gavin O'Herlihy as Jack Petachi, who both seem to lack credibility in their respective roles. Otherwise, this movie is one of the best casts ever assembled for a Bond movie. <br /> <br /> On top of an excellent cast, the film has several other important ingredients. From the open Central America sequence to the battle at Shrublands to the underwater sequences and the motorcycle hunt, this is a movie where the action sequences are not only great but also service the plot for the most part. The film also has good special effects with regard to cruise models, explosions and all the things we expect from a Bond movie. Irvin Kershner, so horrible at making The Empire Strikes Back, brings a tight directional direction to the movie, especially in sequences such as nuclear warhead substation and subsequent theft of cross missiles. <br /> <br /> But this movie is far from perfect. Never Say Never Again is easily one of the most dated of the Bond movies with its powerful use of the 1980s computer games. While technology dates back to a time, the movie's strong dependence on it, especially in the hijacking of the cruise and the Domination sequence, is that the movie looks incredibly dated a quarter of a century after its release. The script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the fact that it is a remake of Thunderball. <br /> <br /> But for its predictability, the Never Say Never Again script is pretty good. Scripture sports good dialogue scenes, not a single cringe worthy of a liner (how many of Roger Moore's era scripts can you say about it?), Some humorous situations, and yet watchable and tense for the most part. When you look past it is a remake, there are a lot of good things in the movie. The film is actually the greatest weakness in the movie. Due to the film's "unofficial" status, James Bond Theme could not be used. That said, with the right composer this could have shown that a Bond score without it could work. Unfortunately, Michael Legrand's score is far from adequate. Legrand's score is completely out of place in a Bond movie, and there are only or two places where it actually works. To make matters worse, the movie is also lumbered with one of the worst title sequences ever to be enjoyed by a James Bond movie. <br /> <br /> Despite being heavily dated, somewhat predictable and having a poor score, Never Say Never Again is still a good Bond movie. With one of the best casts of any Bond movie, good action sequences, good special effects, good direction, and great dialogue, this movie shows that "unofficial" is not a bad thing. In fact, it's better than Octopussy and the winner of "Farmer's Battle".
