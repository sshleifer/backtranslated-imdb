It took me a while to find this movie as they don't have it yet on DVD (and my video is not worth connecting again). I think all referrals to drug use are too much for some people. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay, and I have to say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. It's a slap stick spoof in the vein of "Airplane." I have to say that when I saw it on Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed humor a lot more than I do now. But it is definitely worth seeing just to see what they (ie film producers) could get away with before the "Just Say No" hypocrites released their propaganda. singing ... "We're all on drugs" hahaha It's a stupid movie and worth $ 10 I paid out of Ebay to get it on DVD, just don't even think about comparing it to the original - it's just stupid. What are you tall?
