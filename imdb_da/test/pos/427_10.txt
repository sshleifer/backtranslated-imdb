I've only seen three episodes of Hack staring David Morse and it looks like I've missed 37 episodes! Good if ITV 3 shows them in chronological order. I just watched 'Misty Blue' (episode 38). I really enjoyed the 3 episodes, but then I am a David Morse fan, (esp St. Elsewhere). For anyone reading this, Hack is excellent. Too bad it gets aired on ITV 3. The cast is strong, although I can't get used to David playing a bent policeman, we still know he's the good guy who's wrongly accused. I see Gary Cole has guest stars, what happened to 'Midnight Caller'? Just wonder if Hack is available on DVD (yet). Love it. Bowl.
