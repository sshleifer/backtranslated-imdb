Wesley Eure is young inventor Brian Foster, who invented a new crime-breathing security unit in the form of a robot dog, entitled "C.H.O.M.P.S." (It stands for Canine HOMe Protection System). C.H.O.M.P.S., which has been modeled after Brian's real dog Rascal, can do almost anything he has improved speed, strength, x-ray vision and the like. It's just the case to save his chief Ralph Norton's (Conrad Bain) security firm. Of course, a slimy competitor, Gibbs (Jim Backus) wants the edge so he tries to get his hands on the secret. <br /> <br /> These are the kinds of things that are just too hard to resist. It has lots of slapsticks (Chuck McCann and Red Buttons play a good pair of bumbling idiots), an optimistic attitude, an engaging cast and probably good laughs to keep one entertained. The energetic disco-style music is repetitive but unthinkable; The story is straightforward, and the dogs themselves are completely sweet. In a thoroughly strange but side-cutting touch, there is another dog in the movie (called "Monster") whose thoughts we actually belong to; Both his dialogue and the performer who makes the voice are invaluable. In fact, he even uses a bit of mild agony and his last word ends the film on a positive gut-braking final note. <br /> <br /> Eure and the sweet Valerie Bertinelli are very sympathetic young leaders, and their veteran supports cast plays the Material with all the power they can muster. Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert Q. Lewis and Regis Toomey are also co-stars. <br /> <br /> A rare theatrical live action venture for cartoon-creating teams of Hanna & Barbera ('The Flintstones' 'Scooby-Doo', 'The Smurfs' and so on), "CHOMPS" is decent stupid things. I know it left me with a smile on my face. <br /> <br /> 7/10
