This is the best movie ever, but that's my opinion. Some say it's cheesy, but I think it's really a beautiful movie. The chemistry between Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze is like no other I've ever seen, and that's what makes the movie so perfect. I always wonder what would have been of this movie if these two actors never existed, because not only did they do it for me, they both did it. If you've never seen this movie when you understand what I mean. Dirty Dancing looks like it was made from the heart, and it feels right for some reason, like magic and the soundtrack LOVE IT. In addition to the two leading actors, the soundtrack makes the film the beauty it is. As you can tell, I'm in love with this movie, and I know you're staying too.
