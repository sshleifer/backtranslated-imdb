Although a "woman's story" I found this still quite interesting. It is unusual that there are three genuine sisters playing sisters in the movie! I refer to Priscilla, Rosemary and Lola Lane. <br /> <br /> Why national critics loved this movie was the presence of bad boy rebellion John Garfield. In their twisted Liberal-dominated mind, All-American signs are diseases, but sur-on-life, poor attitudes that Garfield played here are people they can identify with. Despite this, this movie still has an overall sense of goodness, which is why I liked it. Some of the characters may have done stupid things, but the good hearts. If heart was bigger than "ann's" (priscilla path) in here? I agree with the IMDb user criticism here, which says this is Priscilla's movie as much as the beloved (not by me) Garfields. <br /> <br /> With a director, Michael Curtiz's caliber, the movie is better than it could have been under another. Curtiz made sure that no scene, soapy water, or otherwise went too long. <br /> <br /> In addition to Lane sisters and Garfield, we have Claude Rains (who adds the necessary humor to the story), Jeffrey Lynn (girls' greatest love interest), Gale Page, Dick Foran, Frank McHugh and Mae Robson. Apparently, this movie must have been a hit because there were more spin-offs from it, neither of them approaching it in content and box-office success.
