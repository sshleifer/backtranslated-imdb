Okay, I love this movie !!!!! I saw it again and again. It's so hard to tell who the attacker is. You keep thinking that it is a person, then another, then back to the first person, then another person. It's so exciting you want to speed up your TV to the end to see who it is. SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and left with her. She is in the hospital and starts telling the story of how she was raped. It goes from her meeting with her regular girlfriend, to her teacher who greets her, her ex-boyfriend, all different stories, all suspects. But who did it? <br /> <br /> I love the play, they have great talent in here. The excitement is wonderful and the settings are amazing. If it comes on television watch it. *** 1/2 stars 10/10
