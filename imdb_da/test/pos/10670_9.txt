This movie has been a favorite for me and is associated with the Christmas holiday for me for two reasons: (1) growing up in the 1960s, everything was space-related from television advertising, and even Christmas claus was in spaceships during the era; and (2) I watched this movie during a Christmas shopping when I was ten years old, and again brought good memories from my favorite TV shows when I was even younger ("Supercar", Fireball XL5 "and" Stingray ") That's why I'm a bit biased when it comes to this movie for personal reasons. <br /> <br /> Having said that, as a film student for a long time, it's mostly a movie for fans of Gerry Anderson (and Barry Gray, oh, the beautiful score!) While the laid-back movie guards will be discouraged by the future-vision-from-the-past (digging the wagons, commercial aircraft, clothes, etc.) and the so-called "plot twist" that will get some to moan, but if you can see past post "2001: A Space Odyssey" desire to make a science fiction movie with a "far out" story line and if you enjoy imaginative special effects then you will enjoy this pearl of an era, when man had just gone on the moon, and people still looked up at the stars of wonder and hope for the future rather than looking down at the banal trappings of the actual 21st century.
