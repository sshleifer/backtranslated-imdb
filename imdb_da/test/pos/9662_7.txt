I have to say that I didn't expect this movie to be so good. Normally, the Eastern cinema presents the communist past in 90% of the films. However, this film surpasses the Romanian cinema, which is worthy of more advertising. <br /> <br /> The action is truthful and not exaggerated, the plot is simple but complex as it presents life in the Romanian suburbs, the sound amazed me, the control was good, and what more can I say ... <br /> <br /> This "Crash" in Eastern Europe was pulled me into the movie, which lives every moment of it. I even felt a desire to get out of me, a desire for adventure after seeing it. <br /> <br /> See it! You will definitely enjoy it! <br /> <br /> 7/10
