Much about the US The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between attitudes in this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like forgery that hampers things that should not be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker about taking on recent events (although I probably can't always tell where he stands), but I admire the unusual and artistic way to get points. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry, etc. Plays a big role here as pictures. Most of the images of history are accompanied by these sound elements to a good effect. I'm kind of a radio buff, so it was satisfying to hear the way the radio was integrated into the pace of the movie. In fact, most of the dialogue takes place over history rather than having characters talk to each other. It is not to say that there are no "signs" (real people), but apart from the "Jim" protagonist (some sort of '60s fall out with an irregular state of mind), the others come and go pretty fast. Some get a very strong impression, especially a guru-like taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom. When he breaks into a spontaneous song about prayer while driving Jim to the subway, it's a very strong moment. On the cover of the DVD, the quote "Father is ready", taken from President Bush's speech, paved the way for our entry into Iraq. In retrospect, speaking in a climax's moment in the movie, it heard how we live in a historically charged moment that will always be remembered.
