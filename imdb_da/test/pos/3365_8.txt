The second in director Coh's trilogy of World War II comedies (the others are "To Death Do Us Party" and "Adolf Hitler - My Part in His Downfall") is a movie version of the BBC's long-running (and much-loved) situation comedy. Like most TV show transfers, this movie suffers from a lack of plot and is more a collection of sketches. Some of them work better than others, for example, the scene where a senior court officer floats down a river is a memorable surreal moment. The joy of this movie is its representation of a past that probably never existed and an England defined by picturesque scenery and the ability to see veteran scene-steals like John Le Mesurier given their greatest film roles. Arthur Lowe is great as Captain Mainwaring, a bungler who, when the chips are down, shows great courage and saves the day (climax is probably the greatest moment of character). The episodes of the TV series are, of course, more fun, but as an introduction to a British legend, you can't find anything better.
