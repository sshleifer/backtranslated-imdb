The primary plus for this movie is the combination of Chris Farley and David Spade. This was the first movie in which this comedy duo showed their Laurel-and-Hardy-esque humor. Farley's obvious physical comedy skill is perfectly amplified by Spade sarcastic take on any situation they are in. <br /> <br /> This film is apart from other comedy films. Tommy Boy ranks with the Blues Brothers as a comic work whose individual scenes and bits originate from the plot, rather than serve to break up the story and give the film a heterogeneous feel as so many other comic films do. Thanks to the excellent direction of Sagal, all scenes are tight and immediately shatter or act on the story being told. He is just as much to credit for the movie's hilariousness as Farley and Spade are. The action of Dennehy, Lowe, Ackroyd and many others (see petrol station accompanying 22 miles from Davenport) strengthens the film. <br /> <br /> The movie guarantees multiple views because there are many fine shades for the movie that may be overshadowed by Farley / Spade. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is very well-made and is the funniest movie I've ever seen.
