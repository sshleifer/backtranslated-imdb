quite genius movie from CKY crew ...... (not jackass boys ..... johnny knoxville, chris pontius, steve-o etc are not in this <br /> <br /> movie). Okay so maybe they're not the best actors, but that's not what you call a serious movie ... but hey having fun and it's fun to watch. who will not see Don Vito dressed as a Roman emperor! <br /> <br /> An overall must if you like Viva La Bam or CKY ............ a fantastic soundtrack by Almighty HIM, CKY and others ...... check out the extra features of the DVD especially Bran's freestyle <br /> <br /> Chinese rap number two ...... seriously fun ..... ...... check out this movie .... .... you will not regret it ......... 10/10
