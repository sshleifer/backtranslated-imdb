The original Female Convict Scorpion is a complete masterpiece. The first successor, Jailhouse 41, was not quite as good in my opinion, although it is still remarkable that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same again with this movie; The story is a little different here, but he still managed to take what made the previous post excellent and better than many movies of this type and create something quite original about it. Again, the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (a.c. "Scorpion"), and this time she is out of jailhouse and not so keen on the idea of ​​going back. Having failed to pursue police officers leads one thing to another, and Scorpion finds himself with a prostitute and her late brother. The prostitute ends up being impregnated by the late brother (...) while Scorpion is kidnapped and caged by a person she made an enemy out of prison. But Scorpion doesn't like spending time behind bars, and it's not long before she's back to doing what she does best. <br /> <br /> The movie goes well when we see Scorpion hacking the arm of a copper intent to take her back to prison. From there, the film drops a lot, and Beast Stable ends up being more of a drama than the two previous films. It is not to say that there are not many actions yet - Scorpion still spends a lot of time in "revenge mode" and the movie is not as short on general sleaze. Meiko Kaji again represents his role as the eerie title character, and it is another discreet, almost wordless achievement. Her screen presence is great, but she manages to have a threatening presence, even though they are only small physical ones. The plot structure of this film is similar to the other two, as it all relies on a raising of revenge. There are more people who have angered Scorpion in this movie than in the previous two, so this section takes up quite a large part of the movie. There are a few surreal sequences, not as many as in the first movie and not as close as in others, but the film remains in the rest of the series at that time. Overall, I would say that this film is between the first two in terms of quality - not as big as the original and slightly better than the other.
