I'm not sure if these other people saw the movie - some couldn't seem to follow the "complicated plot". He is a billionaire who owns an oil company that also happens with big game hunting - wow - it's really far taken. Any way - his new "drill" happens to break through a glacier, and on the other hand, a world is separated from our own time, where dinosaurs and cavemen roam. Nothing groundbreaking about this, but it's certainly not ridiculous. Yet the rest of the movie about this T-Rex they find (as the billionaire Boone claimed was there) is chasing them and them on the hunt. Look - it's an old made for TV movies - of course, the special effects look like they don't have CG - they did the best they could, and for an MFTVM they did a hell job for the time being. This movie needs to be restored to the big screen - I would love it and I would be the first in the queue. Seeing that dinosaur with modern special effects stalking these guys would be great!
