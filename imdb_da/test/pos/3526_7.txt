Well, unfortunately, I can't help but feel a little disappointed after my very, very much anticipated "Just Before Dawn" show. Jeff Lieberman is a great filmmaker and he can undoubtedly do good things with a small budget, but I still expected to see a far more sadistic and cruel early 80s slasher. But actually I start to think that Lieberman is not to blame for this, but we are gorehounds! It is more than obvious that Lieberman intended to resign from backwoods slasher to "Deliverance" and certainly not as "Friday the 13th" which hugely popularized the subgenre a year earlier. Fear and constant sense of threat comes primarily from the demented maniacs with their machetes, but from the real vicious and isolated Oregon forests where this film was shot. If the movie looks slow and unintentional, it is only because Lieberman takes his time to introduce the dark forests and spooky mountains as extra characters in his film. We rarely see the murderers, but there always seems to be someone who lures behind the trees or from under the mountain lakes. With this in mind, "Just Before Dawn" becomes a very admirable scare effort and in fact much better than its modern blood-woven counterparts. In the midst of an almost endless selection of gory and sickening slashers, Lieberman puts emphasis on excitement and character development. The reason is about five twenty some friends on their way to a camping holiday in Oregon woods, where one of them owns a small piece of land. The forest is deserted, and of course, campers ignore the forest ranger Roy's (George Kennedy!) Advice to return to civilization. Shortly afterwards, they brutally meet an inbred family, where the two sons have murderous tendencies. All five protagonists are surprisingly sympathetic and compelling! No annoying stereotypes that you don't feel sympathetic to anyway, such as erasing girls or soccer jackets. As a result of this "natural" character, you are automatically chasing them, even when they ultimately become savages themselves. The sublime camera work delivers the movie at a sometimes unbearable voltage level, and Brad Fiedel's chilling electronic scoring adds only this effect. "Just before Dawn" is a fine piece of early 80's horror as long as you don't want the blood to drip from your television set.
