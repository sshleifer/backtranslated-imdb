I recently discovered this amazing series and I just can't seem to get enough of Garner's laid back PI. The views continuously show excellent writing and exciting episodes. <br /> <br /> This episode, Sleight of Hand, is a little different. Foresight humor in favor of a more serious trip to Rockford when searching for his missing boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The mystique is amazing and it's unraveling is compelling enough. It is based on a book (can't remember the name) and it could easily have been stretched to a feature-length episode. Garner stands out here as Rockford gets tough and really does business. This has a "noir" feel to it, the dark lighting and the general mood echo the great dark thrillers of the 40s and 50s. <br /> <br /> Really good episode in a class A series. Deserves easy 10.
