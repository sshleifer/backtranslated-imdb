Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote quite a few Sherlock Holmes accounts, but the popularity of the famous detective assured that successors in both print and film would go far beyond the author's works. In "Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapons," Holmes, Basil Rathbone, patriotic British intelligence serves to ensure a Swiss scientist desperately needs bomb sightings. The film dates back to 1942, and I wonder if the producers and the authors realized how important bombsight secrets were (American nordic bombsight was guarded almost as eagerly as the new radar sets that would change the course of World War II). <br /> <Holmes and his faithful but expected bumbling companion, Dr. Watson, Nigel Bruce, Dr. Moriarty, Lionel Atwill. As evil as Moriarty has always been, it is a little shock to see that he is enrolled in Hitler. Does the man have nothing of decency? I do not think. But Atwill is really bad. The story is reasonably fast-paced as Holmes and Watson seek to recover stolen bombsight components before they can be delivered to a U-boat. Rathbone is his usual suave himself and several Holmsian aprons are well done. <br /> <br /> This and other 1940's Holmes stories are now available on DVD, and oldies.com has posted a very nice four-disc set in a wooden box: this movie is included with a bonus cd of an interview with the old Doyle. The set sells for about $ 26 in large DVD and CD stores, but I found this and other sets from oldies.com at a $ 14.98 warehouse club. The transfer is very good. <br /> <br /> Very nice and relaxing view. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
