Sandra Bullock paints a credible image as the distressed detective, but even though she is seen as a cynical man-demanding persecutor, he requires a step in faith (or two). The two creepy troubled children are exhibited adequately by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of trouble getting Ben Chaplin in the equation (the same problem arose when you saw 'The Truth About Cats & Dogs' (http://us.imdb.com/title/ tt0117979 /) I think that when you put an Englishman into an American movie, there should be a reason to put him there, so there shouldn't be an Englishman serving as a detective on a American police force Should there be no dialogue pointing to and explaining the rather obvious fact? Or even jokes that he is English? <br /> <br /> He looks out of place here, as he looked at place in 'The Truth About Cats & Dogs'. Producers should really notice what it distracts and annoys the audience (at least me). Nothing wrong with Chaplin's play, it's just a matter of making an actor who is 'out of place' trustworthy and not put him anywhere without a good reason or a story. <br /> <br /> lm: Well, thrillers, especially the dealin g in solving a complicated crime, require some suspension of disbelief. This one is no different; In fact, it requires a bit more effort than usual. To make Bullock smart enough to crack the case despite all the pressures that require her to get rid of it, some unrealistic assumptions are made about the evidence, and I am sure many people who looked at it had a moment of 'Come on, it's very unlikely under the circumstances' or even 'Hi, you can't mess up evidence to unpack this movie!'. <br /> <br /> As I said, reasonably entertaining and clapping. Just don't use this as required viewing for detective exams. There are no shortcuts there.
