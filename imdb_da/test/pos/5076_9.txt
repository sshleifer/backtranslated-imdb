The movie tackles it here and now scared of "extradition" with a multi-cast trans-global account of all involved. No one goes easy because we see the blind's blind, as they cut out their own piece of the worldwide game that chops and misery their "enemies" and even equally. The interaction between the sympathetic senator Aide (played in scintillating style by Peter Sarsgaard) and the real Washington power mongers are electrifying. Meanwhile, in the field, the new CIA man (Jake Gyllenhaal) goes through a sea change in his attitude to the new found cosiness of the United States with torture. Suddenly, even though his rejection of what he had originally tacitly condoned, one has to ask why in the world would anyone who calls himself civilized stand and see someone being humiliated and mistreated in this way? The movie has few heroes - perhaps Gyllenhaal's flawed and wobbly CIA man is the exception and a necessary indulgence to get the film a fate of hope. The sad fact is, of course, that this movie is not fiction at all, but a wake up to them with a sharpness of decency left in them. The terrible truth is that we in the United Kingdom and the United States have lost moral plot and this film shows how low we are ready to go. All this in the name of freedom! There is a wonderful line in the manuscript that says torture is a sure way to swell the numbers of our enemies. This is already happening in real life, and we need to listen to the announcement that this movie delivers and begins to use our power and money much more intelligently !! The message seems to be that any of us claiming that reproduction, torture and abuse of basic human rights are necessary to protect our lifestyle is as wrong and stultifyingly stupid as the jihadists and the suicide bombers. <br /> Everybody commends the senses of a talented South African director with an eye on the gross injustice of how power is exercised and a cast of principle mainstream actors from the United States and beyond. Oh, and by the way, the film has a turn in its tail with the end of a smart and thoughtful surprise (which I will not give away). <br /> <br /> I watched the movie in an early London preview, so it hasn't been written much yet, but I'm happy to say that the tide of less than glowing reviews seems to be reversing. The BBC review has been very strong in support and they (and I) suspect that many of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple specs of Hollywood - where the good people and the evil ones are cardboard cuts. That is why many of this year's really big movies are becoming more and more indie and / or non-american pix.
