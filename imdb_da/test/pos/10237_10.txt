Nightbreed is not only fantastic, it is also unique, even taking into account other Barker movies that never lack originality. An amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea to a book. For the horror genre, it has very few subtle symbols and references. Certainly very fun to have, a little to think about if you care. And not to forget, a good music score. Well, the special effects usually get old old faster than anything, but that is probably the only drawback. I've just seen it again after ten years, and I still find it something to recommend.
