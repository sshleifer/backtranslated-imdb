I'm a HUGE Tenacious D fan and I think it's not the funniest movie in the world, but the most entertaining one. It's not laugh-a-minute, but that's not what D intended to be. I went into the movie watching all the HBO shows, memorizing both albums, and making it even more enjoyable. Lots of interior jokes from previous Tenacious D-albums and HBO shows. When I knew the new album already, I knew 40 minutes of the movie because it is a musical comedy. I would say it has the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best last 5 minutes of any movie. Hands Down. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie now!
