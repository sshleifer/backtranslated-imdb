For those who have enjoyed Asterix books and movies, you will love this movie! Yes, I will admit that it mixes some of the books and movies, but the characters are brilliant, and not only people show their CGI left, right and center. I've already seen it several times and knocked off my socks. <br /> <br /> Of course, it contains the main heroes of Asterix (Astérix), Obelix (Obélix) and Dogmatix (Idéfix), but this time they have some new ones to deal with. <br /> <br /> With a sense of humor, the Gauls will continue and continue. Bless them.
