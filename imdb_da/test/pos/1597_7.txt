A movie to split his viewers. Just criticism points to its funeral pace, overused snap zooms and persistent, lingering gaze between the protagonists. Lawyers point to Dirk Bogarde's powerful performance and Pasqualino De Santis' benchmark photography in Venice. Altogether, this may indicate an indulgent romanticized elegance for the gay love nobility (at a time of 1971, when it became persistently legal). In fact, Visconti has succeeded in making a richer and more complex film than a single vehicle. He has knitted his ideas - sensitive and all - into a carefully paced bow. <br /> <br /> Inside, there is actually a central achievement for Bogarde's Aschenbach. Instead of a simulation, Johnny-come-lately gay, he manages to give a pathetic composer struck by tragedy and misunderstood integrity that sees salvation in Tadzio. His fascinating staggering around an ever better Venice after the boy is a right metaphor for the artist's patience for the truth in the teeth of the dilettant (and it is explicitly cut with such a feedback). <br /> <br /> Although Mahler's music may be a bit overused, it is well suited. The Italian overdub is a worn anachronism, but fortunately, the actor does not suffer too much. 10.7
