Although it won't give a more than previous post here (like Ruby Liang's very good) I would share my own point of view. Hope my English is understandable. Bon voyage is a rhythmic, light but deep presentation of the French disorganized down-down, but also courage and charm. Yet in an excellently reconstructed 1940s France with many details (from Bordeaux's luxury hotel occupied by the HQ and attacked by unusable high class French, to Parisian coffee near Le Pantheon / rue Mouffetard and 1930s cars) Gérard Depardieu and Yvan Attal gives their other roles a brilliant taste;) Isabelle Adjani and Virgnie Ledoyen are very credible in their drastically different roles, and Grégori Derangère makes an enchanting performance :) <br /> <br /> Much easier than average (e.g. American time of war movie and focused On the citizens, Bon voyage shows a lot of things about French problems (even to a French guy like me), some of them quite deep.
