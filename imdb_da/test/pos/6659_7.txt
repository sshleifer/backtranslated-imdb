This movie worked for me because I see this movie as a completely opposite of 'Gone With the Wind'. Farm owners instead of plantation owners. Scarlett fights and connives for what she wants Ada to become depressed and turns into herself until Ruby (Renee Zellweger) turns out to save the day. Sort of, around. Deserters instead of officers try to get back to their families, the lists continue and continue. Even the love story was the opposite. If this is what the manufacturer and the authors tried to get across, I succeeded. <br /> <br /> There are only two things I didn't like about the movie, the rest I thought was well done, and I liked it enough to recommend it to friends. First, I could not see the attraction between Inman, (Jude Law) and Ada, (Nicole Kidman) being strong enough for Inman to desert to come back to her. Inman said he had only written to her a few times when Ada almost wrote to him. Secondly, something or someone who was killed or dying in almost all scenes was a little over. I must say it was full of action because of it, but after the second scene I knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene. I like being surprised by the next scene, not knowing what to do before it does. <br /> <br /> I thought all the plays were very well done, with Zellweger the best. She deserved the credit she got for it. I thought she played part of the hillbilly girl very well. She must have done her homework on that side. Zellweger even said in the film that she was wiser than people thought she was. I think it was true. The law did well with its part with everything he had to go through to get back to Kidman. It must have been a much stronger love to go through all that I thought it was. Now he showed many feelings in his face during his attempts. Kidman's part may have had something to do with choosing her performance after the other two. Except when she was depressed, she didn't show much emotion, I don't know if that was how the part was written, or if it was how she perceived that part. She still did a good job, I just thought the other two were better. <br /> <br /> I liked the scene with Zellweger, Kidman and the cock, even though it was one of the scenes I mentioned above. I thought "Home Guard" was exactly as they probably were back then. Although we didn't hear much about them, they were part of that time. I thought the scenery was beautiful. The movie had everything needed to be a good historical romance.
