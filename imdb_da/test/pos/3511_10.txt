I first saw this afternoon in the 80s on the network T.V. I think I was like 9. (The picture today sees a violent horror flick on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later, and that's as I remembered, it's really good, scary flick. I think the reason why it may have gone unnoticed is because it was not followed by a **** load of successors, ie. Friday the 13th. But it's one of the movies that takes the original idea and makes it better. Although this is a murderer in the forest ticket as Friday, it has more in common with the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is because the film puts a certain atmosphere and sense of fear even in the broad daylight. And the killers feel more threatening than Friday. There is also a good amount of voltage. I recommend seeing it now as it will be released on DVD at the end of July.
