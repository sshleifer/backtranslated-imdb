Jim Henson always seemed to put wonderful TV shows. Unfortunately, this was one of the shortest lived. It was endearing to hear every story with their lovely morals. Each episode was a new story with new characters. John Hurt did a wonderful job of playing the narrator, and the sarcastic tone of Brian Henson as the dog was always fun. <br /> <br /> The set designs and costumes were very well done. The Muppet work, when required, is the classic Jim Henson work. You know it's a Muppet, but it's more than forgiving. You find yourself enchanted and forced. When each episode comes to an end, you realize that you were totally entertained. A entertained person who fulfills, not the kind of wear after a moment. You lean back and think about each episode and realize that each story is actually timeless and presents a strong story of morality. I have not yet shown this to my own children, but it is actually a series it is more than family entertainment. I ask you to find it on DVD and clean it up. If you can't do that, just find it a little how.
