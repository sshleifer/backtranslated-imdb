It's such an exciting documentary, it was by far one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I recommend it to anyone. It is so much fun to watch different musical styles, exciting people at the junction of modern and traditional, Istanbul, and great filmography capturing beautiful scenes in Istanbul and Thrace. Watching the movie made me book a trip to Istanbul right away. Great footage of Ceza, a Turkish rapper. <br /> <br /> Also his sister, Ayben rapping - she's amazing. <br /> <br /> Priceless performances by amazing Turkish musicians Orhan Gencebay, Sezen Aksu, Muzeyyen Senar. <br /> <br /> The wonderful atmosphere of Aynur, sang in Kurdish. <br /> <br /> And great clarinet and signing of a Roman gypsy group from Thrace. Last but not least, Istanbul bands mix Turkish music and rock, as well as trance music - Baba Zula, Orient Expressions, Duman and others ...
