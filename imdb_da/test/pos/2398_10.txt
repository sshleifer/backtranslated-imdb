I just saw Eddie Monroe and I was very impressed. The story was easily paced when the plot was excavated to a surprise. Heartwarming performances, action, humor and drama filled the screen. Topnotch works by some talented Long Islanders. Great script. This is the best movie that Fred Carpenter has made to date, he should be very proud of this work. Doug Brown's score is on the mark. Craig Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. It's hard to believe this is a low budget, independent movie. Imagine what Carpenter can do with a Hollywood level budget. Paul Regina's last film and he is very much missed and loved by everyone. He was a wonderful, successful, talented actor and a great man. He will look over all of us and we will never forget his dynamic smile and spirit. Great job for anyone who participated in this movie. A few valued scene steals and humorous cameos break up the serious content. You will enjoy this movie, watch it!
