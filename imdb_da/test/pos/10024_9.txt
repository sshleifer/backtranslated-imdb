Although I can't tell if Larry Hama has ever seen any of the old cartoons, I would like to write cartoons, file cards, and some of the comics would count on something. <br /> <br /> For fans of the old cartoon, it's pretty much a continuation of the same, except with a few new characters - and a more insane Cobra Commander. <br /> <br /> We still have all the old favorites too, but on a personal note, one thing that always annoyed me was this "Duke in charge" thing when there are tons of other * officers * around instead. The fighting sequences also resemble the old series; The most important trick here seems to be CGI. It's generally pretty good, if not a little over-the-top.
