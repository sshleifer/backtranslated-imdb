The world will miss John Frankenheimer. This was his first feature film, and it was four years before he directed his second, but don't let it stop you from finding it. Frankenheimer's direction is assured, and he gets some convincing ideas outside his throw. Everybody else has pointed to them, but I also want to talk to James Gregory and Whit Bissell in two key supporting roles. Both would work for Frankenheimer again - Gregory most like the bumbling senator in "The Manchurian Candidate" - and they do good work for him here. <br /> <br /> If it all seems too simple in the end, it's just because Frankenheimer and author Robert Dozier chose to tell a simple story and they are doing well. Watch it - Turner Classic Movies can only show it again.
