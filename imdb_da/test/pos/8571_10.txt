Topless touch football !! A wet t-shirt contest !! A jockstrap raid !! This "SheAnimal House" has it all. Except for a plot and good actors. The film consists of several pranks and catfights between H.O.T.S. girls and bitchy PI house. Dialouge is a scream and the soundtrack is sublime brilliant. Over the past few months, it has popped up over cable, so do yourself a favor and watch out. H.O.T.S. is so bad, it's good!
