The railway children are perhaps my favorite movie all the time, just for the brilliant play, the warm human interaction between the 3 children and the people they encounter live close to the railroad in the beautiful English countryside. Jenny Augutter is especially credible in her role as 'Bobbie' the older sibling of her sister Phyllis and brother Peter. The adventures they discover and the relationships formed in their new homes and neighborhoods are very genuine and fascinating. The landscape is lovely, the trains part of Britain's great history and the soundtrack is very moving. This heartwarming film never fails to bring tears to my eyes every time I get home. I often wonder if I should have been born in the era that I think I would have fitted as well as people treated each other with such chivalry and decency. In short, I consider this film something of a masterpiece and a must see for anyone who considers himself a 'sensitive or caring type'. Eith Nesbit wrote this story around the early 1900s and what a wonderful story it is. Several children today have to read this or watch the movie instead of playing violent video games. If we had more movies of this kind, the world would be a better place.
