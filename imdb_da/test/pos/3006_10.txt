I loved this show. I was waiting to get out on DVD .... it never did. Does anyone know how to get the show available on DVD? I have contacted Lifetime TV and a few others and nothing. Let me know if there is a way we can get this series on DVD. I would be first in line to buy it. I got really hooked on this show. I don't understand how a lot of other TV shows are available on DVD, but not every day now. I am sure there are many of us out there who would love to have this series on DVD or even VHS. I was thinking of contacting the production company. Has anyone out there tried to contact anyone for this information?
