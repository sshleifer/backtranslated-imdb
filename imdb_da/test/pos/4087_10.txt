Like some people I love / love Stingers! In Norway, it was sent much later. It also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yes that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers may be on the series (except from Grey's Anatomy), which I really see! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personally, I think she is one of the best access we have! I know he's not SUPER-known, but she's really a great actress! Stingers makes me a policeman! I love it! <br /> <br /> PS: Do you know if you can buy the episodes?
