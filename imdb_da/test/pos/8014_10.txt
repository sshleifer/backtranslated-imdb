That's why it's important to talk about the DVD release instead of just the movie. Narratives from Crapper is a film that only a studio in the world could deliver. Who has brought us innovative and original REAL independent films for 30 plus years now: Troma. This is really a very special movie because it manages to be definitely not my favorite in the Troma productions, but is released on a disc that because of what I just said is one of my most appreciated and favorite DVDs is. Not only do the countless Troma disks I own count but count my entire collection of movies. The movie itself is the result of a bad plan to produce a television series to be led by a director entrusted with a substantial amount of money (especially for Troma) to do something wonderful and delivered very unfinished and incomprehensible material before completing (or be fired, I'm not sure what at the moment). To avoid pushing a big investment into the toilet, Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz decided to put together a team of directors and actors and use the material as the backbone of a movie. A movie that really consists of two, in the beautiful old Tales From The Crypt antology mode, hosted by Crapkeeper, played by Mr Kaufman himself. But as I said, not my own favorite of all their movies. This is largely due to a strange sense of discipline on the various sets, forgetting the tough Troma rule of "no alcohol on the set", which was discovered by a furious Lloyd and other less respectable employees whom Troma had at the time of the film they added scenes. All this made it impossible for Mr Kaufman to make a worthy product in the editing room. But Lloyd Kaufman is a genius, and with the disturbed scenes for an already missed start product, he did not create much less a masterpiece. The film itself is as good as the circumstances would allow the most brilliant filmmaker to cut together, and it is certainly very entertaining, totally confusing, loaded with the elements that made Troma amazing and certainly unique and unique. As a movie itself, but not as brilliant as many other Troma productions. However, the enjoyment of Independent Cinema made the DVD of this movie so much more than a release of a movie with some extras. The movie is when push comes to push, in fact only part of the whole DVD, which is in its entirety a document of the difficult situation, sees serious filmmakers in having to survive in a world monopolized by the few very large, which do not allow really other players in their market demand. A document of the problems you have when relying on people at the level, only to find that freedom is sometimes something difficult to live up to and realize that access to a movie budget is When the boss is not around, can even destroy those who should really know better. The brilliance of this DVD is that the film is not perfect and that Lloyd KNOWS, and does not want to make anyone believe he thinks it is. The full comment is a show in itself (as is often the case with Mr. Kaufan's audio commentary), blending humor, cheating on those who deserve it and very interesting information for anyone interested in Independent Film-making in such a way that Watching the movie again with this comment right after seeing it on its own benefits is so interesting that it's hard to stop. The feature length documentary THE THICK BROWN LINE takes us behind the scenes at the various sites where Lloyd only visits the sets to sometimes take over and make the most of what he finds there. We see him somewhat disillusioned sometimes, different from his appearances in other Making Of Documents such as speed of darkness and apocalypse soon, both of which are in the to-own Make Your Own DAMN MOVIE box set. <br /> <br /> They added scenes with James Gunn (who started his career at Troma to find success as a writer and now a director in Hollywood) and Trey Parker (again someone to start with a Troma-released work , later to be a national hero with its South Park series) is entertaining and probably (as is much more so in this edition) a reason to obtain this disc alone for anyone who is far interested in the work of these two characters. Charged with much more than I could mention here (including another audio comment), this is one of the best Troma DVD releases.
