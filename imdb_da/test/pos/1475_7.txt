Ah! When good actors take on soft material! If you think of this movie as a tight policeman, you may be disappointed. Although the situations are very true to life, the plot goes on a very predictable clip, and you can see what's going on before the actors take you there. Many of the criminal and secondary characters are really just stereotypes in progress. Much of the dialogue is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> But! If you love watching good actors rise above this kind of material and do some of it, then you will love this movie! Sam Elliott is nothing short of brilliant in taking the detective Falon's one-tone character alive with depth and pathos. Those of you who have never seen Elliott emote that far beyond his usual scowling stoicer will be delighted with the range of emotions he portrays in this movie. And also in his early fifties in this movie he looks amazing! His naked breast stage gives hope to middle-aged men everywhere! Esai Morales does a wonderful job raising her role as that. Falon's eager beaver new police partner. He could easily have played it as a Robin to Elliott's Batman, but instead he breathed a authenticity and passion into this role. He makes it work despite some of the lame lines he gets to say. <br /> <br /> Paul Sorvino is fun to watch! He plays the eccentric police captain. He seems to know he is slumbering in this movie and has a ball that does it. He makes it fun for us too. <br /> <br /> This movie is very by-the-numbers in plot, but makes it a great show! Sam Elliott fans should definitely get this one as it sucks a kick to see him spread his wings and do so much more than he usually is allowed to do!
