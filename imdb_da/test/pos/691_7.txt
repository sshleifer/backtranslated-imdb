If you are in the midst of a wild war and it is still not clear that you are going to get to the top, among the things you want to worry about is to stop civilian morals ... to demonstrate our troops have the courage, the resourceful and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause. And that's just what director Anthony Asquith gave the British with the 1943 marine war film, We Dive at Dawn. After more than 60 years, it is not surprising that some of the film is dated. It does not help that class typotypes that help define the hired men from the officers can crush. Here, as in so many other British war films, the men always have thick regional accents of the working class, while the officers speak to a well-educated liquid who will place them at home in England's finest ruling establishments. In this movie, Freddie Taylor (John Mills), the captain of the Sea Tiger submarines, is clever, confident, resourceful, aggressive, in control, good with his men, humorous with his peers, quick to make a decision. And it helps him to succeed. His men are jolly tars, mostly, competent for their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense. While we are using the first third of the film to get to know these people while on vacation, it quickly gets excited. <br /> <br /> Taylor and his part are ordered to destroy Brandenburg, a new German battleship. They just miss the ship when it enters the Kiel Canal and leads into the Baltic Sea. Taylor assesses the risks and decides that sea tiger will go after it, through my fields, anti-subnet and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to the home base. After several tense situations, the confrontation takes place. The Sea Tiger can loosen six torpedoes, but must dive, not know if it had done its job. After a clever subterfuge Taylor surpasses a couple of German destroyers, but then it realizes that there is not enough fuel. He plans to scuttle his under and surrender, just at the last minute, James Hobson (Eric Portman), a sailor who had been hungry and a single family, and who speaks German, says there is a small Danish coastal town that had been the fuel depot. He thinks it can still be for the Germans. The last third of the film is a shocking action sequence like the crew of the sub-trials to keep the Germans far enough to pump in enough fuel to bring Sea Tiger back to Britain. This is a wartime propaganda film, so don't expect to fail. And did the sea tiger actually put Brandenburg down? Are the men reunited with their wives and lovers? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and little son who left him smiling for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have a chance to make use of all the female names in her little black book? You have to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. Some, like Powell and Pressburger's One of Our Aircraft are missing, and 49-Parallel, still stand to see today because the stories are solid and unexpected, and the creators didn't use obvious shorthand clichés. Others who we dive at dawn were made with enough clichés that when we see, we must remind ourselves of how much time was when the film was made. Nevertheless, Asquith can build a lot of excitement even with a few clichés. The seaweed's compelling path through a subnet was tense. The Brandenburg stalking and the plot needed for the torpedo shooting were realistic; John Mills no-nonsense attitude, while willing to attack, was well managed. The fake preparations to make Sea Tiger look like it had been devastated by depth loads, were as realistic both inside and outside as you could hope for, and the fuel tank struggle was dramatic and exciting. We Dive that Dawn is not a classic war movie, but it is a well-crafted, well-run example of its type and time. <br /> <br /> It's worth noting, John Mills had a long, long career. Especially in the 50s, he played in a series of serious mind-blowing films looking back on these WWII days. He had the quality of showing grin, cheerfulness and perseverance, but also being credible could a man England be proud of when he fought for the war. Top image in this movie was Eric Portman, a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold that you would like to put on a sweater. Everyone underneath is very much in fun but stiff-upper-lip mode, but Portman manages some complexity for his character. Mills and Portman did great jobs together on this movie.
