During the Sci-Fi TZ marathon on January 31, 1999, this episode was the last to be sent in the 20th century in my time zone (Eastern). It was New Year's Eve, and when the clown begins to sing, "We're here because we're here because we're here because we're here ..." I realized this was TZ's clever nod to it was New Year's Eve because it melody is also the melody of old long sight. Coincidence? We never know. <br /> <br /> I love this story for the little touches: The tear of the ballerina, the cloister of the monasteries, and the hardest end in the head. This and Art Carney Santa TZ are the only ones about Christmas. <br /> <br /> My personal top five episodes, after five characters ...: 1. The Hunt 2. The After Hours 3. The Hitchhiker 4. The Single 5. Little Girl Lost
