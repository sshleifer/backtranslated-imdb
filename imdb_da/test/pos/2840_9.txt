This movie can only make you cooooo. The movie was well worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger) is the only "acceptable" soap group out there. Her character is so charming and so convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness that she is such a deaf person. I can even allow myself to get lost in Betty's wonderful imagination if it wasn't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George ... And talk about the devil; "Looker" Greg Kinnear completes his role very well. While Charlie (Morgan Freeman) makes you want his wish to be true, Wesley (Chris Rock) makes you tie him to a chair. And Rosa (Tia Texada) takes you back to these brilliant class-school friendships. The sheriff encourages you to feed him donuts and lose his name. The rest of the molding fits well. Never one to do the same movie twice, the nurse Betty is the exception. One of those long, cold ones needs to smile on some winter days.
