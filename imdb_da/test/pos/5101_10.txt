I wish I was first exposed to this in a movie theater when it was first released, as some of the commentators had been. It's really a treasure. To be fair I have not seen any other version of goodbye, Mr. Chips and I don't want to. For me this is a perfect version. I saw it first on TCM years ago and never forgot it. I had the pleasure of seeing it with my boyfriend yesterday, even though I had recorded it from TCM days earlier. There were parts of the movie where we were both foggy, it's really a moving movie. <br /> <br /> And shouldn't that be what movie is about? <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful, the movie was shot wonderfully. The action is top notch. And the story is delicate and timeless. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite full-time movies.
