It was such a good movie. It was done with such a beautiful design, such symmetry. I love the way classical music ties in with the classical art on earth, space and beyond. It was such a fluid and thoughtful masterpiece. I loved the way the monoliths never changed, even though primate, land and space did. I loved how it was a question of "Do you need me / us now"? The film expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, finesse, gentleness, courage and innocence. What more could you ask for from a clean movie? Maybe a complement movie. Everybody acknowledges in 2001: A Space Odyssey finds the movie 2010 is the 2001 complementary film. 2010 is more history oriented than 2001.
