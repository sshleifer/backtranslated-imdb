The minutiae of what is involved in performing a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all hoist films. Then there is the robbery itself, a wordless, thirty-minute nail bits that have never been exceeded, followed by what is probably the cinema's most pronounced example of disgrace among twenty when things begin to spectacularly breed and we undoubtedly have the greatest of all hoist film. <br /> <br /> This was a tough and unentimental movie, as it was first shown in 1955, and it is as tough and unentimental today. (It shows some of the brutal brutality in Dassin's former "Brute Force"). There is not a great moment or duff performance throughout the movie, and Dassin captures the environment of seedy clubs and Parisian back streets as no one else and the final drive through Paris of a dying man is one of the most iconic closed sequences of any movie. A classic.
