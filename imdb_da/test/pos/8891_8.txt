Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) has a crazy life: His wife (Kate Mulgrew) stole his book and left him, he has a new budding romance with a girl named Beth (Kim Greist), he doesn't know how to start his book and his students on their screen writing class are strangers than most. But a student (Danny DeVito) is extra strange. He lives with his evil Momma (Anne Ramsey), and he can't get up to killing her. So than he goes to Larry for help, his life goes from normal crazy to extra crazy! <br /> <br /> Stu Silver should have done more! The dialogue, the characters, the entire script is almost perfect! And Danny DeVito has proven to me that he is more than a great actor: he is a great instructor! His children's film Matilda is among my favorite family films, and now this is one of my favorite comedies. It's a black comedy, most jokes are about murder, but it's fun fun! All the players have their full potential, whether they are protagonists (Billy Crystal) or just a little lesser character (Olivia Brown). <br /> <br /> If you like comedy (Who doesn't?) than you would like this! 8/10 stars.
