Alan Alda usually plays characters that are too "soft" and too verbal - that's probably how he really lives. This time he fits the character. Even if he takes over when the judgment is handed over. The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the state of New York's response are remembered by many of us as a frightening event. Few journalists have told the true story. This movie gives a quick look at the horrors and surprises associated with the Attica uprising / rebellion. Attica had great influence on this country. Perhaps the film will stimulate someone to investigate the story. <br /> <br /> I can't remember a feature film made from the prisoners' perspective - even though there is a good PBS piece with the actual Attica survivors / participants. The perspective of the guards held hostage is explored in "Against The Wall" with Kyle MacLachlan, Samuel L. Jackson, Clarence Williams III, and Frederic Forrest. <br /> <br /> Back in the day, we screamed, "Attica! Attica!" It was nice to hear it in the movie. Carried memories. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie is the natural wigs Morris Chestnut and the other African Americans have to wear. It would have been easy for these people to cultivate a 'Fro.
