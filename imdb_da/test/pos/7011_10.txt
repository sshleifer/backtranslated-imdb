It's fun how time passed and never saw this movie ... 'until last week when I was just like a spell. I saw it twice a week and it was still not enough. It's a great movie and I love to watch it again. The story is great and it really moved me. I would love to live such a story. The actors are good, the music too, and you can dream of your own love story. I just hope that someday I will find the opportunity to learn to dance like Johnny and Baby. I feel like dancing connects people and brings them together. I think people should learn to dance ... it helps a lot, especially in a relationship. It's great to feel the dance in your blood and in your body.
