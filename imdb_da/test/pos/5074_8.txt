Think of it as an extreme form of detention without trial. Without commenting and taking a page on US foreign policy, the process of extraordinary transfer involves taking persons suspected of terrorist activities to a foreign country, as opposed to extradition, if you wish, to a place where torture is not a crime, but one means of illegal information. Instead of dying your soil with the blood of potentially innocent parties, you do it in a foreign country where such tactics are accepted interrogation techniques. Of course, in keeping with the severity of the tactics and attempts to break down a person, sometimes you will get what you want when you dispute the resistance, or get nothing, or worst of all, get a confession just because the mind has been broken to the point that the subject will accept what you say. It is an ugly process and what better way to do it when you are the master's human rights, and allows the neck to use the means necessary to protect more lives at a time when information is the key to the fight against terror and does It is in a country where probably the rights record is questionable. <br /> <br /> Publishing is this year's Syriana, but during the New Year we have a number of political thriller competitors to take that crown, with Rendition primarily followed by Robert Redford's film Lions for Lambs starring Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep (again, but now on the other side of the fence) and the Kingdom with Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner, though this would probably turn out to be more action-driven. Directed by Gavin Hood, who made Tsotsi and wants to halve the new Wolverine spin, Rendition is a decent thriller with a top notch cast in a narrative that has proved to be quite popular these days - split, giving an ample difference Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), a chemical engineer, is on the way to returning home under orders from CIA top brass Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep). At a detention center outside of the United States, Jake Gyllenha's CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (his so prophetic) begins his very first interrogation session, no doubt being put in a position he did not join. At home, a very pregnant Reese Whitherspoon is vigorously seeking answers to her husband's disappearance and sought the help of a former flame Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard) when working for Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin). Throw in J.K. Sinmmons, a terrorist plot study and a budding forbidden love story between Fatima (Zineb Oukach) and Khalid (Moa Khouas), you have a lot going on in a busy picture. <br /> <br /> Given a number of releases, rankings, timelines and the like, Rendition was not confusing at all, and it plays out with clever handling of the material, never quickly judging, presenting ideas and thoughts from both sides of the equation. Each character has its own agenda, and the disclosure of this agenda probably does not involve carrying or confusing you. And the best part of it all is how they really bow to self-preservation in various forms, and ultimately in various loss-lost situations unfortunately. It also kept you guessing - he or she didn't and asked your mind all the time about whether Anwar deserved what he got. It took advantage of an extremely smart hand quality that I could not see until it was too late (so the credit goes), even though it yielded to the usual stereotypes of terrorist militants and without spending much time exploring their motivations. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it has not found a need as there are so many movies out there that already touch the base of this problem (Paradise Now, Day Night Day Night, Syriana itself). Although it turned out to be rather one-dimensional (personal tragedy to bind bombs to become a suicide bomber), I felt that Rendition did it right, as it did not give any saccharin sweet end that this fight against negative destructive ideology is nothing It can be solved in a two-hour movie, and I'm glad it managed such adventure disorders. <br /> <br /> What we have instead is a well-crafted narrative that puts your guns on the problem of rendition and enough to rub discussion when the lights come on, which camp you belong to - support you serious pain in interrogation? Yes or no? This is the quintessential issue of our time. Yes or no? (OK, I'm already geared up for Lions for lamb)!
