Series as a whole - Jim Henson's best work. John Hurt * is * the storyteller. Often, the Oscar caliber shows, not surprisingly, when you are thinking of making Minghella write. The Oscar caliber appears, always. <br /> <br /> Tomorrow's Morning - Everyone loves the 'Soldier and Death', but something about 'Somsorrow' pushes it to a higher one in my favor. In the first ballroom scene, costumes, music - perfection. Hurt and the dog are typically semi-interacting with the story, but this time Minghella presses the extra notch in the 'ring' scene between Hurt and Sapsorrow. The chemistry between characters is especially well-developed, more than usual in the series, compared to the friendship between Straggletag and the prince. Seen it? See it again. Be more attentive (to those of you who are not fanatically adoring this 22 minute biographical perfection). Have you never seen it? I'm so sorry. Luck Child - not as sophisticated as Sapsorrow, but very smart in itself. This is a story of irony. Irony on irony, in irony ... I love it. Each character is perfected, except for the ferry. He made drama; everyone else made romantic comedy. I forgive him. This is my favorite of the primarily comic episodes, 'Somsorrow' and 'The Soldier and Death' are examples of more dramatic episodes. Page note: Greek myths. What is lacking in Minghella subtlety (different writer), it is partly in boldness, as it portrays the four selected myths with more sympathy and respect and history than it is common. Also check out Jim Henson Hour if you can get your hands on it. For Storyteller adicts, it contains The Man Himself introduces the myths, the lion from 'True Bride' and ... No annoying opening theme! Half-time narrator, half clean, pristine muppet white.
