I first saw this movie as a teenager when it came out in theaters, far back then. To see it again, almost 30 years later, I was surprised at how well it has stopped. Gags are still fun, the interaction between characters works well, and cameos come out better than ever. (Steve Martin has to be the best.) My kids (9, 11 and 14) all loved it and the music is good enough to still buzz the songs many days later. <br /> <br /> I would suggest that before watching the movie, see at least half a dozen episodes of the Muppet Show to get a sense of the back story behind the characters, otherwise the movie won 'I don't do that much.
