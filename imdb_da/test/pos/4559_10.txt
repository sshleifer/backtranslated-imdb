It turns out that Chris Farley and David Spade only made three films together ("Coneheads", "Tommy Boy" and "Black Sheep"), but this was really the "Citizen Kane" of their mating. Farley plays Thomas Callahan III, the immersed heir to an auto party firm. His father Big Tom (Brian Dennehy) hires mild-tempered Richard Hayden (David Spade) to take care of him. Big Tom gets married to a "ten" (Bo Derek), so everything must be fine. After Big Tom suddenly dies, Tommy and Richard must try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from bankruptcy. From then on, the movie is basically an excuse for Chris Farley to do what he does best: make a mess of everything. <br /> <br /> When this movie first appeared in the theaters, I saw it with my grandfather. He found out that Bo Derek and the Rob Lowe characters hid something. But you can completely ignore it and just immerse yourself in Chris Farley's antics. Nothing is surely about his stomach, and hell has no fury as his happy lucky attitude. The scene where he puts the cars on fire and later deer scene makes it a pure laugh lift. Chris Farley and David Spade were really John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd from their era. It is a pleasure to always be able to think of "Fat guy in a little coat" over and over again.
