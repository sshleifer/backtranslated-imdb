Greta Garbo stars in 'Anna Christie', a very early 1930 MGM 'talkie', the first time 'Garbo Talks'. 'Anna Christie' is a powerful movie, but not for everyone. The film is recorded as a stage play, short on set and filmography, long on dialogue and dramatic characterizations. Eugene O'Neil, who wrote the play 'Anna Christie' is known for her dark work and Garbo's character. Anna Christie is a gloomy figure with a tortured past. <br /> <br /> The sound quality of the DVD was mediocre. It doesn't help being that George F. Marion, who plays Anna's alien father, Chris Christofferson, is verbally difficult to understand. Marion gives a good performance as the old drunk sailors, who are insane with their fixation of the evil 'devil's sea'. But his dialogue is written with a very heavy Swedish accent, which is true for O'Neil's original games. Marie Dressler's dialogue as Marthy Owens is just as difficult to understand. Dressler believably portrays a broken down old drunk women, a "wharf rat". Her dialogue is also true for O'Neil's original play, just as Charles Bickford is the Irish sailor, Matt Burke, who pursues Anna in an uneasy relationship. Garbo is actually the easiest to understand. <br /> <br /> The strong point of the movie is Greta Garbo. She delivers a gut-breaking performance as a victim of neglect and abuse, leading to a prostitution life. Garbo was a great star at that time and is considered one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. Here, her appearance is not glamorous, it is tortured. Her posture almost forces her into pain. She scratches her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen. Garbo conveys these anxious feelings to the viewer to convince us of her misery. <br /> <br /> This is dark topic and Garbo brings it to life. It's not easy fare, not fun, not for everyone. 'Anna Christie' is strong emotion elaborated from the depth to the exam, it's a helluva ride.
