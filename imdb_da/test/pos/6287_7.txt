I've been through several Pauly Shore movies, but that's the only one I've seen. Of course, it helps that he is much less annoying than usual, maybe even a little sympathetic. The rest of the throw does a fine job, especially underestimated Carla Gugino. The film itself is basically a harmless and silly comedy, and although some of the jokes are particularly fun, the film is quite entertaining in general.
