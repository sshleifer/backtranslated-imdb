Forget all the spy movie you've ever seen - such as life in the Soviet Union, and are still many places in Russia and the former Soviet countries. Vera dreams of the life of leisure as she imagines the West to be; her reality is very different, with a bitter mother, a violent father and the always present alcohol. And her prospects for the future are not much better. She finds a man, and they try to patch a life together, but he is affected by the same environment, both socially and physically. The scenery of this movie is brilliant, sitting comfortably in post apocalyptic movies, but of course made with no special effects they have just entered and shot what happened to be in front of the camera. Forget your stereotypical, cold Russians of spy movies. This is Real Deal: people are passionate, vibrant and present in a way you will never see in a drama from the West.
