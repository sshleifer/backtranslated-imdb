I first saw The Couch Trip (1988) on television broadcast years ago and immediately fell in love with it. The funny thing is that I usually catch all the comedies that are made, but have never even heard of this before I saw it. Dan Ackroyd is pure and simpley hillarious period. He has made some good movies with Belushi and don't forget Saturday Night Live. But I think Couch Trip is probably his best and most fun. With a well-supported cast by Charles Grodin, David Clennon and Walter Matthau, this piece of cinema shines with comic gold. Ackroyd's wife Donna Dixxon does a good job here. My favorite moments in the film include Ackroyd and David Clennon's character Lawrence Baird. The two played well together. So if you haven't seen a good comedy for a while, take a trip back to 1988 and rent or buy The Couch Trip. I just did, Amazon 78 cents. What a bargain I was hit with a 2.50 shipping fee. Oh, it's still well worth it. Any guy will love this flick check it out.
