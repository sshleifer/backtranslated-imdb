The film, although not true to the original novels, manages to create modern gothic vampire views. Someone tried to offend QotD and call it a 1.5 hour music video clip. In fact, it's a complement. The ever-present gothic music combined with the music-video-like images made the film so moody - and "Queen of the Damned" is a mood-driven story. <br /> <br /> I don't understand the dead fans complaining about the changes of history. The reason has been changed to be less confusing to viewers who do not know the novels. The number of characters had been diminished, and I have no trouble changing Lestat's maker or skipping Mecca's character. The biggest change - the romance in Lestat and Jesse - seemed a very nice addition to me. <br /> <br /> In fact, I believe a faithful adaptation would be a complete failure. The slow and gloomy mood that was perfect for XIXth century New Orlean and Louis's anxiety would not suit Lestat's rebellion and his music. And while the book may be slow, descriptive and combine several elements, yet convey them well, the film simply cannot do so without being chaotic. "Vampire Lestat" and "Queen of the Queen" can be divided into at least three films - the creators had to choose something. <br /> <br /> Some of the special effects like flying or going out of the flames were the only things I really didn't like in this movie. But Akasha's death was very nice. The shock was good, Stuard Townsend was convincing as Lestat, especially at the concert, but I preferred Banderas as Armand. I loved Jesse, Maharet and Marius. And of course, Aaliyah was perfect with his quasi-ancient-Egyptian accent. So if you are in gothic music and vampire dillemas of loneliness and eternity (and you don't consider books as movie scenarios) "The Queen of the Damned" is one of the few films that show vampires as nothing more than blood-sucking monsters. But please compare it to the "Interview" movie. It has a completely different style, as much as Louis and Lestat. Personally, I find it exciting first to see a vampire's existence from Louis' "bottled hunger" point of view and then switch to a devoid of all morality but surprisingly outgoing for a vampire, Lestat. <br /> <br /> I'd give "Queen" 8 out of 10, as it had some technical flaws, but I decided to give it 9 because it is very undervalued by people who simply hate it because it didn't match their vision of the books, which can clearly be seen by looking at the voting of the votes.
