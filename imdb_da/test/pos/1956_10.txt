I really have no complaints about this movie, except for the disturbing scenes with the body. I fell on it while switching TV at night. Actually, the action was amazing, I didn't expect to be better than it seemed! I thought Keanu's (which looks the same since 1986, which is a very good thing hehe) acting was really * great *, and Crispin played his character perfectly! This movie is a hidden gem! It is a new awakening of reality to the 80s compared to the other teenagers made by the abrupt pack (though I also like them). All in all, I give up my thumbs up!
