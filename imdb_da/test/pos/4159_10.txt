GOLDEN DOOR (NUOVOMONDO) is the finest movie for this year to date. It is a masterpiece of concept, writing, rule, acting and film. More importantly, this brilliant beautiful film is a much-needed mirror-mirror for us to see the immigration history of "foreigners" to America at a time when the very word "borders" is a political safeguard. Writer / Director Emanuele Crialese has not only given us an in-depth story, he has also given us a touch limit for viewers to visit the story of each of our origins: with the exception of the Indians, we all came into America as "foreigners" at a time in our stories, and it is humble to see this movie with the fact in mind. <br /> <br /> In the turn of the century, the film opens Sicily as the poor-born widow Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his brother Angelo (Francesco Casisa) climb a rocky hill to present their tokens on the cross to ask for a sign whether to continue to fight for existence on the island or go to America, the dreamland. Mancuso's deaf silly son Pietro (Filippo Pucillo) runs to the top of the hill with postcards he has found with pictures of America (money growing on trees, fruits and vegetables bigger than humans, etc.), and Salvatore accepts this as a sign that he should move his family to America. After convincing his reluctant mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) and his sister Rita (Federica De Cola) and Rosa (Isabella Ragonese) to make the trip, he sells his only possessions (two donkeys, goats and rabbits) and the man with the boat arranges Their trip provides family shoes, appropriate clothing and instructions to board an ocean liner as third-class passengers. As the Mancuso family prepares on board, they are asked for a photograph, and as they stand behind a painted set, an English woman Lucy / Luce (Charlotte Gainsbourg) goes into the picture as if she were part of this peasant family. Lucy can't board the boat to America without a male escort. The voyage begins and Luce in her gentle way identifies with the Mancuso family and finally strengthens her safe passage by suggesting Salvatore to marry her 'for convenience, not for love' when they arrive in America. Through a violent storm and living conditions that are terrible poor, they survive many triple class passengers, ties and eventually come to Ellis Island, their belief in America being fulfilled. But everyone has to pass hard physical tests, extinguish and even intelligence testing to determine if they can enter America: the officials tell them that America will not have genetically inferior people into the new world! Every woman must be chosen by a man to marry Ellis Island before they get access. The way the Mancuso family remains united until a somewhat surprising ending is the end of the story. <br /> <br /> Few of us understand the strict rules and harsh treatment that immigrants face (or at least face the end of the century) on Ellis Island, and if we have, we have chosen to immerse this information. GOLDEN DOOR presents the case for immigrants' struggle in a way that not only affects our hearts, but also challenges our acceptance of current immigration laws. But all political issues aside, GOLDEN DOOR is first and foremost a movie of tremendous beauty, exquisite photography, deeply felt beliefs of a great cast, and a very sensitive written and directed story. It's a movie that deserves broad distribution, a movie that is a must see for everyone. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
