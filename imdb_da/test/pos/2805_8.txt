This is a very well-designed film showing the lives of international students in their "Erasmus Year" in Barcelona, ​​which, by the way, is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and is an ideal place. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​all the different languages ​​is great and gives the movie an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about the countries, but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries. <br /> <br /> After experiencing "Erasmus" on myself during my exchange vacation in Italy, I can say that movies are incredibly authentic. I had many experiences that looked like the characters (except that I wasn't put so often). The movie is also quite fun, but not like all the stupid American college movies. Finally, the film also deals with some important issues such as the change from student to work life. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (I may not be very objective myself)
