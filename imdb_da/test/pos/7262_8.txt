Well, I'm not adding to the diatribe that's been preached about this movie. All I can add is that in no time does it seem to be a 'historical' picture. Unlike the 'Braveheart', 'Titanic' or 'The Patriot', all of which have very credible and serious historical changes for theater purposes only (possibly the worst excuses). <br /> <br /> Have all taken a humorous bypass? <br /> <br /> Everything I can add is a paraphrase from the good captain Macleane - "It looked amazing and we have a bloody good laugh". <br /> <br /> - One last point. What surprises me is that there are comments on the "modern music" in a historical setting. I wonder if the same people made the same judgment about the Moulin Rouge. I do not suggest.
