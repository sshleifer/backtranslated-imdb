The Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to get along, but it's certainly one of the best. It's a pivotal movie in the Black Exploitation genre, where it caused a dramatic shift between the movies that came before it as opposed to the movies that came after it. It was not necessarily an exciting or moving movie about black culture, and it is struggle to overcome issues like racism or something as important as that, but it was the story of a badly beaten guy fighting "whitey" with his army of hot king-fu mama's. It was a guilty pleasure, fun and best to see it with friends. (10 out of 10)
