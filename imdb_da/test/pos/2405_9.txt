Well, it took them 4 attempts, but they finally got it right! In this 4th sequel to the Karate Kid franchise, the producers hit a home race! Well, first of all, I welcome them to finally get rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt he never served the role of karate kid. I'd rather have seen Danny 'Ralph Mouth' the most in that role. Macchio showed what turned out to be the best movie in the series and see where his career is now! Instead, they put in a girl! They got Hillary Swank, best known for playing a number of sheman parts in every movie she's in. I don't care about her buck teeth but it's a personal preference. But see how the Karate Kid 4 launched its orbital career! She won a freakin Oscar. Jiminey Christmas! Meanwhile, where is Ralphy ?? He has to put some amateur porn like Screech or something. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my only disagreement with the movie is that they have a girl doing karate. As a self-appointed champion in Karate, I have been the proud owner of a white belt for the last 8 5/8 years. The first thing they taught me is that there is no room in any of the girls martial arts ... well except Judo ... but it's pretty homosexual. So for the sake of accuracy, I think they should stick with another man for this role. I thought maybe Dennis Franz. He would give the role the depth it requires. Maybe they will listen to my suggestions and make the correct adjustments in Karate Kid 5. It is also Pat Marita who is no longer. I thought maybe Justin Guarini is the perfect substitute for the beloved Asian guy Mr. Miyagi. He will give "wax on wax" a whole new meaning. HAHAHAHAHAHA fun, huh? Anyways, if you're looking for an exciting movie filled with karate and triumph of the human spirit, karate kid 4 is for you. Don't waste your time with 1-3. This is Karate Kid for you! This is the Karate Kid for years!
