I would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released. All these years later at 37 and I had no trouble hiring it on DVD. Great entertainment for all ages. And what about the song The Rainbow Connection? See: <br /> <br /> Why are there so many songs about rainbows And what's on the other side? Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, and rainbow has nothing to hide. So we've been told and some choose to believe what I know they are wrong, wait and see. Today we find it, the rainbow connection, The lovers, the dreamers and me. <br /> <br /> Who said every wish would be heard and answered When the desire for the morning star? Someone thought of it and someone believed in it and see what it has done so far. What's so great that keeps us stargazing And what do we think we might see? Today we find it, the rainbow connection, The lovers, the dreamers and me. <br /> <br /> All of us under the spell, we know it's probably magic ... <br /> <br /> ... Have you been half asleep? And have you heard voices? I've heard them call my name. ... Is that the sweet sound that calls the young sailors? The voice can be one and the same, I've heard it too many times to ignore it. It's something I need to be ... One day we find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreams, and me. <br /> <br /> Then then, then, let's leave then ...
