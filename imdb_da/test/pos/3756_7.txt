I've only seen this movie once when it was shown on TV, but I still remember it 15 years later, so it has to say something about it. I thought it was an intelligent look at schooling, friendship, bullying and the influence it may have had on adulthood. <br /> <br /> The title really refers to how being good or bad in sports can either make you the lowest of the low or you will be tolerated by the clients in school and even later in adulthood if you are good at That - it's set in a private school in England, but it can be anywhere. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is poor in play, seeking revenge in later life, all culminating in a climatic confrontation on a cricket pitch. I have to admit that I was beaten by the end - it was powerful and sad.
