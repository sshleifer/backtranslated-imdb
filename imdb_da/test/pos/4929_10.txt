This was one of my favorite films from childhood. I saw it so many times, eventually my band broke out. I was a big fan of this show and still. What I love most about this movie is that it appeals to so many people, both young and old. I watch this movie now and laugh as hard as I did the first time I saw it. I am now able to appreciate all the adult jokes I never received as a child. My favorite characters are Elmyra and Foulmouth. Almost fifteen years later, my father (a big fan of the movie too) and I still quote lines from this movie. I love the part where Foulmouth and Shirley go to the cinema. "You save the seats, Shirl, and I want to talk to dadgum snacks." I also loved the story of Plucky and Hampton and his family going to Happy World Land. Wade Pig reminded me a lot of my father. I love that part when they finally come to Happy World Land and all they do is ride the monorail. This movie is fun and appealing to children and children. The animation, the jokes and everything about it are top notch. If you haven't seen it, rent it. You won't be sad.
