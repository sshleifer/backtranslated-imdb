Although not labeled as a Slasher flick, it has all the elements. The fact that slashers are well-known for the low budget, lame plot, cheesy effects, and everything you can add doesn't mean there can't be good slasher movies. "Opera" completes the description. Although it is part of Italian giallo; that is far from being a slasher subgenre. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento proves he deserves the label of one of Horror's best instructors. "Opera" is one of the most stylish Horror movies of the past 30 years. Although the film takes place in a beautiful, shiny place; situations and gore make it one of the craziest places ever used in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I think of "Opera" as a stylish Slasher, although there is profound plot and character development. The cheese factor, which is often used in most Slasher flicks, is not present here, but in exchange we got an exciting, visually stunning gore story. The movie's plot is simple (as in all Slasher). There is a psycho in the opera, something obsessed with the leading actress / singer and forcing her to see cruel deaths. The death scene is extremely cruel and is the best thing about the movie. The infamous "peep-hole" death scene is the highlight of the movie in my opinion. It's a great death scene that no one other than Argento could release. The knife through the throat (and mouth) is another cruel scene, but less violent than scabies. Gore in "Opera" will please the evil and beloved of violence. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like about the movie is the lack of coherence or logic. I mean, after seeing the first dead, leading woman, reassured as if nothing was happening, getting a ride home and not doing much of a big deal on what she saw. She is also alone in the home and does not take security measures. Still, the excitement of the movie makes you forget the lack of logic. Argento knows how to create tension and how to scare the subconscious. For example, when Betty's friend tells her that someone saw her from outside, she knocks out and excites her in case something happens. <br /> <br /> The direction of the film is great. For an Italian giallo it is excellent. Argento's creative POV shot is impressive. The ravens also added an eerie feeling to the movie. Argento adds his unique spice. <br /> <br /> "Opera" is one of the most underrated, but popular through the Horror community for these reasons, in my opinion: -Harrow the death scene (brilliant) - The Ravens ultimately attack opera mode - the knife through neck and mouth - heavy metal score combined with opera music (this music has never freaked me out before) - the killer is toughness <br /> <br /> The only thing I don't like about "Opera" is the heavy metal songs there is used in death scenes. It's okay to disturb the audience, but I think opera music might have added a jerky feel. Still, the "shocking" use of heavy metal is a single disturbing aspect of the movie. <br /> <br /> See "Opera" even if you don't like gore. There is a lot of excitement and excitement that can frighten the most skeptical person. This is not "Suspiria", but it deserves to be among Argento's finest.
