"Family Guy" is probably the most ballless sitcom ever produced. It relentlessly blocks everything you can think of, from TV shows to family drama. Best of all, it is one of the few TV shows today that is actually fun. <br /> <br /> The show is about Griffins: Peter, the obese father whose schemes are limited by his lack of intelligence. Lois, the mother who is more or less the family leader, even though Peter considers it to be. Chris, the fat teenage son who has as few brains as his father. Me, the black sheep of the family who are but of everyone's jokes. Stewie, the child who plans to kill her mother and take over the world. And Brian, the family dog, which is often the cause of the cause, but often destroyed. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" uses many tactics to get the audience laughing. Most notable are the frequent cutaways that spoof what has just been said. They are effective because of the impeccable timing and the way they play. "Family Guy" uses spoofs to also get humor, most often from 80s TV shows. What really makes the show so great is that a person does not need to be aware of what it is spoofing. I'm sure it would help, but the material is fun enough in itself. But the show doesn't stop there. It doesn't just spit it all over, it spies its own spoofs! The show is full of off-color humor. The only reason people are not in arms about the show is probably because it makes fun of every race, sex and other generality equal. There is nothing sacred here and none and nothing is immune from "Family Guy's" satirical jabs. Putting music tracks into a movie takes a lot of time and effort, and it is a very big risk. But "Family Guy" contains some good songs. All well-written and performed, and of course they are fun (perhaps the most famous, "The Freakin 'FCC" is both captivating and hysterical because it hits the rating board where it hurts). <br /> <br /> The voice characterizations are right on the money. Seth McFarlane is incredibly talented. He gives the voices to Peter, Brian (who is his own natural voice) and Stewie. The voices are not only consistent and creative, he can change their tone according to will, so it seems like they are spoken by three different actors. Alex Borstein brings a nasally drawl to Lois, who is perfect for the character. Seth Green is unrecognizable as Chris (had I not seen IMDb, I would never have known it was him). Lacey Chabert comes from Meg, and while she was good, Mila Kunis really elevated the character with her sharp voice. Kunis gives Me a new, sharper edge that she didn't have with Chabert. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" has been compared to "The Simpsons" and it is quite understandable (and not just because they are produced by FOX). Both are satiries of blue-collar life, and while "The Simpsons" is good, "Family Guy" includes its sharper edge. The show is completely fearless. There is no real holy cow. The performance shows disabilities (physical and mental), ethnic groups, TV shows and films, celebrities, politicians, religion (especially Catholicism), drug abuse and addiction, sexual humor of all kinds (including S&M), and some that lie right out over the description. Not all "Family Guy" throws in the audience, but overall, the show is constantly entertaining and frequently fun. <br /> <br /> If there are any errors with the "Family Guy", it is that the jokes run too long sometimes. Especially with "scary moment" jokes, the sequences are stretched so long that it not only ceases to be fun, it becomes so annoying (and far) that a forward button is justified. These can be effective in about 10 to 15 seconds, but the show sometimes extends for more than two minutes. One can argue that the show rewrites its rules to fit the plot, and it does so often (for example, Brian often seems like a person, but he still works like a dog when the story requires it). But that's not a problem because the show is still working. <br /> <br /> Some people have argued that the show has ceased to be fun. Although I agree that it is not as exciting as it used to be, I believe the blame lies with FOX, not McFarlane and his crew. The view originates from FOX, but after some weaknesses and display counter it was canceled. But the DVD sales were big enough to be picked up by the Adult Swim. The show was an instant success and it was once again bought by FOX. But because the show is so big now, FOX is afraid to let the authors experiment and try new things. While it is still fun, humor is not so fresh and edgy. <br /> <br /> Check this exhibition for sure. It is fantastic.
