I have always been a fan of this largely unseen recording of the Gershwin opera since I last saw it in 1959. As many of you know, it has not been available on video or DVD; In fact, the Gershwin family tried to destroy all existing prints. <br /> <br /> But for some reason - hopefully signaling an end to the resistance, the Gershwin family has recently approved the exhibition of a collector's print at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens. . <br /> <br /> Now, the wide screen, Technicolor print was excellent! (Not perfect but excellent.) The sound was excellent, in stereo with road-show quality. The people who saw this in their original release would not have seen a much better copy. (The program notes include the original Variety review, which warns that people can bow to the broad, limited $ 3.50 ticket!) <br /> <br /> And as much as I loved it, PORGY AND BESS was better than I remembered it. It's just amazing. Sidney Poitier as Porgy was at the time of his career just starting to fire and his charisma shining through. Dorothy Dandridge as Bess is spectacularly beautiful. Brock Peters as Crown is aggressively masculine. Pearl Bailey as Maria gives some comical moments even though she is small. And Sammy Davis, Jr., as Sporting Life, steals every scene he's in; He is especially riveting in his two big numbers: "It's not necessarily so" and "There's a boat that's Leavin 'soon for New York." (The last one won applause in the screening I saw.) <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS are set-bound, but it doesn't matter when the set is as beautiful as this. The costumes are also excellent. <br /> <br /> Sidney and Dorothy's song voices are inviting, but they are called very well. The exquisite "Summertime" is sung by Clara, played by a young Diahann Carroll; her song is also called. (In fact, only Pearl and Sammy make their own vocalizing.) <br /> <br /> The music is sublime, of course, but what really struck me back then was how much emotion Preminger got out of history. People actually sniffed in the audience a number of times - once when Bess sings the beautiful "I Love You Porgy." And I got a kick out of the audience who actually laughs loudly at the lines of "It's not necessary." Could it be that they had never heard this song before - or never really listened to it? I think much of the emotional impact of this movie is due to Poiter and Dandridge's beliefs - you are fighting for their love of winning. <br /> <br /> A lesser haze with 136 minutes of maturity - one or two slow places and a stereotypical Amos-n-Andy kind of scene that Bess sees a shyster lawyer to get a divorce from Crown, though she Not even married to him. (I would have cut it.) And the beginning is a bit confusing - both title characters are intentionally introduced - they are part of the movie before you realize who they are. <br /> <br /> And I don't think Preminger used a single close-up throughout the movie. It all seems to be shot in 3/4, which I guess was his way of working with the wide screen. <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS have always been a cult movie for those of us who saw it, for those of us who loved the soundtrack, and for some of us who have only heard of it. Let's hope they find a way to republish and post it on DVD. It deserves the widest audience possible.
