If ever a potential movie should have sounded like it wouldn't work based on reading the script on paper, it would be this. Here we have what seems like a lurid and seedy soft porn s & m flick, complete with the huge in-theater poster showing a close-naked Christina Ricci chained to none other than Mr. Bad Ass MF himself, Samuel Jackson. But let me tell you if a movie is alive on celluloid big time with soulful power, it's Craig Brewer's redemptive follow-up on Hustle & Flow, Black Snake Moan. <br /> <br /> Unashamedly over the top of the go, this movie sucks you into the opening scene and continues to dig deeper and deeper into each subsequent frame. It is your basic story of two deeply damaged characters that find each other the strength and courage to move in more positive ways with their lives. Finished before, of course, this narrative, but as I have always said, it is the way in which a story is told that gives it heart, depth, meaning and power. <br /> <br /> Ricci is a corrupted-madness-abuse of wild character Rae and Jackson are just as the soulful musician character Lazarus finds in desperate circumstances, and Laz takes it upon himself to try to help Rae. This is in itself relatively unique: the idea that a man is trying to help a woman who is in severe pain, rather than trying to exploit her further, and we know from the beginning that Laz's heart and film's heart are right place. The film is characterized by the revitalizing, healing power of love (with music as a very close second), and the film resonates deeply with this truth - soulfully, artfully, and brilliantly. <br /> <br /> A big reason The film is so deeply successful, is due to the hard, engaging performances of Ricci and Jackson. Scenes that would have come out as ridiculous and pathetic in the hands of smaller artists are instead strong as everyone emerged. Especially the film's arc scene, where Jackson sings and plays song for the title alone in his house with Ricci in between a serious thunderstorm and the violent demons of Raes formerly running amok inside her head and leading her to crawl to Lazarus and cling to his legs, do not come as ridiculous as it should be, but rather as gut-wrenchingly cathartic. <br /> <br /> All the supporting performances are also fantastic here. Justin Timberlake is absolutely credible as Rae's anxious girlfriend Ronnie, and the always wonderful S. Epatha Merkerson is also perfectly cast as a sign that naturally has feelings for Lazarus. John Cothran Jr. is also excellent as Laz's honorable friend R.L. (a nod to blues musician R. L. Burnside, no doubt). Everything works about this movie, let's look it out, including the music / soundtrack containing Burnside, Scott Bomar, Bobby Rush, Son House and most importantly, Jackson himself, whose amazing version of Stackolee I listen to when composing this review. There is also a really beautiful and fluid version of "This Little Light of Mine" highlighted in the movie, sung by heartbreaking and soft by Ricci. <br /> <br /> In recent interviews, Samuel Jackson has said that he thinks he's the performance in this movie is the best of his career so far; I couldn't agree with him anymore. This is work that he can be monumentally proud of, along with everyone else involved in this hideous, extremely clever and deeply fervent mother * week of a project.
