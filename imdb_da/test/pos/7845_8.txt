Beguiled is one of the entertained movies in career with an instructor and / or actor who ends up playing better than expected. In the same year that Clint Eastwood and Don Siegel collaborated on Dirty Harry, they also worked together on this little psycho-sexual drama in the Civil War era Confederacy country. It's almost 180 from what 'Harry' had for the audience. Here is a movie that is under the radar and with a low budget for almost no business compared to what Dirty Harry pulled into. It is also a story where Eastwood is not surrounded by a world full of dangerous men, but women who, despite their first appearance, have darker sides to them. And there is even romance in between some of the coarser and more complex scenes. But in this kind of frame for making the film, Siegel actually has a bit more freedom to do things with the style of the image that streams into something more European; I am reminded here and there about Polanski's work in the 60s. However, it all seems pretty good even with the original doubt that these two characters of masculine film production (Eastwood the obvious and Siegel have made his niche in B-noir and low-budget players) can draw material that could possibly be made for a lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> It was also captivating and really dark comic here and there to see Eastwood's achievements that worked out of these girls. He does something a little subversive in his performance by still having some sort of Eastwood machismo - if there is such a thing close to his clich√© movie - being a step ahead of this little school of young women at times and not with others. Seeing Eastwood in a show like this, as with Play Misty for Me (the second Eastwood work of 1971), shows how cool he can act credibly with very good actresses. Especially here are the four main female characters, each of different ages and each with varying attractions for their 'Yankee' man. Although Siegel's work on managing all the actors has their moments in the first half, it is really when the story crosses the halfway mark of the dream sequence (less successful than the director might be able to) that the real juicy scenes begin to pick up. Much of this is the best thing Siegel directed dramatically and pushes the psychological and emotional edges of scenes where it is not expected. <br /> <br /> It's a tricky movie, all this boasts aside as it doesn't paint anyone as being too respectable - only the character of Hallie, the slave played by Mae Mercer, is separated from what happens between the all too curious women and McBurney. Along with this, Eastood works here in a role that is and is not what he usually sees as during this time of his true formative years in the films. He is an anti-hero here who was his trademark for westerns and other thrillers he did at that time. But, unlike these films, he is not really in a state where he is 'greater than life', to say it in a way, as he is both deserts and females, deceiving and difficult even in his most charming and gracious moments . If it's not one of his best-performing jobs that it's hard to really put into consideration in his catalog, it's worth looking at fans who might want to see another side of him. It's a credit for him, but also what was clicked on his collaborations with Siegel, as they both took chances at this time in Hollywood.
