Instead of writing a paragraph, I give four good reasons why 2001 is the greatest cinema experience all the time: 1) It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen. The special effects that won Kubrick's only Oscar are the most amazing effects before Jurassic Park and T2's age. They allow Kubrick to provide a precise (or at least the most accurate) depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds to the mood of the movie (to be discussed at a later point with HAL). The fact that Kubrick shot the moon's scenes before the Apollo landing is a gutsy but satisfying movement. Many have said that by its original release, it was a favorite "tour" movie. I can't think of any other movie that has such amazing visuals for its time and even all the time (sorry Phantom Menace fans!) 2) Kubrick's leading style is great. As in all his films, Kubrick likes to use his camera as a means to dive into the psychology of his characters and plot. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such as Scorsese, but instead sitting and watching the story unfold. Faces are the key element of a Kubrick movie. As classic films, like M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the audience a psychological point of view. He himself uses extreme close-ups of HAL's glowing red "eye" to show the cold and determination of the computerizd villain. I could go on, but in summary, Kubrick is largely of his style. 3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I totally agree with the late Gene Siskle's perception of HAL 9000. Most of this movie is in space. Through the use of silence and the darkness of the room itself, a mood of isolation has been created. Dave and his crew members are isolated between the land and jupiter, with nowhere to escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of the HAL 9000 and you have the most terrible villain imaginable. I can still, even though I watch this movie several times, feel my chest tight in a particular scene. 4) The controversial end of 2001 always turns people away from this movie. Instead of trying to give my opinion on what it means and what my idea of ​​2001's opinion is generally, I would like to discuss that the end serves to leave the film open. Kubrick has stated that he would open 2001 for discussion. He left his importance in the viewer's hands. By respecting the public's intelligence, Kubrick allowed his film to be the beginning, not the end, a meaningful discussion on man's past, present and future. The beauty of 2001 is that the end doesn't have to mean anything deep, it can just be a purely plot-driven explanation, and the whole movie can be seen as an entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the big Citizen Kane, opens itself for discussion like 2001. It's really supposed to be a surreal journey that not only includes the eye but the mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for Phantom Menace, rent a widescreen version of 2001 and enjoy the greatest movie experience.
