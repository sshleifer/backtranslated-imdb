It opens with your cliche far too long ship flying through space. All I could think of at this time was "Spaceballs" and hoped that there would be a sticker on the back saying "We are breaking no one." The film then shows some cryogenic freezers with Vin Diesel's story. I always thought his voice sounded cool ever since I watched Fast and Furious. From when I found out he was such a criminal, I thought the movie should be cliché. It was. It was very cliché and fate seemed to be against them at every turn. Black out every 22 years. Lucky those they land on that day. Foreigners can only be in the dark, hey is a solar eclipse. As much as I thought it was too easy and just a cliché, pulled the movie through and kicked big @ss. I even went out and bought a copy of Pitch Black after seeing it. I really can't wait for the Chronicles of Riddick.
