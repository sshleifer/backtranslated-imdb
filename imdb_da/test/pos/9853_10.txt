In Sudan, the Arabs rule and are constantly at war with the Christians and animists in the southern part of this East African country. This film follows a group of Dinka boys, a tribe of cattle shepherds who were abandoned after their village was destroyed, and their families were killed in a brutal attack by the Arab forces. Most of these boys are now teens and have been called "The Lost Boys". <br /> <br /> The filmmaker follows a group of the "Lost Boys" on their journey as they have been accepted as refugees in the United States where they want to land in Houston. Those who have been accepted as refugees are given celebrity status which they feel (from what they have heard) that America is amazing. Taking a trip from Sudan to America is like "taking a trip to heaven," one young man says. A big party is being thrown for their departure, and they are told to do Sudan well, and once they are trained, they must return to Sudan to contribute to the Dinka community. They are also warned not to be like "those with the pants" who are responsible for the negative stereotype of black men, and whatever happens, not to forget the Dinka culture. <br /> <br /> You see, as the boys come from a third continent to America and how they are trying to integrate into American society, as they have gone from a place of almost nothing to this abundant world where everything is massively overproduced and overused. They are taught about cleanliness and how to use all the aids we take for granted on a daily basis. It is sometimes humorous, humiliating in others. Listening to the comments they make about black Americans and American society / culture is quite interesting. As the film progresses, you see how American culture begins to destroy their former humble ways of thinking. <br /> <br /> One of the boys, Peter, is not happy to work and does enough to survive, he looked up and moves from Houston to Kansas City so he can pursue an education. When the other boys visit him, they talk about how they can't get into any school. The main reason they came to America was to get an education, and the media says the boys have been brought from Sudan to an education. This happens because the boys were given arbitrary ages, which makes them older than they actually are, and prevents them from enrolling in high school. <br /> <br /> The movie equals images from Houston to Kansas. We look when Peter signs up at school where he turns to a group of Christian conservative children and that Santiago is trying to drive to school (though he runs without his license anyway), and works at Walmart. We see that Peter is struggling with high school as he strives to do his school sports team, and since Santiago has difficulty keeping up with the job, rent, appealing tensions in Sudan, and most of all, loneliness. <Br /> <br /> It comes to the point where the boys will return to Sudan and tell them that all they learn about America is lying. "You have to do it alone here, do it all alone" says one of the boys. A cursing message to a liberal capitalist lifestyle that shows how it makes people become radical individualists (a trend that led to the creation of both the neo-conservative and radical Islamist movements). However, their biggest beef with America is that there is no time; time is money and we don't waste a second! <br /> <br /> After all, the boys never lose their sense of Dinka culture. They are celebrating South Sudan Liberation Day, which marks the day that SPLA began to fight in Sudan, a battle that continues today. They also meet with other "Lost Boys" on the anniversary of their arrival in America, where they discuss their experience in America over back in Sudan. When asked, a boy says that if he could live, he would prefer to live in Sudan. It's too lonely in America, he adds. They never lose their sense of community that has been conditioned on them as part of their culture! <br /> <br /> This film questions us the way we live, questions us the artificial happiness that materialism and the nature of our society have created within us. It will also change the way I look at refugees, I will never again take for granted how hard they are to work and which immigrants mean to a country like my own, Canada. This is a wonderful movie. I laughed, I cried .. a very emotional journey and a very well made documentary. 10 out of 10
