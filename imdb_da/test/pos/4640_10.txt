Still fun after all these years. Midnight Madness is great entertainment for all ages. It introduces Michael J Fox as a typical 15-year-old problem maker. Melio and Blaylak are by far the funniest characters in it, and Leon is perfectly cast as a wierdo gambler. The budding romance between Adam and the girl could not have been a cheesier. Fagabeefe !!!!
