Eisenstein's first sound film tells the ice battle in 1242 when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky defeated the Lively Knights, eager to bring Russia under Roman Catholicism. Produced in 1938, Nevsky can be seen as a propaganda: the Germanic knights, with their vicious (and somewhat grim) helmets, are obvious stand-ins for the Nazis. Knight's slaughterhouse, when entering a Russian city, seems like a prophetic warning of the massacres of World War II. The movie ends with a warning: Those who came to Russia with the sword will die of the sword. Made in delicate black and white (somewhat reminiscent of a daguerreotype), it also marked Eisenstein's return to official advantage. At the end of the 1920s, Stalin wanted Soviet filmmakers to stop experiments and make films that would be more populist and tasty for the Russian public. It stopped Eisenstone's career in Russia for a decade, and in Nevsky he came back with his more accessible movie. Nevsky's strong point is in his other half, which contains the struggle itself, and is rightly seen as a milestone in film history: never before (and probably never after) a battle would be so vivid on the screen. Another strong point is Prokofjv's beautiful, haunting soundtrack (by using a composer to score a movie was quite unusual at the time). One of its weaker points: The comical relief (in the form of two simple Russian warriors trying to ask for a beautiful Russian farmer) really crises.
