It's the 1980s, and the teenagers are ready to pick it up in a scary old house rumored to be haunted by the ghost of Murder McGee. After committing the dead mistakenly through an unfinished conversation at a Ouija table, the children are forced to fight death, struggling with an avid ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one. Sounds good? It must. It's clearly marketed to pay tribute to the classic 80's slashers with tagline: "Excessive violence. Gratuitous nudity. Zero budget." <br /> <br /> Can't get enough; It's pure entertainment! I enjoyed the humor and the way it poked fun on all horror cliches, but at the same time embraced what was fun with movies from that time. There is something you get with this movie you never got with the old 80s slasherfilm, though: good acting. The whole cast was very talented, and you don't see it so much in any low budget flicks, recently or otherwise. There was a lot of chemistry between the characters. I was very entertained throughout the movie and I am absolutely convinced that the author / director and cast will go a long way in their separate career. The writing was very well written, and the dialogue flowed naturally. The effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not turned on well, but the fact that this movie admits to the cover was almost no budget, I already know this goes into. This movie makes it easy to politely ignore its mistakes and just sit back and enjoy. Although this is not an Oscar's award-winning opus, it never claims to be and props for it. It is very fun. If you like slashers, you will really appreciate this movie. If you like blood and boobies, you will also appreciate it.
