This movie and its subsequent television series follow-up has become the iconic stand-in for what's good about America. <br /> <br /> Fame is famous for its music and performances. There are several standouts including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara *, and the amazing Gene Anthony Ray. The latter, who plays a walk-on dancer without academic or anything else "street" credentials, is a great personality and is worth looking at what is essentially a self-portrayal. A marvel to see as a king was inclined to say. The plot follows an interesting format - chronologically at times, genre at other times, personalities in some cases ... but it all really ends in a kind of mush. <br /> <br /> Where Parker succeeds, pushing this movie into periodic overdrive - with the extremely exciting and sometimes beautiful and direct-fighting music score that matches the executive step by step. <br /> <br /> The climate of the movie is a climax for all time. And this climatic complete cast of many many talented musicians and dancers and music is fortunately repeated through the credits. These are a set of credits that are worth sitting through ... a performance in the past. The music of Christopher Gore is a gift to see.
