More and more French cinemas demonstrate that it is the only one that can confront Hollywood's and spend huge amounts of money on their films. If Bon Voyage had been made in the United States, no one would be surprised. Perfectly seen in France, in the 40s, when Nazi invasion, technically irreproachable, and with some of the most international French actors (Depardieu, Adjani, Ledoyen ...). Bon Voyage centers on two parallel stories: a scientific and his disciple (Ledoyen) who tries to hide one of his discoveries (a kind of water that can act as a nuclear bomb) from the Nazis; and a poor guy in love with a well-known actress (Adjani) who ends up in prison accused of a crime he has not committed to protecting her. <br /> <br /> Bon Voyage seems to have been made in the old style, with no unnecessary camera movements and effects. Without large revolutions in the plot. As I said before, in terms of production itself, they have done a good job. But the biggest problem with this movie is about the script. Is it a spy movie? A romantic comedy? And spy comedy? A comedy of intrigue? It's not clear. That makes Bon Voyage a bit unbalanced. When you think you see a comedy, suddenly shift to another story line, a more dramatic, slower ... I think they should have focused on one of the arguments (one on the spy plot) and left them romantic parts in the background. <br /> <br /> My rating: 6.5 / 10
