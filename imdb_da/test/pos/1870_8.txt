I saw this title again on Shemaroo. I also asked my nephew, who was 17 to see the same with me. I am 35 and he is 17. He liked it, and I did too. It's still fun, a little childish one times, but still very pure entertainment. Satish Shah is fun in multiple roles. This sitcom would still go better than many of the latest TV shows. But of course, some people obviously like everyday prices coming out today. It would have been nice that Shafi Inamdar would have continued for all seasons. He no longer lives today. I wish if anyone could list all episodes here. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the lines "Yeh Kya Ho Raha HAi" "What a relief" "Kaat Daalu Boss" "Vyavhaar Hai Vyavhaar" "30 years Ka Experience shark" and the title track Yeh Jo hai Zindagi, teaches us to live life as it comes and take pleasure in it. The lives of the common people. <br /> <br /> I still like this sitcom. It may not be fun at times, but some episodes are still fun.
