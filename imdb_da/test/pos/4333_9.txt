I couldn't agree more than with the commentary left by "coldshit action" and how this movie is a masterpiece. I've never seen a movie that had my adrenaline floating as this movie did, and it happened mostly when Bronson is going to run out of fire with like an M-60 and plow down like 20 dude from a gang that's genius. Probably the best action movie ever made (no exaggeration either), it could really be the best action movie ever made. From the start you should know that you; beware of something sweet when the police let Bronson go and tell him he says clean up the slum. Once again a genius. And again, Bronson is a bad ass. Paul Kersey is just as cool, maybe even cooler than John McClain or Terminator, he's just a bad ass. And what else is great is that he is a lovely guy and buys a little ice cream and helps an old couple all before he kills any scum bag. genius. Recommended if you hate this movie, you are crazy.
