This movie is more than the story of Danton. It was a joint Polish French production filmed at the time of the beginning of the Soviet system. It has probably contributed to encouraging the Solidarity Movement's trade union. It is more about Poland in the 20th century than the French Revolution. Solidarity began the end of the system. This movie is historically of its existence .... the rest is history. <br /> <br /> Robspiere, aka. totalitarian leaders. Danton, aka. Walensa. When you watch this movie, you must remember the snowball that began in Poland. <br /> <br /> In fact, it might be useful to watch the superpower battle in the only superpower left.
