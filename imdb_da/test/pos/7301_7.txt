A Jane Smiley novel, loosely based on Shakespeare's KING LEAR about the Cook family and its dark secrets. Director Moorhouse seems tame in her approach, so the characters can step forward and take a bow. And how could you go wrong with the talents Pfeiffer, Lange, Leigh, Firth, Carradine and Robards?
