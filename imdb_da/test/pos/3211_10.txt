People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who have not seen many episodes. You really have to sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All the characters are realistic because they have so many errors. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC errors, which is an unusual thing to watch on TV today. Also mostly the action is amazing. Lauren Graham has been snubbed by an Emmy for six years now. Someone needs to give this woman the credit she deserves. The same goes for Kelly Bishop, who plays Emily Gilmore so perfectly. It's also great to see a show that can have a young girl in the middle of it and not be filled with teenage anxiety. Rory is a smart girl who also doesn't see much on television today. If only other shows could capture the whole of this show ...
