Aparna Sen's 15 Park Avenue is a film about reality. <br /> <br /> A young errant girl who tends to imagine things and hear voices, possibly out of sheer boredom, is considered to be the schizophrenics of her educated father and steering freak trained older sister. Controlled, pitied and treated as an invalid (though out of love and affection), she has a ghost with a chance to develop as a normal person. When a boy offers to marry her, her father and sister sister are trying to persuade him to take such a step. A traumatic experience, primarily due to her protected existence, finally takes her across the line without return, and she lives full time in an errant world. <br /> <br /> The family and society around her are intolerant of her delusions and want to suppress them with medicine, electric shock therapy, whatever, even though they all have some kind of error. <br /> <br /> Her mother doesn't see the irony of allowing a ghost bust to treat her with the delusions. Her step-sister is a professor of physics and teaches, among other things, Quantum Mechanics, a topic where a stream of experts accepts parallel multi-universes and many more dimensions in space than the 3 we see. A friend tells with admiration an experience with a holy person who claims to hear hallucinatory voices. Far away, George W. Bush has genuine or false delusions of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction and is allowed to invade Iraq. As some viewers have already pointed out, the monkeys scolded Sen from attacking the mother of all delusions - generous religions, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> In other words, accepted reality is what a majority or an influential minority believes in. It has been the case since the beginning, and much more powerful people than Mithali in the movie, among other things. Bruno and Galileo have suffered as a result. <br /> <br /> The film's controversial and difficult ending was necessary to show that it is a film of the nature of reality and not the case study of a schizophrenic girl. <br /> <br /> All casts have shown good performances, but Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma have excelled. Aparna Sen has produced an excellent philosophical film.
