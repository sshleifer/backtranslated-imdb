It was a lot of fun, even though it fell a little at the end. Don't go overboard with the greeting after Hitchcock - Owen (Danny DeVito) was lucky that he had "Strangers on A Train" playing at the local cinema, so the movie flattened tells you that it was the inspiration. <br /> <br /> DeVito is very fun, but also a little sad. He has no friends, and all he wants to do is write and get someone to write. His teacher, Billy Crystal, goes through a number of serious writers, and his wife has stolen his book and made it his own success, which has also frustrated him a lot. <br /> <br /> The best parts are the book proposal by Mr. Pinsky ("One Hundred Girls, I'd Like Pork") and all scenes with Anne Ramsey, who is so terrible that even Mother Theresa would have wanted to kill her too!
