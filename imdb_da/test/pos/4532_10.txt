This movie may not have seemed like much to some people, but it had everything I was looking for in a comedy. Fall down fun moments accompanied by a moment or two of seriously moving scenes, amazing actors, and just about anything a good movie should be like. Despite David's spade playing his usual snobbish character, he made this role an unusual achievement, which I don't think he had ever exceeded before he hit the screen with your dirt. Whether some people were not Chris Farley fans, I saw this movie when it came out and my friends and I are still talking about it ... 11 years later. This movie was what finally told me that Chris Farley was the right deal. he is the best comedian I've seen in my life. in some of his words he could be clumsy, clever, funny, serious, crazy, sober and moving or depressing at the same time. Not the same words, but the message is all that matters. one of the true great actors of our time, and one of the true great comedies of all time. along with good acting, good story, funny moments, serious scenes that sometimes led me to tears. This film is on top of the hordes as a movie that marked the beginning of a short reign at the top of the comedy world of late Big Chris Farley. no actor sooner or later has captured my interests in a movie page. because no actor sooner or later has put so much into his film. this movie is worth the time, if you haven't taken the time to see it, do it the next time you rent a movie.
