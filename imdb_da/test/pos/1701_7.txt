OK, most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at remake, but at the same time it is also another movie in itself. Don't forget me, 'American Werewolf In London' is a superior movie, but 'American Remake In Paris' is also a decent movie. First, the only real similarities are TITLE, 2 US backpackers and WEREWOLVES. Apart from these 3 things, 'American Remake In Paris' stands out quite well alone with its special blend of humor, action / adventure and horror. Most of the people who say this movie is better than the original is the youth of today's generation who believe that a movie made before 1990 is a total crap. While those of us who grew up in the 80s can appreciate older films and what they've added to the horror movies today. What many people do not realize is that without the old classic films, including B & W, horror would not be what it is today. Now I get a bit off the beaten track ... <br /> <br /> An American werewolf in Paris is a good attempt to recreate a classic, but it will never surpass the original. Having said that, it is still a very entertaining movie to watch and I recommend it. I give it a 7 out of 10. Maybe it's a little generous, but I've seen much worse attempts to try to recreate a classic.
