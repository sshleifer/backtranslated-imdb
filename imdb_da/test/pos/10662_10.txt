Sergei Eisenstein's most famous film has really resisted the test of time. The story of a mutiny aboard a warship in 1905 has the feeling of Soviet propaganda, but does a good job showing the conditions that led to rebellion. The scene of the Odessa steps should remain wounded in everyone's mind. Okay, so "The Battle-Potemkin" wasn't actually the first movie to use for mounting, but they did a good job on this. Surely any movie history class should show this movie. It's a fantastic historical drama (though I will admit I don't know exactly what it is). A 10/10. Oh, and we should have learned that "Potemkin" should be transliterated as "Potyomkin".
