Once a certain man from India once said, "First they will laugh at us, and they will hate us, and they will fear us." Know that yes, the film's budget was a bit gone, but even then, history is still our interest many years later, no matter how it has been. But soon, "The Mast Thrust" will soon come to the big screen. Then he and the new redesigned T-Rex will come across you more. It will scare many for centuries to come !! This movie is in pre-production and will not be something you have ever seen before! <br /> <br /> This will be beyond the THX format ..... right into the 4-DX format. <br /> <br /> "Be scared, be very scared!"
