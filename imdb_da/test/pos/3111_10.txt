I loved this movie because of the dialogue and excellent plays by Candace and Jacqueline. However, I never knew before to see a Bette David marathon at TNT that this movie is a remake of a 1943 Bette Davis classic called Old Acquaintance. Bette co-stars with Miriam Hopkins as she was in a horrible feud with the movie, because Bette had had an affair with Miriam's husband who instructed her in a movie before making Old Acquaintance. <br /> <br /> Anyway, both are worth every minute. I highly recommend this movie if you like a lot of dialogue and drama. It is a study in women's psychology and their relationship with each other, in my opinion.
