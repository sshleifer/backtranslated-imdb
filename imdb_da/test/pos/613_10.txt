Subtle, delicate, touching. <br /> <br /> A young man in a summer dress on a bike as incarnation of perfect joy. History of a forthcoming and anatomy of relationships. <br /> <br /> Soft ambiguous movements, traffic lights and a day as a room of innocent miracle expression. <br /> <br /> Two men, a girl, an afternoon on the beach, some words and a gift. Religious tracks and a pantheistic vision. Cercle of light and expression, an ordinary day and a warm evening. <br /> <br /> An erotic casting film, where the gay identity or the first sexual relationship are only instruments for good definition of a universe of sensitive values. <br /> <br /> The amount of self-discovery, beauty universe, signs of ozone and the same nostalgic air in any creation, "Robe d'ete" is a great opportunity to understand the moment as projection of dream, to see, with emotion and the child's soul the essence of the essence beyond images or people.
