This is not your typical Indian movie. There is a great sense of humanity, and the characters are quite realistic. There is great dynamism in the interpersonal relationships, and there is a sense of guilt, sadness, passion, inaction among the many characters. As you see this, you get a sense of the heavy burden of the 5000-year-olds and layers of history of social existence of one of the oldest civilizations. The final scene of an elephant walking away in rural areas was a great footnote to such an ancient civilization, yet human relations are still preserved and nurtured. Watching it on DVD, the two interviews with the director and the greatest actress are very interesting. Was surprised to know that the movie hasn't done well (or not shown) in India (... but maybe not so surprised). The artistic heritage of the rural community is slowly being lost, and its legacy is not excited by younger generations, as some of the older musicians in the film no longer live today. Great film.
