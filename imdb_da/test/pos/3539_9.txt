After reading the other comment about this amazing piece of TV drama, I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murder, being signature and serial, and your police must be British and shouting a lot, and the gore is bloody and has a religious slope, it hits every button. Not enough to put the shout at Sweeney's rare heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as "policeman on the edge" and the guest stars are also well-cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended. (In response to previous remarks, although I accept that "Red" would not "normally" drive away from a stroke and run, he had just witnessed that his brother was being arrested for murder and I am quite sure that he can't see the boy moving.)
