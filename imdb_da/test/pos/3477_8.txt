In Dublin, the curvy rebel Rory O'Shea (James McAvoy) moves to the Carrigmore Residential Home for the Disabled, affecting the lives of residents. Roy can understand the incomprehensible speech Michael Connolly (Steven Robertson), who was abandoned by his prominent father many years ago because of his cerebral palsy, and they become close friends. Rory convinces Michael to move from Carrigmore to an apartment in Dublin, and they hire the beautiful Siobhan (Romola Garai) to help them. Living with Rory, Michael faces a new world that finds friendship, love, and freedom and learns to survive alone. <br /> <br /> "Inside I'm Dancing" is a wonderful story of friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story. The act of Steven Robertson and James McAvoy is awesome and I don't understand how they have not been nominated for Oscar with such grand performances. Romola Garai also has a leading performance and is extremely beautiful and sexy. The play touches, never corny and without redemption, and the exact direction of Damien O'Donnell is very sensitive. Unfortunately, the Brazilian title on the DVD is shamefully ridiculous, giving the wrong idea of ​​this excellent movie. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Melhores Dias de Nossas Vidas" ("The Best Years of Our Life")
