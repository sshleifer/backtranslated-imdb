Watching John Cassavete's debut film is a strange experience, even though you have previously seen improvisation movies. The first thing you notice is the bumps. From the beginning it is obvious that some of the figures turn up on their lines. But then you step back from the situation that you sink deeper into these people's intimate exchanges, and you ask yourself, "Should I ever stumble over my words?" The answer is, of course, we all do. It is unfortunate that most people in this respect come early in the picture because for about twenty minutes you have so deeply immersed that you would not know if a bomb went out behind you. <br /> <br /> The next thing you notice ... or maybe you discover it hours or days after the movie ends is that you've never seen any significant plot, but the themes and poetry in dialogue and characters never leave you. In fact, the processing of the role play in everyday life for these characters is always there, but it is so ephemeral that even they are not aware of how it informs their opinions about themselves, their self-awareness, their perceived status, or the fate of their relationship . <br /> <br /> The title is appropriate because you get a full spectrum of black, white and gray ... and not just in skin pigmentation of the characters. Leila Goldoni (truly remarkable here) is an African American / Caucasian, her two brothers are white and dark African American. The irony is that they exist in what is undoubtedly the "hippest" most tolerant atmosphere of the time ... beat-driven east-east-west Manhatten ... and there are still conflicts in and around themselves. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever seen a movie with such a subtle delivery or technique. It's much like absorbing a really good piece of art gallery and then just nodding in bliss as you think back to the pictures it evoked days later. Great mastering and extras on the Criterion disk. Probably the first truly experimental independent film ever made.
