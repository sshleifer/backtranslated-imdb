Oh, how refreshing to see a vision of the 18th century England complete with mud, pox and gibbets ... and accompanied by a nice techno soundtrack to start. This is the story of shaded highwayman Plunkett (Robert Carlisle) and the gentleman's fall of hard times Captain Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller) and how they meet and divulge the aristopies. Plunkett is a hard nut, but MaCleane is too polite to it, and thus becomes "gentleman highwayman". He falls in love with Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler) (who is honest is the only weak part of the whole shebang) and will impress her. The costumes are amazing. Big, colorful, historic innacurate beautiful train. Alan Cummings gets all the best threads and the best lines like Lord Rochester who have a lot of eyebrow piercing in the very 1800s. The music shifts between swooping glorious choirs and pounding bass-laden techno, which doesn't crumble as you think it should do in a historical movie. The manuscript is quickly moved and pointed with today's colloquialisms; Merchant Ivory, it's not. There are hilarious parts, obnoxious parts, sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat-and-nibble-your-nails parts, but all the chugs along and are wonderfully entertaining all the way through. These are cheer-in-the-cinema things. Unmissable.
