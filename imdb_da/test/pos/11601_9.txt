It is very difficult to portray a Tagore novel along cinematographic lines. And if you forget a fuzzy production of 1967, then the first time chokher bali has been performed on a large scale. Overall, the seats looked amazing with the right moves to make a successful period drama.Prasenjit, so used to make crass commercial stuff made a good effort.I saw the Bengali version and found out that Aishwariya's voice was called, making her dialogue Delivery a little poor. While the director did a good job describing each of the characters with finesse, there was very little in the way of meaningful plot, probably the lack of history itself. But the development of the characters, including those with lesser roles, seems to be the strongest point. It is difficult to make some Tagore stories for movies, as only the visual parts appear to be realized.
