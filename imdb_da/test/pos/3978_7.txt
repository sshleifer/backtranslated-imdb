A good movie. The film was even better than the advertisements put on. And believe it or not, it was very very inspiring. I really believe that anyone who goes out of the movie at the end will be inspired in one way or another. <br /> <br /> At first, it was a bit corny, but getting fast. I laughed. I laughed a lot at some parts. The action is basically above average, nothing special but better than average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st Funniest is CLERKS II). So after all that, I give it a 7/10 (a high seven, but not quite an eight).
