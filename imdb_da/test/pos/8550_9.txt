This is a finely crafted movie with moving sequences, humor and best of all a love story. Anthony Quinn is wonderfully cast, and having seen several of his films, this must be categorized as one of his best performances, besides Zorba. The movie really makes you wonder if it's filmed in Romania, which apparently isn't. It is safe to fool even native Romans with its authentic landscape, costume and ways of living. According to IMDb, it is actually shot in France and Yugoslavia, hmmm. The story is convincing, so you want to watch the whole movie over to see if you have missed something. It provoked me to research to find out if this is a truth-based movie, but to my disappointment, it is a novel-based film, apparently fiction. It seems to be a bit far-fetched to have happened for real, but you never know .... One problem with this movie is that it doesn't seem to throw any Romanian actors, and it's a movie about a Romanian Grade. There are probably many Romanian fillings in the beginning, but maybe it's not filmed elsewhere. The author of the book was Romanian, at least it was all fine and dandy - generally a masterpiece in filmography.
