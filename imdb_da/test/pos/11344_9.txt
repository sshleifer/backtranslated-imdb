SPOILER ALERT !!! <br /> <br /> You can listen to Wong Kar-wai's movie as a radio game: Invisible vibrations between the characters, the spaces in which they stay, the rhythm that pushes them in front, the attraction and dislikes - the full spectrum of the atmosphere is played by the audio track. The dialogue is mostly insignificant. The story resembles a childish, amorous look at a beautiful woman and a sad man whose sorrows are noticeable but helpless. "In The Mood For Love" is told from a children's perspective, but the child never appears as telling. The film's aesthetics are developed by extreme light and color dramatics, hard cuts, an unassociated, almost documentary camera and a complex, discreet sound. Brilliant use of Nat King Cole's "Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps" whose mystical power grows more often, it repeats, and the melancholy waltz helps in the graceful choreography of the two main characters. Maggie Cheung in her beautiful dresses is brilliant, the perfect for the stylish, stylish Tony Leung. The audience assumes a romance between them, but Wong just sees sad departure. The two potential lovers turn around each other as satellites, knowing that they will never share the same circuit. You want them to find each other. They do not want and the emotional power in their non-love context makes the movie incredibly fascinating. It is about broken happiness and unspoken love. In all of Wong's films, these are the search engines. Love whether it comes too early or it comes too late to take one and not the other person. The request of the characters that are never fulfilled, their loneliness, the grief and the fortune they experience when it is too late.
