I watched this movie in a snap preview, and it's great. The cinema is exceptionally creative, the play is good, and the story is fabulous. If this movie doesn't perform well, it won't be because it doesn't deserve it. Before this movie I didn't understand how charming Shia Lebouf could be. He does a wonderful, independent work as the management. There is something incredibly sweet about him, and that makes the movie even better. The other actors also do a good job, and the movie features moments of really high excitement, more than you might expect from a movie about golf. Sports movies are a dime a dozen, but this one stands out. <br /> <br /> This is one I would recommend to anyone.
