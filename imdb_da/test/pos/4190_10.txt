The cinema of the 60s was as much as the revolutionary time as politics and music. Filmmakers were bold to make avant-garde films that discussed taboo issues that were only allowed before in exploitation films. Starting with both "Breathless" and underground American cinema (like Kenneth Anger), films became more and more experimental. All of this accumulated when Hollywood realized that they had a lot of commercial appeal with "Easy Rider". One of the best (and most surprising) exits from this era was also one of the least successful in the beginning. "Head" was made when The Monkee's career was severely diminishing, which is what cursed one of the best psychedelic films ever made. <br /> <br /> The reason? Well, there really is not one that many have said. It involves The Monkees going from a surreal scenario to the next. However, these sequences are clearly LSD-tinged and basically mock how the Monkees were sick of being limited to their light pre-fab reputation. It's a shame that the movie didn't find any audience. Teeny Boppers, who loved them, had moved to a new dish as they always do. The psychedelic / Haight-Ashbury crowd to which the film was shot would never be captured dead in a Monkee's movie. Its all their loss. This movie may be smaller, but it is certainly not meaningless and highly intelligent. The crew later made both "Easy Rider" and "Five Easy Pieces". The movie was later revived by a 1973 Raybert retrospective, and it received a very positive response that gave it the cult it had earned for a long time. Ironically, The Monkees would be the victim of the same commercialism they protested in this film with the reunification of their later 80s. (10/10)
