If anyone is in doubt about the talent Liev Schrieber, just take a look at his new movie, "Everything is Illuminated", which clearly shows a man who is not only one of America's finest actors, but a new director whose first effort In fact, it is an inspiration and a harbinger of what to follow. Mr. Schreiber has adapted the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer to a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material. The film clearly exceeded our expectations as we had no foreseen ideas. <br /> <br /> For those who haven't seen the movie, you may need to stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Jonathan is a collector. His love for his grandparents is unlimited. He looks like his grandfather dies, and as his grandmother is at what seems to be her death bed. At a clear time, this dying woman gives Jonathan a picture and an amber ornament for her collection. When you look at the picture, long ago, a young couple is seen together. Watching makes Jonathan think it shows grandfather and his girlfriend taken at happiness times. Seeing a snapshot seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to look for his ancestral past in Ukraine. <br /> <br /> Jonathan made arrangements with a travel agency, Heritage Tours, of Odessa for his journey to the Trochenbrod, the mythical place where his grandfather came from. The agency is handled by an elderly man who claims to be blind and his grandson, Alex, a man who loves the pop American culture that has captured his imagination as well as his contemporaries in the country. Alex speaks some kind of English, no speaker and his conversation and translation, for Jonatson's benefit is hilarious to our use for sometimes unheard-of English expressions. The old man insists on taking his dog, Sammy Davis Jr., against Jonathan's desires who do not want to sit next to the creeping and barking animals during the journey. <br /> <br /> As they enter the Trochenbrod search, it is clear that his companions, especially the old man, have no idea where to go. At this point, the film becomes a road movie, as the three characters on the country's back roads become more familiar with each other. When the trio arrives at the sunflower field with the house at the end, it suggests that they have actually come to the right place. Some places are a clear reminder of past conflicts. <br /> <br /> The older woman living in the isolated place is the missing link of history. She is able to put things in the right perspective. But here's where history changes its weight from Jonathan, who has clearly come to the land of his ancestors, to the old man. We see when this older man begins to remember things about himself. This again changes the movie's dynamics as we discover how the connection between Jonathan and his guides has been. <br /> <br /> Some criticisms on these sites have voiced opinions on the accuracy of the story, which is after all a work of fiction and liberties. It would have been impossible to make another movie, including as much as contained in the book. The amazing way the movie is divided into different chapters is a smart way to let the viewer know what is being watched. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood, a magnificent film actor, does an excellent job of suppressing Jonathan. Mr. Wood makes one of his best appearances in any movie with his main character interpretation. The happy casting of Eugene Hutz as Alex, the Ukrainian tour assistant and translator, seems to be an idea made in heaven. Hutz is about the best in the movie. His arcane use of English gives the film a funny angle that pleases the viewer. Boris Leskin as Alex's grandfather and the driver of the tour car makes a valuable contribution to the film, as well as Laryssa Lauret, seen in the latter part of the film. <br/> <br /> The outstanding filmography of Matthew Libatique brings the splendor of the Czech country to its fullness. The musical score of Paul Cantelon is heard in the background that adorns the film in ways it gives a wealth to the movie. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a triumph for Liev Schreiber, first-time director, who will surely go a long way in what he decides to do next.
