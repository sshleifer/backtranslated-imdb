It's an amazingly good movie, with some surprising twists, a good cast and a good script. Only a few stupid bits, like Rasta hit-man scene (This guy is professional?), But it has already been commented. The fact I had only heard a guy in the workplace mention it before, and didn't have many opinions or reviews to continue, making it even more entertaining. This gets a higher score than maybe some people think it deserves, but I have to factor in the low budget and the good effort from the cast. It sings me that some movies are made whose budget corresponds to a small country's GDP, with a hyped up release, good reviews, an Oscar-winning instructor and / or actors, and turn out to be so disappointing with actors sleeping Through their roles and uninspired control with predictable plot lines and a story with holes in it so great, Sandra Bullock could run a bomb-loaded bus through it. (Examples are in my opinion The Terminal, Castaway, Matrix: Revolutions) Extra points for the wardrobe department choose beautiful clothes for the cast, especially Paulina Porizcova, who wears a rubber dress in a scene and a jacket with "c * nt" on the back in large letters in another! A sex scene showing her tight ass and a good soundtrack added bonuses! And enough, enough with the Tarantino comparisons, it did not remind me of a Tarantino flick at all .... and Tarantino borrows almost all ideas he has ever had from other movies! Although this is your opinion, when a particular movie or book is written or directed in a way, can we never use the same ideas again? Be real. This movie has its own style.
