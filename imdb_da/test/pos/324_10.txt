Mani sir who usually brings another great story out with Kannathil Muthamittal. Such a great relationship between parents and child is brought out in a beautiful way. Mani Sir as usual without very special effects and not much outdoor shots. (In fact, it was the only movie where he went outside of India ever .. it's just for Sri Lanka) .Mani's class is written all over the film ... and adding it to ARR's music .. which is just amazing. .. Vellai Pookal is one of my most fav songs ever ... Maddy, who is what he is in the movie industry has also impressed a lot. From alaipayuthey to canathil to ayutha ezuthu to guru .. Mani Ratnam has shown to the world what a versatile actor Maddy is. Simran has also been really good. She has shown that she can also act in non-glamorous and character roles. All in all a fantastic movie. Sad that the Tamil public couldn't appreciate this gr8 movie and it bombed at the cashier's office.
