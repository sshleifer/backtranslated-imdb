Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you will be hard pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental function that can withstand time, space and convention in a way that only underground films from the sixties could. reflection of these films. No matter how you feel about Monkees, it is a movie that every filmmaker must see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium. Had it not been for the film's unorthodox ad campaign (and the fact that when it came out, the media translated the media that the public was tired of them and every critic was ready to hit them), it could have had a much bigger impact. Studying how the film was edited is much more important and exciting than what really is in the movie - and yet there are some good things in it (good songs, great filmography, etc.). Must be seen after midnight for maximum effect due to the overall dream-like feeling. 1968 was a time of social unrest and a call for change (hence the film's working title "Changes") and HEAD perfectly reflects the time.
