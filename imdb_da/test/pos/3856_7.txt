There are a number of few comic strips where animals or something "not human" portray people, and I think this movie is one of them. Apart from a few points in the plot and the characters - this movie can be changed with all people rather than primarily animals. Although - it is good that someone did not - I feel that the cats are very good in this movie that depicts people! :-) <br /> <br /> This movie also focuses on a lot of adult issues - which is quite strange for a Disney movie. It mentions alcohol *, shows a dog teaching another dog how to attack "three-fit" people, and it shows a male cat called (Abraham Delacy Gieuseppe Casi Thomas) O 'Malley, who prefers a female cat on a surprisingly human and adult way. br /> <br /> As a cartoon film - or just a movie in general, I think this is pretty good quality - history and characters are particularly good. The film (generally) is set in France and you meet a family of cats - Mother Duchess and her kittens Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz. You also meet the kind (rich) old woman who loves the cats, butler Edgar and an old man (who has lost his marble), called George. The friendly old woman discusses her will with George and Edgar to hear that what he receives from the will he gets after the cat has it. He's INKREDIBLY ticked this - and has a bad plan in mind ... <br /> <br /> A very cute movie of any age - enjoy "Aristocats"! <br /> <br /> * Not included "Basil the Great Mouse Detective" and a few others that I can't think of at the moment.
