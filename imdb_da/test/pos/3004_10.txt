I would give this TV series a 10 plus if I could. The authors were "smack on" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show. These characters were so real. One could tell it from the two main actresses, Ms Toussaint & Ms. Potts that their relationship with and from the camera was genuine. It didn't just end when you heard the familiar words "Cut" at the end of a "Take". The show is very much about life for example. Historical battles, tragedies and triumphs, relationships, everyday situations, every household has the same situations, no matter who the members are, it really came down to just being a wonderful family show that at the end of each episode you can just sit on your living room sofa and tell yourself "now what I learned from this episode". <br /> <br /> I have to say I have lost most of the episodes and I find myself seeing them again and again. <br /> <br /> Now you know why I gave it a 10+ !!
