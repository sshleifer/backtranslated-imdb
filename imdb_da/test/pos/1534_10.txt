Even the trailer for this movie makes me cry like the first time I saw this movie. Not for people who are easily upset with intense materials! The finest performances by Alan Rickman and Madelaine Stowe, no doubt. This horrible tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture it is citizens for some reason, whether they are anarchists or the author of children's books, will chill you to the bone. I saw it when it first came out in 1991 and I remember every frame. It still scares hell out today. It happens now. <br /> <br /> Apparently IMDb requires ten lines to meet their criteria for a film review. IMDb may want to get a glimpse! Some of us are a little more wise about writing opinions.
