Great adaptation of Christie's novel. Surprising attention to authentic time details currently (Many films from the mid-1970s-early 80s trying to make the 1920s and early 30s look far to the center of The 70's and the early 80's to my taste, so expected the worst here and were happily proved wrong) Costumes and sets are very well done. I liked this production a lot? largely because of the charming Francesca Annis' depiction of a carefree, bright young Lady "Frankie" and James Warwick's charming Bobbie. The couple would continue to portray Christie's Tommy & Tuppence, which is fun, as some contemporary book critics compared Frankie and Bobby with her former characters of Tommy & Tuppence. Supportive sign was just as well done ?? The supreme Mrs. Rivington (acted by Miss Marple-to-be Joan H.) and "Badger" played perfectly as post WWI, "Bertie Wooster type."
