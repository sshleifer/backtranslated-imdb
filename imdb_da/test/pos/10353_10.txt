Absolutely disgusting and cheap bawdy humor. I loved it !!! It is the most obnoxious and utterly horrible movie, except for Nicolas Read, who plays an infinite Court Jester, for comic sheen. But it was as possible, I laughed so many times, and I have to leave it to the filmmakers, it was not pretentious or ordinary in any way. Rape, fighting, zombies vomiting on their rape victims. What other movie does this have? Not for the quesy, but with a pizza, a bong and a six beer package, you got it made if you have a cast iron flavor and a juvenile sense of humor like myself.
