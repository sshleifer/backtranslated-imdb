It happened to me as I looked at "Imaginary Heroes" that a film writer trying to make a drama about family relationships seriously considers killing a child or two in the opening role as a way to get his characters open and reveal themselves. There has to be something about this story, because it looks as if every other family drama coming down into the pike uses this device in some form ("Paradise" and "Moonlight Mile" are just two of the newer examples, who springs to mind immediately, even if one could come back to a golden oldie like "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?" to do so too). It is not that the child's death is an illegal subject for serious films to explore. Far from. It's like something like that, it can be so overblown that it just becomes another movie cliché, a convenient little narrative shorthand to get the ball rolling and give the characters something to intervene for the rest of the time we come to The last work is "Imaginary Heroes", a movie that borrows heavily from what is one of the earliest and perhaps most well-known examples of "family dealing with the death of a child" genre, Academy Award winner "Ordinary People." Like the characters in the previous film, Travisers on the surface seem to be the ideal suburban family until a fateful day, their eldest son, Matt, who is the "golden boy" athlete and thus the apple to his father's eye kills without explanation (a minor difference is that the son of "Ordinary People" dies as a result of an accident, not suicide). It is Matt's younger brother, Tim, who is starting to find the body, and who takes on the role of the lead in the movie. Each of the other family members handles the tragedy in its own way. Matt, who has always lived in his elder brother's shadow, is becoming increasingly alienated from the father, who has almost ignored him throughout his life and begins to turn to survival drugs. Ben, the father, is swallowed up in feelings of remorse and guilt, turning away from both his job and his family. His wife, Sandy, is the most complex character in the film, an outdoor child of the 60s who feels strange in the role of the mother and wife as she maintains a largely loveless marriage in sterile suburbia. She spends most of her time after the tragedy trying to reconnect with her pot-smoke past. As written and directed by Dan Harris, "Imaginary Heroes" appears as a wildly uneven film. For every scene that feels genuine and authentic, there is another that comes across as arbitrary and unauthorized. One sometimes has the feeling that Harris would like to tie every possible life situation he can think of in his script, perhaps an admirable goal, but one that makes the movie unnecessarily melodramatic in the process. Instead of identifying with the characters and getting caught up in their situation, we often think, "Oh, come on, what next?" For teenagers suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hot-button topics covered by this movie; The manuscript also affects drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, sexual identity conflict, life-threatening illness, even unintentional gay incest. It is this "anything but kitchen sink" mentality in the writing that robs the film of much of the credibility it really needs to care for us. That's not to say that "Imaginary Heroes" is a bad or unfair movie. Much of what it has to say about family relationships and values ​​in the 21st century is insightful, original, pointed and deep. Prime credit for its success goes to the actors Emile Hirsch, Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, who deliver obvious, sensitive performances in their respective roles. It is they who overcome the narrative transgressions to stimulate our brains and touch our hearts. In addition, Harris, in turn, achieves an effective melancholy tone throughout, but one that is often amplified by some badly needed flashes of bold dark comedy. <br /> <br /> "Imaginary Heroes" may appear unfocused and derived from times, but its fine performances and subtle mood swings make it worth watching.
