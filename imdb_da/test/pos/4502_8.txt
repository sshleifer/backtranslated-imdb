I have not read the novel on which "The Kite Runner" is based. My wife and daughter, who did, thought the film was far away from the book and I'm ready to take their word for it. But alone, the film is good - not great, but good. How exactly does it show the destruction caused by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? How convincingly does the intolerant Taliban regime show? I would rate it C + on the first and B + on the other. The human history, the Afghan-American who returned to the country to save his childhood playmate's son, is well done, but it is especially here that I was told the book was far more convincing than the movie. The most exciting part of the film, however, is not that the kitek competitions in Kabul and later a mini-competition in California - have not meant the book. I'd bet money on it.
