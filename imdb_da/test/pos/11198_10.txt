The only complaint I heard about this movie was that it was slow. Although this may be the purpose. The two characters collide unforgivingly and the slow build-up of tension between them is anxiety-producing. The intricate and subtle movements and minimal dialogue take the excitement to a point where an otherwise normal argument chokes the audience. Istanbul and the outskirts are dreamy, scenery captivating, and the plot is exciting - not in that "look, the hero blew another car and he now flies with his motorcycle" of course. I had chills down my spine as the characters moved in and out of each other's spheres and saw the fog sense of Istanbul.
