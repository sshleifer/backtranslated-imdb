A gentle story that suggests rage, with a redemptive message and brilliant celebration. The photograph is wonderfully well done. Cinematographers look at this kind of movie to hone their craft not just for what the eye can do to improve a story, but what the right camera word can do to enhance the feel. Feeding the soul is per. Definition what this movie addresses, but with an elegance and grace of delivery that simply does not happen much longer, at least with this degree of taste, restraint and finesse. If you are interested in history and character development, it is also a good movie to see as an example of which simple lines and the right delivery can do to fill out a character's impression. Match all this with a movie score that is almost minimalist in character and also perfectly conceived and you will "get" this movie.
