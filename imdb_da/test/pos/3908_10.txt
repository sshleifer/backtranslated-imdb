This excellent movie starring Elizabeth Montgomery is a long time for release in DVD form. The same can be said for her former, also excellent films, A Case of Rape. I can only hope that my comments encourage some enterprising minds to place both Elizabeth Montgomery movies on a DVD to be made available to her many fans. First of all, I think that this excellent actress role was stereotyped by his role on Bewitched, and as a result, no more serious plays were made to her. I am convinced that if these two films, perhaps even a trilogy with The Legend of Lizzie Borden, were released in DVD form, her fans would put the record right on how high they regard her serious acting skills.
