I was very pleased and at the same time surprised by other positive comments written by non-Koreans below. This movie is incredibly heartbreaking and shows a lot of 'sad but warm' views of life typical of Korean people. I thought other foreigners would not understand this delicate feeling and under-rate this silent movie as a dull, but I was wrong. The attraction of this movie can be difficult to avoid for foreigners as well. (Even without subtitles ...) <br /> <br /> I would like to mention some points that others have missed. Of course, this film depicts love between a man and a woman. But the theme itself is far beyond that. In fact, it's about time, the value of memory and death. In this film, focus is not on 'love affair' between two people. As some pointed out, they do not kiss, they do not hug each other, even without holding their hands. So love itself is not completed (either positively or negatively) in the film. What is rather Jungwon (a leading actor) is rather his impending death. He runs out of time, he can't keep it and leaves a couple behind, including his father and of course Darim (a measurement). So the problem is how he can face death and leave something valuable in his short life, not how he can love himself with Darim. <br /> <br /> This kind of theme sounds very familiar to us. There are lots of movies about patients with incurable illness like 'Love Story'. But what makes this movie excellent is the way Jungwon deals with his death. He is a loser, but tried to do his best while living, in a good way. He doesn't tell anyone about him about his death. He hides something in his mind, but without anger, hate, revenge. He just tried to do the best while he was alive. This limited communication and obedience to fate is Korea's typical mindset and point that most Western people do not understand or at best misunderstand. <br /> <br /> This theme is very effectively expressed by the director of this movie (surprisingly, his debut). Some say he is heavily influenced by Japanese director Ozu Yasujiro, who directed Tokyo Story. In fact, I remember reading in a magazine that the director himself admitted that he was influenced by Ozu. I'm not so knowledgeable about analyzing its style compared to Ozu's, but they have some in common and some not. Low angle and static camera, especially reminding us of Ozu style. But as far as the theme is concerned, this Korean director seems to have some warmer and hopeless vision. <br /> <br /> It is expressed in summary with Jungwon's last picture. Very well done and really heartbreaking scene, I think. In fact, the director had the idea of ​​this movie when he attended the funeral of a very famous Korean folk song that died young of mysterious suicide. They say he saw the photograph of the singer at the funeral and thought of a film about death and memory. (And possibly hope for the remains, I think ...) I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has great interest in cinema as well as Korean culture. This film, in my opinion, can be rivaled by other films like Tokyo history and some kind of American beauty. It is great if without language barrier. DVD version will be out in the market in February, so it may be a little help for foreigners with English subtitles.
