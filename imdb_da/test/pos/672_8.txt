A great B-function. A virtual two-handed and seen in a day (you can see it is the scene's origin and even how it should have acted as a radio game), and while only 77 minutes played out in sequences that look like real time. Robert Ryan is the psychopath who holds Ida Lupino trapped in his own home. Both are excellent, especially the under-qualified Lupino, whose original independence and self-control soon crumble before Ryan's outrageous intruders. Today, of course, it will be all the courage and do, but the restraint shown by director Harry Horner (much better known as an art director) adds only the excitement that is sometimes worthy of Hitchcock.
