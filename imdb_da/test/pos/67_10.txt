This Blake Edwards movie is not quite sure whether it will be a comedy, a drama or a musical. Regardless, Julie Andrews' pure presence is reason enough to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy spoof. Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents throughout the film. Rock Hudson looks tired, but he is more than fine as Julia's romantic interest. Authentic world war cars and airplanes add to the appeal. Overall, the film is very entertaining. DVD release is an edited (by Blake Edwards) version of the original release. It is alleged that this is the only version that Edwards would allow; but Turner Classic Movies has recently shown the complete (theatrical version) version. Recommended.
