Martin Ritt seems to be a director who was always interested in social issues (as an immigrant's son, he had all the incentive to be, especially when he was blacklisted in the 50s). "Conrack" is based on Pat Conysy's novel "The Water is Wide", about his own experience in 1969 teaching a school of poor black children around the world, much to the right-wing superintendent (Hume Cronyn). What was added to the film's strength was the cultural and historical context: Conroy (Jon Voight) frustratingly tells another teacher how many of the children do not know about Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, the Vietnam War or even where Vietnam is. He continues to inform them of all these factors. <br /> <br /> Somewhere I read a complaint that when Conroy played music for the kids, he played only white music. The truth is, you can't blame the movie for it; It was based on Conroy's true experience. In any case, the film is a real gem.
