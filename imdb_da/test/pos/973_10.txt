This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. A 14-year-old boy Jason Shepherd wrote an English paper called "Big Fat Liar". When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to the college on time, and he hit a limo. As he entered the limo, he met a famous Hollywood producer, Marty Wolf. When he left the limo, he forgot one thing: his paper! So Marty Wolf took it and he turned Jason's English paper into a movie! When Jason admitted he left his paper in limo and Marty took it, his parents and his English teacher didn't believe him! So Jason and his friend Kaylee had to fly to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood to have Marty admit he stole his story to Jason's parents. When Jason told Marty to call his father that Marty stole that paper, Marty cheated him and burned his paper! Jason became so angry that Marty burned the paper, so Marty called security to get Jason out of his site! Jason and Kaylee realized that Marty would not admit the truth. To take Marty down in phase 2: Takedown, Jason and Kaylee put permanent blue dye in the pot and when Marty jumps in, his body gets blue and it wouldn't come out! Then they put permanent orange dye in Marty's shampoo, and when he uses it, his hair gets completely orange and it wouldn't come out either! Finally, they put lots of glue on Marty's earpiece to make him call Jason's father, and when Marty uses it, stick it to his ear! It was fun when Marty's hair and body were all blue and orange and his headset was glued to his ear! Then they tricked Marty by telling Monty, who is Mike's assistant, that Duncan moved to a house where there is a party going on. When Marty went in to see Duncan, he was in the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him up! When Marty was in the house, Jason and Kaylee switched control of his car. When Marty drove his car, he knew all the controls were changing and he didn't know which button to press. He's stupid enough to fall for it. When Marty hit the back end of the masker, the masker destroyed his car! It was so funny. So Marty starts calling Jason's father and trick him again! He was on the phone, but it wasn't his father, he called security! After the security Jason and Kaylee got out of Mike's website, they suggested they go home. Monty was to be on Jason and Kayle's side because she knew Marty was a liar and a jerk, so she told Rocco who is one of the security guards that she will take care of the kids. Jason told his father the truth about what he has been for the last 2 days and if his parents came to L.A. When Monty came to the kids, she would help the children enter Phase 4: The Payback. Jason shares the crew in 3 teams to phase 4. A team will distract and fool Marty until Jason's parents come to the set. Marty rescued first with Frank Jackson, but his car broke down so he rode with Jaleel, but he took him into the desert and left him there. When Marty was in the desert, a helicopter came to rescue him. Then one of the knives is stuck so Marty and the pilot came out of the helicopter. Then he was on his way to the set, and when Jason saw him, Marty stopped and saw what Jason had: his monkey! So Marty went after Jason and Kaylee, and when they saw Lester, he released the water, and when the water came, Marty shot away. Marty was still after the kids and when Kaylee went the other way, Jason Marty led to the top of the apartment. At the top, Jason was challenging Marty by getting him to admit the truth, and Marty will never tell the truth. When the crew was surprised by Marty, all people, including Jason's parents, knew what Marty was doing. Marty was supposed to kill Jason, but the only way for Jason to escape is to jump off the top! Then his parents thought Marty took his story. As the people who were on the set left, this is the end of Marty. In the end, Jason's story, Big Fat Liar was a movie. I can't get enough of it.
