Don't ask me why I love so much movie ... Maybe it came at some point in my life, I wanted desperately to fit in, maybe it's the amazing monster effects, maybe because I enjoyed the short story "Cabal", but that's enough because I love Clive Barker. I think it's fair to warn you about the movie, and the novel has no true solution, and like me you'll probably have a WTF moment in the end. At least two successors were planned, but never came to the ground because the film flopped for a few reasons. The studio made drastic cuts to the movie, which cut a good half of it, and they did a terrible job promoting it. The ads made it look like another cheap slasher that primarily shows the "Button face / Mask" Decker character. This is a movie about monsters! About imagination! About a place called Midian! It's a story where monsters are the good guys. There really is nothing else out there like that! It's not a movie for anyone I suppose, but it is one of Clive's many amazing works. Sit back and be prepared to be taken to Midian - where monsters are.
