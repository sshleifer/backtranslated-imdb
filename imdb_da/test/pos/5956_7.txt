I recently saw this at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2007, where it ended as one of the audience's favorites. This is a spear on the French cottage industry of OSS 117 films from the 50s and 60s. The first OSS 117 movie based on the short story by Jean Bruce was brought to the screen in 1956, long before the first James Bond movie, staring Ivan Desny as Hubert Bonisseur De La Bath and six subsequent action adventure spy films made in 1970 with Luc Merenda, Frederick Stafford, Kerwin Matthews and John Gaven all change as Us 117. Jean Dujardin is in the title role in this comic series. As the film begins in 1945, he has a French mustache and resembles Desny, but when the film begins, it's the 1955 setting, he really looks like Sean Connery. Jean Fran√ßois Halim wrote this hilarious manuscript of a spy sent to Egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. It borrows on the silliness of Naked Gun, Get Smart and Pink Panther and uses fresh humor at current events in a nice combination that international audiences will enjoy and I am sure this will be the only one of the first to come by A revived OSS 117 reworked for comedy adventures. Michel Hazanavicius instructs. I would give this a 7.5 and recommend it.
