I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. However, my two personal favorites are unforgiving and tombstone. This movie, however, I loved! It was good! The plot was well finished and it was a fun movie. Everyone who participated in this movie did excellent! I even think it hit both movies in someway. Well, not really unforgiven, because it was a great movie that these two cannot compare to in the long run. I think it knocked out Tombstone himself. Both had strong points. For example, they both had excellently known casts, very good plots and very good filming. But Posse knocked out Tombstone in four ways in my opinion. First, the characters were more unique in Posse. The music was better in Posse. The idea was original in Posse, unlike Wyatt Earp. And the biggest difference, the action sequences! Oh, my goodness! Posse was a western with really good action sequences. I mean really good! The action was paced quickly. Like modern day based shoot'em up movies. The action also had big budget explosions! Fistfights were also quite good. Mario Van Pebbles was amazing in this movie! I suggest buying this excellent movie!
