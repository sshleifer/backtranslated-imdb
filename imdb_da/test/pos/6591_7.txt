Ernesto is a man who lives by popping up other solid citizens of their hard earned money. Along with Manco, an older man with great experience, he pulls out hijackers that allow him to make a decent living, but it doesn't make him a rich man in any way. Enter Federico, an older man who is more experienced in the art of fraud. Together with the younger Ernesto, they show a winning combination. It only lasted until Pilar, Federico's former love interest, appeared on the picture. <br /> <br /> This Spanish film, directed by Miguel Bardem, is light in tone and comfortable to sit through. Other, better-made caper films are made with very clever plots than this one, but the film is easy to take, and sometimes it has a lot of fun situations. <br /> <br /> This viewer will see Federico Luppi in something even reading the phone book! He is the actor's actor. We have had the privilege of having seen him in the Buenos Aires scene with excellent work before his international film career. As Federico, he does what he does best. It is impossible to imagine anyone better in his role. Ernesto Alterio, son of Hector Alterio, is a young actor who promises to have a good career. Victoria Abril makes Pilar fun as she gets involved in these contexts. Miguel Alexandre, a veteran actor, is also good as Manco.
