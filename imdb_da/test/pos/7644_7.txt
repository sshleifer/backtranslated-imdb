I watched this movie on HBO and I was fine. <br /> <br /> The director has done a good job. I found myself completely absorbed in this movie when it started. Norman Reedu's performance is cool. I expect more chilling movies from him. <br /> <br /> I was so absorbed that I would sometimes have taken a gun from Norman and shoot the snake girl. Hehe. I like the movies when innocent looking girls play tricks with men really cunning. The end was what I wanted :)) <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with instant phrases. You expect this, but something else happens. <br /> <br /> Initially, these massive images were sharp scenes really painful to the eyes. Although not shown when Norman Reedus changed currency notes? Or is it standing by the fridge. :)
