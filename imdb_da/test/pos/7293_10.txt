I just have to say that this movie is the bomb. You have to cry when you see this. I think it is a reminder to everyone how hard and easy it is to fall in love. It reminds you of the days of your youth when you were carefree and all that was bad for you was washed away with a single kiss. Even though I'm still a teenager, that's how I live my life. When I am with that particular person, everything that was negative in my mind was deleted. So, I give this movie a 10 because it's hearty message and touching plot. Actors Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein I also give a 10 to have a sweet face.
