Then the Koreans are now beaten by American horror flicks. But they do it in style. DOLL MASTER is a close copy of PUPPETMASTER and DOLLS, and even has a small childrens arrow that goes after it. Several young adults are invited to attend a special event in a gallery filled with dolls, only to find they are the targets of a revenge spirit. The dolls come to life and do some smart things for the kids. The Gore level is reasonably high, the photograph and set of design and production values ​​are first rate, the play is not that bad, and the scares are certainly there. DOLL MASTER must not be in the same league with a spoken word of two or even dead friend, but it is close. Give it a watch. You will not be disappointed.
