After a few years of searching for the Humphrey Bogart movie, "Two Against the World", it unexpectedly turned out to be a TCM offer titled "One Fatal Hour", a first national film from 1936. Bogey is the character Sherry Scott, the man running WUBC, a radio station whose program series loses listeners. The owner Bertram Reynolds (Robert Middlemass) is a pathetic executive who calls the shots at the station, but hides behind his decisions by picking them up at Scott. <br /> <br /> In an effort to increase audience base and revenue, Reynolds has the idea of ​​reviving a twenty-year-old murder case and offering it as a fifteen-chapter radio play. Scott calls for the support of Dr. Martin Leavenworth (Harry Hayden) for writing the game and presenting it in the air. The Pembroke Murder case involved a woman acquitted of murdering her husband, the circumstances of which have not been clarified. But Gloria Pembroke is married and now lives as Martha Carstairs (Helen MacKellar), married to a successful banker (Henry O'Neill), and their daughter Edith (Linda Perry) is getting married (the same day no less as radio play is that reveal the identity of Gloria Pembroke). Being confronted with the devastating effects of this revelation, Martha and Jim Carstairs go on a crusade to get the program stopped. At the same time, Edith's future in-laws respond by demanding that marriage not take place. <br /> <br /> Without revealing the final result, the movie takes a devastating turn to scare the viewer. Edith Carstairs confronts the radio station's directors, strongly deploying Scott and the snappy Reynolds. While accepting his part of the blame for the result, Scott admitted in part by quitting his job, shooting his secretary and hauling her out of the office and acknowledging her for the conscience he once had. With a completely abrupt finish, the film leaves one as disoriented and rude as any movie that does not have a good ending. <br /> <br /> With about a dozen movies under his belt, Humphrey Bogart gets a chance to take center stage here with exciting results. Without names supporting players, Bogey rises to the occasion by taking responsibility in the radio offices and driving the show as if it were his own. In an interesting characterization, he expresses his expedition by crossing his hands over his curved head and anticipating a similar effect for half a year, as we will see him doing in "Casablanca". For Bogart fans it is a real treat to catch an unexpected nuance like this one.
