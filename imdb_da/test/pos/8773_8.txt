I'm a massive Hitchcock fan ever since watching "Rear Window" on TV. "Saboteur" is not Hitchcock's best for myself, it is very good but not a masterpiece. It has its faults, some parts go quite slowly and, as a result of being written off in haste, the writing felt rather incomplete. But Hitchcock's direction is fantastic, and the performance wasn't that bad. While Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane both do a good enough job, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very close to stealing the show. The story is good, about a fake man along the way, very similar themes used in "39 steps" and "north of the northwest", and wisely gives much needed escapism. The music score was absolutely excellent; the music in the open title sequence was phenomenal, almost like a distorted march, and I liked the tombs of Tchaikovsky's first piano concert and Beethoven's 5th symphony. The kinematics are also sharp and smooth, the landscape and landscape are almost dazzling, and there are also a number of very effective scenes. For the Statue of Liberty climax, but circus troupe meetings and Radio Music City Hall shoot-out are also on the money. Overall, not Hitchcock's best, but definitely worth the look. 8/10 Bethany Cox
