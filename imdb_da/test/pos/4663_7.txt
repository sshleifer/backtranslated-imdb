**Warning! Small plot spoilers in front! <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job" is not the best movie you want to see all year, or probably even this summer. But it is a worthy two hours because it colors in the lines, knows the boundaries and doesn't try to cross them. <br /> <br /> What carries the film is the work of the work. In a film about a thief crew, the individuals must have a good report with each other. Without the cohesive feeling, the audience does not believe in the characters collectively or individually, and the film never has a chance. But from the first scenes where the men scream around and shake each other as they infiltrate a Venetian palace, the right chemistry is in place. The people themselves are nothing new; They are your basic gang of criminals that contain about half a dozen players, each with a specific and defining skill. But each actor brings the right items to the table for his part. Mark Wahlberg's undervalued plays and humor fit well with his role as mastermind planner. Edward Norton gives attitude and twirls his mustache well in his dark role. Donald Sutherland is the crew's grandfather, and he sees the part of the suave and old-fashioned thief who is still mentally scattered. Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def do not do much beyond their character's abilities, but they nail each of them. Statham as the sliding driver; Green as tech whiz geek with a chip on his shoulder; and Def as the demolition man. Charlize Theron slides well in a part that doesn't ask too much of her. She is primarily asked to drive fast and look good. That she does. None of the characters are so deep or three-dimensional, but in this known kind of film, two dimensions are all that is required. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, the film has a European feel, a la "The Bourne Identity," partly because it was shot in place in Venice along with Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Also contributing to the Euro flair is the rhythmic, jumping music that adds the girl's optimal nature and complements the cast's report. The look of the movie is also a perfect match. The bright colors in all rooms increase the mood and add to the attitude. Minis not only provides a fun variant on the car, but also functions as a necessary plot unit. <br /> <br /> The reason is more or less straight forward. There are some surprises, but they are more of the fast and smooth swing, as opposed to the drop-your-jaw hairpin curve. Even with them, the movie goes fast. When the foundation is laid out of the first action, it is constantly going through. Fortunately, there is no break in the action for a romance, something the movie wisely avoided. There are not even breaks for 'real life'. History has its purpose and runs the course without disturbance. The lack of character depth prevents "The Italian Job" being more than a good popcorn movie, but with all the complex details of the hoist planning, such surfaces would have dragged the pace and quality of the flat down. <br /> <br /> There are a number of inconsistencies that I thought about both during and after viewing. But the movie is so fun that I don't and don't care. In the real world, most of the movie probably couldn't have gone away so clean. But "the Italian job" does not take place in the real world. It arises in a stylish and light hearted criminal world that appeals to the rebels in all of us. <br /> <br /> "The Italian job" is a movie, in the word true meaning. It has no notions of Oscar and contains no deep moral message. It gives pure escapism entertainment and does it quite well. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Perhaps the best popcorn movie this year so far. 7 out of 10.
