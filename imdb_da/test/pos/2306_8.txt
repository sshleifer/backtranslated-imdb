Eros and Thanatos, Love and Death order the dialectic of life. At the end of the 19th century in a distant Japanese village, a young man and a married woman, older than him, fall in love with each other and decide to kill his husband to be free to enjoy their love. But they never enjoy the freedom when Remorse begins to haunt those who begin as usual at the time of the weakest member of the couple, of course, the woman. In the future, in an atmosphere where the dream (nightmare) is mixed with reality, the murdered man's ghost appears first to the woman, but also to the man. It also claims the dreams of the other villagers creating a climate of suspicion and gossip about the couple, aggravated by a police officer who is investigating the disappearance of the murdered man. However, making this film more interesting beyond this almost common story of adultery is the evolution of the couple's feelings in a Shakespeare-deep psychological and dramatic evolution of remorse, anxiety and fear that turns their love relationship into a nightmare until their last judgment. The expression so dear to Japanese theater or movie plays is also present in the players' notions, but not in exaggerated form. Just in the necessary measure to show the most profound feelings of the depicted characters more effectively. This really is a good good movie.
