Nazarin is a kind of saint, he wants to live in life exactly how Christ taught man to do. But it is too late: now the Catholic Church is between the hands of a wealthy bourgeoisie, the bishops live in luxury and do not give a horrible to the poor and the sick. Therefore, our hero is not able to follow the way his hierarchy asks him to follow. So he disposes of everything and on the way to purity he is associated with some kind of Mary Magdelene and a woman who is attracted to him sexually (the scene between this girl and her fiance tells). In Spain (that was the late fifties ), they thought Nazarin was a Christian movie! Knowing Luis Bunuel, it was actually inconsistent: all his work is anticlerical to a fault. Comparison of Nazarin and his "holy women" to Jesus is a nonsense. At Nazarin's road, only brambles and couch grow. His attempt to help workers on the road is a failure, he is hunted as a strike breaker. All his words correspond to nothing. At the end of the journey he is arrested and offered a pi neapple of a woman (Bunuelian sexual symbol). Thanks to "Nazarin", Bunuel was allowed to return to Spain (where the censors did not have a clue) and to lead "Viridiana".
