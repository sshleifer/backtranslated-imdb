Although I watched this movie dubbed in French, I'm sure it lost something in the translation, lack of accents, etc. It was an excellent, fun movie for a lonely evening in a hotel room - a real pick-up there pronounced precisely and positively the complexity of individual sexuality, gender roles and finding a place within the communities that one should belong to - man, gay, urban, 30-ish, etc. I was very proud of French television to show such an honest and positive depiction of homosexuals. While the fact that the gay lead character ends up a bit "straight" at the end, is mildly disappointing, it's life, and sometimes happens. This is a great movie, either alone or with a date! A really enjoyable experience.
