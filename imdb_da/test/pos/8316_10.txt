SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> I got this dino documentary on DVD in July 2004. I had longed to see it and was not disappointed at all. The score is memorable (my <br /> <br /> favorites were the theme "Sauropod" and "Winters Coming" song). The effects were dazzling, you could almost believe they were there. You actually learn something too; Stegosaurs may have been able to pump their plates with blood. Female T-Rexes may have been on a killing spree before laying their eggs. I know there are many people who thought this was too much speculation, but there will always be issues that we can only guess. And there is also very hard-core, undeniable FACT. We know that some dinosaurs traveled in herds, we know that Diplodocus swallowed stones to grind the vegetation in their stomachs. Despite this "speculation", the series did very well. In fact, so good that it created a follow-up, a prequel and more offers. If you are a dino fan then this is for you. It makes Jurassic Park look small and weedy.
