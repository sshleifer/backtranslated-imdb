This film was made soon enough after Karen's passing, that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the nearest Karen felt a bit guilty of how they might have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be precise), it must have been easier to deny any complication. Richard has spent the years following Karen's death infinitely remixing and rebuilding the footage he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I read, he seems to be planning a next generation of carpenters with his children. He seems to have regretted making this movie, and it may well be why it is not available in any form. It seemed to me to be a fairly honest assessment of the tragically short life and the incredible talent that was Karen Carpenter.
