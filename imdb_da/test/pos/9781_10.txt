My family and I enjoy this show and find it a fair sketch of what the people went through. My own father spent some time in Changi before entering the Thailand-Burma Railway in "F" Power. Much as has been said about the treatment that the POW received, I would just say that my father was 6 feet 1 inch and 196 lbs when Singapore fell. At the end of the war he was 5 feet 11 inches tall and 91 pounds. <Br /> <br /> No show could really convey what the POWs went through, but it comes closer than most. As Ex POWs say, "If you didn't have helpers, you didn't survive." This show succeeds in getting this message across.
