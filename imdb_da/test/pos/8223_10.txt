Flight and Clown Bagatelles as done by Bill Irwin are some of the funniest (both in terms of physical comedy and verbal and visual gags) performances I've ever seen. My dad taped this special as it was first sent in the 80s and my family has loved it ever since. We quote it back and forth quite constantly. It is a screaming shame that copies are not available for purchase. I have a poor VHS copy, which I acquired from a special distributor some years ago, but Mr. Irwin's performance deserves a proper DVD treatment with a restored version of the original performance and interviews with artists / producers as well as several examples of modern clowning. Bill Irwin's talent deserves more exposure to the mainstream audience than it has had in his limited broad releases. I often share with friends, and although I am always greeted with a little bit of skepticism when I mention that it is a mix of clowning and vaudeville, I have yet to get anyone to get away from seeing it without loving it. If the powers ever happening on this IMDb listing, please consider releasing this and other Bill Irwin work.
