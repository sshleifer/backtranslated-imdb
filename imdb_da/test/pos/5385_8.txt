I watched this movie from 1918 recently on our local Helsinkian film archive. It seems that the Danish Film Institute has reconstructed it in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Nordic Film Company, which was one of the largest in the world in the early 20th century. I think there are several copies of English translations that are circulating around Europe at the moment. <br /> <br /> I found the movie fascinating and the trip to Mars well thought out. The plot line is definitely original, but I really don't want to reveal more of it at the moment, which now exists the danger of destroying things for you ;-). <br /> <br /> The film is also available on DVD, ask the Danish Film Institute's web pages on dfi.dk with 'The Heavenly Ship' to get more info.
