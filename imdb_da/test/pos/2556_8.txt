A friend brought me this movie, and in the beginning I hesitated, the pace of the movie was so slow that it was definitely boring at first. But the life scene was attractive, it's like observing than seeing. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be simply amazing throughout the film how the instructor handled the scenes to reflect the reality was confusing, but somehow overwhelming. It's like understanding real life for a lively person than watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Alejandro Polanco and Miss Isamar Gonzales did their roles so well that it is more like telling us their own stories. In fact, they used their real names in the movie.
