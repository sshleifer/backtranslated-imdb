Tim Burton is essentially an expressionist filmmaker, uninterested in character dimensions and obsessed with gothic reach and choosing style over the fabric incessantly throughout his career. But with its style so intriguingly intriguing, like many movie guests, I forgive all the countless errors that can be found in many of his films and become confused in what is essentially a hundred million dollar art film. <br /> <It is almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic, emotionally involved spirit within the second part of a mediocre franchise, especially when the franchise target audience is half a 15-year-old boy. Batman Returns should have been as commercial as its predecessor, secure check signs and cheap (in fact, very expensive) tensions, entertaining without ever really involving his audience. Had this been the result, Tim Burton would certainly have been required to manage a third tranche. Instead, Burton delivers something that can only be defined by the term 'out there'. From the melancholy opening where a high society party throws a prison-like basin with their newborn deformed baby into a river, it is clear that Batman Returns is not a picnic at Buckingham Palace. The cut thirty three years later, during a political speech made by the bad guy business tycoon Max Shreck (outrageously depicted by Christopher Walken), the Red Triangle attacks Circus Gang Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton returns to the role) makes his first appearance sporting a new logo so you can save the day. Shreck is soon kidnapped by the circus band and the black post to approve the political return of the baby, now a fully grown penguin man (Danny DeVito in disgusting perfect makeup), whose motive for return is only suspicious of Batman. Meanwhile, Shreck is trying to extinguish his nosy and awkward assistant Selina Kyle (played perfectly by Michelle Pfeiffer, who honestly deserved more recognition for her performance), turning into the deliciously sexy and psychotic Catwoman, for revenge and harbor, for a or some other inexplicable reason, a deadly vendetta against Dark Knight. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns is gloomy. The production design is breathtaking and delivers a cold, scary Gotham City with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor. Danny Elfman's score supports the film brilliantly, from refreshing to tragic. The tone and direction of the entire film itself is intense, shot like a sad nightmare, Burton's direction overshadows what is in fairness an in-depth manuscript with an almost completely irrelevant plot, yet perfect for Burton's visual style of filmmaking. And while Burton's action sequences are fighting for exhilaration, the right excitement lies in the directional choices that show the remnants of each of the protagonists, the penguins' death, Catwoman's mental state, and Bruce Wayne's lonely destiny. <br /> <br /> Warner brothers hated it while critically and audience reaction was mixed. After all, they would have a Batman sequel, not a weird, somewhat horrible horror movie, where a deformed psychopathic orphan tries to kidnap and drown a lot of babies who are constantly vomiting what can only be described as green mucus. The production company wanted an audience move, something for McDonald's clan to promote their happy meals, not a movie of gloomy irreversible signs, including a sexually suppressed secretary pushed from a skyscraper and revived by a gang of cats that awaken her from unconsciousness by to chew on her blooded icy fingers. <br /> <br /> It is easy to understand the mass killings that came with the release of Batman Returns. The movie never felt like a Batman blockbuster. It is doubtful whether Burton really knew who Batman actually was, or even if he was concerned about the character as much as he cared about the movie, which fits in with his usual themes with beautifully joking artistic direction and misinterpreted lonely characters which are rarely in line with society's standards and expectations. Therefore, Burton failed to create a fantastic Batman movie. He did, however; create a nostalgic and anesthetic cold piece of cinema that remains a personal and nostalgic favorite of mine. <br /> <br /> This may not be a good Batman movie. But it's a great Tim Burton movie.
