I really enjoyed this movie, it certainly keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well-tended. I think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobby and show them as people with emotions. When this movie was to show Bobby as a cold and windy person. <br /> <br /> I agree with another review, it was sick love, not true love. He didn't have to go far as a murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her he was sterile and decided to adopt a baby together. Some reviews say she was naive, I think she was when it came to the adoption, but the best actors all the way through. Great movie to watch !!
