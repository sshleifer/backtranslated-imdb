This movie is the most moving and fun movie I've seen for a very long time. As a homemaker and a fan (Rupert) I found it to be sympathetic. Anyone who celebrates Dirk's outburst of anger has it wrong. Kathy Bates is not really an actress I know, but she is perfect, the whole role is perfect for their roles. Julie Andrews had me in stitches. I see it after reading Rupert's auto-bio, so the inclusion of her was even more fun. It is sometimes awful to move. I'm not really a fan of the type of music in the movie, but you are drawn into the romance and find you sing the songs in days. This movie deserves to be more accessible. Our favorite scene involves Dirk and a gun and pants, watch it and watch!
