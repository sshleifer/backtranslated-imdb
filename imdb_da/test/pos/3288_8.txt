Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a sympathetic performance by Wesley Eure of TV's "Land of the Lost") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for the Canine Home Protection System) to his boss, Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain) whose home business is floundering. A rival company hires a couple of monstrous criminals to get their scary hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. The task turns out to be easier said than finished. Director Don Chaffey tells the endearingly dopey story at a constant pace, maintains an amiably stupid and start-up tone all the way through and phases the greasy slapstick gags with great flair. In addition, the game threw it up with contagious aplomb: the sweet Valerie Bertinelli as Brian's cute fianc√©e Casey Norton, Chuck McCann as clutzy crook Brooks, Red buttons like McCann's straight bumbling partner Bracken, Jim Backus as evil CEO. Gibbs, Hermoine Baddeley As a lovely old biddy Mrs. Foster, and 60-year-old AIP exploitation, the regular Larry Bishop is an elaborate, double-dressed dress, Ken Sharp. Best of all, the titular pooch is a fun joy: C.H.O.M.P.S. Jump through fences, walls and windows with amazing agility, perform actions of extraordinary strength, run faster than a deer, and even move a few smart martial arts. A subplot of a sobbing neighborhood dog named Monster delivers a couple of extra stomach spines (Monster is spoken by some uncredited guy with an appropriate deep, rough voice). The order of the groovy animated opening circle, Charles F. Wheeler's shiny filmography and Hoyt Curtin's funky, vibrant disco score are also solid. A cute little kiddie flick.
