This movie is a tour de force by Julie Taymor, who heads and makes stage designs and masks. No one comes close to matching his imagination in the modern operator stage. Since making this film in 1992, she has been very successful in filmmaking and musical musicals. One can only hope that she can be convinced to return to opera one day. I would love to see a ring cycle directed by her. The current Rheingold in Covent Garden has giants with big hands like the characters in this movie. The current butterfly at ENO uses Japanese doll. Coincidentally, or evidence that Taymore's influence is pervasive. Taymar uses amazing costumes, masks, dolls and origami birds to recreate the history of Oedipus at a stage set on stilts over a lake. Red ribbons are a recurring theme. They are used as an umbilical cord when Oedipus is born, they hang from Oedipus eyes after he has blinded himself. In a breathtaking effect, they are used to making a cross when Oedipu's slaughter of his father is resumed by dolls. <br /> <br /> This neo-classical opera ball from Stravinsky enjoys fair haze until this movie brought it to life. The music is uninspired, but unofficial, and Philip Langridge, Jesse Norman and a very young Bryn Terfel make the most of it. The singers are quite immobile, in accordance with Stravinsky's wishes. My Tanaka is the dancing Oedipus to Langridge's song Oedipus. This creates some confusion towards the end when you dance, Oedipus pokes out of the eyes singing Oedipus. <br /> <br /> The libretto is in Latin, but calm if your high school Latin is a little rusty. There is a useful narrator who introduces and describes each scene in Japanese.
