I loved this movie, it was a great depiction of a family that had its share of up and down, but ultimately they knew that the special love they had for each other. I've seen many movies with Jaclyn Smith, but my god it was one of her best, even though it came out 12 years ago. This movie featured an all-star cast, and what I loved most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors I haven't seen before. This movie was a bit long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it. It is a movie you can sit down with your family and see, even though we had to cover the eyes of the children a couple of times because of the discretionary love scenes. In general, I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale. Life doesn't close it enough, so if anyone knows what the store sells, let me know because it's a must-have.
