I really liked the movie "JOE." It has really become a cult classic among certain age groups. <br /> <br /> The producer of this movie is a personal friend of mine. He is my Stepson's father-in-law. He lives on Manhattan's west side and has a bungalow. in Southampton, Long Island. His son-in-law lives next door to his bungalow. <br /> <br /> Currently, he does not make any producer, but dabbles in an HBO movie company. As a person Mr. Gil is a true gentleman, and I wish he would have continued in the production of moving materials.
