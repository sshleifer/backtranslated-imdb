I absolutely loved this movie. <br /> <br /> It is not a "typical Asian fate" where you would see a cruel-looking ghost (usually a woman) walking around scary people. You hardly see ghosts for a majority of the movie, but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and the characters is genius. This is not the movie for you if you are in gore (eg Saw, Hostel) or "surprise scares" where things show up on you (Hollywood horror, slasher movies), but this movie has an underlying "creepy" factor throughout the whole movie I loved. Noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror among the ridiculous remakes and unoriginal crap released by Hollywood in today's society. <br /> <br /> Don't let the documentary movie quench you (why do you ?!). It's far better than the Blair Witch Project, firstly, the Noroi actor is brilliant, and it really makes you feel like you're not seeing. <br /> <br /> Noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Few movies have made it my top 5 horror; and this movie has a solid # 1 place on my list.
