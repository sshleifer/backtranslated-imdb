"Mr. Bean", starring in the legendary Rowan Atkinson, was a big hit during his 1990s, and I probably first saw it when I was about ten shortly after it ended, so I saw reruns. I was certainly not much of a fan at that time and not too many episodes. I didn't really get into the show for my late teens just a few years ago, which was when I finally watched each episode. Contrary to this, it made me laugh many times, and since then it has always been the case during repeated shows of episodes! <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is a mysterious, self-centered, antisocial, extremely naive buffoon whose best friend is his Teddy! He is pretty isolated from society, and life is not easy for him as he constantly struggles with very simple things! This is because he lacks some basic knowledge and has a child's mind. He finds himself in various kinds of hassle, wherever he goes, and comes up with very bizarre ways to try to solve the problems he is facing! Not only does he often create problems for himself, but sometimes also for other people, whom he often does not usually realize! In other words, Mr. Bean is a wandering disaster! <br /> <br /> The humor of this show is very visual and there is very little dialogue. Gags are almost always sight gags, which is mainly what the performance is about. Though there may be an occasional ease of gag, I would say the vast majority of them are funny, often funny (there are so many highlights)! While "Mr. Bean" is certainly not the most sophisticated comedy ever made, it is still great for many of those who like visual humor, and because of the very limited dialogue you don't even have to speak English for. to enjoy the show why it has got such a worldwide reputation! The show ran for a couple of years, but the episodes were made very gradually, so only 14 were made in total. Nevertheless, it is a classic series and deserves its wide appeal!
