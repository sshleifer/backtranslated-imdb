This would be by far the largest series I have ever seen. I watched live every Sunday night and bought the set as soon as it was available. This is a timeless game written by a fantastic Australian that people of all ages could relate to, whether Australian or not, but for those of us who are Australian, it really brings the typical Australian icon. One must see 10/10
