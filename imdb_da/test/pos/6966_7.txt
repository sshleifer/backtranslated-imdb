Since this movie was on IMDB Bottom 20, I simply had to rent it. <br /> <br /> SUPRISE! SUPRISE! I have no regrets about seeing this movie at all. In fact, I really enjoyed it. There is a level of camp in this movie that puts cult classics from the 80s to shame. Is it stupid? Yes, but Jim Wynorski proves that stupid is not necessarily bad. Rent it for a laugh that seems unintentional, but it's actually supposed to be fun. Wynorski is a genius. Hope he is leading the next ninja turtle movie
