Nynke is a classic film in the same style as Oscar-winning film Character (1997). But this comparison instantly encourages me to add that the latter was quite exciting ... Of course, Nynke is a beautiful historical and costume drama (with amazing plays by Monic Hendrickx!), Where you witness the personal growth of 'Nynke van Hichtum 'in her marriage to Pieter Jelles Troelstra. The subtitle of this movie is 'a love'. So it starts and ends with their marriage. <br /> <br /> But this is where the director makes a critical mistake! Nynke's exciting, independent life started when the marriage ended. She wrote several children's books and traveled around the world. What good life she has lived. But Pieter Verhoeff put Nynke back in the convention's tramp, which depressed her and that she struggled out: the idea that her life only extended her marriage to Troelstra, being no other than the mother of their children. <br /> <br /> Let's all hope for Nynke II!
