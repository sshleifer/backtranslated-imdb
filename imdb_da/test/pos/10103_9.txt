Two sisters, Su-mi (IM Soo-jung) and Su-yeon (MOON Geun-young) return home with their father (Kim Gap-soo). Eun-joo (YEOM Jeong-ah) welcomes them, but Su-mi's way is bitter for her. Su-mi hates Eun-joo because the father allowed her to act as a housewife after the sister's mother died. When she sees her attitude, Eun-joo gets by treating the sisters coldly, and a tense atmosphere grows among them. As if summoned by the atmosphere, a number of mysterious things arise in the house. When Su-mi hangs her dress in her wardrobe, many dresses of the same design have already been hung. When she put her diary in a drawer, she finds another diary of the same kind there. As she sleeps in her bed with scared Su-yeon, a nightmare awakens her and she finds a woman standing on her - and a hand dangles out of the woman's skirt! <br /> <br /> Mystical things also occur in other people. In the evening next weekend, Eun-joos visits his brother and his wife family and they have a dinner together. Eun-joo happily tells about a crazy man she met when she was a child, but no one is interested in her talk. She says the crazy man annoyed the brother, but he says he doesn't know anything about the man. <br /> <br /> Listening to their talk, brother's wife panic. <br /> <br /> After dinner, the conflict between Eun-joo and the sisters becomes worst. Eun-joo pulls Su-Yeon into a wardrobe and locks her in it. Su-mi saves the crying sister and complains to their father what Eun-joo has done to his daughter. But his answer is unexpected. "Give me a break." says he angrily: "Su-mi, thank you. Don't let me tired anymore." <br /> <br /> And the following words out of the father's mouth are more shocking than what they have seen in the house. <br /> <br /> To tell the truth, I hate horror movies. Although I sat at a theater because my intuition told me that the movie was something different, I regret what my curiosity had caused me to act when it began to show. However, the regret was changed to the delight of expectation ten minutes later. <br /> <br /> This movie is a tragic mystery more than a horror - painfully more than terrible; beautiful more than sensational. It can get a hard-hearted fan disappointed, but for a mysterious fan like me, this movie is a must see. (9 out of 10)
