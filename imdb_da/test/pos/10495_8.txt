This was the movie that first showed me what a great actor Martin Sheen really is. He modestly claims that Charlie is a better actor, Charlie can't hold a light to him. <br /> <br /> I found it exciting and thoroughly enjoyed the intertwined of the love story with the main plot (and I usually hate love stories). There is a great plot twist at the end that hit me as fully credible, especially at the beginning of the 80's, and probably now too. <br /> <br /> The final scene had me on the edge of my seat. This film illustrates that betrayal is often wiped out by those we trust, while the declared enemies have more in common than they suspect, and finally human compassion can be found where we least expect it. <br/> <br /> ireneration
