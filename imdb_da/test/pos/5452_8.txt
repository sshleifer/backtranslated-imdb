TV movies generally do not receive as much recognition or credit as big movies - and that's normal for good reason, but 1996 HBO movies The Late Shift is easily one of the best TV movies ever. Based on Bill Carter's revealing book, The Late Shift deals with NBC's late-night speech show host David Letterman and Jay Leno as it came to fill the vacant Tonight Show seat once held by Johnny Carson. We see what happens in front of the camera - author Bill Carter, director Betty Thomas and HBO show us what happened when the cameras were turned off. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we can never know what really happened when Johnny Carson was replaced by either Letterman or Leno - but The Late Shift gives us an interesting potential reality. While it's simply a very well-filmed movie, The Late Shift also does a really good job of portraying all the pages fairly evenly - even if you wonder if the movie makes Letterman and Leno seem too fine of guys; especially Leno, who works a little for the weekend. <br /> <br /> The performances are also very good. In a much-deserved Golden Globe-winning performance, Kathy Bates plays Leno's extremely intrusive manager, Helen Kushnick, who, according to Carter and the book / movie, was very problematic for the studio and Leno (the real Kushnick suited Bill Carter in fact, to the detriment of this depiction!). John Michael Higgins breaks out of his usual footage of getting small quirky comedy parts and giving an excellent performance like David Letterman - giving an excellent impression of Letterman, but also creating a dimensional and related character. Daniel Roebuck gives a good performance as Leno, but does not quite correspond to any of the other talent in the film. Roebuck probably did the best anyone could have done. It just looks like hammy when someone tries to make an impression or portray Leno. Bob Balaban (a squirrel Warren Littlefield), Treat Williams (a magician-like Michael Ovitz), and Ed Begley Jr. (a pompous Rod Perth) also provides memorable supporting performances. <br/> <br /> The Late Shift is definitely one of the best movie TVs I've ever seen. I suppose if you haven't seen David Letterman or Jay Leno, Late Shift can't be for them, but it's an interesting movie for those who come into the sennat policy - something that has recently raised its ugly head yet again with 2009 -10 Conan / Leno / NBC debacle.
