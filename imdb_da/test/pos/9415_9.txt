A hilarious thing I want to say from the top, I'm not the biggest Seisun Suzuki fan. In fact, I've seen a real number of his works (thanks to a retrospective film festival) and I found his movie just a bit for the Yakuza drive to my liking. So I went into the princess raccoon on duty for what I should see. Boy! Was I knocked out! 'Raccoon' is Suzuki's attempt at a musical use of elements of Japanese opera mixed in with many modern elements (both Audial and Visual), Raccoon is a treat from start to finish. Leading actor Joe Ogdari proves that today he is one of the hottest actors in Japan in this role. I have to admire the younger Japanese actors still taking roles taking place in Feudal times Japan, and dressing up in Samurai gear to full effect. The story itself becomes a little confusing if you do not follow it very carefully, but even if you do not, prepare yourself for the treasures that Princess Raccoon has.
