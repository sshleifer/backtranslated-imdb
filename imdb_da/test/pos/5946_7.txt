Quite entertaining spoof with great attention to detail: The appearance of the 1960s spy film and the way the action was staged in that time. The fighting room in the hotel room was a hoot and the casting was perfect with a Peter Lorre lookalike added to the mix of villains. A big plus: Jean Dujardin is warm and the stage where he is tied without a shirt was a highlight. Plus, his eyebrows deserve some kind of recognition to do a good job. <br /> <br /> Funny aside: The people behind me in the theater continued to grab every plot twist, as if they saw a "real" spy thriller. Before the movie started a trailer for "Get Smart" was screened. Preview made the movie look embarrassingly bad with lame attempts to incorporate jokes and gags from the TV series. Looks like a bomb and quite a contrast to the relatively sublime jokes and gags of OSS 117, although of course the US had its share of misfires. However, the overall tone of the CIS was not an insult to the public's intelligence, and the material did not feel like it had become "stupid". I got the clear impression that if I understood the language, I would have caught more of the jokes, and one in particular (gun gag) was mishandled in the interpretation of the subtitles.
