This absolute thrilling X-Files episode in the first season. This episode is what I think of when I hear "X-Files". The reason is simple but exciting. Our main cast plus a few scientists are going to investigate an Alskan outpost, where it's the research team that seems to have killed each other. It turns out a small parasite that was dug up from the ice had infected the research group. The parasite attaches itself to the brain and causes paranoia and insanity. Soon no one can tell who they can trust or who is infected or not. <br /> <br /> This episode was a direct tribute to John Carpenter's great horror movie "THING". Thing is set in Antarctica and a team of scientists finds a ruined outpost where the resident has been killed or killed himself. An alien who had been buried in the ice for 10,000 years had been thawed. It has the ability to imitate any form of life. therefore, the protagonists can no longer separate friends from enemies. <br /> <br /> Believe me THING is one of the most exciting and thrilling horror movies you will ever see. If you liked the ICE episode, I advise you to see it. Or if you have only seen it, I advise you to see ICE. <br /> <br /> ICE is the best direct tribute / tribute to John Carpenter's The THING I've ever seen, and it lives up to it's inspiration as one of the best X-Files episodes. I give it a 10/10.
