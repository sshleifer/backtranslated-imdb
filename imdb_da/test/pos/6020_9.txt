This is one of the best television productions of a musical ever. I've heard the Merman cast album, Angela Lansbury album, I've seen Tyne Daly live, and I've seen the Rosalind Russell movie countless times. I think Bette is, if not the best, so tied with the best. She not only catches the bravura, but also the Mama Rose's pathologist. I was never a fan of Natalie Wood, so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb in what is probably her best role. Everything from costumes to sets to the supporting performances is wonderful. The three strippers, led by the always reliable Christine Ebersole, are hard to come by. There should be a TV production by Mame a few years back with Cher, but I think Bette would be the best bet (pun intended) for Aunt Mame.
