"Live Together, Die Alone" is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a fantastic episode. So when you put them all together, you have a big ^ 3 episode. It was a bold step to give flashbacks of a seasonal finale to a character (Desmond) who had first appeared in 3 episodes, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to see, both informative about the history of the island & the Swan station itself and honestly moving. Desmond and Penny seem magically connected to each other, even when they are on opposite ends of the world, and both characters are beautifully acted (it's hard not to cry when Desmond reads Penny's letter). The action inside the hatch is the edge of your seat tense, as Locke is determined not to allow the button to be pushed again, convinced that it was all a psychological experiment, Desmond gradually realizes the consequences of this decision and echo is locked outside and desperately trying to get in again. The melting of the clock and Locke's "I was wrong" are unforgettable moments. Outside of the actions, Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley have captured the others because of Michael's betrayal (after making an astonishing discovery of Pearl) and the changing returns of Henry Gale as the leader of Others. Even the least important plot line Sayid, Jin and Sun sails to the beach, where the others are believed to include camping, one of the greatest mythological mysteries in the show, the huge statue that is almost completely missing, except a four-footed foot . In short: emotions + history + mythology + adventure + excitement + the threat of extinction + a ray of hope = a classically lost episode. *** 1/2 out of 4.
