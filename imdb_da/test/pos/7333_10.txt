This is one of the very few movies with great plays, wonderful history and worth seeing. It is about changes in life. It's about how happiness can be found when you are true to yourself. It's about accepting oneself and others. It is about life's challenges. It is about expressing reality. It's about courage. It's about love. Both actresses are very faithful to their role. The actors had very good chemistry between each other in the film. This is the key to the movie that made the movie. It is rare to see an independent film like this one. One could tell the hard work the movie staff might have while producing this movie. I want to see more movies from this producer / writer. Watch the movie, you'll love it.
