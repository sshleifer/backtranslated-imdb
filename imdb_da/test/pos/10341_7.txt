This movie still lives and kicks today thanks to Alan Ladd's presence. This is good in a way, because the film has some interesting things to say, but bad in another, because everyone who sees it expects the hard guy Ladd to bend through his usual steps, being very disappointed. Without fanfare or introduction, Ladd is suddenly introduced into the third wheel. True, his role is important, but it is small and is likely to be lost in the shuffle. There are many key roles in former leafmaker Martin Mooney's ambivalent manuscript, which hits all political alliances and rejects ruthlessly Reform candidates. It is the delightful and highly talented Joan Woodbury who connects the various threads of the vast history together. In contrast to the usual Hollywood production, the plot actually goes into a series of jumps, just as the films later appeared by the French "New Wave", but it is easier to follow here, especially if you realize that the movie's original title was Paper Bullets. Nevertheless, some of the film's narrative and character switches are a bit confusing, especially in the role of Jack LaRue, who wisely chose to act in a weird, non-demanding way. One of Jack's best plays ever, but no one will probably notice it!
