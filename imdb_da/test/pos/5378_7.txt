I had no idea what to see when I decided to watch this movie and, to my surprise, it's just a very good horror movie that is easily one of the best in the 1970s. Film is of course low budget, and this is an excellent example of how the film's history and style create chills, not special effects! Power Martin is one of the great character actors from time to time, and he has a rare role here, and the film also stars Martin's good friend L.Q. Jones and "Green Acres" Alvy Moore. Jones and Moore also helped produce this movie. TV veteran Charles Bateman is the star and "Enter the Dragon" beauty Ahna Capri is his girlfriend. Capri is in a bikini at the start of the movie and she is just beautiful to look at! Movies do a great job of joining the story and not adding a fake feeling good end and I really liked the way the movie ends. Great atmosphere, interesting history and well run by Bernard McEveety. Martin's performance is also top notch as he does not hold back and really throws himself into Doc's role. Good and undervalued movie!
