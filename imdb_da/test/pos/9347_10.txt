The first music video I've ever seen, Thriller, my mom told me she took me home from the hospital and when we arrived, my sister MTV on the TV and Thriller had played, my mom said I was smiling. Silly I know, but I have loved Michael Jackson since the day the music video Thriller inspired me to dance, I still have the dance hidden to this day. I've even done it to an audience 3 times! Words cannot describe the power of this song that makes you sing and dance, but of course, Michael had to raise the bar for MTV at that time by signing American Werewolf in London's director John Landis and leading the only Thriller. <br /> <br /> Michael and his date, Ola Ray, run out of gas in a dark forest area. They go out into the woods, and Michael asks her if she wants to go steady. She accepts and he gives her a ring. He warns her, however, that he is not like other guys, no really, not like the other guys. A full moon appears, and Michael begins cramping in pain ?? transform into a scary werewolf! His date screams and runs away, but the werewolves pick up, knock her down and start lunging at her with her claws. The scene cuts off to a movie theater where Michael and his date actually see this scene unfold in a movie called Thriller. Michael smiles, but his date is scared and tells him she is leaving. Michael catches up with her and says it's only a movie, but she doesn't like her jokes and she starts to walk away. Michael and his date then go down a foggy street, and he teases her with the open versions of Thriller. They pass a cemetery where the bodies suddenly begin to descend from their graves when Vincent Price performs his rap. Michael and his date are so surrounded by the zombies, and suddenly Michael becomes a zombie himself. Michael and undead perform a detailed song and dance song together, followed by Thriller's Chorus. <br /> <br /> Thriller is probably the best music video of all time, fun are people who want to argue that it is with other Michael Jackson videos, but what makes Thriller so special is the dance, the story, the effects , then, was the most expensive music video of his day. Michael of course praised the bar again with his famous music video Scream and then again with Ghosts. But what you want, Michael was the star of the 1980s, there was no celebrity like him, he loved life, he lived it, breathed it and embraced it. Thriller is proof that he was willing to work to do the best, and that's what we got with the legend, Thriller. <br /> <br /> 10/10
