A true masterpiece of Soviet cinematography. It is a shame for the Soviet Union that Samojlova never had the opportunity to play in Western films - but then again she would probably never find herself there. In "Letyat Zhuravli" she is unforgettable. This was one of the few films where I cried ... In addition to Samojlova, Batalov and Mercury, who are top rated, it was a brilliant job by the director and operator who made this movie a full-time classics worldwide. Just remember the scenes of piano music and suggestions during the German German bombardment, or Boris dead with a whirling sky over his head and his last visions appeared in these skies. The very simple means - but the great technique added the emotional weight ... Mind you 20 years before "The Star Wars", 41 years before "Titanic" and with a Soviet budget.
