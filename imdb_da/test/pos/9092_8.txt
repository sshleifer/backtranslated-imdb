I'm going to write a review of this movie for some time, but only now have I actually managed to get my thoughts down to realize others. <br /> <br /> I have never had the pleasure of watching this movie on the big screen, which is a shame as it is often visually stunning, but I have been reviewing it on video many times over the years and enjoying it immensely walk. It's definitely on my personal list of favorite movies and for more than just looking at Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon, two of my `actors to watch. '<br /> <br /> Perhaps I appreciate this movie so much, because it appeals to my little off-wedge taste in entertainment. I like my movies a little back from the middle - unpredictable and fresh. And whether you "believe" the movie's story line, you have to admit it's different! Everyone has different tastes and opinions, but my impression of some of the negative reviews of this movie is that the viewers never really saw the surface of this movie. They were caught in technical issues: "Why would there be green lighting in a metro?" or `Why should medical students pull such a stupid stunt? 'Yes, there are some medical and technical aspects that do not make sense, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief, just a little, then this can be a very exciting movie. <br /> <br /> First, a note about the film's artistic quality. Some have complained about the creepy lighting and the illogical character of the sets - but for me, the use of innovative lighting techniques, plastic and sheet kits, the unusual settings in old buildings and groats, drip tunnels, use of statuary, rain and curved curtains - Everyone adds a poetic taste to this movie, a scary beauty that fits the dark nature of the questions asked about life, death and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> I will focus on just two examples; In a hill scene, a change in lighting allows some elements of the set to come into focus dramatically, so that fading away when the lighting returns to normal. It is an innovative means of communicating a shift in the 'reality' of the moment and works beautifully. We are also allowed to see the decor of the character's apartments - contrasting with the warm wood, bright colors, golden lighting and cluttered comfort in Labraccio's rooms with Nelson's sharp white voids. Both are reflective of the characters themselves. Nelson's lack of "objects" reflects our lack of knowledge about his past. and his carefully constructed mask that keeps its companions at bay. His past, we will learn, is a chaos and a conflict. He has decided to leave it behind for a pure emptiness. Unfortunately, the emptiness also reflects his relationships with others, a realization he brings along his personal journey of self-discovery in this movie. Flatliners are not your typical horror movie. It is also not a typical drama or thrill movie. Rather, it is a merger of all who have the best elements of all genres intertwined in a complex, intriguing plot. <br /> <br /> This is an ensemble piece and the cast does an excellent job of breathing in their individual characters. Their immediate impression is that the characters are each representative of a well-established stereotype: the female ice queen, the slightly neurotic 'doctor', the playboy and the socially conscious `cozy guy ', etc. But as the film progresses and the characters are further fleshed out, they take on more dimensions and depth. <br /> <br /> Most of all, Sutherland's character is Nelson. Nelson is not a character that is easy to suffer - in fact, he is a bit of a bartard, a master manipulator that certainly places self-interest over everything else. Yet Sutherland plays with a touch of uncertainty that gives him a certain appeal. As the events unfold, you realize that much of Nelson's unpleasant personality is a smoke screen, a protective mask behind which hides a very insecure and vulnerable young man burdened by a horrible secret. <br /> <br /> By revealing pieces of Nelson's complex personality throughout the film, the authors, directors, and casters gradually lead you to a greater understanding and sympathy for him. The character that started as a "jerk" becomes important and appreciated in itself - as you learn to "forgive" its past behavior in the face of new information. Your journey of discovery with Nelson reflects the characters' own travels towards self-understanding, which they will also realize that everyone has value and "everything we do." <br /> <br /> Which leads to my final comment. Although many of the posters here have picked up on the theme of tolerating death, some seem to have touched on what I see as the main premise of the movie - the importance of forgiveness and the need to pay attention to everything you do because it means something. <br /> <br />
