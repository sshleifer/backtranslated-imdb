Fun, entertaining movie about WWII German Spy (Julie Andrews!) In love with American Pilot (Rock Hudson) while trying to get secrets from him. For some reason, this was attacked by critics and cut off by the public in 1970 - I can't see why. It is beautifully shot, has wonderful costumes and interiors, and exciting airtight dogfights. Also, Andrews has made a striptease (strictly PG material) and sings a beautiful song - "Whistling in the Dark". The movie has problems. Andrews and Hudson didn't come together during this recording - and it shows. Their love scenes lack spark and they have no sexual chemistry. Yet they turn into OK performances. The film is a bit long (even in the 105 mins of my director's cut I saw) and gets too dark and serious at the end. Still worth catching. Try to see the directors cut ... the other runs half an hour longer!
