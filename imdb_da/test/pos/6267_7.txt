A very sweet movie about a young Chinese man who is the feel of Western technology and an Englishman trying to make his luck showing films in China. It is a very interesting story that is probably based on true events, although I suppose it is more imaginative than real. It has a fairy tale quality that you rarely come into reality, and it also has 8 people credited to the script, so they must have done things right and left. <br /> <br /> This is a very sympathetic movie that conveys how magic movies were to people who had never seen it before. It is not a particularly deep film that touches briefly on the losses and interventions of traditions in Western culture, but mainly just a pleasant little movie. It's actually a movie I enjoyed a lot, it is already starting to disappear from my heart 15 minutes after seeing it. Light as a souffle, but I enjoyed every minute.
