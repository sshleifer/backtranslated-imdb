The external borders are a brilliant show that mostly leaves me very strong emotions. There are undoubtedly some stink episodes, but it is essentially an old pulp cartoon converted into a TV show so it can be expected. For the most part, it is very well done, well-produced and directed and often with some big-name talent that seems to enjoy working in a solid translation of short fiction to hour-long TV format. The external borders tend to focus on rather large ethical / philosophical / moral issues and rarely end up without the overthrow of the voice that seriously thinks. <br /> <br /> From time to time, the themes are a bit too heavy for all but the most thick viewers. Although a certain degree of distrust of the government is conducive to effective democracy, you can unfortunately catch more episodes back to the back of the absurdity of mistrust of the Army / CIA. A further note is that any large group of power (the Roman Catholic Church, Gospels, People's Republic of China, etc.) is thrown into a bad light in the frequency from time to time. <br /> <br /> While the show can beat a dead horse, if it is enough, the overall quality is amazing and I am grateful that Sci-Fi has decided to continue moving it until they produce a DVD season-seasonal set (and I can afford it.
