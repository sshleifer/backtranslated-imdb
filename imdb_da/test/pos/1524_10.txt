The film deals with universal themes and does not mention any specific country as its context: it can happen anywhere - and essentially if it is not form. Those who are worried about 1. change issues, censorship, et al - but do not want to be bored of lectures - need art such as this to illustrate, dramatize, teach, inspire. <br /> <br /> Rickman is definitely a valued character actor he shines in this movie and shows several actors that you should see (I have not yet seen him give a bad performance, though in not so big movies). Stowe might give her best performance (and show she holds one of the most striking pairs of eyes in Hollywood) - in two words: stunning, convincing. <br /> <br /> The set design perfectly matches the situation in function and mood. Sound editing is increased to the appropriate effect. The overall contrast brought about by the animation sequences is a perfect symbolic unity - and the welcome and only respite for the majority of history's necessary place. The script is tight and important, with engaging dramatic-yet realistic dialogue (ie as it could be and should be). Perhaps the most amazing aspect to struggle with is that 1) this is the director's first time out; and 2) he is the author. In a sentence: a tour de force - with three recommendations: see it, own a copy, see it repeatedly to fathom all its secrets and understand all that genius.
