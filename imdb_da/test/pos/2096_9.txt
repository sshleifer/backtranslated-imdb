When the noble Hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurping Samanosuke clan, the loyal maintainer avoids Kogenta (Jun Fujimaki) with his master's eight-year-old son, Tadafumi and his daughter, Kozasa. They are protected by the priestess Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), who serves the god of the Hanabusa clans, Majin, a vengeful spirit imprisoned in the giant statue carved into a local mountain side. Ten years later, Kogenta and Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) seek revenge against Lord Samanosuke (Yutaro Gomi), but are trapped in the trial and sentenced to death. Pastor Shinobu, desperately trying to save her master, threatens Samanosuke with the god's dissatisfaction, only to be killed for her efforts. Samanosuke, a vain, cruel, slim man, orders Majin's statue to be destroyed to pamper the last disappearances of hope among the remaining Hanabusa loyalists. But god Majin, who has so far been impossible silent, has other ideas ... Daimajin is an exciting, timeless, in-depth adventure. Sumptuously produced on a respectable budget, it is a film about values: nobility, justice, decency, loyalty, self-sacrifice, and love. It is about hierarchy and governance and the consequences of failing to live up to the responsibility that usually entails. These are the things that don't talk much about our democratic times, except by writing toads like William Bennet, but that's nonetheless relevant, and Daimajin shows us why. <br /> <br /> Daimajin is a perfect example of why the Japanese cinema is so delightful. The above values ​​have obvious relevance to those involved in this movie, as they do for many a Japanese film maker. There is no lip service, no wear, no irony here. Instead, there is an authentic effort to evoke a world where these values ​​can once again have life and show what happens when they fall away. Just compare Daimajin, or the Lone Wolf and Cub series or any Kurosawa movie to the actual Tarantino's nihilistic Kill Bill b * llshit to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In a film whose contributing talent is so unparalleled, I would just like to point out the majestic score, talent and beauty of the actor Akira Ifikuba by actors Jun Fujimaki, Yoshihiko Aoyama and Miwi Takada; and the amazing depiction of Otome Tsukimiya. Her death scene is one of the most moving and meaningful I have ever witnessed.
