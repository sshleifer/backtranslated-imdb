In the last days of 1999, most of all in Taiwan have died. A strange plague has ravished the island. Probably spread by cockroaches, the disease sends its victims to a psychosis where they act as the insects. Eventually they die. The cave takes place in a crumbling apartment building (which is especially well created; kudos to set designer!). Its two main characters live just above and below each other. The woman is on the lower floor, and the pipes over her apartment are leaking hard and threatening to destroy her food supply, not to mention her hygiene. She calls a plumber to check it out, and he accidentally pulls a hole through the floor of the man's apartment. The two have never met before and they come in contact through the hole. <br /> <br /> Scripture is quite brilliant. Few movies are at the same time the fun while remaining completely human, deeply exploring the human condition, especially the feelings of loneliness and despair. Tsai's direction is simply beautiful. Like many other Taiwanese directors, he uses many long moves. But, unlike, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai doesn't say overpower them. In fact, I don't know if I've ever seen them used better. They are always effective and never boring. <br /> <br /> It would be wrong to review this movie without mentioning the songs. Yes, The Hole is also a musical, and a great one on it. In the movie's best scenes - which says something, consider how well all the other scenes are - the man imagines that the woman is a singer, almost a cabaret singer. These tracks are fully choreographed, often with backup dancers and singers. In an ingenious battle, Tsai has these extensively produced numbers in the crumbling building, the signs of apocalypse and decay. This gives both a feeling of pathos and absurdity. <br /> <br /> Hole is a movie that asks to be seen. It should be a cult classic, if not something else. Before I went to see this, I was told that it was a decent movie, but probably Tsai Ming-liang's least good. Well, if that's true, I just can't wait to see another! 10/10.
