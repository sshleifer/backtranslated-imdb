Being featured at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and gaining some fame, this film seems to be another modern and elementary school drama. <br /> <br /> It's about a bunch of adolescents coming through a revealing and desperate day at school. Everything goes about a suicide - shown at the beginning to a certain extent - it happens at. 14:37. The signs are somehow connected to each other. What moves them is described through short interview sequences, strictly shot in b / w. The characters are well written, the play is exciting (especially Teresa Palmer as Melody and Frank Sweet as Marcus are discoveries). <br /> <br /> Let's stick to the movie's technique. That was what really impressed me. There are rarely cuts, most of the time the camera follows one of the main characters as in Gus van Sants' Elephant. Some scenes are presented more often than once, but each time from a different point of view (here: character). This certainly evokes a slowly evolving but gripping atmosphere that draws you into literally. The colors are alive, somehow unsuitable considering the hard plot - but it is nothing short of a smart contrast, a disturbing 'everything is fine'. The use of lighting is sufficient all the time, emphasizing the character's actual mood. And finally, there are decent locations of music. <br /> <br /> 2:37 somehow scratching you from the beginning. Neither does it compromise, it serves laughter. Rather, it strings together what psychologists would define as terrorist moments. This film focuses mainly on emotional rainfall. There is no one who should not deal with any kind of neurosis, even the depicted minor parts (eg, the teachers) appear to be in a state of suffering. And that's what keeps this movie from being really good. Its summary of piercing tragedies is unrealistic for its very bones. There is no: friendship, love, smile, truth, passion. There are: faking, humiliation, despair, illness and hitting. It's like being hit in the face really hard all the time, but you're numb after the first hour. This flick is hitting you until it reveals something quite instructive in the end. To be sensitive and excellent: 9. To be technically innovative and original: 9. To be unidimensional: 3. <br /> <br /> Make a solid 7 out of 10.
