Seen in 1962, Hong Kong (in turbulent times as we are informed), this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between two married people associated with their traditions can regain the essence of the old Hollywood scene after scene with lush colors, evocative but in contrast to the necessary sexuality and occasional nude scenes that have become part of the norm of a romance in film) and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication. It is not difficult to see the influence of Marguerite Duras here as she is known for minimalism in storytelling as well as describing powerful drama using the art of verbal and non-verbal conversation between two characters with a strong band and the use of re-active scenes that could ultimately take place in both characters' lives. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATO CANTABILE, her pen is highly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) for the last scenes explaining the intensity of regrets that he feels like he is reminiscent of the opportunity that was lost by confirming this relationship. The plot even resembles something that Duras could have written: Chow and Mrs Su Li-zhen, neighbors in a lease apartment, while both are quite successful professionals, begin to discover in the most banal ways that their spouses cheat on them, and they naturally discover it is with each other. The question is whether they should respond to what they also feel toward each other or not as their partners? Each scene plays with the idea that they will give in to each other at any time, and at one point it is suggested that they eventually make it as intrusive as the camera describes us their meetings (which appear to occur on a daily as It is seen from the frequent changes of Cheung's dresses), we never see it. And just as not seeing any of their spouses increase their own love story, it does not allow them to see through their attraction, the final separation becomes the more bitter, because at every moment we want something to happen - some catalysts - and the only one that comes is when Leung reveals to her that he loves her, followed by his silent brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband, which means he also does not want to. It also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do: from a Western point of view, completing their romance in a more solid, lasting affair would have been possible especially in the 60s, but as it is Hong Kong is cultural values ​​are significantly different. Here is the performance of the high order: playing a burnt love affair is very easy, but continuing to play a suppressed, platonic relationship full of desire is hardly suggested, it is difficult and makes the whole sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual. Cheung and Leung smolder and their burnt chemistry lingers long after the credits have rolled.
