This movie is amazing! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade Vampire Hunter with pure class, he kicks ass in such a fluid and violent way that would make Bruce Lee proud. The movie is a fast paced, exciting action and amazing stunts. The first action scene and last is outstanding, and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he walks around by wiping out all the hooves. The script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue as well. Wesley should have done more action movies than he has, I know he is a very good actor, and in this he is not streched just as much as in his more comical or drama roles, but in terms of action stars he goes he is the one best actor of them all, only Bruce Willis, Stallone and maybe Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) comes close. Like Wesley's quality, Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy. It was an unexpected surprise that a person with little stature in relation to Snipes should come across as threatening, but he does. Overall, the movie is sharp, stylish, and I hope the sequel is finished with the same kind of pace.
