Anyone throwing this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before and during the civil war, the difference between the rich, the average white and the black people. History gives you some insight into the real problems of the era and the difficulties associated with everyday life these days. The story is convincing, and the drama keeps your attention throughout the film. There are signs that you will fall in love with, there are signs you will hate, and you will find yourself emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> Both my wife and I loved it and we will see it again in a few years I am sure of it.
