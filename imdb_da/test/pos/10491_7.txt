In the aftermath of civil war, the United States (Van Johnson) travels to Dallas and is murdered by corrupt officials and businessmen interested in installing the vice president who can extort them due to incriminating documents. A gun (Guiliano Gemma) convinced that his black friend is mistakenly accused of the murder in order to uncover the truth. Tonino Valeri directed this fascinating, if a mischief, of course, an allegory to the Kennedy murder. The movie may erroneously present blacks as slaves working on plantations in Texas, but the film is nevertheless entertaining and presents an interesting interpretation - that Kennedy's death was the result of a coup de tat - which many Americans could not accept at that time. Oswald's murder is played here as the black accused of the murder is murdered by those responsible on the way to Fort Worth Prison. This moment in the movie is more melodramatic than Oswald's death with his various escorts shot down before his over the top death scene. Nevertheless, this is definitely one of the more interesting and worthy spaghetti westerns. Worth to see!
