Let me just say: I love the horror genre to the extent that I see every one that I can get my hands on regardless of (except for really low-quality b-movie frees that I could do without) and recently become a big fan of Eastern horrors. Little did I know that a Korean fate would be the one that tops on my list that came across heavyweights like the Japanese Ringu (or the American ring) or even quality American films such as the sixth sense and the other and the highly acclaimed Hong Kong Horror 'The Eye'. Formerly 'The Ring' had stood as my favorite horror, but it seems to me that I prefer the beauty of 'The Tale of Two Sisters' any day - the story is extraordinary and quite open to interpretation, allowing for repeated views, even The chances are that you will see it again and again just because the film is so masterfully shot ... the story is probably one of the best in the genre to date. The play is also in top speed from the whole cast and the scares when they come have the potential to cheat you as something in the ring - I found myself adhered to the screen at the points that could not see my eyes off. <br /> <br /> I'm still glad it didn't come back to haunt me later that Sadako / Samara did from the ring - as such feelings are unpleasant and the Tales of Two Sisters leave you feeling uneasy, but One who hopefully will not leave you without sleep, but be pleased that you have seen something very special. But remember. If you do not understand the plot after the first impression, a repetitive view is more than advised. I have personally not had time for this since it was late, so I was flipping through scenes on the DVD, some many times, until I had a good synopsis in my head and after looking on the web, I pretty much nailed it on the widely agreed interpretation. And the satisfaction of solving a puzzle as it is wonderful. All in all - a championship scare that will hardly produce the same "level" remake (it's bought by Dreamworks) simply because of Korean content and everyone is advised to capture this in theaters or on DVDs while they can ... it's the best you get. Unfortunately, because of the kind of movies here, there is no way to talk about the story without the coil machines, so it's best to do what I did - see it without knowing one thing except that "a story about two sisters "! And be prepared for something that is unlikely to be matched for some time.
