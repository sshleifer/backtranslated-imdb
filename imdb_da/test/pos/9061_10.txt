Who would a thought suicide be treated in a way that is observed by everyone? I watched the movie at SXSW as it was prizes, and it turned out to be the best movie there by far. Yes, it is biased and it is bizarre, but it makes sense in the world that creates the film maker (Michael Parness). If you don't laugh (most of all did), you just don't get it and it's a darn shame. Especially by note, Guillermo Diaz as Hector steals a lot of scenes, and the chain between Natasha Lyonne and David Krumholtz is intense. The film is reminiscent of one of Harold and Maude, but not really, it takes a bizarre spin after another, and they all make sense in this crazy mixed world we all live in. I became (like most) for Q & A afterwards, and what was good was to hear that the same things I believed in my head about why things "happened" are the reasons for it. I don't think you can say very badly about the movie unless you didn't get it. I think I got it and it looked like most others did too. The movie is called a suicidal comedy, but it has a lot of heart, a lot of laughs and a lot of hope, but it is not shy of the horrors of suicide. A nice little movie that needs to pay attention when it becomes a release that hopefully happens rather than later.
