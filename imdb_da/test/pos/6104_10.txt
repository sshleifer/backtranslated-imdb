The main point of the film IMO is that Joanna has only been a number of facades throughout her life. The film opens with her secretly dying her gray roots and storing the used kit in an empty tissue box. What is strange is that she saves this from her house band. If she is to hide earthly things from her beloved, one can bet she is saving even greater things from others involved in her life. When Joanna accidentally hits Cory, she leaves the scene to call police. At the time she returns, the police and the ambulance are there, as well as people from his community, noting "What kind of person is hitting a child, then she leaves her there?" Well respected in her community, she decides to keep quiet about what she had done. But she never understood how difficult it would be to keep up with her facades ... Great movie - I've seen it many times!
