I am shocked and appalled that the network has canceled the Talk Show with the Spike Feresten !! What's wrong with Fox Television Network, Canceling the Talk Show with Spike Feresten and replacing it with Wanda Sikes? For those on the network with a brief attention span, Wanda At Large was canceled because the audience was tired of his unpleasant insults that would hug the audience and Wanda Sykes spewed out his very own brand of violent mud winding jokes is not humor, is nasty and repulsive. Fox Fox Network apparently has rewarded Wanda Sikes because she has been given an autonomous appearance in front of President Barak Obama. There is no doubt that Wanda's recent bad heath in front of the US President is not fun, and the audience loss was just to protest and please Barak Obama. <br /> <br /> The Talk Show with Spike Feresten has a true sense of humor and has never deliberately or violently offended any guest or performer. Spike is well-rounded personality always pleasing, shot fun of life and himself. And his archived pieces in the first two seasons with AFTRA actress Mary Mae Atwill, when Mae West of the 21st Century was completely hysterical with Spike Feresten's sketches: Judge Joe Brown, Commerce's spouses and last season James Kyson Lee's episode where Spike chats with Erica via the internet on the show. <br /> <br /> Despite the network's budget constraints on elaborate field pieces and second season WGA Strike, Spike Feresten did not renounce his sense of humor or show integrity. Talk Show with Spike Feresten had always been in upcoming new talent and his comedy for Stoners spoofs by Nanny 911 and Idiot Paparazzi was considered cutting edge and had an excellent production value. <br /> <br /> On a professional level, the Spike Feresten was the best Executive Producers, and Set Producer, Brett Webster along with his amazing production crew was one of the best production teams I've worked in in my AFTRA Career. It would really be very foolish and sad to cancel the Talk Show with the Spike Feresten. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, its success is thought to be taken to Comedy Central or another network and financially it would be a valuable revenue loss for FOX Television. <br /> <br /> On behalf of late night, the Fox Television audience, supporters of the Talk Show with Spike Feresten, including all cast and crew, Saturday night, we ask the network to hold the Talk Show with the Spike Feresten Franchise and give the crew another opportunity to become a successful Fox Show.
