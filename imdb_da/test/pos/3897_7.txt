As in "Columbo" we see the death right at the start. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail and murder. The signer, Adam Arkin, is even something of a fumbler, not unlike "Columbo". It is William H. Macy who the film critic suspects who carries the film. Constant twisting and turning sends Macy's plot deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his "perfect crime". William H. Macy's fans will enjoy "A Small Case of Murder", as well as those who like crime forces with every possible opportunity. Add some well-timed comedies and it looks a lot like a nice episode of "Columbo". Highly recommended. - NOTE
