This is a good family movie with a couple of laughs. I wish it didn't have too much of the school stuff like the mob in it to fill the movie. It also seems a bit too easy to save a piece of land from being built. I mean, it just flowed too easily. It makes you aware of the wildlife. It had a sweet way to introduce the piece of land that the fast runner, but a little too slow for me. A little too hokey for me and it reminded me to go back to school. Oh, the DVD is full of goodies, so don't miss it. 7 out of 10 for the movie 10 out of 10 on the DVD with the extraordinary ones worth seeing. Worth having time to see this!
