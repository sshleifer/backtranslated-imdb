Dead Gentlemen Productions has composed a movie with amazing production values ​​considering their budget. Anyone who has ever played role-playing games, especially any fantasy RPG (they play Dungeons and Dragons in the movie) will LOVE this movie. Brilliant performances all around - especially with regard to the dual character of the principles, play their players and their characters. Anyone who has ever filmed or acted on a student film will appreciate the amount of work and love they put into this project. This movie (and its prequel) is for fantasy movies and role-playing games, which Blazing Saddles is for the highest-order parody of westerns. I have only a few minor complaints about the movie itself, none of which prevent me from buying the DVD as soon as it is available (only 6 weeks - I count the days): <br /> <br /> 1. When Lodge Speaks to Joanna joining the game group, he handles her a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Players Handbook and says "this will tell you everything you need to know." The camera hovered too long on a shot of the book, and the moment really seemed like a commercial. <br /> <br /> 2. The jokes are fun, but they seem unevenly spread throughout the movie. The last third of the film, after the almost continuous blocking of visual and verbal humor in front of it, lowers a bit as if the story was going on with the jokes. Odd, but Blazing Saddles always hit me that way too. . . and i also love that movie. <br /> <br /> One of the storytelling tales is the unsolved nature of the romantic subplot. Will Joanna become GM's girlfriend? Will she go back to Cass? Or will the three maintain a platonic friendship, enhanced by companionship? (Yes it sounds juicy, but there are a few saccharin moments, especially when Cass and Lodge "make up" at the end.) But the film spans a week: in relation to human relations, these questions could not be answered in a week. The fact that the characters' relationships remain indefinite hits me as better than the more classic choices you see in most movies, just as the girl gets her prince, and they move into the castle, or the prince sinks into the North Atlantic after three paces. boring and predictable hours. The authors really seem to have an understanding of the character's psychology, and you can see the characters (both the players and the player's characters) changed during the film, but not suddenly and not unbelievably. <br /> <br /> I'd love to hear more wisdom from Brother Silence. "The man who stands out in the dark is ... fluorescent."
