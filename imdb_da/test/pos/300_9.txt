First of all, I think this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrad's "Heart Of Darkness", the book that was the literary basis of the movie. That being said, I think this movie is amazing. It is an excellent war film that does not concentrate much on the conduct and brutality of the Vietnam conflict, but more on the psychological toll it took on the young, inexperienced "children" sent to fight it. Coppola showed a true genius in film making using many visuals to tell the story. The play I felt was definitely up to par. Marlon Brando's role in the film is what really made me act. His lighting to Willard at the end of the film rolls you in and reveals the hollowness of a man you have heard of and wanted to watch the whole movie. Those who would consider this just another war movie should give a detailed look at all the literary elements that are intermingled with this movie because there is a great deal of meaning behind it. In my opinion, this is one of the most sculptural and best-made films all the time.
