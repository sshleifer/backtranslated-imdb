Fred Carpenter screened Eddie Monroe at Boston College and judges from the enthusiastic response he has much to enjoy. A learned, well-executed Indy, impressive for it's great budget appearance. This movie has it all: a tight script that tackles you and does not escape the surprising end. This viewer didn't see it coming! Excellent performances all around. Craig Morris and Jessica Tsunis were particularly well-disposed in the leaders and delivered strong performances. And kudos to Frank Bongiorno and Alex Corrado to create two detectives as engaging and interesting to watch as in movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It confirmed my belief that some of the best works in film come from the independent, and Fred Carpenter seems to be one of the best.
