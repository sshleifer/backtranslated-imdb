This is undoubtedly one of Neil Simon's best-performing film faces. It is full of great characters and a memorable dialogue. Johnathan Silverman is making a big screen version of the young Eugene (he was played by Matthew Broderick on stage). This is the first of Simon's autobiographical trilogy, followed by the wonderful "Biloxi Blues" and closes with the TV movie "Broadway Bound". If I had to say that the movie has some errors, it might be that characters sometimes speak in obvious dialogue, but that's okay because it's a good dialogue. Rent this little gem, you won't be sorry!
