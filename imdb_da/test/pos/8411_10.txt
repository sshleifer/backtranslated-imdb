I've always loved "Gone With The Wind" and have seen it many times. But the ending left me not only "hanging" but depressed, with a hopeless feeling. Finally, in "Scarlett", Ripley took us to a very probable and satisfying end ("beginning") of the original story. It follows that some of Scarlett's obvious intelligence (as originally written) would eventually grow up. Although I, like most people, fell in love with Scarlett in GWTW, I was tired of her constant scary infantiilism at the time of extinction, and I was disappointed that Mitchell did not show Scarlett using the obvious intelligence to make an attempt to make grow emotionally. Fortunately, someone did finally. (After all, it's not the immense immaturity that conflicts with her beauty and intelligence, the only reason Rhett finally gave up on her at first?) I think Ripley did an excellent job of describing it lengthy process, and Whalley-Kilmer did an excellent job of portraying it. Joanne WK has all the fire, extension and intelligent sparkle like Vivian Leigh, and she is certainly at least as, if not more, beautiful. <br /> <br /> There was, is, and will always be a Clark Gable. But if I were to pick an actor out of the thousands I have been exposed to portraying him in his biography, it would certainly be Timothy Dalton. Dalton has the same elegant charm that Gable did, which is crucial to Rhett's character. I can't imagine anyone else coming close. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, both Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were superbly cast and the only actors who could have played Scarlett and Rhett. I think both of their performances did justice to not only the late actors, but also the spirit of their characters. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the whole cast. Julie Harris was her usual lovely presence, and Jean Smart was a sweet kick! Even Ashley's character was nicely played by Stephen Collins, and the development of his relationship with Scarlett was completely credible. The story was a little confused in Ireland, but after all, it's life, and I still found it entertaining. <br /> <br /> All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the fruits of Ripley's imagination. I wish I had written it! <br /> <br />
