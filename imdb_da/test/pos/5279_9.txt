Miyazaki has been making his mojo since the 70's and it's only recently that his films have made the US coast through Disney and fans fawning over his great talent. Ponyo is no exception. Although some of his other films have been slightly more accessible to the American audience, some may find it a bit on the fence, which is kind of "Japanese" in its presentation. For the same reason, Pom Poko is very "Japanese" and does not make much sense to the American audience, so are * some * elements of Ponyo. This should not detract from seeing this fun movie of growth, hope and friendship. <br /> <br /> What's more, Miyazaki's elaborate and magical animation and story features elements of entertainment and imagination. It combined with his characteristic use of character development and often uses girls and women as protagonists. He steps out of his zone with Ponyo, as the protagonist is a little boy living in a small seaside village with his mother while his father is out at work on the open sea. Though not lonely, Sosuke is like any other curious boy who likes adventure and sailing. Like Spirited Away, we see the different worlds of humans and sea creatures and I feel that Miyazaki may be trying to make viewers aware of the great and undiscovered nature of things living under the sea and our acceptance of them and things that are different. <br /> <br /> I managed to see the subtitle version of this last year and was happy with the story and the plot. Miyazaki has claimed that "this is my last movie" for many years, but shortly after Spirited Away, he gave us Howl's Moving Castle. Ponyo is certainly proof that Miyazaki has not kept track of his tracks and continues to delight, renew and pioneer the most creative animated films all the time. See Ponyo with an open mind and a tip of the hat for childhood fantasy and imagination, and you are transported back to when you catch fireflies and secret hiding places were more important than boring adult stuff and eating your vegetables.
