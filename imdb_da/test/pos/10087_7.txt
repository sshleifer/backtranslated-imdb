Another Asian horror movie packed with intense and eerie moments. Another Asian horror mark is the complexity of the plot, which is also here. MAJOR SPOILER WARNING! The movie starts quite simply - two sisters live with their father and grandmother after being admitted to a mental institution after their mother hangs. The sisters seem very hostile to their mother - especially the elderly - and they seem to ignore their father. Everything goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe, and the older sister tells her father. So it hits you, "your sister has been dead for years now". It turns out that the older sister is still not restored from her mother's death and what we did not know was that the wardrobe's mother was hanged on the younger sister and killed her too. As for the founder, she is the older sister's alter ego - revealed when the founder (actually sister's alter ego) sits on a couch when the real grandmother enters! I hope it has been made clearer to confused Asian horror fans out there. Finally - my favorite scene is the scene where the father invites friends for dinner, and one of the friends begins to strangle that breaks into a panic attack. Very creepy! 7 out of 10
