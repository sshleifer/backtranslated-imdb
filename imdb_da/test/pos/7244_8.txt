As always, Joan Hickson is wonderful as Jane M. Subtle, sharp and attentive. I do not want to dwell on his actions as they are praised enough on this site. I would like to criticize some of the smaller parts as the rest of the cast seemed to be hand-picked by director David Tucker. <br /> <br /> Liz Fraser's performance as Mrs Bent (the mother of the missing girl Nora) is a joy to see. Subtle and profound as the alcohol-dependent grieving mother who loves and misses her daughter desperately. A good long shot of her monologue (thank you Tucker!) So she can be fully enjoyed. I was moved when I saw her the first time when it was broadcast, and I moved again, now I have it on DVD. Brava. <br /> <br /> Joanna Hole as Madge tour guide I find very entertaining. She is on the edge of overcrowding, but her role can get it. She is as fun as the over-organized guide who wants to do good with everyone on the bus I find her salutary. Her response, after boarding everyone on the bus, is amazing ... As always: performing comedy must be taken very seriously, and that is what Mrs Hole does. <br /> <br /> I hope the two ladies have a good career (when I live in Holland, I don't know if they have, not all theatrical productions can googles ...) - their performances on the screen deserve it. <br /> <br /> Pieter
