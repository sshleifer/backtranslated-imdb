I think "Key West" can do well as a DVD. There are probably many failed Star Treks who have just never had a chance to succeed. We never know if it could have been a fantastic series. I would love to know if there is a way to see older shows like this or are they just another Hollywood footnote? Is it possible to find copies of these shows so we loyal oddballs can enjoy them again? The show had a great writing talent and some if not all the episodes left you with a feeling for the characters often missing in today's hit shows.I often came away with a sense of learning something from the story lines and very entertained by the hero unique characters. Thank you.
