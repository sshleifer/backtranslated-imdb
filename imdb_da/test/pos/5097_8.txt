"Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is a fantastic written and photographed musical version of the classic 1939 movie. Apart from Peter O'Toole's wonderfully controlled, underrated performance as the pedant school leader who finds love and changes it, the film contains hundreds of amazing visuals, from Greek ruins to London's side streets to an expanded landscape mount. The music and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse have been criticized as boring or not up to par for film musicians, but they are used to improving the story rather than telling it. Many songs are used to emphasize montage or scenes; the few that are not referred to as "show biz" numbers. In this way, the songs do not penetrate this delicate story, but elevate what the characters think or feel. "Where did my childhood go?" "Go through the world with me" and "you and I" are particularly effective. An absorbent, brilliantly acted, directed and written film.
