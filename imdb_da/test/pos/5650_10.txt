Fire on the Plain (1959) **** <br /> <br /> You can't watch movies like this anymore. 'Fire on the Plain' is an incredible portrayal of the life of the soldiers of the Japanese Imperial Army. Kon Ichikawa's masterpiece follows Tamura, a tuberculosis soldier as he walks around the Philippine landscape in the last year of the war. He is only sent to the hospital by his commander, who is to be refused treatment and he is sent back. His CO tells him to go back, and if they refuse him again, his last order is to kill himself with his grenade. He is rejected again, but meets with a band of squatters sitting outside the hospital. The next day they are cut off by American troops, and Tamura flies and chooses not to kill himself, and from there he walks from place to place and tries to get to Palompon. He discovers that some men have eaten human flesh to survive while others act as much tobacco as possible for what they can return. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with a silent sense of desperation and destruction, with a hint of insanity. All we see are skin and bones, covered in dirt wearing torn and tattered cloths. Ichikawa uses his camera to capture some beautiful shots of the destroyed landscape and the Japanese soldiers who go there. Kon Ichikawa was famous in Japan for making many comedies and satires, and there are moments in the fires of the plain that is bitterly fun. For example, take a shot of what appears to be a dead man lying down in a pool of water; a soldier goes, but and asks himself aloud if that is how they all end up, as man lifts his head out of the water and answers "what was it?" and then his face falls even deeper into the puddle than before. Another hilarious sequence involves a man finding a pair of boots along the track. He takes the boots instead of them with his old ones. Another man walks by and sees that pair of boots and changes to his old boots. The scene continues until finally Tamura finds the exchange site and examines the boots back without almost sole. He looks carefully on his own and on the ground, and decides that they are both captains, he removes his own and walks barefoot. The movie is filled with incredible scenes, one after another. Ichikawa, like Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, knew how to use his camera to paint beautiful and amazing images. There are many amazing shots of men in barren empty plains surrounded by nothing but smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies on the ruined land. There is another incredible scene where dozens of Japanese soldiers try to cross a road guarded by Yank in the middle of the night, all crawling on their hands and knees as the camera looks from above. <br /> <br /> The movie gets its name from the columns of smoke rising from fires on the plains seen throughout the movie. They represent the lives of the soldiers a little more common; The Japanese farmers' lives go home and burn corn. However, their beacons of hope for normal life are in hostile hands. The film caused a shake today with its graphic content. Great emphasis is placed on the war fear, not only with the enemy, but within your ranks and yourself. Kon Ichikawa's fires on the plains are an incredibly authentic and moving and somewhat disturbing portrait of the horror the men have suffered during the lower ranks of the Imperial Army. Clint Eastwood's Letters From Iwo Jima, while being a very good movie, it doesn't come close to recognizing the scream of war depicted in Brande on the Plain. (Eastwood was undoubtedly influenced by the movie as he claims to be such a classic Japanese film cuff.) Many war films show that war is hell through the winners' eyes. In Fires on the Plain we are shown that the war is even more hellish when you are in the losing end <br /> <br /> 4/4
