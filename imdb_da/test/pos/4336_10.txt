While I agree that this movie lacks some real substance and should not be taken seriously, it is primarily aimed at fans of the series seeking a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey) goes back on the streets (allowed to kill the main police no less) and moves into his friends apartment (as you guessed it) was killed by a street band who took control of the neighborhood (similar to Beruit) . It's fun that people who connect with Bronson have a habit of being killed. Bronson kills them systematically one by one as the people in the neighborhood are being used against him. There is some dynamism between Bronson and Fraker, who leads street bands, you can tell they both enjoy their work. At some point in the movie, after they hit the city's prison, Fraker says, "I'll kill a little old lady just for you, catch it at 6am news." "Giggler", a purse thief who laughs as he commits his crimes is also fun to see. The film was made in 1985, and most could probably identify with the stereotypical city bears thrown into the movie. It is fun to see Bronson (Paul Kersey) rid the streets of these thugs. Beware of the look of Wildey Magnum, a serious piece of hardware that Bronson uses. I also liked the soundtrack for this movie.
