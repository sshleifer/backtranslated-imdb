I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison films in general (I'm not sure why - I'm sure some shrink could do it!) I spent a night in prison more than 20 years ago, and I knew then I would never go back - I got the individual version of "scared straight"! (I was unlocked in an isolation cell at Alcatraz for a couple of hours, compliments of a park ranger, but that's another story!) Still, the genre really interests me. The soundtrack, especially "The Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones, was the perfect backdrop for the movie. To this day, I think of "The Jericho Mile" every time I hear the song.
