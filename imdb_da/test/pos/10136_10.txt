This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! How anyone can knock this movie just befuddles my imagination! First of all, Goodings and Harris's performances were simply spectacular, especially Gooding. That's the only way I can describe the actor: spectacular! You have to imagine how difficult it would be to play such a character and pull it off; Then you see Gooding, and his performance was magical. As for the plot, as it was based on a true person, it goes where the characters' lives go. For all action buffs, it may be a bit slow, but then it's not an action movie. I absolutely give this movie a 10. It deserves nothing less!
