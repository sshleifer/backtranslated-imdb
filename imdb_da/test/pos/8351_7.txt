* smaller spoilers * <br /> <br /> You know it comes to the point where Walt Disney Television Animation might as well be called Walt Disney Sequel Animation. These successors range from excellent ("Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas" and the amazing "Lion King II: Simba's Pride") to horrible ("Return of Jafar"). (This is of course my personal opinion.) Now Disney gives us their latest successor. "Scamp's adventure" and while it is flawed, it is still entertaining. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is not entirely up to Disney Feature Animation; Nevertheless, the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life. Lady and Tramp have not had a day since 1955. Trusty is still talking about the sense of smell and "Ol" Reliable "and Jock still gives him sadness. There is a good match between Tramp and a big dog in the dog's pound and again treated we at a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic leaders (although it is very doubtful that this will be a classic scene as its predecessor.) <br /> <br /> I don't care about most songs (though Roger Bart and Susan Egan - The singing voices of Scamp and Angel - singing their parts very nicely. Both Melissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel have done much better work in the past. They really aren't much. <br /> <br /> However, voting is pretty good, while I don't like Jeff Bennett as a dog catcher, he is very good as a tramp. and Alyssa Milano gives what can v re her best performance as Angel. Then there is Scamp (who is the tip of his father). He is pronounced PERFECTION by Scott Wolf. Wolf does a great job of showing Scamp's wild strip and his soft side. All in all, while "Scamp's Adventure" is flawed, it still makes for a more entertaining show. However, it is my hope that Walt Disney Television Animation will make their attention more original material for their future releases. <br /> <br />
