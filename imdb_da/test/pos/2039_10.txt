This is one of the best action movies I've seen. Geasa's depiction of the hard as nails, 'Charly' / gentle mom 'Sam', was amazing, and Samuel L Jackson just keeps you laughing all the way with her classic and liners. Sure, there were some gaps in the story itself, but this fast flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end. <br /> <br /> I felt Geena was a perfect choice for the role of Sam / Charly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as the mother of the latest movie 'Stuart Little'. Both Samuel and Geena were well supported by David Morse, Brian Cox, cute little Yvonne Zima and beginners, sexy Craig Bierko and Melina Kanakaredes. This film highlights the growing trend of strong female character and deviation from traditional male / female stereotypes, as we see Sam / Charly (Davis) and Mitch (Jackson) hurting from a catastrophe to the next. <br /> <br /> While I and many others loved this movie, it is fair to say that there will always be people who do not, and that is fine - for themselves. I highly recommend this movie for action fans, for its hilarious scenes and quick action.
