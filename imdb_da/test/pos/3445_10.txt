This epic brings together an excellent gift and crew, a narrative depth that is better than most novels, wonderful music, philosophy, and a relationship to life that I find difficult to explain. Immersing yourself in Die Zweite Heimat is akin to a spiritual experience that resembles the awe you get when you look at the stars in a clear night sky. The language and use of both color and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The movie inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the sites, including the Edgar Reitz office. From then on I have promised to improve my German abilities - after Die Zweite Heimat I almost feel German, as if I am in the head of the characters. I also try to match the piano playing of Henry Arnold (Hermann), but this is the only thing that will always escape me! This drama is unparalleled and I have been fortunate to see it on BBC2 in the UK and SBS in Australia. The successor Heimat 3 is currently filmed in Germany.
