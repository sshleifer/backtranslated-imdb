This is undoubtedly one of my favorite horror movies ever! I really can't believe it didn't get much more popularity when it was released, especially since the main challengers at that time were the usual Wes Craven sequels and copycat horrors, Mute Witness has all the style, excitement and quickfire plot twists of a Hitchcock / DePalma film, combined with some very sharp black comedies and a large plot. It never promises to be more than a good popcorn-and-hot-dog movie, but it's hard not just to enjoy the movie for what it is. <br /> <br /> The reason is centered on Billie Hughes - a dumb girl working on a set of horror movies made at a Russian factory. By a number of incidents, she accidentally finds herself and stumbles on the film of a snus film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the movie is the lack of screaming that seems to invade all horror movies ever made. Since the protagonist is dumb, she can't make noise - something that is a blessing in some stages of the movie and a curse in others. The director seems to have studied his Hitchcock very well, even the opening scene is a heavy-in-cheek nod to both Hitchcock's "Psycho" as well as rather generic slasher movie scenes. <br /> <br /> Although the play may be hammy at times, the whole movie holds it together not just throwing a few great scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat, but a few nice little questions about how to film must end. All in all, an enormously overlooked, well-functioning and action-packed psycho-thriller that I would recommend to any jaded viewer looking for something a little different from the usual Freddy / Jason / Scream / Michael Myers / Damien regurgitation is on the hallowe.
