Some people do not appreciate the magic elements of ROS, but they are what sets this series apart, the fact and the fact that the producers actually decided to dress the actors in due time clothes and armor - not anachronistic spring caps, multicolored tights and tire tension! <br /> <br /> But I'm really writing to comment on a previous poster's article. Um, Michael Praed did not leave ROS to make Jules Verne! There are 15 years between these two series. Yup, I agree, and Michael may also agree that leaving ROS was not a good move - but it was a coveted Broadway role that tempted him in '84 and then Dynasty with his megabucks paychecks ... .
