I used to watch this show when I grew up. When I think about it, I remember it quite well. If you ask me, it was a really good show. When I think about it, I can't remember the opening sequence and the theme song very well. In addition, everyone was ideally thrown. The script was also very strong. The performances were also top class. I hope some network brings it back so I can see all episodes. Before I unpack it, I want to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I'm not sure I've seen every episode. Now I conclude that if any network ever brings it back, I hope you catch it one day before it goes well into the air.
