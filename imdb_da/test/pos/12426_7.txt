Adam (Eric Jungmann) and unpleasant best friend Harley (Justin Urich) are running cross country skiing for a wedding. Along the way they pick up sexy hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Then, for some reason, a monster car does not attempt to drive them away from the road ... and maybe kill them. Who does this and why? <br /> <br /> Pretty good horror movie. Its energetic and full of flashy direction that gets you straight into the action. It's also a horror comedy. Most of the humor is infantile and really rough, but actually fun. Also this movie really piles on gore at times - but that's a good thing! The action is ok - Jungmann delivers his nerd role a bit; Urich is stuck with the hopeless role of the foul-mouthed, sex-occupied best friend - but pulls it off; Brooks is also good in a limited role. But I could see that "twist" stops coming long before it happened, and the logic disappears at the end (especially rescue). Still, this is a gory, sometimes funny and sometimes scary horror movie. I give it a 7.
