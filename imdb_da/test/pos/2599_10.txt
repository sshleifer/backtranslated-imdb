Daffy Duck has characters hanging from every inch of all available trees announcing it's rabbit season. But you guessed it - it really is the spirit season. Elmer Fudd appears: he is the only hunter stupid enough to fall to the gag. <br /> <br /> He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny progresses to him and asks how rabbit hunting goes, Elmer admits that he has not yet seen a rabbit. This is more than Daffy can stand. He comes from his hideout and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. "Shoot him now!" Daffy screams. "You're quiet," says Bugs. "He doesn't have to shoot you now." Daffy insists he does. <br /> <br /> When Daffy turns his blown nose to his head, he is condemned to several arguments infected with "pronouns", all of which have the same result. Later, Bugs dress like a sexy woman and ask Elmer for a second day. Will Daffy get the last laugh? "Have, have, much fun! Ha, ha, ha!" <br /> <br /> What's funny about this classic cartoon? Bug recoils in scared like Daffy screams in his face. Bugs Bunny says "Yes?" while dripping with complacency. Daffy Duck is on tiptoes who need to be shot. Elmer Fudd whines that he "can't wait anything wonger." Daffy sees bugs in women's clothing and makes the little noise with the tongue. Carl Stalling plays "You must have been a beautiful baby" under Bugs drag act. Daffy requires "pure honesty" out of error. Stalling plays "Home Sweet Home" at an inappropriate time. Daffy tells Bugs he is "desthpicable". In five words: every detail of this movie. NOTE: This card is available on "Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume One," Disc 1
