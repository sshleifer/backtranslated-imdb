- The best bit: When the boring mobster (Nicholas Turturro) calls out to the round (Matthew Modine) "Shane! .. Come back Shane!" and when the older wise guy asks him "What are you doing?" he simply replays "enjoy my time!" Actually like me at the moment! <br /> <br /> - The most scary part: I've been wondering all the time about: where did I see that girl before? where ? where ? Until I found out while the final credits. OHH MY GOD! She's (Elizabeth Berkley). From showgirls fiasco! But I just couldn't recognize her with her clothes on! To tell you the truth, I felt a short tremor. She is really sweet and nice, but maybe Hollywood had no mercy at all! <br /> <br /> - The Sexiest Bite: When (Berkley) says "do you mean the things that give you a boner ?!". <br /> <br /> - The most boring thing: The retarded assistant after a day and a night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy at the end !! ?? In addition, the Mexican smuggler took 3 balls on the same car!) And he is not dead either ?? <br /> <br /> - The most ugly thing: All these murdered people, as well as the many (F) departments to a dull degree! <br /> <br /> - The most beautiful thing: The crazy clever script with all the fun characters and the tumultuous situations, the play so sweet especially from (Paul Rodriguez) who stole the show (which he had the best dialogue also !). <br /> <br /> - The most disappointing thing: Although the direction had no root in history's wittiness at all, but at the same time it did not give a unique touch, an unsurpassed signature, a kind of insane hilarity like that in history itself. But perhaps the low production disturbed it well! And of course the easy tasteless music that could be so because of cheap production too! <br /> <br /> - The most confusing part: (Matthew Modine) is a talented guy, but what did he do to be out of Hollywood's "A" list of stars ?! What could possibly be the thing he did (or not made!) To end up in light self-jest like (shipment)? !! <br /> <br /> - The most absent scene: Where did (Jose) go the Mexican smuggler finally? I thought we would see him again and smuggle again as the surviving little criminal who in a short gimmick like this could constitute the continuing disorder in such a world. <br /> <br /> - Most questions I had after the end: When we see (shipment - 2)? Since I'm so eager to see the nice little cartoon hurly-burly atmosphere again! <br /> <br /> These were my own answers.
