I like the good things in life, as much as anyone, I suppose, but up to about five years ago, opera did not come in my entertainment choices. Oh, I made a couple of attempts to learn what all about it I had seen several television productions - especially parts of Wagner's ring cycle on the public television - hoping to understand others' fascination with the art form. And I knew I liked parts of different operas (I remember being surprised as a kid, I actually LIKED the excerpts of "Madame Butterfly" in "My Geisha, and I enjoyed the opera scenes in" Moonstruck "and" Pretty Woman "), but unlike the characters in these movies, I just didn't" get it. "<br /> <br /> In 1995, I saw a live performance of" Rigoletto "presented by the New York City Opera Company, and That night I got it. "What a wonderful, wonderful beauty of color and music and raw feeling! And I mean feeling with a capital E! I think the key is that the operator music allows the artists to hand over freely and reliably in a way that seems to be foolish if their words were just spoken. Everything is related to the music, and when the music is magical, as it is in "Rigoletto", an opera can be a great entertainment. /> A sympathetic family member gave me a laser disk copy of the 1982 television production of the opera, and I found out that since I can't see live perfo Rmances of "Rigoletto" live regularly, this video version is a nice replacement. Luciano Pavarotti is perfect in the duke's part; Ingvar Wixell is excellent as his medieval hips Rigoletto; and Rigoletto's beloved daughter, Gilda, is played by the somewhat ordinary Edita Gruberova. The sets and costumes are sumptuous, and the placement shots on the river late in the movie provide an increased sense of drama to the story that could never be matched at one stage. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen "Rigoletto" or if you think you don't like or understand opera, I encourage you to find it on videotape and buy it or rent it. If you don't like this, if this production of "Rigoletto" doesn't make you appreciate the powerful form of opera, just give it up and move on to something else. But I suppose if you are new to opera as I was then you will be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Bill Anderson
