Judged TV-14 for sexual content and language. I remembered hearing about this show back in 1998 when it used to play on the Teletoon channel. I didn't see it, but now it's playing on the Channel, Razer. I've seen about four episodes of this show and I have to say it's pretty intelligent and fun. <br /> <br /> Show the stars Jason Alexander of Seinfeld fame and also Tim Curry of Rocky Horror Picture Show and it fame. The view is about a duck who is a police officer. He does almost his job as a policeman while handling personal problems. This show is pretty fun at times, and fans of animated comedy will like this.
