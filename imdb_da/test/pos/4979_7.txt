John Parrish is a former EU officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to Wilkison's over at Anchor. The problem is that the price offered is too low, and when they start bullying Parrish and his workers, he has a change of heart, especially when things take a brutal turn to the worst. <br /> <br /> Originally, after seeing this one, I had a sense of frustration, mainly because of the cast that was involved. When you got Edward G. Robinson, Glenn Ford and Barbara Stanwyck in the same movie, you hope they get a story and a script from which to excel. Unfortunately, aren't they able to produce a Western classic worthy of multiple audits, or is it my expectation that makes it a disservice? Well I slept on it and decided to consider more about the picture. I think it is fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work, that is, when all is said and done, a plot that has been milked for all it's worth, and some. But the violent men are still a very rewarding film, regardless of the missing opportunities evident in the production. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford as Parrish is as cool as an Eskimo's nose throughout, and it's always good to see Babs Stanwyck playing a bitch because she's good at it. While Eddie G, when you get used to being in a Western, is fine in what is a written part. Robinson, who went in at the last minute, when first-choice Lee Wilkison, Broderick Crawford was injured, is the one who has changed most of the decision makers, even supporting characters like the Devil's Wade Matlock {a grinning delight from the reliable Richard Jaeckel} Judith Wilkison {a brilliant Dianne Foster} gets something to leave with an impression. But for what it is, Robinson's creepy "bad" guy is at least memorable for all the right reasons. Not shy at action and gun games, it is with the twists and almost Shakespeare tragedies that Rudolph Maté's film rises above the secular, with all of it beautifully framed by Burnett Guffe's amazing filmography. Lone Pine in Alabama has been used in many a Western image {see seven men from now to another glorious use of it}, but here Guffey really stands out and manages to dazzle his eyes at every turn. The violent men are not a good Western image, and perhaps a better director than Maté could really have given Donald Hamilton's {The Big Country} novel an adaptation to be proud of. But for every niggle and irk I personally had with it, I found two more reasons to really like it, so that's what it is recommended for sure. 10.7
