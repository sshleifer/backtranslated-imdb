If you want to see the municipality's true, odd nature, see the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. (Tvamomodr√Ω Svet) It tells how the brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the fight against the Nazis. After the war, the Communists feared that they had picked up dangerous Western ideas of freedom. So they had thrown these heroic Czech pilots into a nightmare prison where some of the guards were the same Nazis, they risked their lives to defeat. <br /> <br /> If Hollywood understands why so many of their movies fall flat, they should compare character drama parts of "Pearl Harbor" with this movie. In Dark Blue World, you really make a connection to all the characters. In Pearl Harbor, everyone is a slender cartoon version of a real person. <br /> <br /> There are countless instances of brilliant writing in this movie. A fun scene that sticks to my heart is when the character Karel is taught English by a rather formal English woman. When he cannot pronounce a word, he charges the lesson. In typical English English style, the teacher learns calmly but strongly Karel and is ashamed to behave. <br /> <br /> The air fight sequences in this movie are amazing and they help keep the movie lively. I read that it cost $ 11,000 per hour to rent the planes, but it was worth every penny. <br /> <br /> Ladies, you are expected to cry at sad movies, but guys .... beware! This movie would make General Patton cry. And if you are a dog lover, use a half box of Kleenex. Don't say I didn't warn you.
