I really love this movie. It has a very real sense of it. I think it was never popular because of the subject, but because of the subject, it makes the movie all the more important. <br /> <br /> This is an "A" movie and I highly recommend it. If you liked the "1984" book or movie, I think you also like this. <br /> <br /> This is hard, at least, including mental and physical acts of torture, some rather insane. Not for the week in the heart or in the stomach. No one does, but his film is so great to show the mental expectation that it doesn't need blood and gut. <br /> <br /> If you are not a realist or a pestimental person, I don't think you will enjoy it. It gives you a troubled sense of people what they can and the very real possibility that our governments do not necessarily have our personal interest in the heart.
