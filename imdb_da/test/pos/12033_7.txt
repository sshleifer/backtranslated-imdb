I found parts of this movie quite slow, especially the first part; The other part seemed to go much faster, but it is not clear to me why some were faster than the other. I have somehow managed to find fun. The action was good, the writing was good (but vulgar). There was also another good side to it: it was easier to understand than say the Godfather movies. You knew who was on whose side, etc. All in all, the movie wasn't half bad.
