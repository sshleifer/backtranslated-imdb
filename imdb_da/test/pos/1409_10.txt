It is a pity that this series has not been remastered and produced on video by Warner or another professional film house. Copies of most episodes are available, but are usually of poor quality, which are copies of copies of copies. <br /> <br /> As I understand, 92 episodes were produced during its race, but only 15 are listed here. <br /> <br /> Some of the series's authors, such as Richard Matheson, continued to be listed authors. <br /> <br /> Excellent series, well-written, well-trained and well-crafted. <br /> <br /> Michael Weldon, <br /> <br /> Udon Thani, Thailand
