"Driving Lessons" sees two middle-class quintessential British families meet upside down when Grint's character comes into contact with Evee, (Walters), a slightly horrified actress with an ego. Grint betrays her overwhelming and super-Christian mother (Linney) and goes on to travel with Evee to Scotland to accompany her on a trip to attend a poetry reading, something she claims could be her last because of an illness. <br /> <br /> Grint's depiction of a caged youth, brainwashed by an indulgent and even hypocritical mother, is the masterpiece of this film. His depiction of a shaded teenager in search of his true morality and happiness is captivating to see unfolding throughout. The film is sharply shot and well paced, with very few moments leaving you tired, a performance, especially considering the nature of the plot. Walters tackles her character with both hands and successfully brings the audience to her side of things and emphasizes Liny's ironic immorality throughout. Her role in "Driving Lessons" is entertaining and memorable in every sense. The plot develops nicely and leaves the audience cheering at Grint as he chases back to Eve's place during his lunch break during his fate at a local bookstore to apologize for his misdemeanors. The values ​​in the piece are continued and thoroughly performed to the final feature, in a very consistent manner. The indulgent (and soothing) main idea is that religion does not lead to happiness and certainly does not lead to morality.

Charismatic and beautiful plays along with a tight and fact-based script make this a must-see this Christmas.
