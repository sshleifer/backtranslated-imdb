OKAY. Overall, this tripartite documentary will bring most interested people up to date in the world of physics and the last 300 years of discovery of our universe. If you have read Stephen Hawking's brilliant book "A Brief History of Time" and understood it, you may benefit from the visual description of certain concepts .. which I did to some extent. The greene is tolerable, but obviously for the sake of the masses tends to explain things in a weak condescending manner. This is, of course, conscious and will be perfect for just about anyone who sees this series. The visiting researchers were good. (no Hawking, but I suppose he has his own DVDs) I waited for him to appear, but they rotate through the same in almost 3 parts ... (very American weighted here with some Britons and an antipodean) I bought Nova 2 Disc Edition (NTSC) and there were a few inclusions that really detracted from the overall experience. <br /> <br /> 1. "This is brought to you by .." at the beginning of each part was a necessary evil for the first part, but seeing it 2 more times before it was over was very common. <br /> <br /> 2. I can't help assuming, but there are some overlaps at the beginning of 2 and 3 that made me reach the FFW button sometimes. <br /> <br /> 3. This disk set was right from TV .. (ie ads, what happens last show to those who missed it and frequently "goto pbs.org for more ....") that appears throughout the presentation. (totally unlike BBC material that is unmatched for presentation. Planets, the Blue Planet, etc.) My 7/10 is based on content alone. Niggles was there but I came across them. If this had been done with the classic British accredited presenter (you know it), it would be a perfect Disc set in my opinion. <br /> <br /> If you've seen this and want more ... then I highly recommend Hawking's book "A Short History of Time" ... I wish it was a movie too. <br /> <br /> Happy viewing.
