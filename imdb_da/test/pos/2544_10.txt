I was very impressed with this production at probably all levels; from production to plot and character development. This certainly falls under the "realism" genre, as nothing happens here that makes use of creative imagination, twists or manipulates the audience into how a viewer should feel, think and donkeys. <br /> <br /> The actors are good, especially the "little ones". The chemistry between the brother and the sister is thinking, perhaps not even as common as it should be in real life. It's a movie that's great for literally watching while visualizing it. you know when a movie is good when you just don't want it to end, but ultimately do everything ...
