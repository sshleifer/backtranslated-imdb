Interesting cartoon included on the DVD of "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra". I especially like how the color was used in background art - very artistic for Columbia, whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget (and the results looked like it!) I wonder, But how a particular ... um, finger gesture ... ever got past the censors. Granted, the particular gesture was seen much less frequently in 1937 than it is today. You would think someone besides the animators would have noticed, though - especially as it is seen three times in that scene! And on the basis of the context, I suppose its recording was intentional, something the animators slipped in just to see if the censors would notice!
