As with any Haneke movie, make your own decision - don't be swayed by what you read, and if you are interested in someone who uses the movie media for their own unique ends, you can see for yourself. Isabelle Huppert is fantastic in this movie - in combination with Haneke, the two never pull their strokes. Haneke penetrates us with the lid for the golden boy, Benoit Magimel, but it's an anti-romance, as much as Funny Games was an anti-thriller. You have to force yourself to see much of it, and the cathars are much more within the framework of persistent anxiety than any kind of emotional release, but it is incredibly nervous and thoughtful; Haneke continues to mirror how desensitized Western civilization is or has become. People can turn their nose on this, but it only takes what Solondz did in Happiness a few steps further. While it is due in reality, much of what Erika (Huppert) does can be seen as an emotional metaphor. I do not recommend it, but I would not deter you either ... it certainly shares people, but considering it is largely about repression - it is no surprise.
