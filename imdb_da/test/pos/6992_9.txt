People who thought THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK sucked harder than the black hole that swallowed EVENT HORIZON could not initially see the movie that created Vin Diesel's skin-head killer, and probably has no point in doing it . Too bad because PITCH BLACK actually kicks big ass. Directed by genre knows David Twohy, (WARLOCK and the excellent but underrated BELOW) and written by siblings Jim and Ken Wheat (LIES, SILENT SCREAM), Beginning PITCH BLACK with an 'ALIEN' esque prologue. When a combination freight / passenger ship is badly damaged by a freak meteor shower (where the captain is also killed), co-pilot, Carolyn Fry (SILENT HILL'S Radha Mitchell) has an important decision to make: disengage the cargo or passengers? Near picking ore over residents, the landing collapses its ultimate action. <br /> <br /> No matter because the catastrophic landing is made on a grueling stone that once held a mine colony. Among the survivors are a few settlers, Shazza (FARSCAPE's Claudia Black) and Zeke (John Moore); an imam (keith david) and his young followers (can you say "red shirts" boys and girls?); an antique dealer named Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); a "young boy" named Jack (Rhianna Griffith) and the most controversial members of the group: a Marshall named John's (the excellent slimy Cole Hauser) and his prisoner ... a dangerous killer named Riddick (Diesel). <br /> <br /> How the group dynamics move out creates much of the dramatic excitement, especially with concerns about Riddick and how many people he can cut and dice if he ever gets away. But no one here comes alive as it says, and the biggest phrases have less to do with how they come together than how they survive when they discover the unthinkable. They are not alone on the planetoid. Things that are hungry, spoken and fast, glide around where they can't be seen, live in the dark, where they can survive and thrive. They want the new arrivals to set their desires, but they cannot get into the daily light to feed. <br /> <br /> Does the term "total feeling" make a little more interesting? You betcha. Therefore, it is more than appropriate title. Wine, more monosyllabic than Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry on its grumpiest day dripping more testosterone than sweat, has a field day here with a sign that really seems worth a sequel or two, and Hauser radiating threat and gall is just as good as his father Wings was in screen crime. Surprisingly, though, Mitchell holds his own and manages to be strong and sympathetic as Fry. You would expect no less than a strong view from Black, who was once 'Aeryn Sun' and she does not disappoint. (That is, her role was not greater, but that is all I want to say about it.) And David makes his usual indelible impression as the holy man whose faith is truly being tested in the Hole itself. <br /> The pace moves faster than Riddick slides up behind his prey with a shaft in his teeth, and when the darkness falls, terror and excitement never break out, much like other classic sci-fi / horror flicks like this mimics. But if imitation really is the sincere kind of flattery, Dave Twohy and Wheat's great setbacks deserve this right of revenge, and to give us an end that is anti-Hollywood to the maximum. <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil the surprises, so I won't say much more, except if you saw CHRONICLES first and were not so happy, PITCH BLACK gives a chance anyway. And if you haven't seen it, you should definitely start with this. <br /> <br /> I don't know what Wine has so far, but he could certainly do worse than give these guys a call again. I'd like to see what they would dream up next time ...
