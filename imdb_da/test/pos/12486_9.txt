H.G. Cluozot had difficulty working in France after he had made "Le Corbeau" in 1943, which was produced by the German company and later sentenced by French as a piece of anti-French propaganda. Louis Jouvet, an admirer of Clouzot's work, invited him to lead a thriller "Quai des Orfevres" where he played an ambiguous police visit examining a murder that occurred in Paris Music Hall. Without each other, the seductive cabaret singer Jenny Lamoure (Suzy Delair) and her jealous piano-companion husband Maurice are in love with her (Bertrand Blier, father of director Bertrand Blier) trying to cover up (without each other's knowledge) what they think be their involvement in the murder? Enters tenacious policeman (Louis Jouvet), determined to discover the truth. Jouvet stole the movie with wonderfully cynical and sentimental at the same time. "His character, his eagle-like profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable." "Quai des Orfevres", witty and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses was a great comeback by H.G. Cluozot, the fine director, "French Hitchcock".
