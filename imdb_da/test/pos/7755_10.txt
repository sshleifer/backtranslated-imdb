I first heard about The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya from a reviewer on Youtube. He literally beat the show with a big bad rant and condemned it badly and confusingly. Curiously, I decided to watch the show (when I first got the order of the episodes, thanks to those who made the lists), and I found it absolutely brilliant and fun to see. Great memorable characters that are full of life and are absolutely lovable and fun; a unique and non-glowing plot that makes sense now that I've seen the show; and two of the best anime moments in history, in my opinion. Plus the opening and end themes are great. <br /> <br /> Based on a collection of successful manga novels, Anime follows a simple plot when you understand it. While the show's focus is on the protagonist, Haruhi Suzumiya, the view from his friend is Kyon. Kyon is a regular high school student who does not really believe in supernatural things (eg Santa Claus, aliens, magazines, ghosts, espers), but he ends up talking to Haruhi, who is the most strange girl in school and would prefer to dance one stranger, in view of all men worthless. She even went with each club in school to find something interesting, but quit as fast as she came to. After "advice" from Kyon, Haruhi decides to form his own club with Kyon's club. Established in the literary classroom, Haruhi forms the SOS Brigade - its mission to investigate supernatural cases (think Scooby-Doo minus the dog, the masked man and the Mystery Machine). Haruhi "recruits" three additional members. The first is Yuki Nagato, a bookmask of the kind that speaks very little and spends most of his time reading and sitting. The other is Mikuru Asahina, a shy girl who is forced into the club by Haruhi, who thinks they need a cute mascot to get some things done. She is often forced into costumes by Haruhi to promote her cuteness. The third is Itsuki Koizumi, a friendly and social transfer student who always smiles. While Haruhi thinks her group is full of normal people, she can't be more wrong. While Kyon is as normal as you can get, the other three are quite unique. Yuki is a stranger, Mikuru is a time traveler from the future, and Itsuki is an esper (someone who has ESP). All three have come to look over Haruhi, who might just have a power of God, and if she gets bored, she may discover her strength and create a whole new world, and Kyon is somehow involved. <br /> <br /> The show is worth seeing with beautiful characters, music and some fun and wonderful moments. But for parents there are some sexual references, including Mikuru's cleavage being exposed or touched several times, and more difficult words are also used. Apart from that, the show is one of greats.
