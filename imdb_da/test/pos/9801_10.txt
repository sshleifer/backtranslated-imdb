This should be the best movie all the time (in my opinion). It really taught me when I saw when I was 10 (2000) that the freedom of a being a child slips away before we expect it. Also Joseph Mazzello should be my favorite actor ever and I think he and elijah wood did a good job in the roles of the brothers. This movie is pretty sad and some people don't understand the end. But the story itself is quite incredible, the idea of ​​a poor 7 year old boy (bobby) being abused by the drunken stepfather is horrible, and what the two boys do about it is sad and important. My favorite part of the movie is when Tom Hanks (older Mike) lists the 7 things to be a child lost to the adult world. But there are some parts that could have been better in this movie, such as the casting of the mother (lorraine braco), which I think is a terrible actor. The "King" played his role well as it is a tough role to play. Joseph and Elijah were certainly the stars of the movie. I couldn't believe how well they played victims of an abusive stiff as they were the age they were (7 and 9). But overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who loves big kids actors and a great movie. :)
