Shooting and editing the movie is extraordinary for the time period. Eisenstein builds on every scene in the movie that leads to the sailor's rebellion and massacre in the city. As much as the movie is a highlight of the cinema, it is also an example of Socialist Realism. In 1925, the Soviet government actively used art, including film, as a means of spreading the message of the revolution. Eisenstein's depiction of rebellion on the battle ship Potempkin gives the viewer insight into Soviet elite's message. Marxist theory and perspectives for class struggle are demonstrated as sailors representing the oppressed workers and the officers representing the elite of society. Much of the film shows the Communist Party's message and how films were used as a tool for propaganda.
