Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema, and it is far better than expected. The people who say it's neither scary nor fun have a point, it's not that big. But it must keep in mind that everyone involved in the movie is pretty amateur, so it's basically a maiden voyage. And comparing this with Sinan Çetin's other movie, such as the first-class garbage bin "Propaganda", this movie is pretty amazing. One thing to be said: It's about the high school students' lives in Turkey very realistic! How it goes! The scenes to scare are somewhat cheap, and Hollywoodish. Most of them, though not all. But the religious lesson scene made me laugh in tears, and Emre Kýnay performs the best play of this flick as a religious teacher. It's not a waste of your time, go see it! You find it pretty entertaining, especially if you know enough Turkey to relate to Turkish youth school life.
