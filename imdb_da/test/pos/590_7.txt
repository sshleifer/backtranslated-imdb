If I judge the movie a little high, you can blame it on emotions. This is one of the first movies I remember watching and totally loved. I saw it in the run-ins here in California in the late 70's. I was already a big fan of "The Muppet Show" on TV, so I was primed for the movie and the movie didn't disappoint. Basically, it takes the whole absurdist ethos of the Muppet show and transports it from vaudeville to a road movie. Kermit The frog is on the quest to become famous; not because he wants to take champagne baths and run in a private jet, but because he wants to "make millions of people happy". Of course. <br /> <br /> Along the way, he picks up all his beloved muppet friends, most endearingly Fonzie Bear, who he meets at a seedy bar that does stand-up. They sing "Movin 'Right Along", a song that has always charmed me with its upbeat tune and its theme of friendship and common discovery. He also meets enough Hollywood movie stars to fill out a Stanley Kramer movie, including comedy luminaries such as Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle and Mel Brooks. Brooks in particular has a rather dull bit and you are left to feel that Henson could have cut a few of these cameos out if he was not afraid to offend the stars. Still, as it fits a road trip movie like this one, the very first person he meets is Dom DeLuise. The end is one of the more odd examples of literally breaking down the fourth wall you find in any "children's" movie. The Hollywood dream seems to be crumbling about them when a true rainbow pierces the Hollywood set with its authentic joy and mystery. I'm sure this was supposed to relate to some of Jim Henson's own personal or spiritual experiences. <br /> <br /> This is the best movie with Muppets by a long shot. If you or anyone else wondered why Muppets were so popular back in the 70s, considering how poor the movies have been in the last couple of decades, I think this movie is at least the age good enough to give one clue.
