What is worth mentioning in the other reviews I have read here is the subtitle of how the law shaped homosexual life and behavior in the era depicted in the film. While Courtenay's character is apparently homosexual, he is not the only one: it often spoke of Mr Davenport-Scott being the other, and the reason he never saw, seems to be the cause of what he has disappeared, to be that he has has been detained by police for homosexual activity - a crime in England at that time. <br /> <br /> We can read below the surface that this recent event has confused Norman, the character of Courtenay: and we can also see in an Oxenby character, Edward Fox the character, the quick renunciation of any connection to such a person, when the law is involved: The fear of association affects many of the characters and is part of the portrait's painting of a time and people who inhabit it. The surrender of Courtenay at the end of sir has been expected throughout, if this subtitle is included: it also makes sense for both his otherwise inexplicable omission from the list of those he thanks. Flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure gives the combination of longing and fear that Courtenay must "step into the footsteps" as he does when he announces the forthcoming air strikes, a scene that would otherwise be free but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of man's inner plague. So while the drama is of Finney's sirens decline, much of the film's and drama's tragedy comes from the fatal mistake of "Courtenay's gay, and makes it a movie about him as the title suggests. <br /> <br /> The artistic direction, pacing and film style of this movie seems to come from a different time more distant than the eighties and, in some ways, than the Second World War. The implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order, and the character's sympathy, racked and destroyed by the atrocities of that order, is necessarily trapped in the closed world of the theater; and the knowledge we have of how much of it would be swept away after the war makes this film more appealing to all its faults.
