This film is full of charming situations, and healthy young people easily face, whether or not they have clothes. The strong superstructure of its plot is maintained by Shakespeare's art. As Joseph Papp discovered back in the 1950s in Central Park, Shakespeare's plotter can be adapted to today's customs and customs. And then, the classic tales of cross-determination and other evil found in such light-haired comedies as the Twelfth Night and A Midzummer night, and which you like, are used for good effect in this movie. All the young actors and actresses do a good job of promoting the plot with their blocking and dialogue and costumes. And the idea of ​​a football game to bring things to a climax reminds me of Bend It Like Beckham, another charming upcoming movie.
