A great combination: - Chabat's humor - Uderzo / Goscinny world and characters - Limited presence of Christian Clavier <br /> <br /> The original comics were amazing - one of the better of a great big series - and Alain Chabat, one of the funniest members of the famous French group Les Nuls, was able to film, replicate and complement the great work done by goscinny and uderzo, by enforcing the story in a smart way and giving Djamel Debouze his best role (finally, a little far from his usual repetitive part) to gather a bunch of great actors (Gerard Darmon is wonderful, so often Chabat himself is a great Cesar). Moreover, he is obliged to continue with Christian Clavier as Asterix, Chabat stylishly set his role in the film to give prominence to Darmon and Debouze ... which is always a good idea! <br /> <br /> Fantastic environment, great scenario, great instructor, great actors, great humor, beautiful Cleopatra ... This movie would have earned a 10 if Clavier hadn't been involved.
