Firstly, I have to say that I do not speak Spanish and usually do not enjoy Spanish-speaking films ... BUT Two Coyotes is an extraordinary film. There is enough action and hard drama that doesn't matter that it's a Spanish-speaking movie. The subtitles were easy to read and did not block the action - OR the drama! <br /> <br /> I want to tell fans of Spanish-speaking movies and non-fans of Spanish-speaking movies to watch this movie. The action and the drama are worth every penny. <br /> <br />
