I liked this movie. Unlike other thrillers, you get to know the killers very well. You also learn the two detectives that look at them. The murderers are two high school kids. They are very intelligent and will prove that they are smarter than the police, so they plan the "perfect crime". We all know that this crime will not be perfect. What we do not know is whether they get caught or maybe just one of them, or even no one. Somehow, I hoped they would both get away with it, even though I didn't know if it was the movie's intention. The story is told in a good way. You get to know the people involved. The character of Sandra Bullock is sympathetic, but has her own secret that works against her. Ben Chaplin is pretty good as Sam and the two children are both good. The scenes between them are the better scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think you can say that the movie is pretty good and not as predictable you would think. For a good night with a movie, 'Murder by Numbers' is a good one.
