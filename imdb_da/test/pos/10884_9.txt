What can one say about one of the biggest N64 games ever? That the action is fast enough to hold even a seasoned FPS veteran sweating bullets quite literally? That the graphics are good, down to the explosions that everyone loves to see? That nothing is as fun as playing multiplayer mode and shooting your friends and siblings in the back with machine guns? <br /> <br /> Very small beats Goldeneye 007. About the only thing missing was voice acting and a little more intelligence in enemy soldiers. If you have an N64 and you like to shoot people and things crossed with espionage, get a copy of this.
