I must tell you that I've been a fan of Star Trek TNG since I was a kid. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, I gave a friend of my some DS9 episodes and I asked him <br /> <br /> "Hello man, what do you see lately because I'm done to see all TNG episodes? " he said. "Well, I have these episodes of Farscape." I said, "Okay, let me try it." I was pretty sure then that I didn't like it because I was just fine-tuned and looked at TNG and found it good. "<br /> <br /> I had 3 episodes, watched them, but the show didn't impress me much, I found it childish first and I thought it was just another TV show, fun adventure, but regularly. were slightly different, nice special effects, although I had the vague impression that the actors did not come all the way into the tub's skin. <br /> <br /> I saw other 3 episodes thinking that 3 eps was not enough to decide I liked or not since then the show started to get me, I got a good understanding of the action and wanted to see what happened next to the poor Crichton .... the rest is history. believe that I mostly like the freedom of the personality in relation to the action as opposed to Star Trek where everyone slept when they had to do too much high tech bullshit. <br /> <br /> episode, very interesting s tory line ..... what can i say, this movie is like poetry. <br /> <br /> I recommend d one !!!
