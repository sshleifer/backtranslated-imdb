This is definitely a good movie, beautifully photographed and evocative. But you should definitely criticize it, and Mizoguchi, for it is not without errors and weaknesses. Mizoguchi really used women and wanted to make statements about the human lack of sympathy and total cruelty, but he sometimes comes before himself trying to make this statement by adopting the wrong means. This is certainly a case in 'The Crucified Lovers', 'Princess Yang Kwei Fei' and 'Zankiku Monogatari'. He sets the scenario in feudal Japan, leaving the viewer at the end with the partially correct exclamation: "boy, sugar feudalism, I'm glad it's over ...". And true, some of the scenarios would present such weaker films of Mizoguchi present literary impossible today. Also, his female characters sometimes become archetypes of unrealistic self-sacrifice, which also simplifies the scenario less attractive. To say that "crucified lovers" is a good movie, with so few relative weaknesses, even though the occasionally cold, cynical prose from Ueda, helps the writer include this film. I still prefer a lot and recommend Mizoguchi's' realistic 'contemprary' 1936 movie: 'Osaka Elegy' and 'Sisters of the Gion' as well as his late masterpieces, showing more restraint and subtlety: 'Ugetsu' Sansho Dayu 'and' Oharu's life '.
