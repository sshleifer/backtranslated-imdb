"Don't look in the basement" is so easy to beat, but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is one of Horror's real underground stars, and IMHO is far too late for proper recognition. 'Do not' is his undisputed masterpiece. This scummy psychodrama immediately strikes the viewer into such a strange, heterogeneous, claustrophobic world of sweating madness, you have no real idea of ​​what hell is going on. It succeeds in making you feel exceptionally dirty, just unclear, for Brownrigg's world is this crazy, unwashed, scary prison cell of rants, obsessions, and all nuances of mental illness. And he uses his low budget palette to pack his cave blanket about you as a bad memory. There is just something so beautifully strange about it all damned. In a word, classic .... Also, if you see 'Not' first, you get an idea of ​​the crazy psychodrama style that marks Brownrigg's other films. In summary, they really come no more esoteric than this - well, they actually do, track Brownriggs' Keep My Grave Open. Mad genius. Accept no compensation.
