There is very wrong with this movie. I don't want to lie. I would say that most of the problems feel as if they were coming from a budget that was cut from under the girl and some bad hack job editing. <br /> <br /> This is not Office Space. Don't expect to expect Office Space levels of comedy. However, it is very fun. It's a mess but very fun at the same time. A fun mess in a movie. That way, Caddyshack is fun. A mess of independent fun scenes filled with some very annoying unfunny scenes. It seems like a whole though, and it certainly deserves a broad release. This is the best comment for the Wal Mart / Starbucks / MTV nation you could hope for. The fact that a film explores the idea that stupid people breed at an alarming rate while the intelligent people are not is great in my book. Not very politically correct, but worth at least some debate.
