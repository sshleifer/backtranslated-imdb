In the veins of Jeepers Creepers and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Monster Man surprisingly well-made - but mindless - little horror. Throw a little buddy comedy, nice and intense scare. It's hard to say that Monster Man is really entertaining. The low budget seems quite obvious, but it has not led to the film's presentation in general and put several large budget war films into shame. Yes, the plot is somewhat generic as possible. Couple of friend Adam (Eric Jungman) and Harley (Justin Urich) are running cross country skiing to interrupt the wedding of a woman Adam has always loved. While Adam is more nerdy, Harley is a self-proclaimed ladies man and very offensive loudmouth. Adding a bonus to the plot, they picked up a sexy hitchhiker, Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Things turn into nightmares when a monster car with frightening facial drives stalking them. When the dead body begins to count, they must endanger the race against the time before their own life. The plot is apparently reminiscent of many previously famous horror films, but Michael Davis as author and director succeeds in keeping the excitement. The scare is built well enough, where characterization is never the best, but pretty okay. The script is also full of comedies that work for the fun moments, and they are quite pleasant rather than annoying and also wait for the twist in the final. It's fun and shocking at the same time, which is pretty entertaining. In conclusion, Monster is surprisingly entertaining. It deserves more attention on the big screen. It shows that big budget doesn't make an effective horror movie, but skill does! Something that the director has shown and deliver.
