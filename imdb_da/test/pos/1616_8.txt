I bought this DVD from Walmart too cheap and thought it would be a typical crap straight-to-video monster junk, but it turned out much better than expected. There is not really any criticism to say about it ... of course it's low budget, but it just adds to the cheesy old-fashioned fun. It is very cool and entertaining. <br /> <br /> There's everything: horror, sex, a big plane crash and good signs. And I'd say it's pretty original, cuz it really doesn't come out like any other movie I've seen. It has its own unique look that I liked a lot, that's why this movie deserves credit. I'm looking forward to seeing some of these amazing movies from "The Scare Master", Brett Piper, which I have never heard before. The DVD menu is really creative with groovy music playing over it, so it's perfect just to keep it on when you're not ready to watch it. It also contains some special features that are very interesting. But we must never see the director or hear him in the comment, must be shy. This is coming out of Edgewood Studios in Vermont, USA. I highly recommend it to any horror buffs you will love!
