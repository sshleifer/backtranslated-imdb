The purchase of four seasons was Rainer Werner Fassbinder's first shot on ordinary acceptance. In a turbulent career in just fifteen years, he managed to create an amazing workgroup in film and theater, both as an artist and creative producer, actor and instructor. Although this movie may not appeal to many viewers, the movie has a lot to offer. The story is pretty straightforward. A man is excluded from his upper middle class family because of emotional and financial problems and is unable to control his downward spiral. The sale of FOUR SEASONS is shot with a Slavic devotion to elegant details, and each set is very carefully designed and constructed. Each object on the set seems carefully arranged to provoke layers of emotional texture. Many religious paintings and icons decorate the walls of the various rooms and seem to speak to His desperate quest for spiritual meaning or direction in his life. Much thought was given to how lighting and color were employed to contrast and enhance the drama. Several times during the film I froze the frame to marvel at the beauty of the shot's composition. I streamed this movie and the print was almost flawless and unparalleled. Fassbinder uses his actors in an almost violent "Anti-Natural" style. He does everything possible to prevent the actors from responding in a normal or coherent manner, and this creates a rather stuttered effect. But by doing so, he almost injects "hyper-reality" into the story. Instead of presenting an everyday melodrama, the actors' almost militant lack of influence prevents the viewer from confronting the film in another way. Fassbinder's film deliberately prevents the viewer from easily connecting with the characters' trials and tribulations. You are constantly on the outside and looking inside. This will be a disturbing experience for many, but I found it a unique and satisfying artistic adventure.
