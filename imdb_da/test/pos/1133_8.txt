I recently stumbled upon this show as the ABC family had a full-day marathon before season 2 prizes. I remember seeing examples of the show back in 2007 and thought it would be short lived and not very well written because it was at ABC Family. <br /> <br /> Never doubt an ABC family show! This show surprised me as much as possible. Not only is the show well written, the story is realistic, fun and fun. I was expecting a lot of talk about relationships, something like "this guy dated the girl who dumped me for that child ... etc." But this show is anything but! The characters are appealing and you really feel a connection between them all. There is a lot of chemistry between the actors and they can really make you feel that things are happening right before your eyes. <br /> <br /> Don't doubt this show, it's really fun to see ... and get hooked on;)
