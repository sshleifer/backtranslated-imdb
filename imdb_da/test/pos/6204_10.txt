I saw the Sleeper Cell with a bit of anxiety to worry about whether the terrorists would be glorified. This fascinating series not only dealt with the subject responsibly, but created depth and substance for almost every character. Oded Fehr just gobbled up the screen in every scene he's in, and although his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell, he still has hypnotic appeal. Michael Ealy kept his own well, although in some scenes I wondered why he wasn't shot on the spot because of the screw he had on his face. <br /> <br /> The pro's of the series are the two leads, Fehr and Ealy, the well-written characters - all of which were credible and tragic, and the disturbing issues that were addressed in history. Having been married to a Muslim himself, the created atmosphere was quite realistic. The downside was for me personally that the female T&A was overkill ?? most seemed free, as well as some of the sex scenes. In spite of this, it is a raw gripping series that makes you think. Someone gives Fehr several juicy roles like this one and let him run with it. He has an incredible screen presence and a strange kind of innate power originating from him.
