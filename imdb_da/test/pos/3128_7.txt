The western can be divided into many subgenres. One of the widest divisions is that between Town Westerns and Plains Westerns. Most Westerners are a mix of both, but at one end of the spectrum you have pictures like High Noon and Rio Bravo, which take place almost exclusively in a settlement that rarely penetrates into the real outdoors. At the other end you have them as the Wagon Master, where there is hardly a courtyard overlooking the desert. Director John Ford usually thrived on "bit of both" Westerns who shot the interior with an emphasis on being small and limited, and then contrasting it with the wide open exterior, which seemed both exciting and dangerous. Wagon Master has a typical Frank Nugent script, with some interaction between experienced old-fashioned and green youth, but it still presents Ford with some fresh challenges. In this picture, the dangers do not come from the country's hardness, they come from the group in the form of Cleggses. Moreover, the absence of real interior scenes means that outdoors could lose its influence over time. <br /> <br /> However, Ford was a real maestro when it came to manipulating the room. He shoots scenes in the camp or carts so the frame is surrounded and we get the same feel of the cabinet as we would in a real interior. In comparison with his other western countries, he does not actually open too much space, as the carriage turns through ravines and passes rather than crossing the clear and empty plains. One of the few moments when he throws the landscape wide open is when the Indians are spotted and there is the possibility of an outside threat. <br /> <br /> The Wagon Master has some surprisingly effective moments of comic relief and some great contributions from the ornate cast. Harry Carey Jr. formed into a fine actor as his father, and it is one of his better early roles. Joanne Dru was disappointing in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, but she seems more calm as a sign with a bit of sass, and is actually pretty good here. Jane Darwell, who won an Oscar in John Ford-directed Wribes of Wrath a decade earlier, appears here with a single function of performing a running gag, where she sounds a weak old horn. Still, with her great timing and movement, she does the job. Francis Ford, in one of the many dumb drunkard roles he played in his little brother's pictures, is at his nicest best. <br /> <br /> And now we are going to lead man Ben Johnson. Although he was not a bad actor at all, he would never be a big star like John Wayne. And yet, he was one of the most authentic "Western" players around with his effortless horse races and unpleasant moves. And that brings me to my last point. This was apparently one of Ford's personal favorites, despite the seemingly modest. Wagon Master has no grand theme or dramatic intensity, it is simply the genre that plays out. I think that's what Ford loved about it. It's a picture for Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr., not John Waynes or Henry Fondas. Small range but worthy of its class.
