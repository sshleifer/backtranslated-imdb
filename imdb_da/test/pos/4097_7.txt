I really loved this movie and have spent years trying to get it. It's just not available, and it hasn't been on television for many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something else to say and made you think about how each person looks at something from different prespectives. We too often do not appreciate anything we have until it is no longer there. My 12 year old daughter just discovers the music and is entranced with some of the songs. Today I hope to get a copy of the movie so she can have the opportunity to see it. (Oh I would love to see it again too!) <br /> <br />
