This Columbo episode is one of the better and perhaps one of my personal favorites. The piece includes Rosemary's Baby John Cassavetes as maestro, his wife played by Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow's mother), and his sister-in-law played by Myrna Loy (one of America's greatest leading actresses in our time film). Anyway, I disagree with anyone criticizing this movie. This episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent cast that does a great job of performing. I love to see Columbo with his beloved dog, which he never names in the series. This time, the episode focuses on classical music at the Hollywood Bowl, one of L.A's attractions. Of course, Columbo is just as interested in classical music as he does everything else that involves a crime.
