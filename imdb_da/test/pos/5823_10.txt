One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after seeing only one oz episode, you will be hooked. They are right, as that is exactly what happened to me. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and incredible scenes of violence, right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a faint heart or destiny show. This show draws no blows to drugs, sex or violence. It's hardcore, in the classic use of the word. <br /> <br /> It's called OZ, as it's the nickname given to Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses primarily on Emerald City, an experimental part of the prison, where all cells have glass fronts and face inward, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many. Arians, Muslims, pedestrians, Latin Americans, Christians, Italians, Irish and more .... so scuffles, death stars, risky deals and shady appointments are never far away. <br /> <br /> I would say that the show's main appeal is because it goes where other shows would not dry. Forget beautiful pictures painted for the general public, forget about the charm, forget about romance ... OZ does not rot around. The first episode I ever saw hit me as so creepy, it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I looked more, I developed a taste for Oz and got used to the high level of graphic violence. Not only violence but injustice (crooked guards who will be sold out for a nickel, inmates who will kill on orders and get away with it, well-behaved, middle-class immigrants become prison bitches because of their lack of street skills or prison experience) When you Seeing Oz, you can become familiar with what is unpleasant to see .... that is, if you can get in touch with your darker side.
