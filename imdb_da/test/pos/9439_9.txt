What is the most violent movie all the time? Rambo III? Commando? Robocop? Add these three very violent together, and you will still not match the bloodshed in The Stabilizer, the wildest, silliest, craziest action movie I've ever seen. For a hundred minutes things are blowing up and people are dying in dozens of strange ways. It will make you laugh and cheer, and when it is over you will be more than a little exhausted. This movie is a buried gem, a cult classic is sadly missing a cult. The stabilizer is the nickname for our hero Peter Goldson (Peter O'Brian), a large oily man with a curly mole. He arrives in Indonesia on the trail of the villains and mean Greg Rainmaker. We know he is evil because he is only mentioned by his full name ("I hate SCUM as Greg RAINmaker!") And uses a method of killing that is so terrible, I can't even say it here. Wait, yes I can. He takes on people in spiky shoes. Greg Rainmaker: Cleat Killer. <br /> <br /> When Greg Rainmaker does not pour alcohol on women for their sexual pleasure, he kidnaps important professors and leads a huge underworld empire. It's up to Goldson (a Jewish action hero? Fell!) And his modley crew of sidekicks to stabilize the situation by killing everyone and blowing up lots of stuff. Perhaps "stabilizing" has a different meaning in Indonesia. <br /> <br /> And the violence, oh violence. This is a movie that is not willing to let five-minute screen shots go without any explosion, gossip, car accident or squib that interrupts the dialogue. Violence is extreme; not graphic and bloody, just really weird. For example, The Stabilizer & Company invades one of Rainmaker's department stores (by driving through a solid concrete wall on a motorcycle, of course). When lying on the balcony, with heavy fire coming from below, Stabilizer makes the only thing he can do. He runs from the balcony into the lighthouse's head, his cover covers it like a basketball. Unfortunately. From the exaggerated love scenes (Both great female characters jump into the bag with the hero's hero, not two minutes after they talk to them alone for the first time) to the poorly duplicated dialogue ("Victor, you talented bastard!") Stabilizer has it all. This is a movie of ages, right up there with Citizen Kane and Gymkata. It is not widely available in the release. If you find it anywhere at any cost, buy it and enjoy the crazy. <br /> <br />
