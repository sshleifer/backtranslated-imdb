Amazing series, one of my few favorites (Miami Vice and the Tour of Duty are the other two, and this series is right up there with them). These guys are not wearing frilly tights - they dress more like woodsmen. Everything about this series draws on realism, artistic license or not. <br /> <br /> It paints a picture of a Europe a little out of pagan understanding, as most of the villagers still have their local deities, and there is Satan worshiping nuns and magic, witches and wizards casting magic. <br /> <br /> But what comes to the fore most is that it's a series of it's time. Instead of the fifties version, which was a regret for centralized government and the McCarthy era persecution, this series was thoroughly founded in the 1980s, Thatcherist's gloom and strong environmentalist. Robin's patron is a naturalist named Hern The Hunter, who often looks at a deer, and is a personification (like this Robin) of The Green Man, an alternative version of Osiris (the Egyptian god of vegetation and resurrection - is interesting to note that in these series Robin In The Hood is not a person, but a concept, when the old one is killed, a new telepathic is called by the Hern - the person can die, but Robin In The Hood will live forever, thus the concept of resurrection). <br /> <br /> The music and score is truly outstanding and performed by the Irish formation, Clannad. When I looked at it, I couldn't help thinking about how _boring_ authentic medieval Anglosaxon folk music would have been. :-) <br /> All this is beautifully shot in Wales' lush forest that passes for The New Forrest. The only downside is that in the first episodes of both series, the actors must overcome their own skepticism and convince themselves that this is really a serious work. Then they come into it and the play is amazing! Michael Praed as the first Robin (the other is played by Sean Connery's son, Jason), makes Judi Trott a beautiful and fragile red-haired Marion, Phil Rose as the portly and really kind heart-free, Tuck, Ray Winstone as the fleeting and beloved Scarlet, Clive Mantle as the giant shepard Little John, Peter Llewellyn Williams as little John's bumpkin friend and colleague Shepard and Mark Ryan as ex-Hashashin / Assassin Nazir - all give good performances. Also good are the regular Bad Guys, Nicholas Grace as the bug-eyed, Scheming Sheriff of Nottingham, and his aristocratic, bumbling sidekick (and Robin's half brother as it turns out) Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne. Really cool is fashion designer Richard O'Brien, as the evil Lord Owen of Clun's (Olliver Cotton) magician Gulnar (he appears close to the end of the first series and later in the second). <br /> <br /> The Tithe Barn in Bradford at Avon stood in front of the Sheriff's Castle. (Look it out at bradfordonavon.co.uk under "Points of Interest".) <br /> <br /> So, if you're not at all in mythology, destroying the Middle Ages, romance, your time at Xena or Hercules - this is the real things, then go out and see it! <br /> <br /> Alex
