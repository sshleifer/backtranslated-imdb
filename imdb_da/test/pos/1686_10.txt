If there are people who don't like this movie, I don't think they are human. This film spreads all emotions and shows many aspects of Judith Light's character. Produced in 1997, this is one of the best movies I've seen and really the movie that Judith Light has stared into making me a big fan of her. This movie, although sometimes you want to rattle your son to trust her so much, is incredibly moving. I cry at the end every time and it takes a lot to do it for me! The reason doesn't have much to do with it, but the play by Judith Light is incredible. She looks beautiful all the time, and in the end you will not have the fate imposed by the courts to happen to her. Overall, a movie is worth for my highest praise! Thank you for doing so and redefining my view of the death penalty. I am eagerly awaiting this movie to come out on DVD or some other media, as Lifetime begins to issue some movies to its customers. Although I do not have high hopes for this one, because this took place almost 9 years ago, which is still hard to believe since this movie is still involved in my head after all this time.
