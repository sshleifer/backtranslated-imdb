Walter Matthau is best remembered for the long series of comedies he did with his straight comedy partner Jack Lemmon from THE FORTUNE COOKIE to ODD COUPLE II. But people tend to forget that at the end of the 1970s he was acting with another partner in two films - a female partner. This was Glenda Jackson, the English double Oscar winner, demonstrating her comic abilities against Matthaus's first in HOUSE CALLS and then in HOPSCOTCH. Matthaus's role was slightly larger in both films because his characters were more central to the plots, but the chain between them was quite good. If you ever want to see two pros demonstrating how sexual intercourse can be fun, see Walter and Glenda as Dr. Charley Nicholson and Ann Atkinson are experimenting to see if two people could have sex on a bed under the two party's old movie code rule each with a leg on the floor! Never has sex been seen from such a clinical and mechanical point of view. Matthaus Charlie has just been a widow before the movie began. He has only had one woman in his life - his wife. So now he is the qualified bachelor. He is also the leading surgeon in the hospital he works out of, but the main surgeon is Dr. Amos Weatherby (Art Carney). Carney is apparently senile (there are moments later in the film showing that he is turning his senility on and off - see the scene where he hits Richard Benjamin's car). Amos is up for re-election (Charlie is his closest competitor to the post - if he wants it). However, Amos manages to convince Charlie to let him keep the job of self-esteem. <br /> <br /> One day Charlie notes Ann in the hospital. She has had a small accident and is resting in bed, but Amos has put her in a cage as appliances (which Charlie's comments have not been used since about 1920). He gets her out of the unit, and soon she searches her. She joins the hospital staff, but she is critical of Charlie's willingness to accommodate Amos, and she is critical of some selfish tendencies she sees among doctors in the hospital. <br /> <br /> Amos bungling causes the death of a wealthy protector in the hospital (Lloyd Gough) who owned a baseball team (his biggest innovation is separate entry cost for double headers). Amos tries to reassure the young widow of the team owner who delivers the praise at the funeral service (the line in the above summary is the perognin of the pearls). But she is still determined to sue (her lawyer Thayer David says the hospital is the most incompetent he has ever seen). So Amos suggests that the Charlie romance widow to satisfy her from the expensive trial. But how does Ann react to this? The movie is very entertaining, and was so successful that, in addition to causing a sequel to Jackson and Matthau, it also led to a television series.
