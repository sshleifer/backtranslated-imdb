I didn't know anything about this movie until I saw it ... my brother actually suggested that I look. Usually, however, his proposal is not much policeman, but I was stuck on something to see, so I saw it. <br /> <br /> Well, to cut a long story short, I give it 10/10. <Br /> <br /> The film centers around two people who meet at the same time at the same venue. One is very much dependent on the institution around him, the other is a rebellion. One does what he likes, the other he has told. <br /> <br /> From the movie's first moments, we quickly see the friendship between the two buildings and see how they rub a bit of each other. It's a remarkable job that manages to tell a good story without twisting by turning, people jumping out of tubs or superheroes will save the day. There is a lot of grin and reality that is not all that can ever go straight - not every golfer can ever be strapped - and this movie shows a lot. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie and are not impressed ..... I would suggest you do not see anything again.
