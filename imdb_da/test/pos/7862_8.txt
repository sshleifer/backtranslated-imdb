It took me years to finally catch this gem of a movie and it was worth the wait. In almost all his films, Clint always plays the hero. Be it completely, anti-hero or devoted entirely. In this movie, he is pure villain and he plays well. <br /> <br /> As a wounded union soldier, he is brought into a Confederate girl school by the students and teachers to heal. Soon after, he begins to seduce the ladies regardless of their age, and some are quite young. He also plays on their jealousies and throws them against each other. In the end, you're never so happy to see Clint die a terrible death. <br /> <br /> That's what makes this movie such a gem. Clint never made any other movie like that, and after watching this movie, he wanted him to. He plays the role of the villain as well, it will make you wonder why he never made more movies like that. It also explains why the movie is not seen very often. Most people don't want to see Clint as the villain, and with Dirty Harry being released shortly after this movie, it's become a hidden gem. If you are Clint Eastwood fan, you owe it yourself to watch this movie. You may not like what you want to see, but you won't soon forget it.
