When I saw this on TV, I was nervous ... what was it if they messed up? Millions of families like mine who live with a brain-injured man, in my case my father would be let down. I saw it with my mother, and we both ended up crying, it was so precise and trapped how the family feels as well as the person who has little brain damage. The actors were all wonderful, and I had no complaints, my Mums told me she had not been able to stop thinking about it. I hope this program made many people aware of how to live with brain damage and how it is for families. Several programs like this have to be made, I was surprised at how good it was and it has really shaken me up emotionally.
