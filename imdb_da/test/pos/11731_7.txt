Sharky's Machine finds Burt Reynolds as a drug politician who, after a failed purchase and bust, was not his fault but got few people killed in it, he finds himself demoted to the Atlanta team. <br /> <br /> The Prestige is hardly as good as the drug battle, but it has its external benefits. One night after a round of working girls, where one of their books falls into their hands, the guys ask for surveillance at Rachel Ward's place. She is an expensive item that serves both infamous mobsters Vittorio Gassman and lawyer candidate Earl Holliman. <br /> <br /> However, their surveillance records a murder, and the rest of the film is Sharky and his new colleagues from Vice trying to solve this prestige case. Although it's a Burt Reynolds movie, and they usually have some humor to them, the comedy is under control as the movie becomes as deadly serious as Dirty Harry. It was actually reported that Clint Eastwood was offered this movie. Look for some good performances by colleagues Bernie Casey and Brian Keith and by Henry Silva, the smothered brother of Gassman, who do the dirty work of the organization and love his job. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, a mix of Dirty Harry and Laura. Why Laura? You should see the Sharky's Machine for that answer.
