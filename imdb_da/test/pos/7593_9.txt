I am very surprised that so many people do not like this movie. I think it's much better than most teenage movies that have come out recently - Ten things I hate about you (can we say teeny bopper movies and what was there about the principle of writing these porn novels?), Terrible intentions ( where a sign gives up their virginity because of a fun car ride) and she is all that (mediocre). If you're looking for something that is just fun - I say go with never been kissed. My mother loved it and she hates movies (one of her favorites is BEACHES). This is a fantastic fantasy about what you would do differently if you could go back to high school. People who were sold out at high school will probably like this movie better. It reminds me of 'Romy and Michele's High School Reunion'. And the end puts me in the best mood. Sure the plot has been made, but how many newer movies can you honestly say has not been done in one form or another. Cast is also charming. And for those who think that Drew can't be geek, she pulls it just as well. Another good teenage comedy I recommend recently made is CHOICE, but it's more of a satire in school and politics.
