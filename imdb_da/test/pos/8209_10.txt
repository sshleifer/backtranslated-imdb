I loved this movie! Films and games fulfill their purpose when they expose social, political and other issues that affect the majority. This movie served that purpose. <br /> <br /> I identify with the plot and know the people to whom this has happened. At the time this movie was made, concepts presented in this flick were promoted to the public, but had already happened to my friends through people in strong positions. And I know what it is when people make you what they did to Angela Bennett because they did it to me. I very much enjoyed Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Angela Bennett / Ruth Marx. She portrays a beautiful, intelligent and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid giving up on overwhelming odds, fighting hard to keep her hygiene and restoring her life and trying to protect those she loves. Losing one's self-concept and yielding to the age-old attempt to strengthen a weak self-esteem by decaying sex with a stranger added an exciting touch of reality. Plot's climax reveals the only real solution to this kind of problem.
