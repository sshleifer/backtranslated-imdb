If you enjoy puzzles and excitement, you will enjoy this movie. The truth is being told that it was mostly Adrian Paul's part that made me download it, I knew almost nothing about the movie in advance. Plot is: Sarah (Carly Pope), a student of philosophy and metaphysics, begins to play a mysterious puzzle game that tries to figure out the "cause" and becomes involved in the "game" by solving puzzles. Vern (Adrian Paul) is a shop owner, also a puzzle fanatic, and is also anchored in the game. Myth has it that if you solve the game, the meaning of existence (called "Design") is revealed. Brendan Fehr's character is a "village idiot" type hanging around the store that turns out to be more than he thinks. All in all, I thought the movie was pretty well done. And it is definitely an original concept, a rare find these days! I personally happen to like puzzles and puns, so while most of them were not very difficult, it was still a fun movie. Worth renting. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it - get it! :-D <br /> <br />
