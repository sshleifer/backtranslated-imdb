These immortal lines begin The Jack Starret-regimented masterpiece, 'The Dion Brothers'. The plot is centered around two blue collar West Virginian brothers (Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest) who commit robberies hoping to spend the money to open a seafood restaurant !!? The following is quite an adventure and many comic events follow. The action scenes are top notch and consist of some nicely realized shootouts. The latter is absolutely fantastic and arises in an abandoned building demolished by a devastating ball! The film was written by the current famous director Terrence Malick and has an early appearance by Margot Kidder. All in all, an excellent hidden gem of the 70s and easily one of the finest action / comedy hybrids each made. Hopefully it will get a decent widescreen DVD release soon.
