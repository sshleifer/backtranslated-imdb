"Murder by Numbers" stars Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt as two rebellious high school students who are happy with the perfect murder to overcome their broken self-esteem. Sandra Bullock plays the heroic tower in the way of their plans like that. Cassie Mayweather. This is not far from the traditional pointing killing mystery, as the film graciously displays the killer to us (Gosling and Pitt). What the film does instead is focused on the purpose of their killing and if they have what it takes to commit the perfect murder. <br /> <br /> The title itself is a legitimately chosen for various reasons, mainly that "Numbers" in the title is the most vocal. The angle focuses on the causes of the hideous killings, although you will haunt yourself with its chilling dialogue (especially from the ringed boys), it does not live up to the origin of what leads them to their killing madness. The characters are giddy, you have the great Rich Kid Richard (Ryan Gosling) and the intelligent but socially awkward Justin (Michael Pitt). In school, they pretend to despise each other and even share a taste for a classmate, Lisa (Agnes Bruckner), but off-school are the allies and collaborate in a ritual where murder is an escape to release the mind. <br /> <br /> It is certain that the story involving the boys seems exciting, but it is pushed into the background of a more earthly subplot involving it. Mayweather (Bullock), who assumes their murder, was due to discrimination (hence Gosling's arrogant appearance) and inexplicable properties, but managed to get it right. Initially, the audience may despise Cassie's character because she is very arrogant and not very supportive. She shows dominance and control over her junior partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). Even when he tries to save her, he knows it's a fight he probably won't win. <br /> <br /> The reason for her tyrannical behavior dates back to where Cassie was the sad victim of a crime that left a permanent mental scar on her. This side story doesn't have much space in this movie, secondly because it doesn't make anything easier with the main plot (the boy's murder spree). It also gives some development to Bullock's character in the film, but it is only a half-employed job and not very satisfactory. I would have liked it if the devilish students had a side story. The resources were right in front of them for the perfect crime film, the creative schemes for the boys to manipulate the police with their false evidence and are just to get out of a potential life sentence in prison. <br /> <br /> In spite of the skewed subplots and the meaningless "real killer", "Murder of Numbers" ends a strong performance of a great cast. Sandra Bullock was convincing as the hard oral relentless policeman trying to shift his inner pain into a more positive light. Ben Chaplin demonstrates his strength as the young detective who seeks to understand his partner and is able to avert his sporadic tyrannical blows. But the stage speaker is the devilish duo by Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling, as they keep you glued to their seat and wait for what to do next. The boy's chemistry is reminiscent of Matt Damon-Jude Law in "The Talented Mr. Ripley".
