Pretty decent for his early work and no Kokaku Kidotai without it, and gets a 2 point extra for Easter eggs. For Shirow, it is definitely a rung in the ladder. I was biased like a Shirow fan, but it was a big step from Dirty Pair, which was what I knew about him. Violent fun with a porn soundtrack! You can't help but notice it. I know people appreciate him for Ghost in Shell. But all the deep spiritual overtones were dealt with in Appleseed. ESWAT kills terrorists, the fight for people to remain viable as bioroids phase them out, and Deunan remains thin despite her intake of junk food. Absolutely like the characters themselves traitor .. and I don't know why.
