The chemistry between Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy was incredible. They were thoroughly convincing and genuinely sympathetic in their roles. Imelda Staunton played the insidious wife Sucksby brilliantly. Despite the fact that she was a dastardly opportunist, somehow she managed to make you sympathize with her in the end. Rupert Evans played slime-ball gentleman with pure charm and snark. He was a scene stealing. The story itself was very unique, as it was told. The Victorian English setting with two lesbian protagonists was exciting and lovely. There were some amazing and unexpected phrases that really kept the audience engaged in history. A wonderful cast and excellent story made this movie fantastic.
