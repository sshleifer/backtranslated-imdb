Hal Hartley has been compared to a modern William Shakespeare by the fact that he gets his actors to deliver their lines in an iambic pentameter. He certainly knows how to collect a throw, and again Martin Donovan is sensational, while Thomas Jay Ryan plays his role with an intensity that is unforgettable. Although the movie is only 1 hour, the time frame works wonderfully and keeps the audience running fast until the end. Without a doubt, Hal Hartley is one of the best directors to get out of America over the last 20 years with a vision that is unique, fun and warm warming.
