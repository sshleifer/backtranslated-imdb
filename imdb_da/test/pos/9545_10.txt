Long trailer? Anyone who said it should be fun. This has to be one of the most profound behind the scenes or documentation ever made. how can it be a trailer when several minutes are used to tell the audience how the film was conceptualized and then brought to the studios? This documentary also uses plenty of time and describes how stunts were made and the new technologies created to reach them. Then it shows us how wooing's teams came up with the battle scenes along with blocking tapes that are basically ashamed of the actual scenes with the actors. There are things mentioned about matrix reloaded, but there is hardly anything real. If you are a real fan of the matrix, see this documentary. the original documentary in the DVD is good but incomplete in relation to this. for example, it never explained why keanu had a necklace in the original documentary, but it is explained in Revisited.
