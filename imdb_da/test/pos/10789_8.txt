Probably one of his lesser-known films, it suffers from the same lack of exposure as Salvador, as it is actually one of his best. Written by and starring Eric Bogosian tells the Talk Radio story of an opinionated radio telephone host that interferes with the wrong kind of listening. The movie is important and has a lot to say about the issues of freedom of speech and just how free it should be, and you can easily tell that it started life as a stage game. Know what you come in before you sit down to see it and you become good. There is not much to the actor when Bogosian virtually steals the movie, he wrote and was granted rant, I could not take his eyes off him and it was part of the fascination many of the listeners had; The people who hated him would not turn off if they missed something. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone but a very good drama and generally a very good movie.
