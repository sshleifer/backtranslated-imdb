Chucky is back, but this time he's not scary (much) - but he's fun! <br /> <br /> When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer sweet girlfriend, Tiffany, he immediately kills her and turns her into a doll. Tiffany and Chucky are now at 2 high school graduates - oak !! <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie - it's a lot of fun. It's scary, funny, weird, crooked and stupid all in one! <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10.
