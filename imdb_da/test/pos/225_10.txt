I saw this series after watching the Naked Gun movies. I found it much better than the movies and I thought the movies were good! This series literally puts you in the TV set in anticipation of the next proverb, vision or fun situation (all night time, club flamingos). I don't think I've ever laughed hard at a TV show in my life, even after watching the movies first and knowing some of the jokes. I think it's a pity that only six episodes were produced, but I agree that the authors would be very hard pressed to maintain this level of comedy for several episodes. Generally, the series is a must see for those who like puns, bad jokes and slapstick sight-gags.
