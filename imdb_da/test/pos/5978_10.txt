When I have just seen this, I find it hard to believe that it is not better known. This and the slightly better known, but almost shamefully neglected COM AND SE (Klimov, 1986) must be two of the greatest war films. They are meaningful, powerful, sharp. The ASCENT is also endowed with a sparingly used but excellent trenchant score by Schnittke.
