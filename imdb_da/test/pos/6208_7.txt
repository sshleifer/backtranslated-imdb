A precursor to "Citizen Kane" in his analysis of the life of a net-dead tycoon, reviewed by his faithful secretary in a series of interlocking flashbacks. In Spencer Tracy's 15th film, he already sees the Middle Ages himself in the scenes where he is supposed to be young! A small silent sound model is understandable considering vintage, but it is a funniest, well-written drama.
