An amazing, quick scrub-like cartoon / drama / farce set against France's 1939 implosion. The game of broad-banded, straight-faced intensity of a talented cast and shock block with action, satire, social comments and authentic details from smooth brilliant-cut hairstyles and marvelous hairdos to a fleet of Citroen Tractions, a rollicking soundtrack and short but credible imitations of Charles de Gaulle and Marshal Petain. <br /> <br /> It is simply some of the best entertainment recently shown on the screen, without presumption and "message". If movies were train (and there is a creative recreation of a trip on a steam-powered train that works despite there being no steam locomotive - an expensive prop, without a doubt) it would be a TGV.
