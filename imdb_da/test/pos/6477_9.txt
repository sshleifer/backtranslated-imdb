It is difficult to imagine today and age how popular and how much of an influence a Norwegian immigrant and chemist had on the American public, and how much of a national tragedy his sudden death in 1931 was seen. But Knute Rockne was an extraordinary individual who both revolutionized and popularized college football and put a small unclear Catholic college on the map. <br /> <br /> I've heard clips of Rockne's famous pep lecture, and it's scary how Pat O "Brien made the voice and the bend perfect. In what turned out to be his career role, Pat O" captures Brien the integrity and fighting spirit that was Rockne, Rockne helped by Gale Page like Bonnie Stiles Rockne, who complained that her home was a training camp for Notre Dame, but never threw anyone out of her house. as a player with Notre Dame not a trainer A fine day in the second half of a lost soccer match against highly favored army, Rockne and teammates Gus Dorais, who played by Owen Davis, used passports as an offensive weapon, before football was simply a games where you just got bigger guys to your side and ran through the defense. Rockne did not invent the forward pass but he popularized and football became a strategy game as well as brawn after that. <br /> <br /> Rockne also knew how to work The media, these well-known pep-tales about his was not just to inspire his players. They were well published, and it was very much because of him that college football became a great sport in the golden age of sports in the roaring twenties. <br /> <br /> Playing a small but key role is Ronald Reagan. As George Gipp coached the first player Rockne to achieve greatness, but Reagan not only got a good performance but forever after a name that was practical in his subsequent political career. The death philosophy that Rockne swore was accurate, became a Republican war of war, where many a GOP underdog went out to win one for Gipper. I still remember a widespread photograph in 1981, which was one of the first to reclaim President Ronald Reagan at the Notre Dame exam with his old friend Pat O'Brien. Reagan always credited O'Brien and Dick Powell with all Warner Brothers stars during the period as those who were the best and most encouraging of a young player at the party trying to do good. <br /> <br /> Notre Dame himself owes his prestige to the rocks. It is quite possible that Notre Dame would be a fuzzy little Catholic college without the reputation of football. <br /> <br /> Although George Gipp and the later famous backfield of the four horsemen probably had their place in the sun, the rocks had reputation. It is no coincidence that Warner Brothers was able to get Amos Alonzo Stagg, Glenn 'Pop' Warner, Howard Jones and William Spaulding, Rocknes contemporaries and coaches with great publicity in their own right to perform in Knute Rockne, All American . That was the way to honor the guy who was number one in their profession. I think more than football fans will enjoy Knute Rockne, All American. Even if you might be one after watching the movie.
