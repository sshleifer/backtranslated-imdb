This light-heated (to Cassavete's) love story is pleasantly portrayed by two wonderful performances by Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassell. Rowlands was never more beautiful than a repressed, fifty woman who met her fight in Seymour. Cassell is a pulse of energy and romantic beliefs (on his terms). <br /> <br /> There is a great supporting performance of Val Avery as Zelmo Swift and an unusual (as always) Timothy Carey, worth the price of admission. Made Between Man and Woman Under the influence, this is Cass's most accessible movie that should touch the heart of anyone (especially Cassavete's haters) who claim that his film is too long and heavy at times. Made my top ten that year and not seen by enough people. An 8 out of 10.
