Well, let me put it that way - I've always been one of the "hardcore brothers"; I have always loved rock music, and especially heavy metal !! Therefore, this movie is a gift from God! I think this movie is one of the best movies ever (well apart from Neverending Story and Star Wars, of course ...). It's great to hear all the classics like "Long live rock and roll" (DIO), "Stranglehold (Ted Nugent), songs by Jon Bon Jovie, Deep Purple, AC / DC, Zakk Wylde and several other legendary rock bands." FANTASTIC !!! I hope they will make more movies like this (otherwise it's just crap movie, "AC in da USA" or what they call it and "8 miles". Bulls ***!) I recommend it anyway, all I'm missing is a few Stratovarius songs! But apart from that, it's one of the best movies ever! Ten out of ten!
