He was raised to be that way. <br /> <br /> Then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his faith, Pastor Lekota. Will he change his ways? The film is a powerful film that shows the perceptions that the different races had for each other, it shows these beliefs with great accuracy. The film shows the world of how apartheid hit the psyche of black and white. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that everyone should see.
