The Canadian filmmaker Ron Switzer delivers a solid, uninterrupted thrill of relentless horror with the stunning 1991 sci-fi movie "Science Crazed". A fierce monster takes revenge on its mother, a police officer and tenants in an apartment building. Brilliant practical makeup and special designs create a truly frightening monster, especially when they cheat through the atmospheric shadows and smoke of the gloomy apartment configurations. The characters have been developed beautifully with excellent and surprising touches from an ensemble cast. Produced by Donna Switzer, novice Ron Switzer also wrote the movie's stylish script, which woven together an engaging roller coaster of twists, turns and terror that keeps you guessing for the last frame. Science Crazed will undoubtedly leave you haunted long after the shocking conclusion. Highly recommended!
