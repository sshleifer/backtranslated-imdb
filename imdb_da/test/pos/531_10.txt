I just came back from watching this amazing movie !! I can relate to it so much ... It reminded me when my sister had to go to college, we had to move from place to place, and my mother seems like Adele August! Boys don't like this movie as it brings tears to their eyes. One of the best real movies I've ever seen !! and Natalie Portman rules !! 10.10
