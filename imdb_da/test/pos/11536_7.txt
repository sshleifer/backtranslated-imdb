Jennifer Egan's novel was brought to the screen by Canadian director Adam Brooks in a film that, based on some comments from contributors to this forum, is a bad proposal, but it is actually much better than you think. <Br /> <br /> This is a story of two sisters who loved each other deeply. Faith, the righteous and happy hippie girl, takes her younger siblings, Phoebe, under her wing. Phoebe clearly loves the belief; When the elder decides to follow her girlfriend Wolf to Europe on a summer vacation from Berkley, she promises to send Phoebe a postcard every day. Faith does so until the cards stop coming in and one night, some time later, the family receives a phone call to inform them. Faith is dead under tragic conditions. <br /> <br /> Phoebe can't forget the faith. Therefore, after some years she decides to take the same path as the older sister took. She takes the cards from Faith and visits every place starting in Amsterdam and then on to Paris, and she wants to end the trip in Portugal, where Faith encountered her incredible death. In Paris, Phoebe chops with Wolf, who is now not a hippie and lives with his girlfriend. Wolf tries to persuade Phoebe to abandon his trip and to go home; She suspects that Wolf has the key to solving the mystery, and when she goes to Portugal, she finds a discovery when she finds a picture that clearly contradicts Wolf's version he has told Phoebe. He feels guilty and against his girlfriend wants to accompany Phoebe to the city where faith died. History is changing at this time, and we go back in flashbacks to what beliefs experienced in Europe and what happened in her last days. The best thing in "The Invisible Circus" is the performance of those responsible, something that Mr. Brooks must take credit. The big surprise is Cameron Diaz's assortment, which, by faith, seems to be choosing lightweight comedy parts when she can quite well do dramatic work under the right instructor. Jordana Brewster is seen as the older Phoebe and makes a wonderful contribution to the movie. She is a wonderful beauty with what seems to be a naturalness to act. Christopher Eccleston is Wolf and shows that he is also able to do more serious drama. The cute Camilla Belle plays the younger Phoebe completely convincingly. Blythe Danner appears as the girls' mother. <br /> <br /> European places are brilliantly photographed by Henry Braham. The film is also enhanced by the musical score of Nick Laird-Clowe's and Petra Hat's original song. Elizabeth Kling edited with great elegance. In the end, this movie shows Adam Brooks in good shape, giving the right tone to the novel's adaptation and gaining rewards by having the right casting that does wonders for him.
