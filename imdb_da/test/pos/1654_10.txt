The ultimate gritty heist movie. Elements of Bogie, Welles & Sinatra will leave you sweaty and satisfied. In comparison, it really disturbs the sensible appeal cart to watch the latest movies, such as "Ocean's Eleven (remake)" reviewed so much - especially in Europe. Films like Rififi should be shown, spoken and kept alive to remind younger (pathetic) critics of what true classic Noir is. Criterion should be praised in their flawless and classic transfer.
