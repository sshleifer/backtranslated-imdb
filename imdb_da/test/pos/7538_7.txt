For those of you who are not familiar with Alisdair Sims, he is of course the final scrooge of all the Christmas Carol movies. (Me? I think I'm really bad. In fact, I haven't seen darn things). I guess those who have seen Christmas Carol and so accustomed to his character can find The Bells of St. Trinians quite surprising. You see, in this movie, Sims has two roles. One of them plays much better, and in the second he is the main champion of a private girl's school! So when you get it through your thick skull, this movie offers lots of delights. The reason is about how the school tries to make some desperately needed money through a horse race. It is actually a little more complicated for the young children to handle, but I think they would be preoccupied with their antics and with the horses really feeling. Also, the adults can be tripped over all the thick accents thrown around as well. But again, the story is fair light, the action crazy and frantic, because you really can feel. PS, the kids all look like they come from Eloise School of Cuteness.
