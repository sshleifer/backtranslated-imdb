The movie was very good when it came out, I attended Cooley High and Cooley High School Center, around 1968 I was also away from home queen and grew up and lived in the Cabrini Green area, I knew many people in the movie, it was great to see friends in the movie who lived in the area too and they had a chance to be a star who might have been a lifetime experience for them, i had good times growing up on the north and hard times i can relate to the movie Cooley High no longer stands, but a person like myself and others still remember the fun we had grown up to attend Cooley High, there is a lot of history around this northern side area to be told.
