An incomplete descent into psychological and physical oblivion that undoubtedly burns images of the truthful brutality and war suffering in your cerebral cortex in a way that not many other films will. In fact, there is simply no other war movie like that. <br /> <br /> Director Kon Ichikawa saw the unimaginable horror of Hiroshima's first hand just 10 days after the bomb had fallen. He has said that from that day on, it would always be his mission to express the meaningless, empty violence that people inflict on each other and themselves. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ichikawa shows us that there are no winners in war ... for paths to victory and defeat are paved with the same soldiers who funnyly march down roads that only have death and destruction at their end. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ichikawa succeeds in bringing his message to the world through this joking piece of cinema.
