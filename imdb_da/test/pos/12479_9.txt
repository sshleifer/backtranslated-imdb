Great artists always suffer while they were young. I could mention Mozart and Beethoven, but it's not the intention. <br /> <br /> This movie was made by HG Clouzot whose family wanted him to succeed in Law professions. <br/> <br /> The most important star is Louis Jouvet, who studied and practiced as a pharmacy before becoming "The Greatest Actor" and also director of France's theater before and after World War II. <br /> <br /> They both had health issues. Clouzot had TB while young, Jouvet had heart problems and died in a theater. <br /> <br /> Such events form the character of men (and of course of course). One can even say that today's artists are so poor because they have never suffered and struggled for their lives. For me, this is the biggest of Clouzot's films. "Fear of fear" is greater in "excitement", "Diabolique" also has more "excitement" and a better plot and is more about "female evil". <br /> <br /> Quai des Orf√®vres is more human. The Clouzot was mistakenly accused by De Gaulle's supporter (mostly communists and Jews) of working with the Nazis and banning filming until De Gaulle left the French government in early 1946. De Gaulle returned in 1958 as president. <br /> <The main characters are all good souls: Jenny L'Amour can perform as a "putain" on stage, but she is not a "whore" (dictionaries make synonyms of these words, but they are not the same), love her husband, and denies the small "progress of her (presumably lesbian) friend Dora, the photographer. <br /> <br /> Maurice man is jealous and busy but runs away from the crime scene. He is a prison because he fell in love in a woman and acted an ultimately more upscale career for love. <br /> <br /> Antoine, detective (interpreted by the great Louis Jouvet, who is basically a stage actor, performs in this French "Gray" no Noir, and EG Robinson in "Double Indemnity") shows the flair for pseudo-criminals, tenderness for a nephew (?) and compassion for the true author of the crime, because he remembers that father has cleaned the latrines of some noblemen's castles! Clouzot was able to hit an actor face in order to put him in them n true thinking, but deep inside he was very human. <br /> <br /> I have his horoscope in front of me. He had Venus in the Sagittarius, which means frankness, devotion, charity, and altruism. For those who do not believe in astrology, my sincere apologies are ...
