I love this show! It's amazing ... I can never miss an episode even though I've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the portions ...... i love Gilmore girls! I've got all my friends to see it. Even their parents see it now. I see it daily and I usually see it more than once a day. I wish my mother was like Lorelei. My friends say I speak and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. It's a great teen show because they actually learn to see it. my vocabulary has expanded from watching Gilmore Girls. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bled El are perfect for parts of Lorelei and Rory. I think Luke and Lorelai should marry because Chris has left Lorelei and Rory too many times. and has also broken Lorelei's heart too many times.
