The brilliance of this film is not in the film-making process, which is a conventional but accomplished, interwoven narrative of the lies of three soldiers after WWII, but in the fact that this story was told at all. Samuel Goldwyn deserves credit for having the chutzpah push through a movie that, for its driver, has a handicapped veterinarian with pincer for hands, alcoholics, and subordinates.
