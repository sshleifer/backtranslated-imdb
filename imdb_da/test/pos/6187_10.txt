For some perverse reasons, best known for themselves, these IMDb boards seem to be reluctant to credit the great Billy Wilder as co-scriptwriter of at least two (this and Ninotchka) from his early classics when any buff can discover Wilder hand in the workplace. As it happened, it represented the first time he was with Charles Brackett (who gets credit) and it was a good start. A commentator has noticed how satisfying it is to watch these types of movies in old-fashioned cinemas, and I couldn't agree. In Paris, one of the smaller Revival houses in one of its halls shows a more or less continuous Lubitsch retrospective, and I am happy to report that this played to a much appreciated audience across the age spectrum, even though I doubting if anyone actually lived It was first released in 1938. The famous Wilder Schtick, the sweet sweet, is particularly tasty here when the millionaire, but cautious with Cooper tries to buy a half-set pajamas in a department store on the Riviera and meets sales resistance until Claudette Colbert turns up and tries to buy the other half. The gag milk is milked even more when you have exhausted the chain of command in the store itself, the leader directs a call to the owner who is lying in bed and leaves it to reveal that he also carries the top half of the pajamas. The film is full of sight-gags like this balanced with verbal white, making it almost perfect. Claudette Colbert is only wonderful and gets great support from Edward Everett Horton as his poor titled father. David Niven in fourth billing has some fun "dealings" like Franklin Pangborn and if Gary Cooper is not up to his role lacking as he does the verbal dexterity and sophisticated persona that Wilder scripts required at this stage of his career well, you can I have everything and what you have is darned near perfect.
