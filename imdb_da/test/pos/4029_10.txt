Always had "DOA", 1950, as star Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this movie. Dennis Quaid (Dexter Cornell) was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out that she had an affair with one of her students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan (Sydney Fuller), who was a college-class student while having a great love for him and having a night stand and in some ways deeply loved him. Dexter learns that he has received a drink that had poor content and would give him a lot of health problems! If you like Dennis Quaid and love Meg Ryan, you will enjoy watching this movie, Meg gave an excellent performance and well worth seeing!
