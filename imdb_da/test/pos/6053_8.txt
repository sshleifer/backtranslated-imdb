I served as the Corpsman on Parris Island in the late 60's, just over 10 years after "The D. I." got shot. I was in some of the barracks where they filmed some of the indoor scenes. I knew many drill instructors and many recruits. I think the film is as close as any movie showing the life of a recruitment and a drill instructor. No doubt I think it's the best Jack Webb ever did. If you've been in the military, you should watch this movie. That's how it was. It shows how important it is to take a lot of raw recruits and make them men ready to defend our country. One feature I found fascinating is that most characters are played by true marines, not actors.
