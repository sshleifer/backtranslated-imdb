Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, which is evident in his film. Forget the black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it's not Samuel L. Jackson at Christina Ricci. More importantly, this film is about the values ​​and culture of the people of this Tennessee city. How they handle divorce, surrender, sexual abuse and mental illness. While the shrinkers make millions in cities in the North, the Midwest and the West Coast, the city minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes a counselor and mediator. It is an interesting concept and one that may not fit well at all. <br /> <br /> Brewery shows us the region he grew up in. Yes, it is still occupied with racial problems, although there are poorer issues in many cities. This is in the subtitle and not the main plot of history. People live a simpler lifestyle, but life is still complex and scary. Jackson and Ricci do a great job in this movie. Jackson, the aging former blues guitarist who trains his little farm. His 12-year-old wife leaves him for his brother so he spirals into depression. Meanwhile, Ricci and Justin Timberlake have a last wild sexually charged night before sending out to the army. Ricci suffers from a childhood with sexual abuse, although it is not revealed until later, her torment can only be struck by sexual forays with different boys (black and white) in the city. <br /> <br /> When Ricci is fired and went to death on the road near Jackson's farm, he finds her and nurses back to health. He believes it is divine intervention that this half-naked white girl is left in her care. He connects his Bible and asks for guidance. He refuses her sexual progress and instead treats her with dignity, respect and care. Something few men in their lives have ever done. <br /> <br /> Over time, Jackson sees him as a man of honor and morality, but he also carries his own pain. He plays his guitar and sings to her. Yes, it is Blues and also good. As the minister advises her, she slowly understands how to deal with her sexual abuse of childhood. Jackson, through Ricci's transformation, realizes that he must cure his own pain. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake returns, discharged due to "anxiety problems". Looking for Ricci, who has lived with Jackson during her recovery, he finds out that she has been promiscuous and unfaithful to him. <br /> <br /> He finds her and Jackson in a bar where Jackson has decided (as part of his healing process) to get out of retirement and play Blues again. Timberlake follows them home and confronts Jackson and Ricci. <br /> <br /> You'll have to watch the movie to get the rest of the story. Should you decide to watch this movie, be sure to look at it from the aspect of a foreign or independent film. It's a piece of life, from a particular region of America that few of us see. It's interesting and revealing. It also shows us that, regardless of the color of the skin, we all have similar problems that can be solved with similar solutions.
