At first I did not think that the performance of Lauren Ambrose was anything but flaky, but as she characterized the depiction, it became more sensible. Amy Madigan seemed too close to her role and didn't really put together her daughter's characters, although it was obvious that her character was decoupled with the character Lauren Ambrose played. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd is a hit as usual and averted his role in encouraging history. His character development left the audience wondering why he was chastised by the younger characters and could have been achieved more directly with <br /> <br /> The overwhelming glue for this somewhat vague storyline was played by Taylor Roberts. Her comprehensive delivery of a simplified character kept the film together. In this central role, Taylor could encourage a realistic family relationship between the characters while acting as the antagonist of all the other relationships in the film.
