I loved "Flash Gordon" as a child and watching the series again on DVD brings back so good memories. Every 15-minute episode, the adventure presents to our hero Flash, the lovely Dale Arden and the pristine Dr. Zarkov on the planet Mongo, with Flash escaping death at every turn: Shark But almost drown him, he is facing the fire monster in the Tunnel of Terror, and he is in deadly danger in the static space! <br /> <br /> The characters are still fun: Buster Crabbe is the only blonde dream boat hero and Jean Rogers is a delicate and beautiful Dale Arden. Princess Aura still stands to steal Flash for herself, King Vultan of the Hawk But still has her booming grin and English wings, and Ming's implacability, emperor of the universe, still gives all the evil eye and the creeps. <br /> <br /> This series would probably not interest children today with its hokey effects - oh, that spaceship! - But it's a fun little nostalgia for those who liked it the first time. The actors play it right and do not play down to children. I appreciate that young viewers were expected to read the synopses chapter, which had rather large words in them. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it came out on DVD. Reviewing this classic sci-fi series is a lot of fun.
