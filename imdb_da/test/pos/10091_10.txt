I have to say I'm an avid horror movie fan, and at the moment I can't get enough of foreign horror. As American horror really depends too much on gore. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing. This movie reminded me a lot of M. Night's SIXTH SENSE. The movie was directed was great. The director took his time to set everything up. It took about a good 40 minutes just to put the movie up in a horror movie. I thought the movie was a drama. This movie just builds up and the pay is not too much. <br /> <br /> I've never done that before, but that's the main reason I liked the movie .... I actually screamed loudly because a scene just scolded hell out of me ... which is a little pathetic .... but for a movie to do so, it's great.
