Patricia Arquette plays American physician Laura Bowman, who takes a vacation to Burma in an attempt to cure her spirit after the murder of her husband and young son. She is left in Rangoon during a military breakdown and leaves the city with an aging man working as a "tour guide". But he is no simple tour guide; He is a professor who introduces her to life outside the tourist traps. The two are trapped in the political upheaval, and Laura sees with her own eyes how the government confuses and represses its own people. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites because of its themes. First, it is informative (describes some of the injustices that occur in Burma). Second, it's about a woman's struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss. Third, it is about compassion and sacrifice, and people come together - without knowing each other - to endure pain and fear. Just about all beautiful scenes in this movie are important; nothing is wasted here. It's a serious and moving movie. There is also a very emotional score composed by Hans Zimmer, which complements scenes nicely. <br /> <br /> A specific recommendation, especially for people affected by human rights ... and people who want to know, "What purpose can I earn?" <br /> <br />
