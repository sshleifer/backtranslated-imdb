The Merchant of Venice 8/10 <br /> <br /> (This review requires a basic knowledge of the story, and it may be like containing spoilers to anyone not familiar with the plot.) <br /> <br /> As a movie version of the famous Shakespeare game, the vendor of Venice, which few adjustments have happened since Policchi's pretty ugly Macbeth: it takes the spirit of the game and brings it out, not just as well as but better than the play alone could easily achieve. <br /> <br /> The rings director, Peter Jackson, has argued that adapting a book or a game has three options: trying to replicate the original as perfectly as possible, using the original idea as inspiration, but tag full license for movie change or (he prefers preferentially) adheres to the original, as far as cinematic ally is viable, but makes such changes as are necessary for the film and at the same time remains true to the intention or spirit of the origin. /> <br /> In Macbeth, Polanski used the rainy beaches and realistic rapes and killings to convey what a bloody and horrible period the toy was put into, thus remembering the horrible context in which the characters make such malicious decisions. It differs from (say) Branagh's Hamlet, who achieved new heights of faithful reproduction, but otherwise offered a little new. Macbeth, on the other hand, allowed the audience fresh to Shakespeare to appreciate some of the drama's fullness without extensive investigation; Similarly, the more familiar audience can find a greater depth than the unfinished stage performance could achieve. Such interpretation plays an important role if the audience is to fully engage, not only intellectually but also emotionally, with the points that Shakespeare would do. <br /> <br /> Radford's adaptation of the Merchant of Venice does just that. It takes decisive moral dilemmas involving religious bigotri or they keep promises, and with minimal brass of the sacred tome of Bard, they faithfully transmit them in the original story. The first of these religious bigotry makes sense to Shylock's otherwise incredible behavior. We see the Jews of the period banished to a walled ghetto, only allowed out if wearing an identifying red hat. Not being allowed to own property, one of the few ways they can make money, is by lending money. This makes them both useful for their Christian repressors and at the same time their object of will. The idea behind (both Old and New Testament) biblical prohibitions of wealth probably comes from not making money by helping his friends. This is being exacerbated by the advocated Christians to curse those they spit on (we see that Shylock not only spits on, but other Jews throw in the streams for sport - in an atmosphere that can only be described as threatening). <br /> <br /> The timeliness of the movie is curious as the right-wing Christianity (as personalized by the Bush after the Americans) has become full circle as they are now Zionism's main supporters and the Jewish political leaders contribute to their Palestinian neighbors, whom Shylock is trying to bid on Antonio (when he thinks the law gives him the power to do so). Psychology is of course - save a dog repeatedly, and it becomes malicious. The circle continues lightly, as victims of repression themselves lose their sense of moral values ​​and become oppressors. <br /> <br /> The rigorous handshake used by the disguised Portia to save Antonio has some merit, both as a clever interpretation of the unsophisticated law, which the Venetians in the play saw as well as a moral point. Shylock must "have his pound of meat" according to his contract, but must not have any blood. An easy analogy can be made as far as warfare and terrorism go - it is much easier to justify fighting among soldiers or to attack illegally if soldiers or evildoers are the only victims - when there is massive security damage that reaches innocent citizens, including women and children, being killed in their hundreds, warmongers' arguments (whether Israeli, Palestinian or American American) have much less popular support. <br /> <br /> There has long been much argument about Shakespeare's anti-Semitic in this story. One wonders if he had to adapt to a largely Christian audience who had little to do with Jewish people. Far from teaching him a greater good, enforcing the end Christianity and humility at Shylock - a course that is likely to continue to be exalted. Both camps look just as bad - you simply have more power than the other. The easy improvement of the judgment simply gives the Christian judges a better public image, or as Bassanio so acute (observes when choosing the caps and resolves the puzzles to win Portia's hand): <br /> <br /> In religion, What condemned error, but some sober forehead will bless it and approve it with a text, hiding gravity with fair ornament? There is no vice so simple, but presupposes some virtue on his extreme. <br /> <br /> Of course, bigotry applies to organized religion (rather than spirituality), especially when organized for political purposes, but one that easily gads ordinary godly people who are not used to splitting hair. The goodness, mercy ('Chesed' in Judaism), which is so fundamental to true Christianity, is also something that is also practiced in a wonderful degree in Judaism as in most creeds. The Jewish faith distinguishes between kindness and charity, ways of practicing both effectively and ways of making it part, rather than just an outgoing show. Both Shylock and Antonio are bigoted and use their respective beliefs to abuse them by another belief. While Shakespeare may point out the gap between the goodness prescribed by various denominations and its absence in practice, the film version greatly reduces the window of interpretation of anti-Semitism and brings a greater degree of realism to the psychological causes. <br /> <br /> Adherence to promises (the men of their wives) is treated less well, as are the comics associated with the cross-connect subplotters. Bassanio, however, his strong love for Antonio (is there gay elements there?) Can't sound moral judgments when he shows his gratitude to the 'judge' and then breaks his promise (for which Portia forgives him, shows a triumphant character for women, not only extremely intelligent and witty, but also more genuinely merciful and considerate of others than her bigoted male counterparts, including her husband.) <br/> <br /> Some of the actors are a bit stupid and there are too Many regional (English) accents, but overall the seller of Venice delivers a fresh and rewarding rework of Shakespeare. I enjoyed the play and also the very beautiful soundtrack by Hayley Westenra and others, song ballads written by both Shakespeare and Edgar Allen Poe. All in all, the Merchant of Venice is a not insignificant achievement of the British (inasmuch as any film can be said to be of a particular nationality these days) cinematic tradition.
