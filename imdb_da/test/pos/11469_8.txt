This movie had a lot of ups and downs ... The Storylin is strong while telling the saga of Ma 'Barker growing up, and then her misadventures with her boys and the FBI. Theresa Russell very talented and her beauty even shines through, as Ma 'Barker, in public enemies. Mark L. Lester's direction, while not as good as in "85's command, was still very interesting." <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts plays a brief role as a security guard, kills (and Ma's Lover), and Alyssa Milano plays a prostitute who hangs with the gang. Frank Stallone plays a chew who helps the gang, and while one of his exploits gets one of Mads boy into trouble, he gets out in a final way of saying ... <br /> <br /> I was confused, fascinated and fascinated throughout this film. So it makes me wonder what movie all these others voted so low !! For all they wonder. In fact, whether the FBI was so bad in the beginning, had no tumbling guns that they had banned, and thus was at a disadvantage when they entered the shootout with gang in the era. As all I saw represented the 30s, I felt it was more realistic than many other films made portraying the era ... It's in ways that a train wreck happens ... You don't want to, but just for .. Enjoy !!!
