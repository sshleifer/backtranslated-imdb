Scientist Carl Lehman (well played by David McIlwraith) is blown up something terrible in a deliberate chemical explosion. He has his brain transplanted into the body by an almost indestructible metal cyborg dress by his evil colleagues led by the evil obsessive co-founder Alex Whyte (a complete hateful depiction of Richard Cox). Lehman begins on an all-out killing spree. It's up to nasty mercenary Hunter (a wonderful abominable turn of the Divine Pam Grier) to stop him. Director Jean-Claude Lord, formerly hell of the undervalued slasher psycho thriller "Visiting Hours", runs the rich action scenes with great enlistment and maintains a zippy pace throughout, ensuring that this girl's size acts as a fun invisible sci-fi / horror action excursion. Pauryy character thesp Maury Chaykin easily applauds top acting as disgustingly bold creep Burt, in the movie's most tasteless sequence, has a brutal fistfight with Lehman's pregnant wife Lauren (a winning performance of the lovely Teri Austin). Stan Winston's nifty make-up f / x and Paul Zaza's exciting score further add to the overall sleazy fun.
