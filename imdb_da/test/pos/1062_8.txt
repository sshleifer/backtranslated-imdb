Given the acting roles he played in the 1940s (Casper Gutman, Signior Ferrari, Mr. Peters, Jerome K. Arbutny, Ex-Superintendent Grodman, Count Fosco, Titus Semple), it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally Sidney Greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the West End and Broadway. He was usually such a total villain or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored. In fact, he actually made four comedy appearances (a fake of his villainous depictions with his villain Peter Lorre in a cameo appearance). His best overall movie appearance in a comedy was probably that of magazine publisher Alexander Yardley in "Christmas In Connecticut" (although his autocratic, semi-grain soap tycoon in "The Hucksters" is a close second). Despite some problems with the manuscript, it is a good movie and is usually revived during Christmas. Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) writes a column in "American Housekeeping" magazine for Yardley, where she provides household tips and cooking recipes. She is the 1945 version of Martha Steward, except that Mrs Steward is a cook and homeowner and can guarantee to try and test what she is talking about. Stanwyck can't. Her cooking recipes are those of her friend Felix (S.Z. Sakall), a gourmet chef and restaurateur. The house she describes as her home (a model farmhouse in Connecticut) belongs to her unofficial girlfriend, architect John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner). Curtains wouldn't really mind marrying Stanwyck, but she's not quite ready to consider a final commitment to him. <br /> <br /> When the movie begins, an American shipwreck is by the Nazis. This is Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor. He spends two weeks in a fleet before being rescued. Greenstreet decides to give Morgan a desire to have a genuine old-fashioned Christmas in Connecticut. He basically tells Stanwyck that she will entertain Morgan and herself on her farm for the holidays. Stanwyck is unable to explain that the column's image of itself (complete with its ability to clap and raise a baby she apparently had with her husband) is a lie - if she does, she is fired, as she does is the closest chief Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne). In a moment of depression, she accepts Gardiner's proposal for marriage, and then Gardiner finds that his Connecticut home is dragooned to become "Stanwyck's" actual "home and himself and" their baby. "<br /> <br /> Of course, aside from extinguishing Greenstreet's disturbing curiosity, Stanwyck and Morgan find that they fall in love (much to the curtain's irritation - he actually expects Stanwyck to still marry him.) Complications after complications arise as lies piles of lies and as neighbors babies succeed the neighbor's babies before the Greenstreet begins to wonder if he is missing something, but it is a comedy, so everything works well, even the Greenstreet, in the end, is entertained by all the madness - his famous heartfelt chortle mirrors it by Santa Clause for a change This is not a classic comedy, certainly not a big, but fun enough to make the season worth seeing in December.
