BROADCAST NEWS opens with a series of short vignettes, which is a smart way to start a story about TV anchors that have no idea what they are reporting on. <br /> <br /> In a speech before a group would -The journalists, who are all bored of their presentation, leave most of them. When the last one comes out, the co-host of the event says to HOLLY HUNTER: "I don't think there will be any Q&A." Subtle line in a brilliantly written low key comedy, a farce about the show biz aspect of TV anchoring. <br /> <br /> WILLIAM HURT is the scary news anchor that gets underway with HOLLY HUNTER as the anchorman network. Hurt needs help in remedial reporting, and Holly refuses to take bait - initially. He knows that he can only look good, but is not a reporter. He turns out to be a quick investigation as long as his earpiece works, and he gets all the straightforward information from the Executive Hunter. <br /> <br /> Holly's second anchor winch (ALBERT BROOKS) helps feed her information, she surrenders to hurt. Of course, she becomes in conflict with her feelings for ace reporter Brooks and equally strong attraction to the beautiful boy anchorman Hurt, who has his own dalliance with a beautiful employee. You have to wait for twenty minutes before the movie ends to find out which man she will end up with. Brooks tells her that Hurt is the wrong one because he represents everything she is against. In this unpredictable comedy there is no narrative who Hunter (the neurotic heroine) will end up with. <br /> <br /> Fittingly, HOLLY HUNTER, WILLIAM HURT and ALBERT BROOKS were all nominated for Oscars (Brooks in supporting role) as the film itself and director / author James L. Brooks. All in all, seven well-deserved Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> The script does not choose a conventional happy ending - and in this case it is the only mistake for the amazing play. I felt cheated and slightly let down by the wistful conclusion.
