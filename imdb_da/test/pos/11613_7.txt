I finally got hold of the excellent Sazuma DVD of this movie, filled with interesting extras. I have read a lot about it, and unfortunately I missed it at the Stockholm Film Festival. It doesn't quite deliver as I thought it would, but it's still worth seeing if you like weird and unique movies. I would rather look at this again than any of the recent so-called horror films that are Hollywood-induced these days. What detracts from the experience for me is certain music impressions that are audio-updated and rely too much on cheap synth sounds. For me, all these tonal / harmonic elements in the scoring could have been lifted out and replaced by David Kristian's excellent sound design. But that's just my opinion. Otherwise, this is a bold, angry picture with welcome meditative and poetic parts that fade the image sequence, which is beautiful. I look forward to seeing Ascension, and I welcome Mitch and Karim for their efforts to produce non-mainstream cinema. They are a great inspiration as I will soon start my own short film production.
