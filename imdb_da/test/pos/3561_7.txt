A train-holding union soldier carries $ 300,000 gold with a banker Clayton who is there to see it reaching its destination but suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. But Bahunda slips off the gold and saves it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he is killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is trapped and soon to be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes off (who after Monetero's bounty) and offers to save his life for half the gold. On the other hand, Monetero gives him half of the medallion, but Clayton notices it and discovers something up. Soon all three cross to the gold, but also the bank's insurance company and Monetero's gang are watching and waiting for their chance to beat. <br /> <br /> Just see the opening sequence you know you're for a spaghetti western with a heavy-in-cheek style and a confidence to sprinkle many references (some nicely realized) from other movies (pretty much the Dollar trilogy ) of its subgenre. Director Enzo Castellari is sprawling and mostly lightweight, but there is potential in many of his large, flashy sets and smooth rhythmic pace. Virtually there are many tussles, niche games (and lots of acrobatic stunts) that take place compared to all-out vicious shootouts. But most of these stunts are very well finished and very fun, and when the guns burn, there is energy to burn. The traditional story is close to conventional details, but as there is a lot of sneaking and outfoxing, the spontaneous nature ensures that you are never quite sure how it will eventually play out between the three. This leads to many effective exciting moments, clever twists and lots of flashes, flashes. The mood within the starch script is rather dull. The work positively among the light and stylish style is Giovanni Bergamini's dynamically tight framing and Francesco De Masi's impulsively exciting music score. The performances are extremely well-tailored and constitute a striking report. The George Hilton is angry and the scuffed trip is solid as the ambiguous stranger. Gilbert Roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable Mexican bandit Monetero. Edd Byrnes gives a clear performance like Clayton, who keeps well. Kareen O'Hara doesn't get much to do but is a worthy look. Gerard Herter, Pedro Sanchez and Ivano Staccioli provide support. <br /> <br /> A fun and worthy spaghetti parody / greeting that throws a basket ball after the other and many fertile down 'n' dirty antics.
