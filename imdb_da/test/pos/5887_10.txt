As a "cusp-pre-baby boomer" ... born in 1944, in Los Angeles; and thereby having the dubious distinction of living while Hitler was still actively involved in his "Last Great Offensive", but also with our President Roosevelt still struggled actively against the offensive ... this was one of my youth's most important "first film" life. Having been given the opportunity to see it in "reissue", several years after the opening in 1946 (a common studio custom these years), I replied (even to my very young mind) oh so many questions I had ... are surrounded of our returning Vet heroes. Ensconced in all the many of William Wyler's equality of subtle "multi-plots" ... intentionally NOT "surrounding", "mini" or "sub" plots ... in all their "colors and intensities" ... did more than anything else I can remember to give me some sense of "reason" and "rational explanation" of what had happened around me ... in real life. personal experience perchance is a "new" and "different" angle when looking at this classic movie.)
