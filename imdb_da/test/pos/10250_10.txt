This film kept my interest from the beginning to the end with lots of laughs and real down to earth that works all over. Glynn Turman, (Preach Jackson) is the star of the picture playing the role of a smart guy who likes poetry and had a very sexy girl friend. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs (Cochise Morris) was an excellent athlete at Cooley H.S. and even won a scholarship for a famous college. There are scenes in this picture with the Chicago Police Department chasing all these dudes in a Cadillac and visiting the Lincoln Park Zoo where monkey dung is thrown around. The music is excellent and there is great photography around the city of Chicago. Great movie, enjoy.
