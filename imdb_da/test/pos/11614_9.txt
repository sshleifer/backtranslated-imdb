Karim Hussain's masterpiece of art / gore - this cat is definitely a talent to watch out for. In these several longer vignettes we have disturbed some shorter victories. It's all a very powerful movie that relies on its intense graphic images and symbolism, and it's not for all viewers. The movie starts with a card called OVARIAN EYEBALL. Very short segment that has a nude woman placed on a naked table. An invisible woman's hand covers the lying woman's face with a red cloth and makes an incision in her abdomen from which an eyeball stalk is extracted. I have nothing too much to comment on this because of its briefness. HUMAN LARVAE is one of the movie's lynchpins, and it is a completely thought-out depiction of a pervert act by a disturbed man who has an incestuous love for his pregnant sister. This is one of those "must be seen as being believed" type of thing. I would say that this movie has some of the best effects I've seen in an indie horror movie, but the subject will make this an unbelievable unpleasant experience for most (not myself - I live for this!). <Br /> <br /> REBIRTH could have been cut out of this movie all of it. This is the movie's weakest segment, and it has a bunch of naked people who get bloody holes in a field and what not. Very short, but one kind of blowing movie's momentum. RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM is one of the most profane reproductions of religious images I have ever seen, and it also kicks. Think "P iss Christ" or menstrual paintings from the Virgin Mary. Very hard sexual / sexually violent / gory imagery is presented in this paragraph and it is certainly not for anyone who will be offended by sacrilege. Subconscious cruelty is one of the best movies I've seen under the banner of extreme horror it will be a very splitting movie among horror fans and the film-making public in general. Some will call it garbage, some will call it brilliant. I can't see much intermediate. I thought this movie was pretty amazing original and I would recommend it to anyone who is adventurous enough to try it. 10.9.
