I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie she called Rose. Rose brought many exciting questions into his fulfillment journey. Is it possible to achieve peace and inner fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory that can lead to victims of others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or control one's environment? How is a "typical" man the same or different from Rose? Finally, the result or story will change if it was from another country like France or Italy? I loved that this movie provoked all these issues in me while it entertained, stimulated and kept me guessing to the end! Every time I've seen it, I've learned more about the movie and myself.
