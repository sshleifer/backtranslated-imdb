Assy McGee is an out-of-control, hard-nosed detective based on the countless examples from the late 20th century police ranks. Twist here is that Assy is literally a running butt. <br /> <br /> The cheap, low-brow facade of the show resembles its wisdom and hidden satire. It is not to say that Assy is devoid of jokes, just that toilet humor is sparingly used to induce constant laughing, not groans and eye rolls. The program's title sequence demonstrates the clever, subtle humor that is used everywhere. The sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s police theme. On a photo, a police breaker is displayed and the "camera" zooms in on the free number plate holder that is available. The pointless zoom-in satirizes the production of the typical 70s-80s police drama and randomly makes me laugh every time. All the typical characters are included: The frustrated police officer who cannot control Assy; the loyal minority partner who acts as a foil for Assy's recklessness; the regular police that detest Assy's funds .... everyone is responsible for, and everyone is hilarious satires of the typical police drama. <br /> <br /> The voice effect, primarily performed by Larry Murphy, is nothing short of spectacular. Assy's voice - breathing and drowning with a little drunk sip - is so clever and unique that it coincides with all-time greats like Stewie Griffin (Family Guy) and Homer Simpson (Simpsons). Although the voice is blurred, the poetry is somehow clear and easy to understand. This is a nice change from other adult swimming program voices that often require closed captions to understand. <br /> <br /> In addition to the amazing production and voice acting, the script is also fun. Assy's infinite directivity burns most of the humor, especially in his interaction with non-police citizens. <br /> <br /> If you have access to Adult Swim comedies, Assy McGee is definitely worth seeing. Each episode runs in just 8-9 minutes, so you really have a little to lose.
