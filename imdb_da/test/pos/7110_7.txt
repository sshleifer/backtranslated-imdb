The All-Monster congregation in the final movie of Universal's famous cycle of classic horror stories. Count Dracula (an intense, brave John Carradine) who calls himself Baron Latos comes to Dr. Nobleman (Onslow Stevens) who asks to be healed by his suffering. Of course, it's just a ruse. So randomly shows Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney), aka "The Wolf Man," and of course he * really * wants to be healed. As others have noticed, the monsters do not get the same screen time. Frankenstein Monster (Glenn Strange) is thrown into the end for the purpose of including all the universal monsters. Storage recordings and library music are also used here. The movie may spend a little too much time with the Dracula part of the story, although Carradine provides an impressive, non-hammy performance in the count's role. The film is mainly a showcase for Stevens, which goes through its own tragic arch and does an excellent job. The women are beautiful and I must say I loved Jane Adams as the bright nurse - who happens to be hunchbacked. Of course, it would not be complete without the involvement of angry villagers. <br /> <br /> Competently professionally made cooler, just for my taste, not really scary at all, but entertaining regardless. It's a respectable serial entry overall. <br /> <br /> 7/10
