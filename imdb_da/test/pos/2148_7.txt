I was fifteen." Eventually he joined work as a usher at LA Paramount and within a few years he returned to one of the greatest songwriting career in American music history. "Who is Harry Nilsson (and why is everyone talking about him?)" Chronicles the legendary life of "the best songwriter of our generation." Writer / Director John Scheinfeld produces a musical royalty from Brian Wilson and Al Kooper to Paul Williams, Randy Newman and Ray Cooper, "His voice was a medical instrument. It would heal you." Mixed archives include his 1969 appearance on 'Playboy After Dark' and Nilsson's BBC special. John Lennon, Brandy Alexander, The Smothers Brothers at the Troubadour Comeback Show Heckling Debacle is a memorable tale among so many that they seem to almost squeeze Nilsson's enchanting music out of this vast and bitter-seeking bio-doc. <br /> <br /> "He was a wonderful offender." <br /> <br /> "I woke up three days later and got a massage in Phoenix."
