For me, Pink Flamingos has lived up to its reputation as the shocking, obnoxious, repulsive, trashy movie I expected to be, which really contains everything except the kitchen sink. We are treated to almost two hours of nastiness, which never ceases: rape, sex, sex with chickens, transsexuals, castration, murder, cannibalism and an awful display of singing out the anus. It's about a weird couple starting a competition with a trailer shipping family trying to steal their title as the "horrifying people alive". Divine (a fat guy in a row) is an incredibly dull man who actually gets painful to see. Trust me when I say that this movie is not one to be forgotten quickly, especially the closing scene, where the divine eats the dog, throws the pavement. I always thought John Waters was overstated, and I can't say I like this movie, but it's an experience if you ever get a chance to see it.
