My friends and I simply rented this movie to satisfy a friend who was very bent on renting it, even though it had no idea what it was about. We all thought it would be like "a Canadian American pie", but when we saw it we were quite surprised we were all quiet in the whole movie and loved it! It was nothing like the American Pie and had a plot that teenage girls are sure to love (seeing as the guy gets the shed knocked out of him at the end), after that night it became my favorite movie for not only his plot, but the actors and the large font. There wasn't a moment when I thought it was incredible. Everything is very realistic and related to anyone living in a small town with small prospects. I absolutely love this movie and would recommend hiring it the next time you have a chance it is worth it.
