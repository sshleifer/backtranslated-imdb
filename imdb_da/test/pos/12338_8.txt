Since Jason and his ilk took over horror movies around 1980, most horror films have involved a group of hormonally charged teens who chopped bits with focus on the chop and not the excitement. <br /> <br /> This little movie is different. Made in the early 80's, it does what every good scary movie should do - bring your worst fears to life while you sit and just know that these horrors are just around the corner. Then you get these horrors to simmer, just don't make it a lesson on the slaughterhouse biology. The story contains Meg Tilly just before she had a short-lived fame that began with "The Big Chill" and then slipped back to turmoil in the early 90s. Me plays an out-of-the-way teenager who is just dying to enter the good gracies of some classic average girls. They tell her that she can be part of their small group if she spends the night in the crypt. The average girls intend to scare her and get her to leave the crypt and thus give them a double reward - further plague the excused girl and have an excuse to reject her. At the same time, the famous occultist Karl Rhamarevich has died a bizarre death shortly after claiming to have discovered a way to return from the grave and by his return order great magical powers. His daughter does not believe in the first place, but she listens to a band about her father's experiments, which included his successful animation of small dead animals and his plans to get out of the grave with the power to animate bigger games and draw additional power from these. animations. She also learns that she may have inherited her father's power and may be the only one who can stop him if he actually rises from the dead. I think you know where this story is going, so I stop here. Did I say that the magician was entombed in the same crypt where Meg Tilly's character spends the night? <br /> <br /> I would like to mention that the commercial DVD containing this movie looks a bit degraded compared to what you would expect from a recent movie. I saw it on television in the mid-1980s, and I remember it looking better than this. The problem is that the original negative of the movie was never placed so the DVD had to be created from a print. This means that it comes with dirt and scratches. <br /> <br /> This is worth checking out for any horror fan. It was a self-made movie and an example of the kind of unusual things that you could usually find on television at night until infomercial turned that time slot into a large wasteland approx. 1986. Only TCM Underground flies this kind of movie more.
