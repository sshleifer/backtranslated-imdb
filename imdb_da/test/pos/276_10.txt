I was half-pounding when I looked at a sennate selection of short films - but sat bolt upright from the first frames of "I Shout Love" and couldn't take my eyes off for his full, short, perfect length. With incredibly incredible pacing and performances, this movie keeps its funny / sad / insightful tone through. The credits at the end went so fast, and in such a small type I had to go online to find out which person was responsible for this masterpiece. What a pleasant surprise to see the name of Sarah Polley, a great actress rarely seen. Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) turn in rich, touching performances as a couple in the jersey of breaking up. As they work through the resumption of Tessa's favorite moments from their time together, both actors reveal the dimensions of their characters and their relationships in ways that only honor their talents - and to the instructor / writer's abilities. The film creates a moving tale with ridiculous and immediate sorrows. "In Shout Love" is undoubtedly one of the greatest and most memorable short films I have ever expected to see. It has white, heart and amazing originality. It matters.
