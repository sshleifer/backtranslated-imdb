The beautiful, charming, highly versatile and talented Irene Dunne is one of the largest 5 or 6 actresses of American cinema. In over 21 - as in all her films - she lights up the screen with a natural but glamorous presence. She is at the same time authentic and human, and a charismatic, inspirational model. This role is quintessential Irene Dunne, full of pathos and white and a little evil. I love all her movies, and this movie was a great new discovery for me when TCM aired it last night. I hope they don't wait for years to fly it again. <br /> <br /> Likewise, Charles Coburn is one of the greatest character actors in the entire American cinema. True, he often portrays variations on the same theme, but I never need to see his soft heart curmudgeons. Here, his character is the perfect foil for Irene Dunne, and he is perfectly portrayed by Coburn. Their conflicts in this movie are absolutely fantastic. They never miss a blow. In addition, they represent the film's central conflict and the moral conflict of Irene Dune's husband, portrayed by Alexander Knox. <br /> <br /> I'm not so familiar with Knox's work. He was recognizable, but it was all about it. But thrown with Dunne and Coburn, he keeps his own. He delivers a fine, nuanced performance. His character has noble motives that are made available to us by Knox's achievements and never held us as a holy grail. He is noble but in conflict and doubts his ability to complete the OCS. His interaction with Dunne is always compelling. Dunne supports him without being syrupy or becoming a martyr, and he reacts in nature. Their scenes are very well done. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is a great snapshot and an environment not portrayed in other movies. I don't remember from the top of my head, another movie depicting America still struggles WWII, but with the end in sight and focus on the creation of the World War. Not the usual WWII movie! It is in itself interesting; It is also important for the plot and the film's message. Unlike other commentators, I thought the climatic speech was okay, but not great. It was delivered very well by Knox, but it wasn't as "tight" written as the building made me expect. I've heard better biographical speeches about very similar topics. It served its purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie's greatest value was the image of Dunne and Knox's life, reflecting the typical OCS experience. The sense of community among the wives living on the Palmetto Terrace seemed quite authentic - like the Palmetto Terrace itself, although of course it was a solid stage. The incredibly short meetings between the wives and their OCS husband. The Strengths of the OCS Candidates, Strengthening the Difficult and Complex Material They Must Learn. The shabby "base house" - apparently quickly constructed. The tired and worn furniture. The constant and harrowingly short deadlines - to return to base to learn lessons, to catch trains for subsequent "posts." Tenants ran into their predecessors and successors in the base house as they moved in and out. Yes, I suppose this was a glimpse of a real world war experience - dressed in some comedies, but very real in the core. I loved it and I highly recommend it.
