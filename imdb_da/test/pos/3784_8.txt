Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' from 1918 was his longest movie to date, but in just over 45 minutes it wasn't quite a feature film. With the First World War that just joined, many of the most popular entertainers of their time were to inspire their original troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And then the lovable tramp went to war! The movie begins with Tramp in training, and the character is hilarious at even the simplest military exercises, including marching and pistol-slinging, much to disgust for his drunken rider. The tramp then finds itself in the trenches that face a more formidable enemy, even though the Germans ultimately turn out to be infinitely more incompetent than even he. The outrageous moment when Tramp declares that he single-handedly captured thirteen German soldiers by "surrounding them" had me sting. <br /> <br /> There are many other amazing moments in this movie. Chaplin wakes up to find his sleeping barracks under water and is unable to literally find her own feet, is fun, like his brilliant use of a tube from a turntable to sleep underneath the surface. <br /> <br /> But the most memorable scenes in the movie undoubtedly involve Chaplin's chanting behind enemy lines disguised as a tree. The reactions of the bumbling German soldiers, unconsciously just meters from a sworn enemy, being single-handed disabled, are unique in being particularly entertaining, especially when a soldier seizes an ax for the purpose of cutting down a tree for burning. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining movie and one of the best of Chaplin's before 1920's action. Highly recommended.
