I had no expectations (never seen previews for "Marigold") and enjoyed the characters, contemporary music and sharp dancing in this light hearted movie. Although 98% of the dialogue is English (big thing for me), I want the DVD that had subtitles to help with some of the quick moments when the character's accent can be hard to understand. I didn't want to judge this movie against Bollywood movies, but only at their own merits as a fun entertainment (a musical folk movie). I'm hooked on Ali Larter as an actress (and her interviews in the Bonus material indicate she's a good person). I have since seen this movie several times (getting better every time).
