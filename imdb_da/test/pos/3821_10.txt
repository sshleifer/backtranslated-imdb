"Think like a dinosaur" was a well-produced and performed show of -Outerlimits series. The actor (Enrico Colantoni as Michael Burr) plays an impressive good and convincing role. You can actually identify yourself with him and his 'introspective' feelings about what to do for the girl he has fallen to (because he has been alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels hopeless until "Kamala" comes to its life with a foam fear of carrying out the task of being transported, he consults her and lets us know that it is all going to be okay, which ends up being a deception for both of them. she (prototype) comes back ... and her (clone) is sent to the other resident plan, although the -Dino and Micheal have not yet found out, it is up to Michael to decide to either kill her or leave her But what happened to him before she met her (kamala) was very much related to what happened to his wife, his wife died the same way, this show regrets the irregularity and grief most of the time.After the show you are considered. About what should have been done and you're stuck with 50 / 50 of what is right from wr ong. Therefore, the "balance" equation is exclusively there none. <br /> <br /> 10/10 strongly recommends watching this show.
