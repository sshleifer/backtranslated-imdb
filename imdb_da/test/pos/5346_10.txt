This movie is what most of the industry has forgotten how to do: FAMILY entertainment, which means something fun to people of all ages. This particular Wallace & Gromit can be enjoyed by everybody from toddlers who like colors and cute rabbits for their grandparents who understand the adult references. <br /> <br /> This movie has really good direction I have ever seen, and I mean it literally. It's also filled with little mood, and each scene has so many humorous details in the background that I have to buy it if it only needs to read all the characters and manuals in the W&G world. <br /> <br /> I plan to watch this movie at least twice in theaters so buy it on DVD. You should also see it.
