After purchasing Universal's Marlene Dietrich DVD collection, I was somewhat reluctant to see the "Golden Earrings." The idea of ​​a 40-something Marlene Dietrich as a gypsy in a wartime romance seemed unusual and unlikely. I should not be concerned. With all the professional talent that went into these old movies, it's hard to miss, really. The movie was a joy to watch; It's a classic. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie was Dietrich, who pulls out of the gypsy role perfectly. The makeup, the lighting, the photography and her performance all fill up to make a truly spectacular and memorable character. I had never seen Dietrich play a "good" woman convincing before - but she does here! She played a lot of heartless stamps in the big Sternberg movies, so it is refreshing to see her in a more downward, relaxed role that plays an exotic but very human character. All in all, a very nice romance. The love story is credible, optimistic, and the happy ending is extremely satisfying.
