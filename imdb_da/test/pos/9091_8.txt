When I first saw Flatliners, I was amazed at it. It had all the necessary features of a good movie: the casting was amazing, the plot was amazing, and in the case of thrillers, there was genuine "excitement" throughout. Keifer Sutherland offered a fantastic performance As the male lead in the play, showing a scientist who believes he can find the answers to life and death by killing himself and then coming back to life, "secrets of death" steal away. Kevin Bacon offers an outstanding performance as the more morally decent counterpart to Keifer, while Julia Roberts offers her most compelling role. William Baldwin portrays a student who excels in class and apparently intercourse. And Oliver Platt, in another excellent performance, portrays the reasons for the group and the innocent. <br /> <br /> The story is fairly simple but original, and the play is refreshing - definitely one stand out movie for the genre and one that has set the standard for measuring other thrillers for me. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
