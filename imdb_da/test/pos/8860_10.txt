Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a thing from outer space - it consumes and completely duplicates everything it chooses. It starts out as a dog, but loosens - and has a chance to copy any of the men. Soon no one trusts anyone else - they are isolated - the radio is broken - their helicopter also. What should they do? <br /> <br /> The 1951 movie had just been a great super human monster. The movie was scary. This is also - but the story is different (and more based on the source material - the short story "Who goes there?") And it is scary in another way. The movie starts with Ennio Morricones extremely scary score setting just the right tone and - when Thing is attacked - the amount of gore is amazing. There are blood and body parts that fly everywhere - the arms are bitten, the head loosens and - in the strongest - a man is consumed face-by-thing first. Gore effects are strong and real nightmare material. I don't scare easily, but I had to sleep with the lights when I originally saw this back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just incredible - how this picture came with an R-rating is beyond me! <br /> It also has a very creepy feeling - do aside, it is very exciting. You are not sure who is what and the carpenter's direction and the score really builds up the excitement. One complaint - no one has given any characteristic personality traits. The actors stay straight and say their lines. It's annoying ... but the movie still works. <br /> <br /> This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982 - it competed with "E.T." and many critics complained about the amount of gore and there were no female characters in the movie. It is now considered one of John Carpenter's best. A must-see ... too strong stomach. NOT a date movie! <br /> <br /> A funny note: When this was released Universal sent a note along with all the prints of the movie. They suggested theater owners to play the movie in an auditorium near the rest of the rooms. They were afraid that people would be so sick of the violence that they should be close to a facility to vomit!
