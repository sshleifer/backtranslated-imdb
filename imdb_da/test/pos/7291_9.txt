Okay, I'm 12, so here you will see the movie from a pre-teenager's point of view. I've also commented on Magnolia and Bicentennial Man, both great movies if you want to check it out. Okay, here on earth was a beautiful movie with amazing scenes and pictures, very pleasing to the eye. The author (I don't know who it was, check out IMDB) has either worked very hard or has a good understanding of love, poetry and drama. I cried 4 times throughout this movie, once for over 30 minutes. It was really sad, really beautiful, really meaningful. It's a great movie for everyone, says 11 and up who is not a romantic comedy freak. Yes, it's romantic, yes it's comical, but (in my opinion) it's better than "She's all that" or "Whatever it takes". I never cry! It's a messenger story. Go rent it and bond it :).
