I can't believe I missed this one. Made in 1970 with a budget likely to allow you to make an indifferent episode of a TV soap, this is 90 minutes of persistent, crisp as knife film making. You will find the sketch, plot, etc. Elsewhere on this site. Although the whole thing was shot using a single handheld 16mm camera ... the whole dialogue is improvised ... none of the "actors" had appeared in front of a camera before ... It sounds like a recipe for disaster. Instead, we get hippies v cops running around the California desert in what turns out to be a 'it's not fair .. I'm on that person's scenario. The only problem is that the instructor keeps you changing your fidelity and by the end of 90 minutes we are still not sure who has one. Brilliant ... Absolutely brilliant.
