An amazing movie that brought so much into the opening of disability that generally makes people afraid. It showed how minds can be captured by less than wild bodies, and how difficult it must be to witness things that happen to others who are wanted for the disabled. <br /> <br /> Love, friendship, fear, frustration, joy, humor and so many other things were so well captured. The two main characters were very well played by the 2 possible play actors and invited your laughter, tears, worry, joy and horror. <br /> <br /> I approached this movie with a mix of interest and frightened concern that it might be too much a game of sympathy or staying only on negatives. However, it was a beautifully crafted story of 2 friends. <br /> <br /> I loved it.
