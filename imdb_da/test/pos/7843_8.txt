Another well-done moral ambiguity pieces where anti-hero makes it difficult to determine who should root. If nothing else "The Beguiled" silenced anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in film - at least in 1971. There were four good parts for actresses in this movie and everyone was well cast and well done. <br /> <br /> Pamelyn Ferdin did a great job as Amy and would continue to play "Wanda June". It must have been the first time an adult male office star shared an extended kiss with a twelve-year-old girl on camera, wondering if there was much controversy about it at that time. It was probably Polanski's favorite scene. Considering Amy's turtle "Randolph", it's not surprising that Ferdin grew up to be a hardcore animal rights activist. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page was also excellent, playing a complex character with just the right amount of restraint. Interestingly, she died only three days after Elizabeth Hartman committed suicide (threw herself through a fifth-floor window) as they also worked together in "You're a Big Boy Now". <br /> <br /> Hartman (who looks like she could be Blair Brown's sister) was wonderful as Edwina and should have been given an Oscar (no other performance was even the same year), but considering what we Now know about her, you wonder just how much of her performance was a researched effort and how much just came from inside her. Edwina shows such raw pain, it's hard to see. As Marilyn Monroe's incredible performance in "The Misfits", the viewer sees a lot of her own demons in the character she plays. Finally, there is Jo Ann Harris, who is wonderfully perfect as the flirtatious Carol. For my money, Harris was the sexiest actress in the 1970s who combined sensuality with intelligence and humor. She was the best reason to watch the TV series "Most Wanted" and the only reason to see "Wild Wild West Revisited". Hard to believe that anyone who could bring it all to the screen never became a big star.
