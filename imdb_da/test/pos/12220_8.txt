The problem with television today is that people have been pampered by "little" TV viewing. This type of TV show is similar to elevator music or "easy listening" jazz. The typical viewer idea of ​​"continuity" remembers who was voted out of the island last week and wonder who will be the next to go. Show them a program like surface, Firefly, Dr. Who or something with a plotbue of more than three episodes and ... well, they will just return to Survivor. <br /> <br /> 95% of the sheep watching TV do not want to brace their brains. They want excuses not to think. They want to make sure that the "boob tube" lives up to its name ... and they won't have shows trying to go another route. Because of this, Surface and many other high-quality shows that should have lasted much longer have got the ax. TV viewers will not have stories, morals or philosophy or anything over a third grade vocabulary level. They want people who eat earthworms or over-dramatized "real-life" series (not so! You can't observe anything without changing the very nature of what you see) or hormonal shows involving groups of people who have been trysted. and then write to their friends. Today's television is nothing but a wasteland, and the few diamonds you can pick out of the dust are just thrown out because no one even knows what a diamond is more. The surface was one of these diamonds.
