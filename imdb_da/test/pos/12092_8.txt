This is a great documentary and the above comments make a brief summary of how great it was, so I do not repeat the same compliments. But beliefs that are akin to being a Turkish-oriented guy who probably knows about this country more than an ordinary European, fall into the Oriental trap that other Western artists usually fall. But come on man, you are Turkish blood, and your movie could be deeper and could describe what lies outside of "beyoglu-old city". It is a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason. Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are watching the movie and Ceza (a very talented and poorly ass Turkish rapper) is making some fragile speech about American gangsta rappers, which I totally agree. I would recommend this movie to my American friends.
