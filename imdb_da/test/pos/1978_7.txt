Now, a fan of sci fi, trailer for this movie is so little too, how do I put it, Hollywood. But after seeing it, I am happy to say it has impressed me a lot. Jude is a class actor and Miss Leigh pulls it better than she did in Delores Clairborne. It brings movies like The Matrix, 12 Monkeys and The Cell in mind, which may not sound appealing, but it's really one of the best movies I've seen.
