Back in the mid-late 80s, an OAV anime by title "Bubblegum Crisis" (which I think is a military slang term for when technical equipment goes haywire) debuted on video, inspired by "Blade Runner" , "The Terminator" and maybe even "Robocop", with a little hint of Batman / Bruce Wayne - Iron Man / Tony Stark and Charlie's Angel's girl power thrown into good measure. 8 episodes long, the overall story was that in the 21st century Tokyo, Japan, in 2032-2033, machines called Boomers lived manual labor and sometimes cause problems. A special, SWAT branch of law enforcement authorities, the advanced police were formed to handle the boomers, but were mostly ineffective, making millionaire scientist Sylia Stingray, the daughter of the scientist who made the boomers, created four powered fighting armor (hard suits) worn by women to fight the boomers and fight the evil company that produced boomers through. This group becomes known as the knights' abbeys, and in addition to ringleader Sylia, her rag-tag band of rebellious women included Priss Asagiri, a fighting rock and roll with a passion for motorcycles and a contempt for police, Linna Yamazaki, an aerobic instructor with an eye for money and a tendency to blow through lovers, and Nene Romanova, a young officer of ADP and expert computer hacker (the first in a long line). THROUGH meanwhile, is represented by Quincy, a great, fiery old guy who happens to own the business, his younger assistant Brian J. Mason (killed in episode 3) and an annoying boomer man named Largo. Other characters included Leon McNichol and Daley Wong, two AD police sectors (Leon appeared in a spin-off / prequel anime, "AD Police Files" which I heard was very dark), their balding, overweight chief Chief Todo, younger brother Sylia brother Mackey, and a fun little mechanic known as Dr. The raven, which apparently helps Sylia maintain the suits. Apart from the overall Knight Sabers & AD Police VS THROUGH the storyline, there was also another story that involved a friend of Linna's who apparently was a daughter of a large criminal family, the annoying Largo trying to persuade THROUGH and various price desires -have-for-a-less character history. Oh, and I mention that there were hints that Sylia herself could have been a boomer? <br /> <br /> Now it was a good watch full of chaos and chaos and even some very nice pop songs, but it was not without its faults, some unfortunately due to the series being interrupted after episode 8, as it was originally was planned for 13 episodes in total. Then some of the stories that Larger's scheme (or arrangements), the family of Linds weak friend and Sarlas origin, never resolved. Another issue with the series was that at that time Priss was the most popular character, so much of the series focused on her, and unfortunately, most of the Prize-oriented episodes focused basically on Priss, who even justly sought justice / revenge for some secondary character who had never appeared before but happened to be a friend of her, but she rarely went out of the way for her, the knight's sister, who always mocked her out of trouble and for some reason was very worried about her , to be (just to be fair, but she went to rescue Linna in episode 7, and her boyfriend was killed by a boomer and ADP mistakenly surveyed). This meant that we didn't really focus on the more interesting back story about Sylia, or even the daily antique of Nene and Linna. Linna had two episodes about her that related to her friend with the mafia family, while Nene managed to hang the last episode for himself, showing that her eternal good cheer was really good spirits and not laziness. Nene must also put her computer skills in good use, or she has sometimes only acted as a gracious goof who put her screenplay and character development a few notches over poor Linna, who was often drawn into the background with only her greed and her tendency to to eat up lovers to get her some attention. Don't make me wrong, I like it, and I love the overall concept of it all, but it annoyed me a little. Also this is one of those runner-ups for "worst English voice dubbing of all time" features, which means you could better stick to Japanese. Some of the voices were okay (some really matched their personas people), but others were just plain and passless or, in the case of Priss, really obeyed. <br /> <br /> Now Tokyo 2040 comes together and pretty much throws it all out of the window. For a couple of years to come, the story here is that after earthquakes shattered Tokyo rebuilt GENOM's boomers the city into a great old paradise, except that the boomers still tend to fly out of the handle, prompting the AD police to be formed followed by The knights' abbeys are formed. So the overall story is the same, but the character's backgrounds and characters' appearance and attitudes have changed a lot. <br /> <br /> 1) Sylia originally had short, purple black hair and brown eyes, was usually dressed as a hedge, real businesswoman and was distant from others. 2040 Sylia has more of a supermodel look to her, dressing more provocative and possessing white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light (running the gamut from blue to purple to silver and eyes occasionally looking purple or gray), and also 2040 Sylia is more of an emotionally unstable woman who flies out of the handle when she is not public and may hold even more secrets than before. Sylia does not take as much risk on the battlefield as she is more of a stay-in-mobile-pit type here, but she does battle when she needs to. <br /> <br /> 2) Initially Priss was a short woman with an afro and a really bad mood, always choosing matches with people who offended her, always biting more than she could chew etc. 2040 Price has, however, gone in the way of Clint Eastwood oneone - very cold, very stoic and emotionally distant (more like the original Sylia you might say) so she is not really attached to anyone. Her hair is also more stingy and cat-like (a big improvement), and she is dressed in leather like Trinity from "The Matrix" (although much less annoying than before, the authors unfortunately eventually screw her when they revealed her reasons for hate ADP). <br /> <br /> 3) Linnaeus had this large black hair for her, but now her hair is shorter, brown and more than the 90s. 2040 Linna is also an office lady who has accidents of being sexually harassed. As if apologizing for how she was treated by OAV authors, the 2040 authors dedicated the first 6 episodes to Linna, writing her as a new maid who is new to the city, but determined to meet the Knight's Saber and win a place with those she eventually does. <br /> <br /> 4) Originally a short red-haired girl who often fell victim to ridicule and ate a lot of candy, Nene is now a short blonde-haired girl who likes to justify and take pot shots on ADP detective Leon McNichol (revenge for him toying with her in OAV?) and other signs, even her surrogate sister Linna and Mackey, Sylvia's "brother", with whom she is horrified. Cockey and arrogant, she still eats a lot of candy and is a master hacker, but she is finally deflated and growing beyond her comic relief status. <br /> <br /> 5) Nigel Kirkland is a new character, a tall, stoic, robust handsome man with long black hair (he resembles Adrian Paul from TV's Highlander), he replaces Dr. The raven from the old series and now serves as the man who gives heads to Sylvia's hard suits. Nigel is also Sylia's beloved, but you would not know it by his behavior. He is a kind of father / big brother / mentor figure to Mackey. <br /> <br /> 6) Leon and Daley are back, but of course different. The original Leon was a tall and beautiful boy built like a baseball player with slick back brown hair, blue eyes, a black leather jacket, tight blue jeans and always wearing a revolver that could pack more puppy than a chief if needed; While he was not really a bad guy deep down, he was bad, but he served mostly as comical relief when he tried to pursue Priss Romantic (exactly what he saw in her is a mystery) but occasionally he and Daley served as information guides to important plot points. Also, the original Daley was a rather muscular red head dressed in pink / purple suits when he was a flamboyant gay character who always hit Leon as he did not provide important information. In 2040, Leon is no longer a beautiful boy, but more of your typical robust, hard-hardened type with nailed black hair, brown eyes, long and sporty big muscles, a brown leather jacket and blue docks (he actually looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger a little, or maybe a pumped up Colin Farrell or Hugh Jackman) and he still carries a revolver, a big one, but it's not as powerful as before. Although 2040 Leon still has a bit of attitude problems (especially in approaching Priss), he is not so much of a jerk as he was in the old series, but he has a bad mood and he is easily annoyed by Nene and Daley (he also drinks too much coffee). Oh, and Leon is still after Priss, but he'd much better this time. Meanwhile, Daley is now a louder (but not as tall as Leon) more handsome boyish guy with red goggles, a white suit, green eyes, and light brown hair, and he wears a great machine gun (he actually looks like James Marsden from X - But the movies); Daley is much wiser and more confident in 2040 than OAV, and although it is not quite clear, his gay tendencies have almost disappeared, without a moment of what seems to be jealousy when he hears about Leon asking for price. -mail. <br /> <br /> 7) Brian J. Mason (what says "J" for?) is back, and that's Quincy, but Mason is much more the biggest villain here, with Quincy as a fellow cartel, as he is no longer is a towering terror, but a vegetable with a lot of batteries and wires connected to him. Mason has now replayed brown hair instead of black hair as he did in OAV (he actually looks like OAV Leon in a suit) and he is a lot from Alan Rickman's villains. <br /> <br /> 8) Although a perver in the first series, Mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040. Of course, there are many things different about Mackey in 2040, but they won't be revealed here. <br /> <br /> 9) Sylia now has a companion, an Alfred-the-Butler type named Henderson, who cares about her and the gang. <br /> <br /> 10) In the original series, boomers were like the replicas of "Blade Runner", armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions, but in 2040 they are more stupid-monsters-on-the-rampage type . Most of the time they are just big robots that do what they are programmed to do (heavy work, struggle, cleanup, etc.), and they have this tendency to "go rogue", which means trying to develop become a monster in the process. <br /> <br /> What's the same is the theme of humanity's VS technology (has machines souls?). Unfortunately, this series, but well animated and well written, only runs 26 episodes so it moves faster than you might like, especially those of us who are accustomed to more than one season of our most beloved characters, and unfortunately it ends still on a cliff hanger with unresolved storyline bits (which i will not discuss here. What saves this show and does it what it is, but the characters are a colorful cast screw ball they are, ranging from stoic loners, psycho women, genocide crazy men, rough cops, Sardinian intellectuals, wise old sages and lovable innocents, much more diverse than before and much more to play, they are enough to make you want this show to have gone further. <br /> It's not good, but it's a good watch, but the English dub (at ADV) is pretty good, but not without some flat spots, but certainly better than dub on the original.
