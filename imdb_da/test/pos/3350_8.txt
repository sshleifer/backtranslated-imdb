What can you possibly say? This is the unbeaten hardcore, musical Alice! It also works with a great energetic casting, which apparently benefits from the hilt, and while one might wish for a new master version, I think we are lucky to have this video transfer ourselves. Almost a joy all the way through. There are a couple of moments, but it could have been embarrassing all the way through, and it certainly isn't. It could also have been, and today it would have been for camp. No, a very fine effort that is fun, tuneful and just sexy enough. Fine performances, especially Kristine DeBell at the forefront, and was it an unaccredited Richard Prior, as the exposed knight got heavy (if discreet) ride?
