The creative team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker rooted in the improvisation theater in Madison, Wisconsin, I think it was. They had a group called the Kentucky Fried Theater (or something similar). They put a lot of their set of celluloid like 'KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE' (1977), which was long, irreverent, sophomoric and really fun. <Br /> <br /> They followed up with the very popular airplane! (1980), which really puts them on the map. Then they took some well-known veteran actors in Robert Stack and (especially) Leslie Nielsen and put them in prominent roles and continued to parody all the clich√©s of each flight film since John Wayne's (Batjac) production by THE HIGH AND POSSIBLE (1954). * Pockets filled with cash and now noticed, the trio drafted an agreement with Pramount Television and the American Broadcasting Company TV Network to make a half hour comedy spoof of the almost countless Police Crime Drama show that has come and gone on our TV screens through the years. To remember the good work that Mr. Leslie Nielsen had turned on AIRPLANE !, he was thrown in the lead. <br /> <br /> As Sgt / Lt. / Captain Frank Drebbin (the rank name switch is one of their comic bits), he presided over a large series of successive puns, sight gags, non sequitors and overblown police / crime cliches. All of these were tied together by some apparent standards scripts. Added to this is overly dramatic opening narration, pronounced over information contradicting the visual printed info. They have always used this to give the title of episode titles where voice and printed titles never matched. <br /> <br /> They had a fantastic musical score, which, although slightly exaggerated, would have passed as a theme and random music in a straight drama. The musical score, the opening titles and the format for having the episodes divided into Act I, Act II, Epilogue, etc. were all part of blatant, but loving, ribbing of QM (Quinn Martin) Productions. (They even had the same ads as the real Q.M.s.) One thing that this too short of a series did not have was a technically increased audience. And boy they probably didn't need any fake channel. The nature of the spoof was such that it required the viewer's dense, almost uninvolved attention, and it turned out to be the ultimate cause of POLICE SQUAD's downfall. <br /> <br /> As for the series cancellation, an ABC Executive explained that the episodes "... required too much attention from the viewer." So, isn't that what you wanted? Then, after only 6 wonderfully crazy, hilarious episodes, went to the afterlife of the series cancellation POLICE SQUAD!, Only to be reborn in the NAKED GUN trilogy, made for the big screen in movie houses. Once again, they did quite well at Box Office. Oh, TV loss is Cinema's gain thanks to Mr. Mr. Idiot TV Exec! <br /> <br /> * HIGH AND MIGHTY was produced by the Duke's own Batjac Productions and published by Warner Brothers. It wasn't available for quite a few years, and finally Mr. Waynes family arrangements to release it to TV and to video.
