The first time I heard about last days was when I rented DVDs and I was interested as I am a member of the LDS Church. I found this movie very deep and in several areas I was crying. The reason for this is that many years ago I knew a young man who went through what Aaron (played by Steve Sandvoss) did in the last few days, but unlike Aaron, this dear young man did not survive the trial. He ended up taking the life after his church, his friends and his family spoiled him because he was gay. There have been many people who do not believe that the things that appear in the movie really happen in this day and age, but it is sad and sad. For those of you who are gay and young, watch this movie and if you are a gay Mormon, you really should watch this movie. Plus, if you get the DVD, there is help for you listed in the DVD. Teenage suicide in the gay world is very disturbing, and this film touches it, but that part is hidden to a degree. The action and the music are excellent. This movie sold out every movie house it showed, but it only showed in big cities and had a very limited release, so for those who would like to watch this movie, I would recommend the DVD release. The only people I know who did not like the film are members of my own church, and they did not see the movie because of the subject of homosexual and LDS church. Watch the movie, experience the story and feel the emotions shown in this movie you feel will not be disappointed.
