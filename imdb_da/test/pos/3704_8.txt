Mother must be one of the time uncomfortable movies to watch. It has an older lady you will love to have as your nanny who will be the most beautiful morf *** ing monster you will ever want to meet on a dark night! <br /> <br /> This supper Nanny eats inside a young lady at the opening of the movie and it just gets sick as it continues. A cross between howling and brain death seems to be remembered when describing Mom! <br /> <br /> A must for horror fans who have their belly in it (if you have been watching an animator or brain death, it will float your boat) and are willing to change the brain for an hour or so. .. Let go of pouring! ... 8/10
