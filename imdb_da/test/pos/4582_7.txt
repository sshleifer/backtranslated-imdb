Yes, I know this movie is meant as a comedy! And humor is over the top! But the theme that people will be less intelligent in the future may not have been fetched so far! I cannot say that it will happen, but if we do not take proper care of our education system than this could be an option! I have noticed that some schools do not teach more! (Like history, geography, basic things). The focus is more on learning practical skills! The theory behind most topics can be boring, but is crucial to understanding how things work! In the film, this ridiculous example is that people grow crops with Gatorade instead of water! Well, we can laugh about it! But if you've never learned that water contains minerals needed for plants to grow, then how would you know it! For me, this is a frightening performance! So now you understand why this topic is no more fun! It may be that Mike Judge does fun, but at the same time warns people about a real disaster whose education doesn't improve fast! Do I go with this movie too! Yes of course! To each their own fun! I loved Mike's work (Beavis and Butthead and Office Space)! In these he was able to be critical and fun at the same time! In "Idiocracy" I missed this! Most of the events are too absurd, and as I said earlier, very frightening! I think if you are in the mood, you will like this movie!
