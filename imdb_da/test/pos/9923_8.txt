'Opera' (1987) <br /> <br /> Director: Dario Argento (Deep Red, Suspiria) Script: Dario Argento and Franco Ferrini (Church, Sleepless, Demons) Photography: Ronnie Taylor (A Chorus Line, Sleepless) Music : Claudio Simonetti (Phenomena, 'Goblin') <br /> <br /> Betty (Cristina Marsillach) is Lady Macbeth understudy of a very stylized scene by Verdi's Macbeth opera. Betty's time to shine comes when the diva star breaks her leg before the night opens when she is hit by a car running away in a tantrum. The famous curse of Macbeth takes a more uncanny and calculating turn when the body count begins to rise immediately. It seems that Betty gets her first fan through a stalker that ties her up and ties her eyes to force her to witness the pigs murder on the people around her. History: 3 out of 5 <br /> Action: Acting in many of these Italian movies can sometimes be difficult to judge. English, Italian, French, German, Spanish can sometimes all be in the same flick as they usually speak their mother tongue that makes the doubling rule of thumb and difficult to judge. As a result, I usually cut them a little limp in the area. Acting: 4 out of 5 <br /> Direction: Giallo maestro Argento goes again the genre helped pioneer. 'Opera' shows him at the top of his game with an exquisite mix of gore, excitement and beauty. Direction: 4 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Visual: This should be one of Argento's best movies. "Opera", printed by Taylor, contains some amazing and inventive cameras that keep the movie running fast and hard and keeping eye candy on the road. The camera always looks like it is a wonderful shot on the camera that goes up a spiral staircase or a sequence towards the end of a bird's eye view of the bird circling the crowd on the opera house. Visual: 5 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Sound: Frequent Argento partner Simonetti (through his various bands Goblin, Demonian and solo efforts) complements the screen's action with zeal as his score touches the classic (Value) to metal musings (with some help from Brian and Roger Eno and Bill Wyman) and locks muscle muscle to the screen's bloody gristle. The sound design gives you everything you need from stabbings to shots, fire to screams and masterfully remastered at the Anchor Bay counter in glorious 6.1 for each crunch and caw. Sound: 5 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Technical: Editing keeps the movie flowing and moving wonderfully. Combined with the camera work, the editing help helps the surreal dreamy image flow. The exquisite opera house is a hell of a place and perfect for arranging the horror version of Macbeth. One cannot finish a review of an Argento movie without having to comment on the killings. Argento gladly sends characters this time with a brilliant stabbing sequence, hood and the film's highlight in a gun blast through a keyhole in the eye and out the back of the headshot, which in turn sends Argento's ex-wife Daria Nicolodi to the film morgue. Priceless! Technical: 5 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Wrap-up: An almost flawless giallo suffering from a slightly unnecessary epilogue in Switzerland that delivers all the visual tensions Argento fans want. <br /> <br /> Overall: 4 out of 5
