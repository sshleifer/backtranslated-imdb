I would hope so, and how can I get involved? <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic and mature with laughs, adventures and an all star, 80's cast! What happens when you assemble a group of jocks and sororities, a group of debating geeks, a band of misfits and couple of couselors? <br /> <br /> A lot of laughs that want you begging for more! <br /> <br /> David Naughton stars as Adam, head of the "yellow team", a friendly and hip college advisor who helps students with everything from getting the classes they want to dance first. <br /> <br /> His nemesis is Harold, the leader of the "blue team" played hilariously by Stephen Furst of "Babylon 5" fame, the not good loafing son of a wealthy, former college jock with enough trophies for to make any hall of famer jealous. <br /> <Bring these two against each other and throw in a "red team", a "white team" and a "green team", an incredible "sight" at an observatory, consequences of cheating on mini golf, a super ride at Pabst B Lue Ribbon Beer Factory and a Hadmild old hostess among other adventures, and you have all the options for a night to remember! Look for appearances by Michael J. Fox, Eddie Deezen and director Andy Tennant in one of the last films he has acted in before becoming director, and you have an all star, fun, cast. <br /> <br /> The only bottom of this movie was Debra Clinger's performance as Laura. She is terribly overstated, but the rest of the movie is so good that she can simply be ignored. <br /> <br /> I own this movie and can never see it enough! <br /> <br />
