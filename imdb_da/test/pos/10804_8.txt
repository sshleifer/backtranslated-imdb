Unlike http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/, this movie does not provide background information. We are shown a snapshot of Danton's fall, his mock process and execution, but unless one studied the revolution quite extensively, it is hard to understand where characters come from (Fouquier-Tinville, Philippeau, Desmoulins, Robespierre ...) and so put Praise them for what they are: Danton and Joe Blobb could be the same person for the viewer. For example, Robespierre & Desmoulin's close friends since their youth and it explains how Robespierre works. However, those who know the facts will easily orient themselves and appreciate this great movie with actors providing solid actors, no useless subgroups and good reconstruction of time. Desmoulins and Danton are the best characters, but everyone does a good job, even the "demented" Saint-Just portrayed as a kind of psychopath. 'Terror' was a period of massacres, the significance of which is not fully documented, and that - for the most part - they were driven by ambition, greed and the settlement of personal disputes, fed with ignorant sans-culottes as the next epocal step towards tyranny.
