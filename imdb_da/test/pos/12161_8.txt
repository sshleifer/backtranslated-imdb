Britain and France declared war on Germany in 1939, but then almost all of Europe had fallen under the Nazi war machine. Entering the war, Britain began largely from scratch, with scarce supplies and with an air force surpassed by Germany ten to one. But the British will was firm, emboldened by their new prime minister, Winston Churchill, who declared - "we must never go under". <br/> <br /> On August 8, 1940, the battle for Britain was on. But for the first time since Hitler's declared attitude to conquering the world, he hit a wall. Even though it was massively exceeded, the British Royal Air Force went on the offensive, and in twenty-eight days in September and October 1940, German Luftwaffe accidents complained to two thousand three hundred seventy-five lost planes and crew. Hitler's rage was fun, but he had to call an instant timeout. In response later this year, Hitler launched a massive fire bombing of London on Christmas Day 1940. When I say that there has never been a disaster film to compete with London's real live recordings in flames during this assault would be an understatement. Perhaps the most surrealistic effect of this chapter in the series "Why We Fight" is to see British citizens coming out of their underground camps after the bombardments to resume what was left of their lives over the earth. Even when you see, there is no way to understand the living horror that these people must have gone through when London was abandoned in virtual destruction. But the Nazis were also stunned and stymied. All that Hitler wanted to believe in freedom and democracy was now turned upside down. Instead of being weak willed and complacent as the French, the British would not give up without a fight. And fighting they did, take the air fight to Germany and react in the wild with attacks on the German homeland. It was a turning point that forced Hitler to rethink his strategy.
