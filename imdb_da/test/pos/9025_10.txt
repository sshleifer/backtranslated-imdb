Okay, then it begins very imaginatively with a story from the protagonist (Justine, who Laura Fraser plays - a great actress in herself), but it continues to become something miraculous. It has stupid little things that you really shouldn't find fun, but do every time. There is a particularly memorable moment that sees your jaw fall to the ground the first time you see it, when Jake's male body containing Justine's female mind tries to get used to her new anatomy. I won't ruin it for you, but the second time I saw it was with friends; seeing their faces was brilliant. It makes you scratch, but laugh at the same time. I'm also a big fan of the music used. There is a beautiful little band that happens randomly on the street or on a path every now and then, but also some beautiful, but still unknown (often the best) pop songs. It has the feeling of being written for an English cast by an American writer who only annoys me a few times. Overall, this movie is fun. I'm a massive fan of Laura Fraser now, after getting her movie for my birthday, and expecting that even though some of the casts are less well known to most, you will also enjoy every part of it.
