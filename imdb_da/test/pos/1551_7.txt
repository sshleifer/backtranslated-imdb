Having been out of the air for a while, Columbo returned with some new TV mysteries that, while not as good as the original series, are better than the shows made in the later 90s. <br /> <br /> "Murder can be dangerous to your health" used the then (and now I think if you think about it) shows real crime as the situation for a murder. The murder is committed by a very successful, egoic true crime presentation host, George Hamilton (in a good deal of casting). His chain-smoking nemesis, who lost the job to him, played by Peter Haskell, tries to chat Hamilton when he discovers a porn video Hamilton made with an underground actress in his salad days. Hamilton uses Haskell's cigarettes to deliver the death blow through poison and gives himself an alibi. <br /> <br /> Columbo is taken to find out what happened. You know the rest. Very entertaining.
