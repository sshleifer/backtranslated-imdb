It starts a bit slowly, but gives it a try. In the spirit of the "Wackiest Ship in the Arm" and "Pink Sub", this film is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to overcome all. Rob Schneider is invaluable as an LT who takes too seriously, resulting in an unsuccessful murder attempt and "pirate" crew makes him go on the plank. In contrast, Kelsey grammar (similar to Cary Grant) takes nothing seriously except the job. This movie is more about lines than plot. From the "deserted" fisherman in Charleston harbor to the "whale" animal, their crimes surprisingly took me over and I laughed out loud.
