There is nothing left that is rejected on this Perry and Croft masterpiece - as well as some of the best episodes, fortunately it was still filmed in time before the late James Beck unfortunately passed by to be included in it to show his talent. <br /> <br> It shows right from the start how the platoon is formed by the national emergency and shows the boys so monstrous during Captain Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) and Sergeant Wilson (John Le Mesurier) as they normally are through the series. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Mainwaring makes its usual longing to show authority, but chaps can't help letting him down at every turn, during wargames, and suspecting an invasion. They have a chance in the movie, even if they redeem themselves when they actually capture the Nazi airmen who take the cemetery hostage. It was a nice finale, especially since Mainwaring was able to prove himself to the general, getting a last chance to shape. A great movie, lots of good lines and laughs, it's another to the DVD cabinet - I'm glad the BBC repeats it - and on this day 2.8.08 they deserved 'Father's Army Night'. Don't miss out!
