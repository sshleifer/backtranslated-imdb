I was not surprised to read a comment from the director that she made this movie an antidote to all of these "making of" DVD feature songs, as it certainly hit me. I admit that I have a penchant for "meta" but I found this movie to be very accessible and entertaining and not even in an unemployed, self-conscious, smart way, which is certainly part of what you expect in a film production film . It is very "French" because there are a lot of incredible but sometimes convincing theories about how filmmaking (and even sexuality) "works", but since the director doesn't play completely (using an avatar instead), we is left with many choices (since I'm pretty sure she constantly contradicts herself). Apparently Catherine Breillat specializes in hard-to-watch movies, but I would definitely say that this one does not qualify. I really enjoyed the dialogue, the balance between the biographical and the natural, the relationship between the director's character and her assistant and actor, and so on. Highly recommended.
