Although Bullet In The Brain is undoubtedly superior to short films, it seems more like a short piece of writing than a movie. And it's a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass comments make him shoot. But after the ball enters his brain, we begin to understand a little about why he was so horrified with life in the first place. There is a terrible amount of detail wrapped in this reasonably short film, and that is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a bit - it looks like there is almost too much to do at one time, then The details will fly you fast. A slightly more relaxed pace and a smaller po-faced narrative in the last paragraph would have benefited this film a little. Despite these complaints, there is no denial that Bullet In The Brain is a fairly widespread work compared to many short and even full movies. The actors should be applauded for trying to make such a basic emotional and literary film in the current climate with fast jokes and Hollywood action.
