Chicago reporter Frank Quinlan decided to go to Iowa to confirm the existence of a so-called angel. He was not alone. His partner Huey Driscoll and the new colleague Dorothy Winters also came to him. When they arrived at the destination, they found that the angel Michael was quite different from what they expected. But Frank still persuaded Michael to go to Chicago with them. So an interesting journey began. <br /> <br /> Although Michael didn't look like a weekend, he was a friendly and fun angel. In fact, Michael owned irresistibly charming women. Even because of other men's jealousy, he was involved in a revolt. The Climax appeared in the pizza restaurant. Dorothy sang lively country songs to Frank. It was just what Michael wanted to see. But the next day, Huey's dog was crashed to the death of a running car. Michael was asked to save it. It would be used to check if he was a true angel. Andie Macdowell shone in this comedy. She also showed her song friend. John Travolta proved his comedy talent again. For this reason, Pulp Fiction was still his typical work. A comedy that will warm your heart. 8.10
