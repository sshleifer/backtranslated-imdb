I watched this movie in its short run in "art house" cinema in '69. I found it so much fun that I literally spent part of the movie on the floor as I was so laughed, I fell out of my seat. In retrospect, years later, I thought it had been done by Melvin Van Peebles. When I mentioned it to a friend, he said that a friend of his, Downey Sr., filled almost every non-functioning role in the girl: Director, Author Producer, etc. Of course, he was right and my memory was wrong except from that this was one of the fun movies ever made. The part of "the Arab" was particularly invaluable.
