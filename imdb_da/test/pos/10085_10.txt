This is one of the best movies I've ever seen ... It's so full of detail, and every time you see it, you'll find new things ... Just as the father is in the shower but still only hears one voice, and When the girls whistle, they cannot do it at the same time, as there would be two girls and there are not. <br /> <br /> I have some trouble figuring out if in the middle of the movie their "uncle" visits them, but why does his wife jump out?!? Otherwise a great movie. !!! The best Asian movie ever. <br /> <br /> I hope people will enjoy it. There have been so many movies where the protagonist is crap-so (The Machinist, Secret Window and so on), but this movie is far better than them !!!
