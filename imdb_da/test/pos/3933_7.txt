Many people flame this movie for the presence of Paris Hilton, but it is not a reasonable reason to protest against the film. The reality is that Paris has a rather minimal share, she spends the vast majority of the film's offscreen. The film also makes fun of her on several occasions, which usually involves a camera and at least once in night vision. For those who enjoy Paris Hilton's scene presence, it may be a movie to watch at home when released on video because I was on the screen, we all laughed at her accidents through the movie and she is portrayed as a "woman of dubious values ​​". <br /> <br /> The movie itself was pretty good (unlike the recent flood of weak horror flicks), it has everything a good horror should have; an eerie villain, excessive violence, actions that make the average person cringe ... this movie hit all the bases. It is definitely worth a look.
