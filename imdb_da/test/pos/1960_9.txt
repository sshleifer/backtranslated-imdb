I've seen this movie a number of times and find it very convincing and sad. The lack of true emotions from most characters is very disturbing. They seem empty, hopeless. The story is based on a real event. <br /> <br /> A teenage girl is murdered by her boyfriend without any obvious reason - apparently he just felt it. Then he boasts about it to his friends, and since they don't believe in him, he takes them to see the body - a number of times. No one reports the murder. There are two strong leaders - Keanu Reeves and Crispen Glover - Crispen Glover's character is seriously annoying. Keanu's character Matt seems to be the only one who has a sense of right and wrong. This is Keanu at his best - a flawless performance and very credible - anyone who thinks this man can't act should watch this movie. Matt's little brother is almost the most disturbing sign in the movie. Only twelve and no compassion or love factor in his life. It is very sad to believe that there are children out there like this. It really makes you grateful for what you have. 10.9.
