I have long despised network TV programming, I remember the first time I caught an episode of "Police Squad!". It was completely by accident. It was during the show's first network running on ABC in early 1982. I am a chronic channel surfer and flew the call one evening when suddenly "Police Squad!" It's opening sequence on my TV screen. I immediately recognized it as a broadcast of the opening credits of "M-Squad" starring Lee Marvin, one of my all-time favorite police shows. I stopped surfing. Then, of course, the headquarters came up, followed by the immortal Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln. At that time I said to myself, "What the heck is that?" Then came "special guest star" Georg Stanford Brown becomes flat of a plummeting safe. I was hooked from that moment. The episode was "Ring of Fear / A Dangerous Assignment", with its comic references to "On the Waterfront" and "Muhammad Ali", but most memorable were, of course, all views and non-successors. Leslie Nielsen and Alan North in their races of Lee Marvin and Paul Newlan of "M Squad" were an absolute riot. "Finally," I said to myself, "A network TV program really worth seeing !!!". Wouldn't you know it would be canceled just a few weeks later. Let it be for the network - I should have known. Anyway, I just bought the DVD collection of all six episodes and they are just as fun today as they were 27 years ago. The "Naked Gun" movies were also great, but I really missed Alan North (he was as good as Ed Hocken), Peter Lupus as Nordberg (what did they think about casting OJ in that part?), And especially William Duells "Johnny "the shoeshine guy. Good cases.
