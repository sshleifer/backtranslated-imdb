This movie is a warning to all people surfing the internet on a typical day in the office. My warning is, Don't reveal too much about yourself, 2 Beware who you are crossing !! There are spies on this internet thing. I thought it was so scary what the combination of men and women did for poor Angela Bennett, I didn't understand anyone could take them away in a click with this mouse. Angela, I thought a strong job of persuading Jack Delvin and the horrible girl my question is, why does that computer make that sound when it works? as a click sound mine does not do this or this. This movie also tells you that there is fraud on this internet Also why couldn't Angela make the virus destroy the program on a CyberCafe? I also thought that, like all computers, the disk transfer rate was slow, properly reproduced in this movie when you save the program to your floppy disk, the bar only moved slowly !!! I also liked Angela's house at the beginning of the movie. Why didn't anyone think of Angela ???
