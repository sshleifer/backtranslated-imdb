This is a very underrated movie to say the least. As has been pointed out in previous posts, this movie has a somewhat lost and highly unlikely script, but you find yourself saying "Who cares?" while you shoot milk (or paste the drink of your choice here) through your nose. In fact, it was due to a rare mix of players in synchronization. While Kelsey Grammar is of course a gifted actor (the reference 'Frasier', this movie), the entertaining actors / actor play their roles quite well. I found interesting how they threw in that part about Duane Martin, who blew the shot in the big game for Navy's basketball team; If any of you are a basketball fan, remember Martin from 'white men can't jump' and 'over the rim' and you know that Martin had a short stint in the NBA with knicks. Well, how they threw in credible character attributes like this. Rob Schneider's anal-retentive character was the perfect compromise with the calm behavior of grammar. Lauren Holly played the gutsy-sexpot-with-a-brain well enough to make her succeed. This is a movie that makes you laugh even though you have seen it many times before ... the comic bits in this movie surely last. I still think I laugh 12 years later. <br /> <br /> "Is it one of my chickens?" "Uhhh ... no. This is a parrot .... from the Caribbean." "Don't let it fly away ... it's dinner." "Arrrrr ..... arr."
