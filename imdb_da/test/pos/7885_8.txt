New York's contemporaries with this movie will remember how reflective of their time it is and how well cast and crew captured America, New York City in that era. Norman Wexler's script delimits the different worlds the different subgroups live in and Avildsen's direction brings out phenomenal performances around. Peter Boyle's wonderful talent appears like never before or since. It is clear that this is the best portrayal ever made by Dennis Patrick. <br /> <br /> What I always remember about JOE is the feeling of having been in a virtual state of shock coming out of the theater. Knowing that the screen shot depicted beneath the surface in neighborhoods of the five districts of New York City. <br /> <br /> Remember this movie.
