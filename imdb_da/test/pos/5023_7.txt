Warm-hearted flic depicts arch-angel Michael as a brawling, obese, cigarette-smelling slob who loves to dance and cavort with the opposite sex. However, he has a good side as he strives to put things right in the life of a few burnt losers before they are recalled to heaven. Fun, well-played movie; very entertaining, though a little annoying.
