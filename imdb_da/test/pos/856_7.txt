Stephanie Meyer is so crossed! Now her book "Breaking Dawn" is not first with that title. Sorry, Twilight fans. <br /> <br /> Kelly Overton (The Ring Two) is a medical student, Eva, who is awarded interview psychotic Don (James Haven - Angelina Jolie's brother). I suspected the twist and when she found out, they both grew up in the same town, I was sure of it. <br /> <br /> She kept getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point I felt there was a shared error going on. At times she even seemed to have PTSD. I really thought she was losing it. <br /> <br /> Now she was not losing it, and when the end came, I became the floor. My whole suspicion turned out to be wrong. The twist was even more amazing than I thought. Overton was amazing and the story is so much better than anything Stephanie Meyer would bring. One should see.
