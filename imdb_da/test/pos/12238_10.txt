Basically, an entertaining chintzy and moronic $ 1.50 version of the nifty early 80s underground creature is the favorite "The Boogens", this entertaining schlocky cheapie centers on an unpleasant, crushing, twisting monster that makes an instant meal out of unfortunate souls who are stupid enough to throw around the infamous off limits Gold Spike Mine. Your standard-problem assortment of intrepid boneheads - hectoring hardnosed my boss, sweet but rude blonde babe, feisty lady geologist, boozy, inexplicable Aussie-accented (!) Spiced old my hand, charmless doofus, hunky, jolly guy, and no doubt the most annoying character of the uniformly annoying pile, a nerdy respected aspiring writer dweeb, who tends to speak in flowery, melodramatic expressions - pulling into the dark, relentless cave in search of gold. Of course, these non-impenetrable imbeciles discover that the alleged abandoned mine is home to a lethal, ugly, multi-tentative beast, which over time honored the hoary B-flick mode continues to gruesomely pose the group one at a time. Directed, co-written, co-produced and co-edited with dumbfounding maladroitness by Melanie Anne Phillips, acted with horror of flattery at a rank unnamed cast, further appalled by lethargic pacing, a dull, tantalizing narrative, creepy, sublime, eye -training cinematography, a shivery, redundantly thudding pseudo-John Carpenter synthesizer score and a cruddy, herky-jerky stop motion animation wormoid thingie that only gleamed at the end of the movie, this extremely clumsy, amateurish and thus completely delectably horrible wild be scarefest commits all the bad film errors needed to qualify as a real four star stinkeroonie.
