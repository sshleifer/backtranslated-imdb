Many years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The Machine). When I repeated this little book again and again, I could never stop becoming more and more fascinated by the author's imagination and the wealth of Brazilian culture. <br /> <br /> When I knew about the movie, I was really afraid someone would ruin one of my favorite books! I was glad my fear was unjustified and the film is such a wonderful and delicate work of art. <br /> <br /> I can't remember any other movie that could put tears in the eye because of the very beautiful of the text. Also I can't remember such a powerful performance as Gustavo Falcão. <br /> <br /> You can see and feel how colossal his love for Karina is. You can realize that he will move mountains and do everything for this love. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, see it through the eyes of the child living in you, enchant yourself!
