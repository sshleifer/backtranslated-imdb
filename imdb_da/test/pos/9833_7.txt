I admit that I have been a fan of Harrison Ford for many years now, so it did not surprise me that I enjoyed his performance here. But I also enjoyed the way the story evolved and thought that the casting was well done. I do not know if I "buy in" Kristin Scott Thomas as a congresswoman, but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman. I noticed her in the first Mission Impossible. Although her part was small, she stuck on the screen. Here and Ford play people whose spouses are killed in a plane crash. They sit together and this is where the plot goes. Apparently, Ford, a police detective in Wash D.C., discovers his wife had an affair. He also discovers that the affair was with a New England Congresswoman. <br /> <br /> The story takes on many subplots, as Ford and Thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their marriages, uncovered by deception and pure sorrow and anger over the loss of a loved one. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is worth either renting or catching on cable.
