I'm a guy, so I was very reluctant to watch the movie, because I know Richard Gear likes to be in tear movies. I'd rather see action / adventure / sci fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a fogger. Diane used to act over a couple of times, like Richard, but they brought it around and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teen with great attitude, so you started to hate her. The movie is too predictable, but for entertainment it was a masterpiece. Go rent it, see if you don't throw a tear. Lol If you like the laptop, you will love this one. Beach scenes were immaculately shot. Although the hurricane scenes were a bit off the sequence, it was still a little panic to see them react to it.
