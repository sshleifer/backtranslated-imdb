I seriously enjoy Dr Who. <br /> <br /> Seriously, don't just dismiss me as a "sci-fi person" because I'm usually not. I caught on because a friend got me hooked when they started to see it. It's really fun, and more often than not, it's fast. My whole family sees it a lot, and it's a miracle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Ecclestion is pretty good, but David Tennant is brilliant. I think that's because he made the doctor so manic, and it's just nice to have that little bit of eccentricity in a TV sign again. <br /> <br /> I don't know what it is about, but everything works like clockwork. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is just try it out. An episode (probably best if you don't choose the other half of a two-party, though).
