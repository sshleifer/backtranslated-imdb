Based on the 1952 autobiography "A Many-Splendouring Thing", "Love is a Many-Splendored Thing" (1955), the story of Han Suyin, which focuses on the romance that He, a widow of Europe in 1949, had with a married American correspondent named Mark Elliott. "I don't want to feel anything again, ever" He tells Mark soon after they meet, but the two soon develop the mutual irresistible to each other, and who can blame them? Mark is being played by William Holden at the peak of his coup period (the following year's "Picnic" would be the top) in this, the first of three films over the next seven years to find Holden in China (1960s "Suzie Wong World "and 1962" Satan Never Sleeps "are the others). And Dr. He is here played by Jennifer Jones, who, although not a Eurasian (as opposed to yummy Nancy Kwan and beautiful France Nuyen of the other exotic Holden films), does a credible work of going like one. Whether it's dressed in cheongsam, European dress, surgical dress or (hubba hubba!) Swimsuit, Jones looks ridiculously beautiful here. No wonder East meets West in this movie so dramatically! With its two appealing lead stars, breathtaking Hong Kong scenery, beautiful CinemaScope and color, Oscar-winning costumes and the classic, Oscar-winning title song that wafts through the film as a lovely incense, "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing" to to be right the winning and romantic concoction. Of course, he didn't care about the picture, so I can only imagine that great freedoms were taken with her source material. Anyway, I enjoyed it. And if the film's ending gets a tear to get to the eye, just remember Mark's words of wisdom: "The greatest tragedy of life should not be loved."
