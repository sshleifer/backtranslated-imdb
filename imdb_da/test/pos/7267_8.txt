.. is Princess Bride meet ... well Trainspotting. But wait, it's a good combination! This was definitely one of the better movies I've seen for a long time ... it has that kind of witty dialogue I associate with the princess bride or cemetery man, along with the vile scenes of violence of a horror movie ... the heroic feeling of Princess Bride combined with (this is strange) lack of any really good guys that Trainspotting had. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it was as good as the princess bride, but it was in the arena and it rocked. Some of the dialogue pleasantly transcends to brilliant, the plot is interesting, the characters - while they are light anachronistic - are anachronistic not because of their own character (there were flamboyant gay people in the 18th century as opposed to a previous reviewer's remarks) but only in a little of the language they used. The anachronisms made it fun, and NOT cheesy and easily dismissed. <br /> <br /> If you've ever read any Simon R. Green or Gleen Cook's Garrett series, you know exactly what this movie is. Check it out. It is well.
