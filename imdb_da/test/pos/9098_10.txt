Jack Black and Kyle Gas hold together to promote their band Tenacious D in this Rock Classic called Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. Jack Black and Kyle Gass invent their own Rock Opera. It was like an Opera of Rock 'N' Roll. Some of the most distorted events took place in that movie .... the big foot .... the fungal part .... and finally when they made the rock against the devil. A classic formed in Tenacious D .... one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. The last few things I saw in the theater were stupid .. but this movie rock. This really made me laugh hard. The whole foundation is Jack Black running to find his rock partner in Los Angeles. His partner is Kyle Gass and man who has always been bald. They work together to find this magical pick that can make the most horrible musician play a lot. They finally make it to the Rock 'N' Roll Museum and steal the pick. On the way, they meet The Stranger played by Tim Robbins. They make it to the club to win their prize money when the owner grabs the pick and he was always the devil, and he fights D in a Rock Off. D'en does not win, but the devil's horn falls and sends him back to hell. That's why LIVE LIVE D !!!!!!!!!!
