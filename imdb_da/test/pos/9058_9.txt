I went to watch this movie with caution. A suicidal "comedy" did not seem uniform. Having a brother who has tried suicide and seeing the devastation that has caused our entire family, I know firsthand how crushing it can be to deal with this problem. I must say - This film deals with it in a way that allows the viewer to "inside" someone who suffers and simply does not know why or how to stop it. While the film is not perfect, it respects the subject and, more importantly, makes it accessible to the masses. I know for our family, humor has helped us through a lot of pain. And Max and Grace are just what it turns out to be - a suicide skill. It's fun - and I also felt that characters were real and alive. It is also very intelligent, yet simple. It cuts the hunt and I appreciate it! I give it a 9 and would recommend it.
