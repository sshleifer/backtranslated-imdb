To rewrite Thora Birch: "I'm like this movie. It's the opposite of everything I hate in a movie." <br /> <br /> This fuzzy film was too low and intelligent to get a theatrical release, any chance of success would have needed an expensive campaign campaign. And an upcoming age story, where nothing spectacular happens - where instead there is a focus on character development, has a limited target group. Who's heard about a mature teen movie? <br /> <br /> But if you have the opportunity to see this or if you can share with a few bucks for the DVD, you can do much worse. "My teacher's wife" is not a revolutionary thing, but it has a lot to do for it and stays well on repetitive prospects. <br /> <br /> Jason London (as high school senior Todd Boomer) is the star and fits this character as well as his parts in "The Man In the Moon" and "Dazed and Confused". He is assisted by extraordinary work from his support. Tia Carrere in the title role is a revelation (she can act) like Todd's calculus tutor and love interest. Christopher McDonald teaches in a good self-paced performance. Zak Orth and Alexondra Lee as Todd's best friends, and Jeffrey Tabor as his father. <br /> <br /> As someone commented earlier, this is a "mature" teen movie because the romantic relationships are universally unsuccessful - at least by traditional happy ending. Even Todd's parents do not care about each other, where his father pledges for the title character and his mother (Leslie Lyles) literally on the phone throughout his time on the screen (a device that gives increasing comedy help with each subsequent look). London-Carrere romance has unexpected charm and is far more credible than any other older women's story you are likely to find. <br /> <br /> But the real strength of the movie is the three friends that evolve. There is no overwhelmed melodrama here, only three immature people who switch between testing and trusting each other, subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to this kind of thing. In fact, they are able to draw a "credible" three-person relationship, perhaps the first in cinema history. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
