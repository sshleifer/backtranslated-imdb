Not much to say other than that is simply a masterpiece. This film contains a myriad of messages that everyone must take to heart. especially - women do not scare your husband's dreams - hear them - that's why you loved him in the first place! Those who plan to die will live in the grave. Those who carpe diem will awaken those who live in fear. Even our Lord spoke of this when he chastised the one who buried his talent in fear of being able to make a mistake and disturb the Master. Take a risk, get out of the boat and you want to go on water. Life is a journey that does not end in the grave, but in our minds and souls.
