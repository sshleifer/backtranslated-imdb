When I saw L'Appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed: "How complicated!" And of course she has it right. When you are used to simple one-line plots, especially violent hero vs. bad guys, L'Appartement is difficult to follow. A few of the negative reviewers here have also missed one or more important points. Second whine about confusing flash backs. Come on! It's not the kind of movie you can leave to visit the toilet, come back and get connected again within seconds. This requires full concentration and a huge eye on the details. Then it's really not that hard to find out what's going on and when. The director has left more than enough tracks in all scenes. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the film deals with the question: Why did Max and Lisa split? The movie, which my boyfriend noticed, begins as a romantic love, suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again. Having experienced French films, I predicted that the story would soon get a sick twist and I was right. At the end of the first part, it becomes clear, after many words, that Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max did not know that Lisa had left and why. Lisa did not know why Max did not contact her in Rome and left her without trace as she returned to Paris. The only one who did was Alice, and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut. <br /> <br /> After both Max and Lisa have found out the truth, the question becomes of course: can Alice's manipulations be undone? Well, of course not, the time has passed and things have changed. Many European films use a storytelling technique that I fully enjoy. There is no starting point in the basic conflict at first, after which two (or more) interested parties try to determine for their own benefit. Instead, the spectator is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. In the first half, Alice seems to be a side character; slowly it becomes clear that she is a key figure. <br /> <br /> Shopping is simply amazing. Vincent Cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character who risks a secure life just to pursue a dream of the past. Monica Belucci is very beautiful of course, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey gives the necessary comic touch. Romane Bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman, afflicted by feelings of guilt and regret. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is the somewhat unsatisfactory end. It was of course necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all the events, Max is exactly at the point where the movie began, only wiser and sad. Alice paid for her sins. However, the small turns at the airport are a bit artificial. Max for easy exchanging Lisa for Alice; Alice decides to easily reject Max who has been her dream for so long; Max too easily returns to his fiance. But then again I do not know how this could be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry. I think sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.
