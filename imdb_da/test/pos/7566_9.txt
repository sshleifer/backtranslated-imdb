Someone certainly has the wind, and I can't believe that what I saw on the screen has a lot to do with it. This is a better and more solid movie than most of the independent I see all year round. The cinematography shows a true love and mastery of the craft, and the casting was just fine. I would love to see more of these people, especially Zeke Rippy. <br /> <br /> As for the story and the script, I'm not so sure that the negative comments prior to this post were written in order to inform someone else about the movie. The elongated nit-based bashing posts that must have taken hours to compose and are the only comments ever left for any movie on this page by the reviewer, are obvious fakes aimed at the producers of the film. I don't know the inside story, but it would make a good movie. What I know about being around this biz is that productions trying to make everyone happy to end up being horrible and when the filmmaker has gut, drive and common sense to "kill the babies," ends a person always with evil feelings. It is also part of the biz and one of the finest learning tools available to those who are truly dedicated to doing so in the film industry. Of course, the bugs have nothing better to do than sit at home and write fake reviews on the internet as a form of vendetta against those who snubbed them (read: were honest and truthful with them). And it is my best guess to explain the unpleasant, unpleasant reviews. In as much as there is a grain of sand behind everything, there is a point to be made, but these exaggerations of the grains are so over the top that they are obviously fictitious. It is not a slasher bloodbath, if that is what you are looking for, it is more the psychological tension thriller that is typically not appreciated by the lowest common denominators out there. The best way to watch this movie is to try to show any preconceived notion, pop it in and let it unfold - seriously, signs are defined by their actions and words, and when you see what these people do and what they say , I don't think you can get away with the conclusion that these signs were poorly developed. Poorly understood maybe. <br /> <br /> All in all, I agree that this is a nicely finished, compelling movie. Maybe I wouldn't have given it a 9 under normal circumstances, but the serious negative comments actually attracted me to the picture (I have a secret love for really bad cinema). For me, the judgments under 5 must be reserved for the shocky, eerie, badly acted and stupidly written films. None of this applies here - it is quality film making with some real talent in there. I gave it to the nine to tip the scales back in the right direction. Watch the movie and tell me I'm wrong.
