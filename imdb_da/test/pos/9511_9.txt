I have never seen a file in a language I do not understand just because I wanted to watch the movie and I could not find it with English subs. I don't know how much I missed, but it wasn't much. Probably just specific details that sound silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact together. I would like to mention The Diceman from Germany, there is no reason to feel he 'sucks' when it comes to commenting on the film's emotional strength. As I said, I do not understand Japanese - or at least only the very small amount I came from, from reading the very long novel - probably my favorite whole time book that I could not put down and took the next day out work just to finish reading! I do not know if there is an English dubbed or subbed version, but if the movie, but if there is, I would love to see it. The movie was incredible in Japanese something better is icing on the cake !!
