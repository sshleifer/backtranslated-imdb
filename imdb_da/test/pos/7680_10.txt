When I was a kid, my grandmother took me to see this movie. And I fell in love with it. I admired Dorothy Dandridge so much and would be like her. I fell in love with Sidney Poitier. Pearl Bailey made me laugh. And Sammy Davis Jr. was as big as Sportin Life. The music was just breathing. When I had my first son and the movie came on TV, I let him see it, and to this day he has never forgotten this movie. He loved it. I always remember Porgy and Bess. It has a special place in my heart now and now. I really want them to restore this movie because it was one of the greatest movies ever to have been with an all star "Black Cast".
