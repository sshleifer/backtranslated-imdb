If you have nothing better to do then continue and rent this movie, it is intelligent, fun, it will surely have your attention busy for a while. I discover it by surfing channels in a boring Sunday, it was on cable, and for those faces I saw, I thought it was possible to try, it made me laugh and for a movie on a Sunday with nothing else on tv, it was ok. Liv Tyler looks great in the movie, although her play is not what I expected, it was a little bad play, and for the rest of the crew I liked Reba in her role as a dr. I found it interesting to see the guy from the sitcomet "What I Like About You" plays an almost gay lawyer. <br /> <br /> As for J. Goodman, I found Michael Douglas as always a very good performance, but his characterization was difficult for me to identify. <br /> <br /> It is also a good movie to see at the company.
