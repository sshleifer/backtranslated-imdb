Being from the Buffalo area, I realized that the film had read many articles in local publications. I was most impressed with the movie, especially its clever plot, play and local scenes. Nice to see so many older, quality stars in the different roles. I feel that especially those of us over 50 will find the movie excellent and you can let the theater feel your time was well spent.
