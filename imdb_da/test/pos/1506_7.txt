Fulci ... Does this man bring one of the most beautiful and strange films ever made? Answer: yes! Cat in the Brain, also known as Nightmare Concert, is Fulci's last masterpiece. Yes it is, no matter what some people will say about it. There are few facts why this movie is one of the best Fulci's movies. <br /> <br /> Fulci makes a fun of himself and his movie with this. Lead role in this movie is nothing more than Fulci himself, who plays ... well horror-splatter-making instructor who thinks he's slowly going crazy. It is filled with black humor, which, unlike most modern horror films, works here. Being a Fulci flick, you need to know it's gory. How much? Well, well. I have always loved doing in the movies, and I never get enough of it, but Cat in Brain actually stopped my thirst and believe me it's hard to archive. Even Braindead didn't stop it. CITB is about gore. Almost every scene is about Fulci, who, after being hypnotized by * khmmm * evil psychiatrists, sees all kinds of horror for everything that happens to him or everything he sees. Some of the scenes mean that he accidentally releases whiskey, and instead of seeing a mess lying on the floor, starting to spit something from that wound. Forget about Beyond or Zombie 2, this is the most beautiful Fulci movie! Now I like how Fulci manages to use all these comics in the gorefest movie. He is such a brilliant director. Some fun moments and lines happen from time to time, just as Fulci says "making gorilla movies is a kind of illness". Ending is very good considering that Fulci (and most Italian masters) know that it is not sensible or many plot holes. If you are fun of Fulci, be sure to check it out. If you have a weak stomach, avoid this and repeat "It's just a movie" ps. some of the scenes in this movie: chain saw dismemberment (full), heavy torn out, eyebrows torn out, maggot infected bodies, zombies, neck, face being put in boiling water, sticking in the shower (head) many parts of the body and organs gets toast aside, hammer smashed face ...
