What can I say? The fake of Monkey Island is amazing. The story is good and solid, but appropriately stupid, the jokes are hillarious, the puzzles are enigmatic ... you couldn't ask for more in an adventure game. "You don't have to see my identification" bit is in itself worth buying the game, not to mention Murray, who has become the hot topic among many of my friends (only some of them have played the game). You will love this game. And if you don't, so bad!
