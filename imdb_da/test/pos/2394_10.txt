I loved this movie, independent film production at its best. Cinematography, pacing, rhythm and acting were perfectly synchronized. Fred Carpenters best work to date! The film is well written with lots of plot twists that take you to a great end. It moves well and keeps you involved. As a photographer, I was most impressed with the cinematography. The lighting creates a mood and a beauty that is usually found in a much larger budget film. This gave the actors a great canvas to start from, to work their magic. And that's just what they did! Great performances from all actors and each one was well cast in their roles. As I said at the beginning, it's a wonderful movie, and one of Fred Carpenter's best movies. You will love it.
