With a movie with Twins, Ekin Cheng and Edison Chen, no one should expect a masterpiece of cinema. However, what you get is a fun movie that is easy on the eye and in the brain. There are lots of Hollywood-style vampires (no jumping Chinese blood sugar here), cute girls, beautiful heroes and the occasionally very fun moment. And Jackie Chan. <br /> <br /> Of course, kung-fu is dependent on wire work and CGI. Sure, the script reminds you of Blade. And of course, the whole affect is immediately forgettable. <br /> <br /> But for a really fun movie movie, you would be hard pressed to find better.
