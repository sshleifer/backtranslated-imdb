It is really not hard to understand this movie! I saw it without expectations and no knowledge of the history of the games. I was completely gone! <br /> <br /> Initially, I wondered how most of the characters have some kind of super powers, but it's called "Final Fantasy ...". I also wondered about Clouds' past, but it was easy enough to look up. In no way did these issues ruin the film's enjoyment. Just the opposite; It shows that I continued to think of the story long after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> It's one of the most beautiful movies my eyes have ever seen. The music fully supports the movie. The characters are incredible. <br /> <br /> I want more!
