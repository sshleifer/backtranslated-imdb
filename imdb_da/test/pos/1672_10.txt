If the captain owes much to Walter Huston, it also has a gratitude to Jules Dassin, a man who was before his time and who suffered greatly from his blacklist, when Edward Dmytryk accused him of being a communist. The end of his US career would have meant the end of Mr. Dassin, but moving to Europe turned out to be bigger than the same people who had contributed to his Hollywood death. <br /> <br /> "Rififi" is an elegant film where all the right elements come together thanks to Mr Dassin's vision. He decided to adapt Auguste Le Breton's novel because he saw the possibilities of making it a hijacking movie that became an instant classic. Jules Dassin was barren in Paris when he discovered the city that was to serve as the background for his film. The bad weather paid for Mr Dassin, as the streets were always wet and not much had to be done to show them that way. <br /> <br /> When we first meet Tony, he plays short. Tony seems to be in poor health; he coughs all the time and sweats profusely. After losing all his money, he goes to see Jo, the Swede, telling him about the possibility of robbery at Maupin & Webb, the fancy jewelry store at a tony part of Paris. They survive the idea through Mario, who suggests Cesar, Milanese, an expert safe cracker. Tony, who has come out of prison recently, learns that Mado, his former lover, is now with Grutter, a creeper who owns a nightclub. By confronting Mado, instead of love, everything he feels feels contempt and the meeting ends badly, and he throws her out of her place. Grottoes have no love for Tony, who is his natural enemy because of his connection with Mado. <br /> <br /> When the day comes, the gang is able to get to the apartment where on the second floor just above the jewelry store lives the owner but he is gone. Everything goes well and the gang gets away with the jewels. Cesar, Milanese, a typical ladies man, takes a ring as a souvenir, which again gives chanteuse at Grutter's night club. This tactical error is the spark that unravels the well-thought plan. <br /> <br /> Jean Servais made an excellent Tony. He showed a tired man who might have made his last robbery. Carl Mohner, Robert Manuel and director, Jules Dassin, are seen as Jo, Mario and Cesar, the Quartet jewelry thieves. Marie Sabouret plays Mado. Marcel Lupovici plays Grutter with a subdued intensity. Robert Hussein, who would later go directly to film, gives an impression with his Remi, one of Grutter's men. <br /> <br /> The movie's best asset is the great camera work of Philippe Agostini, who captured the atmosphere of Paris and the places where all these criminals operate. Georges Auric's music plays well with action in the movie. Jules Dassin was peculiar in his choice of film that he instructed, and unfortunately, it is our loss, because this man was a genius, which was particularly evident with "The Naked City", "Night and the City" and "Rifif".
