I have noticed and enjoyed the very rich expression ability of the main actress, Julianne Nicholson. I have no words to describe how much I have enchanted. All the actors and actors played well. In particular, I noticed the solid good character that has been consistent with predicting the future - Andy Richter, who played Carl. I think the idea of ​​showing a number of friends and family members with different opinions and the many counseling meetings is like the real world. Jay Mohr, who played Ed, the future man, also played very real behavior. But I would like to emphasize again the point with the very rich expression repertoire that Julianne Nicholson is capable of doing it naturally, was overwhelming for me. In fact, the subject that this film handles seems to me to be very important, and many people touch highly meaningful thoughts. I've seen this movie several times and haven't bored me. It travels over and over in my mind.
