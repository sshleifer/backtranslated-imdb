This was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound. In the comic, Mickey does not yet use gloves. He doesn't speak either. All he does is flute and play music. The song he plays is "Turkey in the straw" by using more pets as musical instruments. For example, he plays the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and pulls the groom as an accordion keyboard. I taped this cartoon out of the Disney Channel, and I think it's wonderful. It was based on a silent movie starring Buster Keaton entitled "Steamboat Bill, Jr."
