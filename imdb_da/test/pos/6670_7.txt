Who is the man ~ ~ ~ what do I belong to? A resounding cry of Kevin? Well, if you didn't shout for the 'usual suspect', I'd recommend changing your medical prescription. Still, it's not a premium movie, just a very well-produced story, it's almost credible. Considering its about an Alien you probably wonder what? All actions are top stuff and also the first I have seen a balanced, sarcastic Alien. Just fun is all I can say and almost for the whole family (if not for the stage later in the movie). Seven stars
