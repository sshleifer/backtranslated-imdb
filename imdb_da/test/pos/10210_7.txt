While escaping from a hoist on a bank, outlaw Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) helps Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), the Western Union's top engineer, to monitor the wild west and have had an accident with a horse. In 1861, Vance regenerates and is hired to work for Western Union with the team that installs the poles and cable from Omaha to Salt Lake City. Vance and Harvard Richard Blake engineer (Robert Young) flirt with beautiful Edward's sister Sue Creighton (Virginia Gilmore) and she chooses Vance. But his past haunts him when the ban Jack Slade (Barton MacLane) steals the Western Union cattle disguised by Indians. <br /> <br /> Western Union is a good but predictable Western directed by Fritz Lang. The story shows the difficulties of the brave and idealistic men who are responsible for installing telegraph through the West, against hesitation and Indians. The entertaining story has action, drama, romance and fun situations, but with the exception of Jack Slade's identity, there is no surprise in history. Randolph Scott gives another great performance with a great cast. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Conquistadores" ("The Conquerors")
