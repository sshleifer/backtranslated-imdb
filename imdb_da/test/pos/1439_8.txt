A dark and painful look at the dangers of drug abuse, Sinatra is wonderful in this movie. Just seeing his frenzied writhing and screaming and devastating rage at the end of the movie is enough to get someone to think twice about trying heroin; Maybe they should show it to children in health class instead of the fun-filled drive we are forced to endure year after year. It is the story of a man who simply tries to create a new, clean life for even after being in prison, trying to get rid of his drug abuse and his work on handling cards in illegal play operations that have been pulled down. back in the muck of human nature. He is exploited by his employers, drug dealers, and even his enigmatic, swallowed, yet stupid wife. <br /> <br /> Even if you didn't like the movie itself, it's worth watching just for the soundtrack. It's all heavy, swinging jazz with big drum and brass sections. This with its groovke, but a little bad sound helps set the mood with the grinning, snaky drug and card dealers who always seem to hover like vultures around the Frankie Machine. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to anyone - especially if you like movie noir, zoot suits, fedoras or jazz.
