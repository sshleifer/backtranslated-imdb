I know Gerrit. He currently lives in the United States. This film is based on events in both Gerrits and Celeste Wolfaardt's life. It's a remarkable story. It inspired me to read "Cry, Beloved Country." The film is well produced. The music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The story is told in flashbacks. You learn the stories of a white racist South African (Gerrit) and a black South African (Moses). Their life cuts violently. The end is not typically Hollywood - it is exceptionally realistic and ends with a note that encourages you to think about the characters and themes. <br /> <br /> Be sure to look through the credits - you will see pictures of Gerrit in real life.
