It was a rare treat to see "Checking Out". I was touched by the characters, laughed a lot at the wonderful script and was deeply moved by the genuine feelings adorned by this ensemble cast and especially by Peter Falk. In fact, one of his scenes in the kitchen in his apartment with his children, where he tells of his experience of his life, his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life ahead, is so deep that it is the highest level of the best Academy Award-winning performances. He is an accomplished actor who made himself into this movie. Screenwriter offers a combination of literary knowledge, timing, a gift for dialogue and hilarious situations that had me laughing loudly in the theater. I highly recommend "Checking Out" to anyone who wants to enjoy quality storytelling excellently acted.
