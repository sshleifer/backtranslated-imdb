As a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the history of sport, I was pleased with Disney's sensitivity to the topics of the class of golf in the early twentieth century. The film portrayed well the psychological battles that Harry Vardon fought in himself, from his childhood injuries to being subjected to his own inability to break the glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as a corpse in English golf society. Likewise, the young Ouimet goes through his own class struggles, being a simple caddy in the eyes of the upper corpses, who American who scoff at his attempt to rise above his standing. <br /> <br /> What I loved best, however, is how this theme in the class manifests itself in the characters of Ouimet's parents. His father is a working class boy who sees the value of hard work, but is frightened by the upper class; however, his mother recognizes his son's talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who believe he is inferior. <br /> <br /> Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed. Although the course used in the film was not the actual site of the historic tournament, the beauty of the film detracts from the small freedoms Disney has taken. There is a little Disney moment on the pool table; otherwise the viewer doesn't really think Disney. The ending, as in "Miracle", is not a Disney creation, but one that only human history could have written.
