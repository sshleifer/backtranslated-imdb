Directed by Michael Curtiz, Four Daughters are about four musical gifted sisters, their suitors and their father, a smaller leader. Slag technology, quick talk Mickey Borden is John Garfield in the role that made him an instant star. The movie also stars Claude Rains as Adam Lemp and Lane sisters, Lola, Rosemary and Priscilla and Gale Page as his germinated daughters. The final scene takes place in Lemps' living room. Cigarette hangs from his lips, Borden plays one of his own compositions. Priscilla Lane Ann Lemp tells him that the play is beautiful. But he says, "It stinks." He continues, "It doesn't have a beginning or an end, just a centerpiece." Ann urges him to create a beginning and an end. The table answers, "What? Fate is against me. They threw a coin - heads I am poor, tails I'm rich, but they threw a two-head coin." The crowd loved the way Garfield said in his harsh voice, it stinks. This scene created Garfield's screenplay as the eternal outside. Four Daughters is a piece of Americana with Garfield, in a compelling performance that delivers more than a hint of darkness. <br /> <br />
