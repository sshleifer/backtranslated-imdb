Every role, down to the smallest, has been thrown and traded with bravado. The extraordinary Jena Malone never takes a mistake. Her two co-stars are equal to her in this movie. Ryan Gosling may be the best actor of his generation. Chris Klein gives his best performance to date. This is a thought and conversation film that should be seen by teenagers and young adults. You think and talk about this movie for days. Highly recommended.
