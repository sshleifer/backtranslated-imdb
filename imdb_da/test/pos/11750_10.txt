I just got through this movie again and can only ask me if we want to see similar movies like this one here? Timeless music, William Holdens and Jennifer Jones singing, leave this adult man crying through joyful, romantic scenes, and I'm not one who cries very often in life. Where is our William Holden gone and will they make these movements, wonderful movies more? It is sad to realize that they will not, but do not think about it, just try to block it out of your mind. Yet they will not have Holden in it, nor will he come on that hill again. You can only enjoy this movie and watch it again.
