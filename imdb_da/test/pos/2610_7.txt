"Please kill me! I'm just an actor!" "Can you play dead?" It is difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime drama. Where the bad policeman is an ass. Literally. What is good about the show is some of Assy's absolutely horrible one-liners. Blasting such jewels as "Adios, Blimp", Assy Mcgee gives some good laughs on points. Unfortunately, other times seem to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost difficult to see. This is definitely the kind of show you will love or hate, there is virtually no middleman. It's not the best show on {Adult Swim}, but it has some strong points. It's worth looking at just to see if you enjoy it. I know I did.
