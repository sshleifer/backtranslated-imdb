The producer, Matt Mochary, stumbled upon the film's subject, Anderson Sa (head of the AfroReggae music movement), while on a Hewlett Foundation trip to Rio de Janeiro. Mochary was so moved by Sa's story that he called his friend, NYC filmmaker Jim Zimbalist, who broke off his work and came to Mochary in Brazil to work on a documentary about Sa, Rio's favelas and the culture of violence. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film shows you the culture of violence in Rio's favelas (shantytowns where the poor live) through recordings of police attacks and attacks on residents. The recordings are graphic and shocking. <br /> <br /> Rising from the negativity of the favelas, the charismatic Anderson Sa who overcomes a possible career in drug trafficking to launch the AfroReggae movement, combining elements of Afro-Brazilian culture, Reggae, ska and other elements into a powerful, percussion heavy music style that has since spread to other parts of the world. You can't help but be carried away by the music, especially when you see the local children getting involved in Sa's school, which he founded to keep the kids out of drug gangs. The rest of the film follows Sa's meteoric rise, and his positivity changes many of the children's lives to seek a life beyond the course of drugs. SPOILER: Just as the filmmakers thought they had wrapped films, an incredibly life-changing event emerges, the resolution of which must be seen as believed. The movie then continues and you get caught in your seat to the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is an answer to "the city of God" and a worthy one. The grim situation portrayed in that movie is counteracted by a real example of how favela residents can overcome the serious situation they are in and use their resources for constructive ends. You can't help suffer and rage for Anderson Sa to succeed. <br /> <br /> This film is shot scary, fast and completely absorbent. Judging by the audience's overwhelming response at last night's SilverDocs screening, the film has to get a domestic distribution in the US, and the thumping soundtrack should also be released. Keep an eye on this superlative documentary - it's great!
