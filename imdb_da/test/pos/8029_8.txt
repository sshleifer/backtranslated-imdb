When I first knew that Donald Sutherland (Jack Shaw / Henry Fields) appeared in this movie, it immediately told me that this should be a good picture to see. Most of Sutherland's images are full of action and excitement, and he can play a rather cruel character and can also be quite charming and friendly. In this picture, Jack Shaw did his best to be a good guy and a bad guy while training a Naval Office to become a spy who had to change his entire identity and become another person overnight. There are lots of car hunting scenes and lots of stunt men situations that I don't want to perform. This Naval Officer lived in an entire community with his wife and was a father, but you would never realize it until the film reveals his horrible background secrets that he had to keep from his family and friends. Good spy movie and great plays by all the actors.
