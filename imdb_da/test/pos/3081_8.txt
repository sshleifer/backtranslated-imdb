Robin Hood; Pantyhose men are worth watching, I recently saw it because I just became a Cary Elwes fan and this is one of his main roles. Some moments really made me blow so hard! I do not expect you to know, it was so much fun, though the second time you were still away from your chair. The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself, Cary, but Blinkin and Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's very big! Lol) and everyone else! <br /> <br /> There were some moments, of course, the movie tried to make a comic scene out, but you don't necessarily laugh at it .... but ok. <br /> <br /> This is the second time Cary Elwes and Patrick Stewart appeared in a movie together, they both worked on "Lady Jane" in 1986 and it was fun to see them, 7 years later, older, awwww. It is definitely worth a look, quite fun!
