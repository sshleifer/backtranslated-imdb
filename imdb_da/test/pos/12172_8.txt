First of all, I am from Munich, where this film takes place, and believe it or not, there are guys like Erkan and Stefan, including the stupid dialect! I know their comedy show from the beginning, and my biggest fear was that the movie is just a collection of their already known jokes, but it's not! Witnesses evolve throughout history and make meaning in their own way. But if you absolutely don't like Erkan und Stefan, hands on this movie. Everyone else - it is worth seeing!
