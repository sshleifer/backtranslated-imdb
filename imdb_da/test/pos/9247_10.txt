All trials and trials of making a no budget film right from the mouths of the mouths involved. You feel all the sweat, courage, determination and dedication that Stuie put into this love work and the frustration of being left behind by all her work. Clips of interviews with everyone involved provide a great flowing narrative and convey ballout-out, hardcore punk, almost anarchist stance as it took to film "Waldo" and then the documentary. Stuie and company deserve all the props in the world not to give up when they get tough and get "A Texas Tale of Treason" out so we can see how it is for the budding filmmaker on the street!
