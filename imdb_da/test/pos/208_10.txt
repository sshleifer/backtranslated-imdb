If you are looking for a typical war movie, then it is not so, a note for all the testosterone pumped blood-borne war buffers out there, do not bother. Although the film is about Russian characters in World War II, don't expect to see Nazis, guns, blood, gore, etc. It's not a movie about people causing a war or fighting for a war. It's a movie about ordinary people where war happens and the choices they make to deal with it. <br /> <br /> Works, filmography, writing: all perfect 10's here. You will certainly appreciate it if you are Russian like me, but even if you do not want to, you will surely love it. If you do not speak Russian, look for the RUSCICO (Russian Cinema Council) DVD version. It has subtitles in about 14 different languages, but the English dubbing on the one I want to say is just as good. It is of course not as good as the original Russian track (some things are lost in translation), but just as well as the English subtitles. So go check it out, especially if you are studying movies in every aspect.
