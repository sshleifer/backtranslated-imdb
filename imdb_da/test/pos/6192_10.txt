The problem with this series is that it is too real. I see it on Amazon "Unbox" and just finished episode 2 I hate, absolutely hate, Fark, the leader of the cell. I can't remember any TV series ever having this emotional impact. Remember the old horror movie roofline "Just tell yourself it's just a movie"? Now I find myself repeatedly reminding you that it is "only TV". But of course, it's not just TV's? The possibility of a cell as depicted here, which actually operates in the United States, is determined within the scope of plausibility. That is what gives this program its malicious authenticity. And that's why I hate it so much.
