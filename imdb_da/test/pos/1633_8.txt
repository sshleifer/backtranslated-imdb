Where Da Vinci Code Introduced Us To Dr. Robert Langdon and his ability to solve puzzles, anteres angels and demons by giving a big puzzle with an 8-hour border. <br /> <br /> With a draft of award-winning actors, Ron Howard does a good job of managing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci Code slipped so many angles on you in such a short time that a quick bathing wax would leave you a little confused when returning. I did not feel that this was with angels and demons, the plot was just ahead, and the action kept the level of interest peaked all the time. Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was easily my favorite character in the movie. His depiction of the elitist, yet misunderstood rank of the Catholic Church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you will find yourself choosing pages immediately after the introduction. There is not a huge amount of Tom Hank's time when the film focuses more on history than character development, and I was well pleased that I had more than enough introduction from the first movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found Ayelet Zurer's character Vittoria Vetra to be an unnecessary femme assistant in search since her lines were a bit limited and seemed much like an afterthought. She plays a key role in the beginning of things, but she soon falls into the background of being Langdon's "familiar" more - than a necessary partner. The reason is, as such, one of the organizations that the Catholic Church wronged in the past (which has been a few) has sought revenge in a most artistic way. Some men in the church are kidnapped and set to be executed at certain times until an ultimate end to the church itself will take place. Dr. Robert Landon is brought in to help decipher the clues and teams with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed a colleague's door in the hands of the church's enemy. <br /> <br /> Music is relevant and the cinematography beautiful, I could chime on this menial thing, but what makes angels and demons work absolutely is that conclusion. It was by far one of the most surprising conclusions I have seen in a movie, and I was impressed with how I was out of guard when it hit me. Like everyone else, I appreciate a big wrapper, and this film wraps it pretty tight and puts a beautiful bow on it. Needless to say, I left the theater satisfied with the movie at all. <br /> <br /> If you are religious and uncertain whether this movie will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that where the DaVinci Code painted Catholicism as a shady array of sadists, angels and demons paint them with a much lighter brush. The Church is shown as a collection of good men who are made to suffer from the evil and misunderstood men of evil who bore their colors and even a few who have infiltrated their modern ranks.
