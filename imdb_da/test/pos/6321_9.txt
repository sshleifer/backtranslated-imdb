The mystic and its solution was a great noir objection. However, I have some questions, maybe I don't have enough attention. <br /> <br /> Who killed the neighbor and why? Who killed the replacement girl and why? <br /> <br /> And some minor strangles, they should have shown stopoff in the hotel for the switch. Not that they should have shown the shift, but they should have shown Jim and the girl to the hotel, Jim goes to the toilet, comes out and is told by the bartender that his girlfriend went to the car without him. <Br /> <br /> then Jim comes back in the car and sees the sleeping woman and little girl in the back. <br /> <br /> This would have given the viewer a sporting chance to figure out the solution. <br /> <br /> I wish I lost it myself, I'd like to see it again.
