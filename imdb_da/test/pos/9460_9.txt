I caught this movie right in my eye as I passed a poster hall in the nearby cinema. The roofline was kind of confusing and immediately after reading it I thought of the possibility of resembling National Lampoon's Dorm Daze. I liked the movie, except having a huge collection of such genres, I decided to turn it on to the theaters just after my exams release exams. I was delicious and smiled from cheek to cheek and had an equal amount of laughter on bits and pieces in the movie. Amanda Bynes certainly beat it better than Keira Knightley in Bend it like Beckham. Being both a male and female actor is certainly not that easy, especially having to face the similarities of life with the reactions that the actress must respond to. This movie requires great confusion to confuse oneself and us viewers at the same time. The only way to pull it is through this movie. The main character is of course sickly fun in a serious way, the girls are just as sexy and beautiful, and that is also the actors. I would recommend this movie to anyone who needs a weekend of relaxation and calm, you will laugh the whole movie. It is a sure guarantee.
