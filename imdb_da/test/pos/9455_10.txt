If you haven't seen this movie than you need. It cuts and you should see it. It's so much fun and will make you laugh your gut out !! So you have to see it and I saw it about a billion and a half and still think it's fun. So you should. yes i have remembered the whole movie and could quote it to you from start to finish. You must see this step. It is also sweet because it is a half chicken flick. If you don't see it then you're really slipping. This movie even has sweet guys in it and it's always a bonus. so in summary see the movie now and trust me that you will not make a mistake. I mention the music is also good. So you should like it if you enjoy music. This is a movie that they judged correctly and it will work for everyone.
