I don't think it's 60% of the voters who voted this show as ten now, how in hell is the score five points eight it impossible, I don't understand, it's totally pathetic, I mean how. anyway the show is good, the story is great and the characters are interesting, definitely a ten out of ten from me, i think the creatures are cool, they look good and i wish i had a nimrod great show, good cgi hope that there is another series that a lot went unanswered in the first season, and when does nyrod get bigger, as the rest of the creatures are big, why is the rating so low as the voices were so high <br /> <br /> 10/10
