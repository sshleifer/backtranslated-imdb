It's not as good as the movie that said it's a cute kids show. Okay, so the Emperor has slipped back and becomes a selfish pampered again, accepting it and enjoying the comic book as something entertaining. It has lots of jokes for the parents and still keeps the child's attention. It also boasts two of the original voice actors from the movie. Earth Kitt, who has been in many movies, but I'm sure many people know as Catwoman. And Patrick Walburton (sorry if I flawed), who has also appeared in many film and TV shows, but is most recognized as The Tick. It really is a rare and wonderful combination. If for any other reason I do not recommend highly serious fans, see at least one episode to enjoy the dynamic duo. Summary, entertaining children's show, with lots of indoor jokes for the adults to laugh with. If you are looking for educational value, this is not your show. If you're just looking for something fun, it's a good Saturday morning pick!
