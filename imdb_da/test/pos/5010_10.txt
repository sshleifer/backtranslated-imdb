After watching the series' premiere of the Talk Show with the Spike Feresten, I took a moment to really think wow, there are actually good shows after 12 beyond SNL and I was also sorry to see that it was only 30 minutes long. His great writing skills helped this show overcome a series of money shortages and help hands. Electronic Lincoln was fun and I really think it will be a good Dark Horse Talk Show. <br /> <br /> I was very pleased with the way he handled and gave Andy Richtor some good lines to work with. As you would have suspected, it was a little shaken, but for that kind of time slot it was very good. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are not someone weed or even if you are, and you have nothing more important to do than see this big piece and have fun doing it.
