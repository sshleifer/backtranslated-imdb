No sayings are calculated. I'm not going to spoil the story, but it's safe to assume that you already know what kind of character the main actor portrays. And of course, being a priest while you're "naughty" exaggerates all that. Plus, it's the most erotic movie from Park Chan Wook yet. <br/> <br /> If you've seen Wook's former works / films, you know he's very visual (in a good way) and it shows again. As it stretches away from the vengeance theme of its earlier films on the surface, it still has little heat hidden below. And when it boils, a lot of bad things start to happen. But through all that darkness, there were also moments of light (fun) to have had. A very stylistic and wonderful film that lives outside the mainstream and does a very good job ...
