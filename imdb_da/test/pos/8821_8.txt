This is a "doku drama" of (mostly) recent years of KW's life, with almost all the parts played by actors (but spot which TV quartermaster plays himself!). It was made for the BBC4 art channel, but my guess is that there will be syndication and DVD releases soon. KW is played very much by the excellent Michael Sheen, repeating her previous stage role with great success. Most of the supporters are also very good, and a good touch is the recreation of periodic television shows with the new actors. However, this is not easy to see - everyone who is familiar with KW's diaries and general unhappy behavior already knows how distorted he could be in later life - so don't expect 80 minutes with the Carry On styled buffoonery, as the weight is definitely scary in all . Recommended, but it is actually tragi-comic.
