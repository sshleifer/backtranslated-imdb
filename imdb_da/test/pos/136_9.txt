I didn't expect much because of the hard reviews and continued to enjoy the movie a lot as a result. Softer colors and less amazing compositions of the shoots than some of his previous films, in my opinion, allowed the narrative to focus. Although the religious conflict in a vampire girl was commonplace, I felt that many of the other things were not. For example: <br /> <br /> how his forces were often revealed through interaction with her. <br /> <br /> The very powerful and well-acted love scenes. In fact, the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other separates them even more. <br /> <br /> Their strong differences in what it means to be "vampire" created by their past life experiences. <br /> <br /> The lack of scores of other vampires that appear or created through the movie. <br /> <br /> I've heard and read several things about 'tricks used in other movies'. Of course. But I feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and I feel he is doing well. I don't need a director to use new tricks. I prefer the used tricks to be used well and appropriately, which I feel is the case with this movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend it.
