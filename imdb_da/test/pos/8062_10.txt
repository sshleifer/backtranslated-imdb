As good as Schindler's list was, I found this movie much more powerful as it is a documentary and based on real life. It describes the story of the Frank family, and especially Anne. Although it is a bit slow in motion first (describing their family life before the war); It becomes very powerful. Because of some of the pictures and pictures of the camps, I would not recommend it to children, but for adults it illustrates the Holocaust's scare through a young girl. Highly recommended.
