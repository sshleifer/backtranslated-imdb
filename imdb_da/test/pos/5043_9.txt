The most important cast: <br /> <br /> Vlastimil Brodský .... Frantisek Hána Stella Zázvorková .... Emílie Hánová Stanislav Zindulka .... Eda <br /> <br /> Director Vladimir Michalek gives this charming story of older people's enchanting phrases that make the characters appealing, truly universal. <br /> <br /> Frantisek Hana is retired and retired, his former occupation unknown. He lives in a very nice apartment with his wife for twenty-four years, Emilie. His son Jara chops the spacious apartment as problem-solving, which he needs to house one of his former wives and more of their children. The son is not a vicious schemer, just a guy with a previous spouse for many and a gaze eye for the attachment his father has for the occasion (which he moved in after declining a previous residence to his son). <br /> <br /> Hana and his elderly close friend, Ed, spend more than ample time making little jobs, not for money, but for the joy of putting one on easy-to-do people like real estate agents. A favorite trick is for Hana to appear as part of a retired divo of New York's Metropolitan Opera, returning home and in need of a scattered mansion. Ed is his companion as happy real estate agents fall over themselves, committing chauffeured limousines and fine French restaurant dishes in the hope of lucrative sales. <br /> <br /> When you are not involved in well-planned scams, the duo engage quick ploys such as pretending to be railway safety agents to snatch kisses from breathless and timeless teens trying to sneak on trains. Chaste kisser, that is: There is no lechery here. <br /> <br /> Hana's passionate wife is obsessed with saving enough money to ensure that the couple, individually and together, have a great funeral, an event, that Love Frantisek is in no hurry to experience. Disagreements about money and Frantisek's promiscuous disposition of marriage funds lead to a crisis whose resolution is both genuine and loving. Michalek fishes for the viewer's feelings, but he makes it open, honest and effective. "Autumn Spring," signed of course is a product of an increasingly vibrant Czech cinema. It was not widely shown in the United States, but hopefully its availability on DVD will make it affect a wide audience. Unfortunately, Brodsky has recently overwhelmed cancer, so this movie is a valedictory for a fine actor who permeated his character with a passion for the pleasures of life that must have reflected the actor's own values. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
