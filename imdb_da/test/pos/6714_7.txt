No, "Lifeforce" is not a good movie. It's not a good movie. However, it is an average film with some good effects and a compelling story (and of course Mathilda May). It can actually be one of my favorite SF / horror flicks for the very simple reason that they are trying to justify their way through the science of space vampires. How often do you see it? Not even in "Alien" (SF / horror flick of all time) science comes into history at all. In "Lifeforce" they are trying to create the cause of an unfair world. <br /> <br /> Now do I think it succeeds? No. I think the film has the issue of a massive ensemble cast that Hooper is strenuous to be assembled and tracked and that viewers should focus on more than one "villian" and there is too many weather trips. <Br /> <br /> To be honest, the movie is eye candy and fun to watch. But there is great potential here for a superior remake to address what Hooper tried to do and really create a strong, scary, SF / horror movie. <br /> <br /> However, if remake happens, I require Mathilda to have a cameo.
