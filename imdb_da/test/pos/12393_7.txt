It is generally accepted that Marcel Carne's films from 1936 to 1946 are masterpieces, and it is considered polite to say that the rest is mediocrity. This is an unfair opinion: at least two of the latter era are highly visible: "Thérèse Raquin", his best post-war work and "les tricheurs". There is a strange evolution from Prevert golden hour to "les tricheurs": in "les enfants du paradise" "quai des brumes" or "le jour se lève", true love is counteracted by the bad guys. love no longer: we deal with a lot of young people who believe in nothing; infatuation will be inconsistent with this youth. Adults are not at all bad: Mics brother and mother are kind people but she is out of their command. adults work anyway. <br /> <br /> Within two hours, the characters do not stop, dances, listens to jazz records (a music that was not part of the bourgeois culture) and heavily drinks. find out that they care about each other, it will be too late, the throw is pretty good, Laurent Terzieff as an existentialist cynic and Andréa Parisy as a nice child is stand-out On the other hand, Pascale Petit and especially Jacques Charrier ( who married Brigitte Bardot the same year as "l es tricheurs ") not the ambiguity their parts ask for. They are all smiling, too sweet and good to be trustworthy. <br /> <br /> It was strange that "les tricheurs" was labeled "nouvelle vague"! When yo you know what the priests in this cinema school (like Godard) were thinking of Carné, it's really a good joke. But this disadvantage you feel throughout the movie is really disturbing.
