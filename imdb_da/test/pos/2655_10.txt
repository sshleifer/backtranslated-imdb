2001: A Space Odyssey <br /> <br /> Is it a sermon? An account of human history? An exploration of man's unsuccessful attempts to promote technology only to get technology to destroy him? Is it about the fragile balance between time and space? A lesson in evolution? Or is it just a spectacular effects show; A movie Kubrick did just to show us the unlimited possibilities of film and present the truth to us that images are extremely powerful than words? <br /> <br /> 2001: A Space Odyssey is all these things. One of the most understandable films ever created, it is almost fun to dissect and discuss the ambiguous plot design and events in the movie than it is to actually look at. But it is open to deliberation; if Kubrick had explained the meaning of his wonderful 1968 classic (ranked # 22 on AFI's list of the biggest 100 films ever made, my personal 21st favorite movie - and nominated for 4 Academy Awards: Director, Original Screenplay, Art Direction and visual effects that it won for) would have lost half of its fascination, its entire complexity and much of its cinematic value. We would only be left with the technical ingenuity; which in itself is worth praising. <br /> <br /> Because every shot is worth the time to look. And there is plenty of time. 2001 is very elegant and also cool distant; freestanding. The emotional distinction and slow pace pay perfect tribute to the unique visual experience; 2001 begins with the human ancestors of the human race, which upgrades from planners of the planet to hunters and toolmakers, after discovering a giant monolith in the midst of their desert home, it is in one of movie history's most inspired spring-cut edits) a leg thrown into the air becoming a satellite, jumping a few thousand years into space, where astronauts have discovered a similar object on the moon, and the next film follows a crew's mission as they follow monolithic signal through space, accompanied by their untrustworthy computer, HAL, which is trying to sabotage the shooter and kill the crew, before finally the lonely survivor is launched through space and time (in a flurry of drug-induced colors that probably gave hippies an epileptic shock back in the day) to grow old, die and be reborn a "star-child". Whew. This pacing and emotional blankness is also in sharp contrast to the film's most ironic scene; the destruction of HAL. As the crew's final explorer turns off the machine, bathed in the red light sacred aura, Kubrick has always used as a repetition motif, HAL sings a lovely melody, it's a strange emotional experience. And that's all genius. Other noteworthy aspects of Kubrick's masterpiece are HAL's memorable voice (a quiet, somehow scary, Douglas Rain), the minimal use of dialogue (Kubrick was wise to rely on his images to evoke the movie and give only banal, inappropriate lines to his Actors The most famous is "Open the Hall Doors HAL"), satellites that dance in orbit to unorthodox music and the first awe-inspiring shot of the earth; slowly revealing the glare of the sun in front of it, played to the sound of blasting, triumphant horn. 2001 must always remain a mystery and will forever be a testament to the cinema's strongest point: visuals are more powerful than writing. It's all from one of the movie's most legendary and best directors whose unique vision was always his own. 10/10 <br /> "Open the podium doors HAL" -2001: A Space Odyssey
