In my endless quest to see as many quality films as possible in my life, I stumble across this movie on cable. I tried Hitchcock three times before this, and I never felt that man's work lived up to the praise he had received. I've always felt that he was good, not great (from what I've seen). It was the best of his movie I've seen sofar. Robert Walker is quite chilling, his performance takes the film, where Hitchcock wanted it to go. Even an average performance here damages the overall product. My favorite scene was his obsession with getting the lighter from the drain (how does he get his arm, though?) Bruno is quite convincing, but I also loved the performance of Patricia Hitchcock as Barbara. The rest of the Morton family as well as Guy were a little dry and boring, but she added some glare to the movie as well as having some of the better lines in the manuscript. Finally, in any thrill movie you're going to live and die at your end. This holds water, unlike a few other Hitchcock movies I've seen. I was really unsure how it would end, which kept me on the edge while I looked and waited.
