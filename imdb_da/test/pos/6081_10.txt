A sweeping and profound love story with powerful performances by Ralph Fiennes, Willem Defoe and Juliette Binoche. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a badly burned man (Ralph Fiennes) being pulled out of a plane during the pre-war he fell in love with beautiful Katherine Clifton (Kristen Scott Thomas), but she is married to Jeffery Clifton (Colin Firth) and the two begin a passionate and forbidden affair. A very joking and tragic story of love and desire against some beautiful places in the desert. One must see especially if your fan of Anthony Minghella's work, but be prepared to throw many tears, it's very moving, especially at the end.
