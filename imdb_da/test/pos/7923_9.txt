ALEXANDER NEVSKY is nothing short of a big movie on a large scale. The film opens a window to a world and culture, most Americans will never become aware of. And much has been said and written about the film's thin blurred patriotism in the light of the impending war with the German Nazis. <br /> <br /> In the United States, the play is a bit stuttered. The play is concise on words and great on visuals and actions. And while the action may be tedious, the pictures are often amazing. The direction is incredible. <br /> <br /> On another note, fans of Ralph Bakshi animation may notice that he stole many of his images for WIZARDS directly from a copy of ALEXANDER NEVSKY.
