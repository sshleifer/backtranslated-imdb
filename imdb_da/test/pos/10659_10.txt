Battleship Potemkin is said to have been a favorite of Charlie Chaplin. It presents a dramatized version of the mutiny that arose in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their tsarist regime officers. <br /> <br /> The movie is a biographical classic textbook and a masterpiece of creative editing, especially in the famous Odessa Steps sequence, where innocent civilians are shedding bloodshed; One minute's events are drawn in five by frenzied cross-cutting. The film contains 1,300 separate shots, and in 1948 and 1958, the best film ever was judged by a panel of international critics. Battleship Potemkin is publicly available in some parts of the world.
