This is my favorite Renoir from Fifties. It's the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see the workers spraying on the spot to get construction started and the dancers training. Finally, the weakness of opening night and the long range of cancan dancing. Financial issues and ego shows by the performing artists are described. <br /> <br /> Gabin is in good shape as the easy Danglard - watch him act humorously with Nini's violent girlfriend. Gianni Esposito moves like the wistful Prince who hips Nini. Maria Felix, with the Amazon body, introduces Dangard's first lover as the selfish Lola. Finally, Françoise Arnoul as the Nini Maid who ends up dancing for Danglard and becomes her girl is just amazing; her love and pert charm will win you over. <br /> <br /> A bonus: we get Edith Piaf, Patachou, André Claveau and other stars in cameos who play the stars a century ago, ruling the Moulin Rouge.
