A beautiful, magical, thought-provoking and heart-breaking story. Excellent direction, perfectly cast, wonderful script, excellent score, beautifully illuminated ...... should I say more? <br /> <br /> If you love movies that not only make you think but also warm your heart as spring is 'Contact', 'Turner' and 'Groundhog Day' then you're sure to love K-PAX. <br /> <br /> Most recommended.
