I read ashews comment and thought they must have seen a completely different picture! <br /> <br /> I just watched the movie this morning and was totally surprised. <br /> <br /> To address ashews comments: Trail Street is a very well done western. <br /> <br /> And Randolph Scott was in it quite a bit! <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes was more fun than I ever saw him! <br /> <br /> The evil guys had very good comeuppances as far as I was concerned. <br /> <br /> Plus: <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see Robert Ryan as an equal A good good man - he is usually so slim. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good Western, very well-acted and written. <br /> <br /> I liked the background story of Kansas and the "winter wheat", which apparently also helped it to a state. <br /> <br /> I thought the girl who played Susan was lovely - can't believe why she wasn't a big star!
