I must admit that I absolutely loved this movie. Of course, you are sure that you know that "Malcolm's in the Middle" star Frankie Muniz and the ever so sweet Amanda Bynes "The Amanda Show" played into this children's comedy as two friends that I am sure we all together can -late to. The movie is about a boy Jason Shepard (Frankie) and his friend Kaylee (Amanda) going on a Hollywood adventure. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> When it starts, Jason is a typical 14 year old boy who suffers from getting around everyday life's problems. One day, Jason is hit by Mr. Wolf (the big bad instructor). Jason's English paper is stolen by Wolf and starts the adventure with kaylee to earn the trust of his father. They fly to Hollywood in search of Wolf to get him back. Frankie and Amanda do all sorts of crazy stunts to get Wolf back and all he has to do is call Jason's father and tell him he stole his idea. But the end is not a real surprise, being the good samples and victories. The story is sweet and fifth grade mood, but what do you expect it to be rated PG. I really think this is one of the best family comedies of the year. Not only is the child's play great, unusual casting, well-written, but it is good fun. It made me laugh and fall in love with the innocent message. I reccomend it highly and would like to disagree with the one who gave it a zero out of ten. The unemployed critic is not free for nothing. I give it (well I voted a ten out of ten) a perfect one.
