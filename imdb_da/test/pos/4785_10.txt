Steamboat Willy was not the first cartoon for Mickey Mouse. The first film for the star America's friend was "Plane Crazy". "Plane Crazy" was released May 15, 1928 in Hollywood California, in the silent movie format. "Steamboat Willy" was released on November 18, 1928 as a SOUND movie (it was also released on July 29, 1928 as a silent movie). Thus, "Steamboat .." makes the first SOUND movie by Mickey, but NOT the first movie for the little American mouse. While many game shows have used the question: "What was Mickey Mouse's first appearance?" The true answer is "Plane Crazy", not "Steamboat Willy". These dates can be checkout on IMDb during "release dates".
