The cave is a wonderful murder mystery that gives everything you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot. It is located on a country house on a weekend. As always, all guests are suspected and it is up to Poirot to find out the truth. With movies like this it is always best not to give too much away, so I stop here. What I loved in "Hollow" was that it is an old-fashioned mystery. When Poirot arrives, everyone around the body is e.g. Everyone seems to be the culprit. There is the suspicious look, and the atmosphere is just perfect for the story. <br /> <br /> You can expect a wonderful time guessing who did it and how and why and perhaps even surprised. A cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you have a great pleasure. <br /> <br /> The actors are all very good. As a curiosity, Edward Hardwicke who played Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes. Nice to see him after a couple of years. Suchet is fantastic as always and luckily on the screen is most. <br /> <br /> I found out who the killer was, but it's still not predictable, and it's also very credible. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, a great movie and always a pleasure. <br /> <br />
