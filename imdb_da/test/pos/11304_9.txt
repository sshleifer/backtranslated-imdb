I have to say that Barbie Movies generally impressed me. I have a 5-year-old barbie fanatic niece and she is watching them all the time, so it is superfluous to say that I have seen a lot of Barbie these holidays, but I'm not sick of them. <br /> <br /> Visually, this movie has a lot to offer, especially backgrounds, and the animation of the characters is enhanced with every new movie. One thing I noticed especially was a big improvement in the animation of Barbie's hair in this movie. It has a nice series of excerpts from classical music, and I think this is great as it exposes a new generation to the classics. This movie is well worth the time, especially if you have young relievers. They will be entertained for hours!
