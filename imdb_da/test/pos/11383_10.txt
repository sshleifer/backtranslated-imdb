Sometimes the Academy does not recognize the potential of some films or nominate them because they are controversial or strong. Sometimes they are nominated, but do not win anything (I hope this does not happen this year with "American Beauty"). That's exactly what happened to "Boogie Nights", which was the best movie from 1997. The Academy preferred to give the best picture Oscar to "Titanic", a pure commercial and hollow movie and other awards to the overrated "Good Will Hunting "and the annoying" Full Monty ". The other images that were nominated in the main category were "LA Confidential" and "As Good As It Gets", amazing movies, but "Boogie Nights" are still better and should have been remembered in several categories. <br /> <br /> This amazing movie tells the story of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, in a surprisingly great performance), a 17-year-old barman taking Jack Horner (Burt Reynold's attention) as a porn movie director. Eddie has a special 'gift' and it helps him get into the porn movie world. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and begins to make a great success. But fame ... doesn't last forever. Other characters also have their parallel stories - Amber Waves (Julianne Moore, perfect), Buck (Don Cheadle) and others, including Rollergirl (Heather Graham), an actress who agrees to do something, but she must wear her roller shoe. <br /> <br /> What could have been a banal, trivial movie turns into a perfect, memorable one in the hands of Paul Thomas Anderson. What makes "Boogie Nights" such a great movie is its accomplishment, added to a smart, well-written play, great soundtrack, etc. Each character is very well-developed, and each one has its meaning in context. Every feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is explored, resulting in a masterpiece of the modern American cinema. "Boogie Nights" is a powerful and influential image that should be seen by anyone who really likes cinema. During a plot that seems banal at first impression, there is a wonderful story of heights and lows, things we face in our lives. It is a stunning portrait of the late 70s and early 80s, exactly the age of highs and lows. That's what makes this movie so special and a true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> 10/10
