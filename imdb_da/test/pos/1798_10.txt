Good 25th Anniversary of Valley Girl! Great soundtrack, plausible history, wonderful performances ... captures the spirit of the 80s; The main flow hose and the outcasts. A wonderful rendition of high school life and "gritty downtown" from a suburban perspective. <br /> <br /> The audio track contains songs of modern English, Felony, Josie Cotton, Sparks, Payola $, Josie Cotton, The Plimsouls, The Psychedelic Furs, Workplace Men, Flirts and Bananarama. <br /> <br /> This movie is really Romeo and Juliet (minus the double suicide) in the 1980s Los Angeles. Julie's father, played by Frederic Forrest (Sonny Bono, someone?) Is hysterical as an idealistic father of hippie wondering how he ran such a materialistic offspring. Yet he doesn't judge you digging ??
