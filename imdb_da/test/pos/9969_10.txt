Filming such a lavish production of "The Merchant of Venice" is a risky business. It could be a stodgy, tree, period piece, or it could be ridiculous for its excesses. This version is neither. While not completely sold by Al Pancino's highly-held Shylock, he gives a competent and honest performance. Jeremy Iron's Antonio is, as always, with his tortured self-roles, riveting. Some of the minor roles seemed to be a little too much in the spirit of scary fun, "a boy's own friend's fairy tale story," but the central plot is effectively and sympathetically moved through the movie. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that the location shots, costumes and interiors were breathtaking, almost to the point of distraction. One thing that I do not want to comment on is the anti-semetic content of the game. The film is so sympathetic to the Jews' preaching as possible, while still portraying Shylock as the instrument of his own self-destruction. It is a sad comment that the director of this movie four centuries later found it necessary to comment on his newly appointed screen before the premiere screening at the Toronto Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie and I look forward to more impressions.
