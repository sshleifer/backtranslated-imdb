Farscape is the best sci-fi show period, for one main reason, everything the show is trying to do, it does very well. From a technical aspect, the music is original and perfectly fitted to the show. The special effects are abundance and higher quality than almost any other thing you want to watch on your TV. The action is also fantastic, for many shows today only use the American market for actors for their shows. Remember the first time you saw The Matrix and you said, wow where did that agent Smith come from? It's the same feeling you get to see Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Lani Tupu, Virginia Hey and especially Wayne Pygram. These Aussies are amazing and it comes through in this amazing show. The plot is something else. The next closest thing I can think of is Babylon 5 in the shadow war episodes, but it does. It's a really good experience to see all the episodes again in sequence, the intricacies of the interpersonal relationships between the characters are well scripted and done. The overall plot is both original and thoroughly entertaining. I'm always itching for the next show. The comic episodes are fun, the drama episodes touch, and the action sequences are tense. The beginning of the second season had some great comic episodes that made me laugh loudly, something that seldom happens while watching television that is not South Park, Sealab 2021 or Seinfeld. The drama is even more difficult if Crichton meets his mother or the characters face their mortality, everything is done with heart and intensity. Finally, it goes without saying that the action is tops. This is sci-fi. If you're a fan of science fiction at least if you like good television at all, if you like a well-serialized plot, you owe it to yourself to see Farscape. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Ben Browder owns.
