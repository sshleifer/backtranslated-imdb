The murders in Opera are not real murders, as much as they are symbols of past events and parts of Betty's own broken personality. In fact, Betty is the same person (a man) that Suzy Bannion is in Suspiria, only a decade later in life (Suzy was a 10-year-old boy who was kind to another boy of ten with a more gentle version of his own background ). <br /> <br /> Thinking of Betty's luxury apartment as a military barracks bay; She spends most of her time in her bedroom in bed next to her stereo, it works, and other parts of her apartment seem strange to her in some way or another, as if other people live in the other rooms. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento's movie is synchronized with a wide selection of rock music as well as funk (Dario starts the synchronization right at the beginning of his films, the eye of the opera and the start of a drum in Suspiria) . There are also standard films that Opera (and Suspiria) synchronize with. For example, Opera synchronizes with a record album of the Judas Priest called the Priest ... Live (like Suspiria), and Suspiria syncs very well with a Kiss record album titled Kiss Alive II. Films like Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, The Image and The Vampire Happening are sync film Argento using which deals with the same subject as Argento's film. These synchronize with many others that Betty is a man who has suffered sexual torture in his father's hands since birth (even in the womb according to a particular Anne Rice novel, Lasher). <br /> <br /> Anyway, big budget films are occult works that relay spy information collected by occult means, all in synchronized symbolic / alchemical way. Normally, the sync point of a movie is the beginning of the audio score, or it is the first image of the movie in addition to any movie product company. Sometimes it is more creative. The heavy metal music used in Opera and Phenomena is simply music sync that was deciphered by other films that Argento's film syncs with, an intellectual game of the elite in the industry. <br /> <br /> So, Betty doesn't do I don't normally respond to the murders she witnesses because she never witnesses a murder of any real person. "She herself" simply suffers from witnessing her own "murder" this person's father almost dropped him into an overcharged mine shaft in Arizon by 4 years, in 1970; he was on the brink of falling off a wooden board, which his father balanced him before father changed and grabbed him and pulled him back from it; the child felt nothing conscious. People of sexual torture are lost to this person through extreme sexual oppression, and the vague memories that remain are of the large, square deep hole in the desert, and there is no significance for this memory due to the lack of conscious trauma (" loss of trauma, "also a" buried trait ", is depicted in the 1975 film title The Image). These sausages in the ceiling of Suspiria are each reminiscent of the first three or so years of a life (Toys in the ceiling). The reason why Betty (or Suzy) is a female character is because the individual Christina Marsillach's mirrors are a man who has been trained for a female role from birth (all the DVDs in the Simpsons cartoon synchronization with Suspiria), with its nature has been cast along "queen" lines (The X-File episodes are synced with Opera). This has even changed her body to be "beautiful" in the way a woman is. Behavior changes genetics. A recent movie entitled Death Proof deals with the same ideas and the same individual. <br /> <br /> Almost all of this person's life is reflected in large budget films, albums and books made since 1966 and father before 1966 and beyond. The Scorpions album titled Virgin Killer is a Suspiria sync album, the original album cover acting as a symbolic mirror image of the fall through skylight.
