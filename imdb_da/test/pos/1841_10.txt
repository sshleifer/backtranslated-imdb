I watched this movie a few years ago and was literally swept away by it. So charming and so very romantic. David Duchovny and Ms. Driver has chemistry that is so hot you have to take off a layer of clothing. The support supports are 100% top notch. Just watching Caroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia play each other is pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the movie's most charming moments are when they are on the screen. Like Jim Belushi screaming at his kids to go to bed "FOREVER!" or he dances in the kitchen. This movie we did wish I knew people like that in my own life. Not to mention which woman doesn't want David Duchovny for a girlfriend?
