This movie is probably Hal Hartley's best. The subject of an unusual originality is treated (it is usual with Hal Hartley) with great humor. This feature is not the only quality in this movie at all: the fussy frame composition (everything is parallel to the smallest details), the shooting angles, the lighting that gives a more supernatural dimension to these blurry images (Jesus coming down couldn't be filmed a conventional way), the false "bags" action are qualities that make this bible re-reading, performed in the form of an apocalyptic delirium, crucial.
