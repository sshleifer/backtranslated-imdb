Lovely Candace Bergen kidnapped by widow Perdicaris and held to ransom by Sheik Raisuli, played by a dashing Sean Connery. The incident comes in 1904 when Theodore Roosevelt runs for election to the presidency itself. Need a good example to showcase America's muscular foreign policy, Brian Keith as Roosevelt issues a great statement to the Sultan of Morocco, "Perdicaris Live or Raisuli dead." <br /> <br /> However, in this adaptation of that event, the famous statement is the only true thing about this story. The Perdicaris in question was, in fact, an Ion Perdicaris who was a Greek immigrant and a dilettante playboy. In fact, Perdicaris gave his American citizenship many years ago and remained as a Greek citizen. Never mind it, even though his difficulties were profitable at the time. <br /> <br /> The lady in need makes better screen material, even though it is a widowed woman and her two children who are injured. Of course, as presented here, the incident is also used by some of our European powers to set foot in Morocco. The intrigues go far beyond a brigant's demand for ransom. <br /> <br /> Wind and Lion are hardly history. But it's a fun movie and Sean Connery is always fun to watch. Brian Keith also fits in with my perception of Theodore Roosevelt, and the scenes in the Roosevelt White House call true to all the famous stories. John Huston plays the ever patient state secretary John Hay, whom Roosevelt had inherited from his predecessor William McKinley. <br /> <br /> However, children do not use this movie to skip reading a story on Theodore Roosevelt era.
