I first saw this movie on an Alaska Airlines flight and have since seen it twice more. It's simply - and is simply - one of the best movies this year. I found myself enjoying it after my first viewing, but a bit overcast on what had happened. After seeing it again a few weeks later, things began to fall into place. It was not confusing, just deep. In fact, the depth of the film cannot be appreciated for a long time. For example, it seemed to me only after my third impression that Sammy Davis Jr. Jr (Grandpa's dog) is more than just a pet - perhaps she is the standard of her dead wife. Witness how hard he protects her. There is symbolism galore, and none of it is sour or indulgent, just genuine. The adventure of their turn keeps the story in eternal motion, and even when they arrive, you are not sure if it really was the destination. As the film continues, it does the adventure too, and I have the sense that the destination was just a waypoint. The soundtrack is fun, the scenery convincing - and both certainly eastern block. I could continue with the deeper meanings within the movie, but I'm not quite sure that I have discovered all the nuances yet. In addition, it is more fun to justify these out yourself. As much as any movie can be, "Everything is enlightened" has turned out to be like a fine wine that sweeps over time. I highly recommend seeing it - twice.
