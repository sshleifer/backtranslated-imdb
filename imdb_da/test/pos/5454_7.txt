I read the book written by Bill Carter, which this film is based on many years ago. The book is definitely stronger than the movie. It gives more detail than a movie could possibly give, the end result is that I thought the movie seemed a bit outlined on a handful of things. All in all, and given the media's limitations, the film provides a completely entertaining and informative account of the battle between Jay Leno and David Letterman in the early 90s to host "The Tonight Show" after Johnny Carson's retirement. <br /> <br /> The highlight is clearly the notion. I can think of a more difficult performance for an actor than to play a character that is still alive and known and on television on a regular basis. John Michael Higgins nailed Letterman perfectly. Seeing him was really like seeing Letterman. Daniel Roebuck patiently tried to be Jay Leno, but in one way or another it didn't move so effectively. His whole "look" seemed fake, and he just didn't look natural in the role. In a less central role, Rich Little did not surprise Carson's voice, even though the look was a little off. In the book, the most interesting of the central characters was probably Leno's agent, Helen Kushnick. In the film, Kathy Bates was perfect in the role, though it was not completely out of control as Carter's portrayal of the woman in writing. In the end, it's easy and entertaining viewing. The subject is not very important in the overall system of things, but it is fun behind the scenes, watching a memorable time in the entertainment industry. 10.7
