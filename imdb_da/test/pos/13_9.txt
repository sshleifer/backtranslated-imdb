I work at a cinema and every Thursday night we have an employee screening a movie coming out the next day ... Today it was The Guardian. I saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much of it, and by no means did I really expect to see this movie. It turns out that this movie was much more than I would have thought. It was a great story first and foremost. Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner made amazing plays in this movie. Being a Big Fan of That 70's Show I have always found it hard to think of Kutcher as anyone other than Kelso despite the big play he did in The Butterfly Effect, but after watching this movie I think I might Finally, look at him as a serious actor. <br /> <br /> It was also a great tribute to the unhealthy heroes of the US Coast Guard.
