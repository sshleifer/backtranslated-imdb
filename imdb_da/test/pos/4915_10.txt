When this was shown at the Seattle Int'l Film Fest, I was the only person who stood and clapped and cheered. The rest of the audience was booed or quiet. It is a well-played little movie that deepens into the reality of a young gay humanity. It's about a real man; and does not play for the creepy, hyper-puffed muscular "gay" passing for the genre of the Gay Gay cinema (and so many modern Gay genre movies are so boring). This movie is Intense Passion and Great Tragedy. The action and director and film are amazing; it all holds the film clatrophobic and tense and passionate. Don't miss this if you can find it.
