This movie is not your typical Hollywood fare, although pickings are so bad, I often tend to stay away from movies instead of being disappointed. But this little low-budget gem is thoroughly lovable and enjoyable and definitely a goalie. The actors are just as varied as the characters they depict, the Buffalo setting is charming (which beautiful city) and the story sparkles. The lack of gratuitous violence, sex and the "f" word does not detract from it! Take the kids, take the grandmother, take a break from Hollywood! I give it a 11 out of 10!
