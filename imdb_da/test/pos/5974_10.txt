The Ascension (1977) <br /> <br /> Larisa Shepitko is a very few name. Her bright career as a director lasted only a decade, suddenly ended with a tragic car accident. Despite her short career, however, she managed to create some of the best Soviet films of his time. Her last film, The Ascent, is widely regarded as one of the finest Soviet films of the 1970s. Nevertheless, her work remained obscure in subsequent years, usually only available on rare and poor copies on video. It's now changed thanks to the people at Criterion. They have released two of Shepitko's best works through their Eclipse department - Wings and her penultimate masterpiece The Ascent. Seen during the darkest days of World War II in snowy rural Russia, two partisans pull over land in search of food after their party is attacked by Nazi patrols. They are originally only going to a nearby farm, but when they arrive, they find it furious by the Germans. Not wanting to return empty, they continue deeper into enemy territory. Along the way, they must confront not only enemy soldiers, but the harsh conditions on the Russian plains, possibly fraud and their own souls. The movie does not fall into simplified plot units or destinations. It deals with difficult issues with painful rationality. It never takes the easy way or gives us comforting answers. The other half of the film is full of moral dilemmas. Shepitko shows us the intimate horrors of war through the internal conflict between other Russians - those who cooperated and those who fought back. While showing her partners as the clear heels, she nevertheless shows why many turned to such tactics - survival. <br /> <br /> The film contains a number of religious references, especially to lead up to the crucifixion. This is a spiritual journey into the hearts, souls, and minds of the two partisans and those they meet. Shepitko and her film photographer capture the journey in beautiful black and white photography. The camera moves in long shots that look like the camera's work in another of Russia's greatest filmmakers, Andrei Tarkovsky. Shepitko, like many others, was clearly influenced by Tarkovsky's style, and Ascent takes some of his rhythmic notes from Ivan's Childhood. It's a great movie to watch, and does a great job of capturing the cold and scary atmosphere of occupied Russia. <br /> <br /> Shepitko's husband would pay tribute to his amazing movie a decade later. Elem Klimov made his own war masterpiece with one of the greatest movies I've ever seen - Come and See. The story and themes of that film were clearly influenced by The Ascent. Although that film is also quite obscure, it became much more aware of any of Shepitko's films. However, it served as a bridge to Shepitko, and has been one of the best tools to keep his work alive. <br /> <br /> The Ascent is a truly magnificent movie and should be considered as one of the best films of the 70s. It's amazing filmography is inspiring; its mood is scary authentic; and its lessons are unforgettable. That is, in any definition of the word, nothing less than a masterpiece. How unfortunate that Shepitko's career was cut short, as it hit its peak.
