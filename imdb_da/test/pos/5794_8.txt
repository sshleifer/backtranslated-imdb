Little Vera is the story of a Russian teenager, her family and her attempts to find meaning and value in a life that is increasingly slipping into decay. In her quest for meaning, she falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious Sergei, whose hatred of her deeply wrong parents quickly sprouts out of control. Little Vera is shocking and disturbing in almost every way. The father's drink, the mother's opportunity and lack of understanding, the brother's laid-back lie and misdirection, and Vera self-forgetting them all their mistakes are all shocking and a little disturbing to see. However, the raw honesty of the movie somehow manages to become even more shocking than the plot or the characters. Seen in cramped spaces and a great urban decay, Little Vera presented a very different view of Soviet life than ever seen. In fact, Little Vera is a portrait of the collapse of the Soviet community, painted in shades of pain, desperation and rust. It is a family prison that is set against the implosion of a whole social order. <br /> <br /> Although painful and desperately unsatisfactory, the film itself is definitely worth seeing if you only understand the emotions and cultures that still transform Russia today.
