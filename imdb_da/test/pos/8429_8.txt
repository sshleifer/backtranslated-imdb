I am a big fan of the 1995 version, which I have seen many times and are considering a subtle, excellent movie. This version of 1971 I bought yesterday, a bit hesitant, but now that I've seen it, I'm glad I did it because it's more true for the book and Austen's insights. The 1995 edition has more dramatic power, mainly because it sharpens many of the characters - in the 1995 version, Lady Russell is snobbling, more manipulative, less really looking to Anne; Sir. Walter is even more in vain and vapid; Elizabeth is a nastier; Mary is more unimaginable; Mr. Elliot is more smarmy; Lady Dalrymple is much more stupid - but I think the characterization in this version of 1971 is closer to the book, to Austen's vision and to the real people of the time. The 1971 edition also contains several of the most important lines and scenes from the book, especially the key scene in the field, where Anne overcomes Wentworth, who speaks to Louisa (or is it Henrietta?) About the meaning of character. I found the action more subtle and evocative than many of the critics here, but the action in the 1995 version is more powerful. I agree with the critics here that the actor who plays Anne is too old for that; I looked up at her recording on IMDb and she was 38 at the time of the movie when her character was supposed to be 28. I thought her action was subtle and effective. Wentworth is of the right age and I found him very convincing. This 1971 version of Wentworth especially has much more of a sense of humor and justice; The 1995, much more of the sense of power, a sea captain would have and more passion. The Admiral of the 1971 edition lacks the presence and human warmth of the 1995 edition and lacks any sense of the power an admiral would certainly convey; I found him the only weak element in production. I agree with others that the scene on the "falling" scene was for wood, and it didn't seem convincing that she would have been so hurt by such a small fall. It could be that she turned her back on her head on the edge of the stone steps, which would produce a very dangerous damage and would make the stage more convincing than the scene in the 1995 version, where she falls longer but is free for any sharp edge that could cause a major head injury. As for the costuming that some have criticized, I am no expert and cannot answer, but I would note that none of the marines (Wentworth, Admiral Croft, Benwick, Harville) in the 1971 version have their uniforms while they The 1995 version is all consistently wearing their fancy uniforms. I suppose the 1971 edition is the correct one and it has always bothered me a little in the 1995 version, where the officers are always in uniform when the country is in peace and the officers are released from active service. My father and grandfather were career navy captains of the US who commanded air carriers and submarines, and they did not spend every day while on vacation or in their spare time in their dress blues. I doubt it was different 180 years ago. The uniforms give the 1995 version a lot of zing, and I prefer it, but I doubt that it is precisely historical that these officers had their uniforms so often. Finally, it is true that the production values ​​in the 1971 edition are much smaller than the 1995 version, but given the year (1971), the TV format and the budget, we cannot blame the artists for it. Modern viewers who can provide mental performance for the lower production values ​​can find this version well worth their time.
