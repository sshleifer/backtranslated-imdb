I've been hooked on "GG" since midway through 2001-2002 (2nd season) when I voted in to see "Smallville" 10 minutes early. Thanks to "Beginner" I now have anything but 2 episodes on tape right through last night (Ep. 4.9). I'm a medieval straight man, and that's the only weekly TV show I see. <br /> <br /> I love this series because: a) Lauren Graham is a crooked woman and fun and smart to start; b) The dialogue is extremely well written. c) It is flat out hilarious, to shame overstated waste like "Everybody Loves Raymond". Many current television comedies have been heavily influenced by the highly successful and highly despised slim-pit, known as "Married to Children", where the viewer is encouraged to avert and feel better than the characters. In "GG" the characters have errors, but we can see our own foibles in them and laugh with them, not with them. This stimulates television, where the authors challenge us to keep an eye on fast-paced exchanges and pop-culture / literary history / current event references. I am delighted to see these episodes over and over again and capture all the individual lines and references to past episodes. Stars Hollow is his own little world, one of which I will happily continue to visit as long as the series runs.
