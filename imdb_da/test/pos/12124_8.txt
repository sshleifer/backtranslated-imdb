First of all, let me say that in my opinion this is one of the 10 most underrated movies since this came out in 72. I absolutely loved this movie, it's very urban, gritty, no real Hollywood glam added it .. you can actually feel for all the characters in here, I love the blood just splattering abound in here. Joe Pesci was quite good in here, but for me it seems he was certainly outdated by the protagonist Joe Cortese, now I don't know anything about him, but boy can he really act. I think this movie is probably true because you live in New Jersey, live close to Philly, you here this kind of thing all the time. I think if the movie had a bigger budget and say Robert deniro as Jerry's boss, you would have a perfect movie, but hey who I should argue for, I was so keen on this movie that it is already up there in my mind, with middle streets. I wish Hollywood would go back to this urbanized, gritty show of filmmaking: it would serve them very well to do so. This movie is a great drama with great actors in it. and I recommend it to anyone.
