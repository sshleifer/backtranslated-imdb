"Nurse Betty" is the kind of movie you can't describe on a poster or in a trailer or commercial. It's the kind of movie you go into to expect a more mature "stupid and stupid", what about the temporarily crazy waitress going on a crossland adventure while avoiding villains trying to kill her. The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartfelt tale of two people chasing their dreams. The best part about "nurse Betty" is the unpredictability. Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to separate dreams from reality, and with the touching drama and hilarious comedies one can never tell what will happen next time.
