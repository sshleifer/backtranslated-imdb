As a former Erasmus student, I enjoyed this film very well. It was so realistic and fun. It really picked up the spirit that exists among Erasmus students. I hope many other students will also follow this experience. But I wonder if this film is all that interesting to look at for people without international experience. But at least one of my friends who never went to Erasmus has also had a lot. I give it 9 out of 10.
