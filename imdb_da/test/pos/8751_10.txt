Contains spoilers I had registered some time ago when it was on PBS but never got a chance to see it (probably due to prejudice about having to sit through 5-6 hours of masterpiece with his BBC made for TV production style (no music, settings all in one room, no outdoor scenes flat screen TV looks)) But after watching the movie Traffic (which I thought was pretty good at that time) I couldn't help digging up Traffik tape for to see what else they could have stayed in with the extra 2 1/2 hours. <br /> <br /> Boy, my predictions were wrong about this TV series. It is so much more involved than traffic. The characters are better off, so their actions are more credible. And the whole subplot that involves Pakistan completes the whole point of view for everyone throughout the supply chain, from the farmer to the end user. In traffic, the Pakistan story was rewritten and reduced to a good policeman versus poor policeman. <br /> <br /> There was much more meaningful discussion and debate about alcohol and other types of drugs, while in traffic most were passing references of no importance. Same with social issues, which in Traffic were communicated realistically without sounding preaching. While in Traffic, the characters portrayed it as a statement as the way they do in those made for the TV release of the week's movie. There was no bad guy vs good guy in Traffic, even the dealer is portrayed as a junkie who sells to support his habit instead of "no messes with me" type of person in Traffic. The only down part is that since I didn't see Traffic much before looking at this, it was hard not to compare the scene to scene, and even though the scenes weren't the same, I knew what the result should be already. Thank God for the history of Pakistan, which is different enough to allow me to enjoy it completely without thinking about what scene it is comparing to. Although I was thrown away, the fabrics in the ceramics thought of the statues, where Helen brought back to Germany (as in the history of traffic). Thank goodness Traffic wasn't the hokey and father-picked.
