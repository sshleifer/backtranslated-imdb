The head should have been a proud moment, not only for its stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature) or its director / co-author (Bob Rafelson), but also his second co-author (and short como) Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them seem to be shadowing, and for outsiders the movie is at best seen as a curiosity. While the TV series was famous for the Beatles' help! ', This movie is also judged by the same agreement. Yet, from the trite and painfully overstated Beatles movie, and even the dated Monkeys TV series, Head has a layer of depth. An undercurrent of human darker nature is at work here, and while it may sound like a bizarre thing to say about a produced pop band, the use of specific themes and images (hitting women, laughing at curls and moving pictures of a Vietcong POW shot dead-point-blank range) gives the film an edge that many "serious" movies would not dare to strive for. <br /> <br /> There are also the fun moments that range from James Bond parodies to 'Big Victor' and my personal favorite, Mickey Dolenz, under the watch of Arabian soldiers on horseback. (One of them turns to Mickey and lifts' pssst! ', Only for' pssst! 'To appear in subtitles!) The group is aware of their portrayed image in the movie (' I'm dummy, Mickey ?? I am always the dummy, claims Tork, summarizes its one-sided foil role in the series), meaning their characters ?? they play 'self' acting and non-acting here ?? is opened out more and is therefore less generic and annoying than they were in the series. This level of parody and self-awareness even takes their fab-four origins, with subtle ones invoking Maharishi and out-of-out accolades with a waitress who asks, 'Well, if it's not God's gift to the eight-year-olds? Do you still greet Ringo Starr? "Also listen to Tork whistling 'Strawberry Fields Forever' while in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are the songs, six of them here, a little more psychedelic than normal, which may have alienated their fan base and even a Frank Zappa cameo would not have beaten an adult audience to their charms at this time. Probably the best is the charming 'As we go along', although the first, a Carol King penned 'Porpoise Song' speaks interesting about the desire to live while the time ticks relentlessly away, and death is getting closer, on a lighter note, its abstinence from the 'porpoise to laugh' seems to be a direct mickey-take of 'I'm the Walrus'. > <br /> Constantly inventive with direct references to silent movies and drug culture, perhaps Head's finest feature is its narrative structure, not the only one but the most important reason why it is enhanced with multiple views, the story goes to the left, right , forward, backward, ci linear and through several levels of reality. In essence, a series of sketches hung loosely together, and its consistency is tightened by space-time defying plot, which interconnects its internal logic by flashback, dream sequence, mind prison, and remote channel changer. <br /> <br /> With a perfect beginning and end, this intelligent writing video was not what The Monkees' pre-teen audience expected and subsequently experienced a negative critical reception. Now these expectations have gone, this is in need of serious repetition.
