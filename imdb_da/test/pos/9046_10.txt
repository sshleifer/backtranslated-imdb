This is Classic Disney on its live action cartoon best! Bumbling college student Dexter Riley (Kurt Russell) develops a mysterious fluid invisibility formula that actually makes objects disappear and helps him save his cash band college. Further experiments show that it works incredibly well on people too! Riley's eye-catching discovery takes some exciting new twists when a gang of villains is led by the infamous A.J. Arno (Cesar Romero) steals the formula and tries to use it for their less than legal activities. Dazzling special effects and a quick story make this lively movie a college comedy textbook! I love this movie! This film has always filled me with a sense of wonder and joy. A comfortable little comedy that the whole family can enjoy. Not much violence or sex and absolutely no gang, make this a movie that parents can see with their children. Much in a series of Kurt Russell films at Medvale College. A pleasant little series set in a healthy America before terrorists, as people valued integrity more than money! I highly recommend this movie!
