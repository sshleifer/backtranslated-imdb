Like many stars on the big screen when their careers were wound up, many turned to television where they probably secured their reputation for posterity. Donna Reed is a point in point. I don't think Donna Reed ever thought Donna Stone was anything challenging, not for a woman who had won an Oscar to play a completely different type in From Here for eternity. She was definitely better off playing wife, mother and homemaker Donna Stone after playing Mary Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life. <br /> <br /> Donna was always handsome and clever and always helpful with the problems of her children and her husband. Carl Betz was not an idiot, he was a pediatrician who had his office attached to the house. Talk about the man's ever ready in a crisis. <br /> <br /> Although this was Donna Reed Show, because Dona's spouse at that time, Tony Owen produced it. Still, it lasted as long as the popularity of the two children, Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen. Fabares had the best-selling teens Johnny Angel she introduced to the show. She successfully completed the transition to adult star, best known for her role in Coach as Craig T. Nelson's wife. <br /> <br /> But Petersen was a bubblegum teen idol back in the day. Donna Reed Show dare I say got most of his viewers because of him. It's forgotten now, but Petersen also had a best-selling record, my father. Didn't do half as well as Johnny Angel. <br /> <br /> Now, Paul Petersen runs a support group for former children's stars like himself. So many of them end so tragically, it's good work he does. <br /> <br /> The stone family was Central Central America. They lived in a suburb near Chicago, they were living healthy lives. Mother and father were always there for the kids. Of course, the problems they usually had were nothing but breaking the curfew. <br /> <br /> It is this series I believe was the model of the television city Pleasantville, where Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are sucked in. <br /> <br /> I have nice memories of The Donna Reed Show. Easy to take, but not too serious.
