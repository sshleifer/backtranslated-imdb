So many great talents were used in "The Best Years Without Life", the result must be something miraculous. Think about what its director, William Wyler is facing; In continuation of a military victory over statistical powers that had committed horrific crimes and engulfed the world of fighting, he made a movie claiming that US leaders themselves were deeply anti-individual - that they had "wasted the best years of life they made or misled to fight the war - which, since ignoring the rights of individuals, had been for nothing, except for the argument of the degree of slavery, men should exist under. "There are beautiful sets of Julia Heron, Gregg Toland's filmography and a script by Robert E. Sherwood, author of "The Way to Rome" and other defense from individuals against tyrannical ideas. The ironic title was used to draw talents of actors such as Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo, Cathy O'Donnell and Hoagy Carmichael in a large but thematic drama. The wise line was your couple's experiences after the soldiers (three were spotlighted) trying to return to a victorious culture. Their bitter experiences and their recognition of their own need to fight again against what happened on the homefront represents a strong and calming counterpart to the conventional concept of selling "everything good with America". "March and his wife have a terrible time adjusting, and he drinks, O'Donnell's young man, Harold Russell, has hooks instead of hands and wonders if life can even be worth living and the worst of all Andrew's wife throws him over to a guy with dough and he has lost years, causing employers to ignore or deny his rights to a job to consider his individual merits, to get what he had before had he been demolished from his life and thrown into the risk - for nothing and the loss of everything he had ever had.The split climax of the movie comes when each of the three has to confront an oath to make battle again, each for his own happiness and all three succeed in finding the courage to fight - each for their own happiness, which is now threatened by a curious anti-self-anti-reality no matter what the inconsistent US Wyler's direction, especially of the scene in which Andrews sits cockpit of a mothballed B-17 alone and the scene of Russells Wedding is wonderful. This is a strongest movie and a great one on its own terms, a woman and men can agree on once. Music by Hugo Friedhofer and costumes by Irene Sharaff adds to its luster. One of the best and most unexpected movies all the time, in stunning B / W.
