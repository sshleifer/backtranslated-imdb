You sometimes know you just need it? Such is this movie with me. I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I like it, it's so stupid in some parts, but I find myself reaching when I'm down and just need a good laugh ... and trust me I'm just not a "goofy movie" kinda guy. You can read synopsis so I don't have to drill it, just be sure if you like Kelsey Grammer you will probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> One more thing, be sure to see the final credits. You don't have to read them, just watch them and capture the performance of "In the Navy" by Village People ... and friends.
