I captured this movie at Glenwood Cinemas this weekend as part of the Kansas International Film Festival, which, as usual, has provided a thought-provoking and eclectic sample of the world's cinema. <br /> <br /> I have been eager for Australian movies for a number of years, so it was good to know that this movie was included and I was certainly not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Excellent shot, highly targeted, it is a creepy tale of a man and his journey to the heart of darkness, as it were. It reminded me of a bit of Lynch's Wild at Heart, it has the weird madness in it, but I was glued to the movie for other reasons - namely that it presents a portrait of Australia which is ... very credible. <Br /> <br /> I've been to Land Down Under a number of times, once in the 1980s and again about 7 years ago with my wife. <br /> <br /> I don't want to go far and explain my holidays, but director Frayne seems to have an understanding that I find so strange and eccentric about Australia, a country responsible for extremities of , says Nick Cave on the one hand and Steve Irwin (the "Crocodile Hunter") on the other. <br /> <br /> An incy wincy whinge - I would have preferred even more of the 'unknown' Australia. Much more actually. But I also realize that it is only 1 and a half hours to do everything in ... 'Sigh.' But in general, this movie is very, very successful.
