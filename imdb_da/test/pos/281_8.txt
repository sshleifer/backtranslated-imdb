Excellent and moving story about the end of a unique affair. Then again, it is the intention of the film to rewrite another comment that each relationship can be unique and intimate. A real quality short film that caught me at my busiest, but had the ability to pull me down on the couch and watch, firm and quiet, for the duration. Bobby and Tessa are vigorously moving characters, and anyone who has suffered at the end of a love affair finds this movie a cathartic exercise. Besides that, the film in a movie's idea plays very well with this cast and is quite riveted, but in a slightly melancholy way.
