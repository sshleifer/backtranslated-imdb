I can't say what knows the source of this movie adds, but this is one of my favorite movies from Paul Mazursky (director and co-author). This is a resume on Shakespeare's "comedy", but completely removed from the scene. Without much text, Mazursky and star Cassavette make a mid-life crisis of passion and purpose. Desperate to re-center itself, Cassavettes retreat to a remote Greek island - where locals and the island even weave a little magic. With especially Raul Julia, Susan Sarandon and Molly Ringwald, it is an adult imagination that is emotionally satisfying and visually beautiful. And funny. It wasn't a big box office hit, but when it comes to DVD, it will sell.
