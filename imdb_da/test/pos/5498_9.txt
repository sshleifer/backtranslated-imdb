Simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted movie. Eastwood is classic as Grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo <br /> have their own partner (and love interest) Lilly Raines. But the film's <br /> <br /> grandeur rests on John Malkovit's shoulders as "Booth". He catches <br /> <br /> this character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity strangely enough. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think this was his best performance and should have received an Oscar for it (But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive also that year). All in all, a good movie to see you want to look into a sniper's mind and be on the edge of your seat all the way through. Enjoy!!
