Remember that this came out before the Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's "Lessons of Darkness". <br /> <br /> Le Dernier Combat is not "Sci Fi". It's more like judgment. I've seen it at least a dozen times. It really is a suitable companion to Herzog's "Doctrine of Darkness": "And at that time men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them." <br /> <br /> One day, unfortunately, can be today in Iraq. <br /> <br /> But back to Le Dernier Combat, be sure to look through the very first second of the movie. I wouldn't call it a "surprising end," but it's something you will miss if you just assume that the end will be nothing more than what you have already seen.
