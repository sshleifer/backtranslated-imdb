The first season told pretty much how all elements of the Marine Corps would work (ie, land, air, helicopters and jets) as a team. It's the season, I give the high rating to! (True, there are still many "freedoms" taken in season 1, but the stories were more credible.) The subsequent seasons were a gawd-horrible attempt at Melrose Place's encounter with Top Gun! <br /> <br /> I was a marine station at Miramar at that time, and I remember them shooting the show around the San Diego area. I met with Rod Rowland and James Brolin. <br /> <br /> Rowland's character was good to go. Brolin's character was only good in the first season. For some reason he resigned after the first ep of the second season. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a little of how the Marine Air Ground team works, then season is the one to see. /> <br /> If you are in Melrose Place and soap opera as plots with an attempt to merge them into Top Gun, watch the last two seasons.
