Twenty years later, this film still has echoes of its grandeur that floats around. Never has a movie surpassed Valley Girl's incredible soundtrack. The film completely encapsulated the 80s to such a perfect degree that it could only be realized here many years later. Nicolas Cage at his best. A movie that has so much character to make you realize how sad Hollywood has become (in terms of quality). Special Edition The DVD is packed with lots of extras and it is worth buying it as you have plenty of material to seep through. Definitely.
