After watching Desperate Living I was hooked on John Waters movie. I heard about Pink Flamingos and had to see it and boy was it worth it! Believe what you hear, it's the garbage bin! It is filled with everything dirty, which is actually the main plot of this movie. It contains the following: Incest, cannibalism, rape, chicken chopping, nudity (as you have never seen before - beware of the baby's birthday festivals), poo dining, fire aid, trailer trailer, perversion, transexuality, egg fat, cross dressing ... ... you gets the picture. Above all, this is a definite must! Just beware of the birthday party entertainer and divine wondering around the park!
