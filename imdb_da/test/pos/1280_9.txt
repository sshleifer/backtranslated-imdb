It is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists. Sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision that inspection gives you, you can see the gears and wheels that make these people what they are. The following is such a look into the past by Christopher Nolan, one of today's great time-waging storytellers. <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan's film production puts great emphasis on story-telling. Although people may complain it depends too much on the back and forth shift of time, I still find it fascinating to see how he uses one technique differently each time. Memento was probably the most marvelous piece of storytelling I've ever seen. Discount the hardened cynics who say it's an old piece of meat wrapped in fancy dressing. Memento shows how even the simplest of stories can be transformed into a mind-bender. The Prestige, which was significantly discouraged in comparison, still showed creativity in how its three stories were interwoven. Even in an enchanted business like the Batman series, Christopher Nolan sprayed some of his excellent yarn weave prints and breathed new life into the dark knight. The following is an intense tale of intrigue and mystery, where we see a dilettant writer who becomes a restrained voyeur who becomes an ignorant accomplice to a number of petty crimes, and finally sees an end that no one could have expected. Having never heard of following before, I had no idea what to expect. At each point, the film kept me guessing where it was leading me. When the mystery angle was clear, I constantly tried to find out what was going to happen next time. And this is where I think the movie is doing so well. The film has many elements that led me to many wild goats. <br /> <br /> The movie is completely black and white and told in several timelines, both of which are considered gimmicky these days. The following makes all this possible in the least formal or constructed way. There does not seem to be a reason why the story is told as it is, but you do not want to be taken on tour. The lack of pretension or self-conscious arrogance is what makes this style of narrative work. Highly recommended!
