"The next Karate Kid" is an excellent movie full of adventure and new surprises. It has a wonderful plot and morality that tells a wonderful story. Hilary Swank does an incredible job of achieving Julie's role. I have seen the actor playing Mr. Miagee, and this is one of his best performances in my opinion. The movie is fun and charming, and I can't stress enough about how interesting the movie is. I definantly gove this movie a 10 out of 10. I suggest the movie to anyone who likes a good movie.
