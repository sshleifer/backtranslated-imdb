This is one of the movies I can see over and over and not get tired of it. It is by far one of the best cartoon adaptations ever. I liked this even more than X men. In fact, this movie is kind of a cross between the X's and the matrix, and it came out before either. Wesley Snipes does a good job with Blade character. He's just not an emotional superhero. Also this movie is not sucked to get a pg-13 rating. Sour comics are primarily for children, but I like a little more in my movies. Let's see if we were in these situations, we would cuss up a storm so it's more realistic. This cartoon adaptation also has something that many do not. A good fight in the end between the bad guy and the good guy. Let's see it, none of the Batman movies had a very good end.
