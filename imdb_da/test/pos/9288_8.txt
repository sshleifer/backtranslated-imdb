A very fun look at some of Australia's current affairs and political pursuits. Chaser boys really seem to have fun with this show, and what I enjoy is that they all have their strengths; Some are brilliant (Chas) by making complete idiots by themselves, while Julian can pull the whole "I interview a famous politician, and I am suggesting that he pamper himself as a pot of jam" type of humor. <They have large segments in the show that take the mick of all sorts of aspects of Australian culture as our current issues show, our advertising and early morning television shows. Some material is a bit tired and predictable, but generally it is very fun to watch and will leave you with a smile on your face.
