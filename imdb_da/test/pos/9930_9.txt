Horror genius Dario Argento is one of my personal favorite directors, and his film "Suspiria", "Phenomena" and "Profondo Rosso" range high on my personal favorite list. "Opera" in 1987 is yet another exciting and brilliant movie that no horror lover can afford to miss, and it will keep you on the edge of your chair from the beginning to the end. This amazing and ultra-violent Giallo could well be described as the master's nastiest movie, which is something that Argento's films are not completely known for their violence. The violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes Opera a nightmare for the film censor. <br /> <br /> - Warning! SPOILERS in advance! - <br /> <br /> When Betty (Christina Marsillach), a young opera singer, becomes successful, a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath begins to steal her ... The murders are really brutal and of a particularly sadistic nature. The killer attaches needles to the bound Betty eyelid so she has to keep them open and watch while brutally killing people close to her in abominable ways. When you finish the slaughterhouse, the killer releases Betty and magazines just to get back to other friends of her ... <br /> <br /> As usual for Argento's film, the violence is extremely graphic and highly stylized. "Opera" is really a brutal movie and what a stylish and atmospheric movie it is. This movie is absolutely tantalizing and pure tension from the beginning to the end. The performances are very good, especially Christina Marsillach is brilliant in the lead. An amazing beauty and great actress, Marsillach fits perfectly into her role as the talented singer, whose fears and horrible experiences slowly make her mad. Other amazing performances include Ian Charleston as a feature film director who heads an opera, and director Argento's true boyfriend Daria Nicolodi, who plays a role in many of his films. The camera's work is excellent as in all Argento movies and the grand opera house is an excellent setting that contributes greatly to the beauty of the film and its permanently eerie atmosphere. The score, which is partly classical music and partially heavy metal, is also great, although I did miss Goblin's brilliant Progressive Rock Soundtracks, which are so characteristic of most other Argento films. "Opera" is truly a scary and absolutely breathtaking Giallo experience. This is an absolute must-see for any Horror lover, and I highly recommend it to any other movie fan who is not too sensitive when it comes to extreme violence. Excellent and absolutely tantalizing!
