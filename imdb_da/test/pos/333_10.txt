When I entered the theater, I thought it was a great movie. And I was not disappointed a bit. WOW! This movie is brilliant! The feelings felt throughout the movie are extraordinary! Great acting by Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman. This may be the best Tamil movie I've seen in ages. Mani Ratnam has once again proved that he is the best at making meaningful and heartfelt film. This film is basically about a young girl (PS Keerthana) looking for her biological mother (Nandita Das) who surrendered her in a refugee camp to fight for her country like her husband (JD Chakravathy). A young novelist (Madhavan) finds out about this young girl's story and decides to write a story about her. He and his wife (Simran) decide to adopt this young child, but one day she finds out that they are not her real parents and decides to search for her biological mother. <br /> <br /> This movie is really scary. The way Mani Ratnam presented the film is magnificent. <br /> <br /> My rating - 10/10
