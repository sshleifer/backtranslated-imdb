There has been some tough criticism of Comanche Moon on IMDb. I think it's for three reasons. First, purists are disappointed that the mini-series is not like the book. Second, it is not as good as the original Lonesome Dove. Finally, people would like to complain about IMDb and the biggest movies in the world get bad comments. <br /> <br /> I want to say that no movie is as good as the book. It's just the way it is. Lonesome Dove was not as good as the novel it was based on. In addition, the film by Lonesome Dove had some things discharged and changed. It's just the way it's going to be with a movie adaptation of something. So it's an infertile argument when looking at Comanche Moon. <br /> <br /> I agree that it's not as good as the original Dove. But hey, nothing is. I know people who govern their lives by the lessons they learned from the deaf. If I were to compare every book I read, movies I watched, and TV I considered by Lonesome Dove; I would be persistently miserable. <br /> <br /> This is made for TV miniseries based on a prequel to Lonesome Dave (the novel) and the sequel to Dead Man's Walk, and that's what you get. It's the best TV I've seen this year. It's a fun setup for Lonesome Dove. We learn to learn about Rangers history, we came to know and love in Dove. Zahn does a fantastic job of recreating Gus McCrae. Elizabeth Banks and Linda Forenelli (sp.) Also do good jobs that create characters that help fill up the pasters and Newt. <br /> <br /> If / when it comes again, I promise you will enjoy it is more than any crumby reality show.
