At first glance, a movie such as Northfork, a city flooded in 1955 and a group of 6 characters sent out to evacuate the remaining townspeople, may be a regular movie. As we soon encounter a remaining pastor who takes care of a sick child, a greedy landowner, we could be set up for a simple story we could easily digest. But when you first get introduced to this movie, you notice the amazing open-minded filmography and a scene with a church hall lacking a wall that opens up to pastures and scenic mountain views with cattle grazing. It soon becomes clear that after this scene and a couple of the city's peoples introduction that this is no ordinary film and no ordinary story, it is something very special and unique. <br /> <br /> At first glance, it's not that clear, but the movie and landscape that the viewer is witnessing is amazing, and the characters inhabiting this little one soon become extinct. is just in wonderful words. That's what can either draw you closer to this qwerky movie or you have bored and wait for something to happen. <br /> <br /> The films are deeply spiritual and dreaming as qualities, giving it a slow and methodical approach that I'm sure will drill some viewers, but if you are patient with it and see the bigger picture, the movie is great to witness. <br /> <br /> Rating 8 out of 10
