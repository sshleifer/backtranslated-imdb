Had the pleasure of watching this movie at the Big Bear Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say it was deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! Scripture is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a large voltage current that runs through it. You don't know what will happen next time the protagonist tries to cope with the realization that his new neighbor may not be the most ideal person living with him. The witnesses are quick and unexpected. The reason keeps us guessing. The dialogue feels very real. I thought the direction was top-notch, and director Travis Davis shows great potential to make it big in the study companies. Not too little praise is he considering the film's main role, so he had to do threefold this, writing, ruling and starring. If you get the chance to watch this movie on iTunes, it is worth downloading. It makes you laugh a few times. And it's more than most shorts offer these days.
