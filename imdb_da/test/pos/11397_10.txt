Boogie Nights is one of the best movies coming out of the 90s and I want to go so far as to say it should be in the IMDb top 250. I can actually understand why many would like it as result of the subject. I feel like so many, judging from this complaint that this film is received by viewers and critics that it is top notch film making. <br /> <br /> The direction and play of this movie surpasses well and reaches the level of brilliance. There is not a scene in this movie that is not amazing. The individual characters reach out and touch you. Since this is a film about the porn industry, one would not imagine that the sex scenes could be handled with such sensitivity, but they are. The direction is among the best I've ever seen - and I've seen many movies. <br /> <br /> The film is not about a particular person's story, it's about many. It is a character study about people who have many teams for them, and who perhaps in an industry will find strangers, but who still dream of the same dreams and have both good and bad for them. Boogie Nights pulls you into their story from the beginning, and although the movie is long (I think almost 3 hours) you honestly don't even see. And when it ends, you won't have it .... I'm not easy to impress, which means there aren't many movies I would give a 10 to 10 rating but this is one. In addition to the multi-character study, the use of music is in the movie. I have never in all my years watching movies seen music tell a story as well as in this movie. There was such a flaw in what you know, it's not something you get to see every day. <br /> <br /> Burt reynold's performance was perhaps the best I've ever seen him do, and Mark Wahlberg is incredible (I'm surprised there are still people who say he's not working well. I don't know how anyone might see this perhaps) The person who really surprised me was Heather Grahem (Rollergirl) who is absolutely fantastic in his role, especially the memorable scene with Burt Reynolds in Limo, to the end. <br /> <br /> Again, I will echo other IMDb reviewers saying that this movie is not for everyone. But I still think this was topnotch.10 out of 10.
