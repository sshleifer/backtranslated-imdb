I always had this concept that Korean movies were about comedy and drama, but "Christmas in the Fall" has changed my point of view. This movie is so simple. The doot has some melodramatic scenes or over the best comedy scenes. Not a single scene where the actors shout loudly. Not even a scene where the actor and actress kiss, not even a simple kiss. And yet, this movie is capable of reaching its viewers in ways that I didn't know existed. The end of the movie left me Speechless. I dint even cry, but my eyes were red hot. This movie left me a feeling I can hardly describe in words. I don't think I can recommend this movie to anyone, but I recommend this movie to people who want to see real movies. 9.4 / 10
