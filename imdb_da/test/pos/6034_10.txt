After repeatedly saying how brilliant so many Columbo episodes are, it's time to honor a maximal point episode. "Etude In Black" is not 100 percent perfect, but it's definitely more than 90 percent ... maybe 96 or 97! <br /> <br /> Last week, I reviewed "Just Married" and compared it unfavorably to "Meet The Parents". Well, here is one of the parents, Blythe Danner, in a much earlier role as wife of the famous orchestra conductor Alex Benedict, played by the legend, John Cassavetes. Alex has had an affair with Jennifer Wells, a girl in the orchestra (not his first affair, a presumption). She is harassing Alex for leaving her wife, but as her wife's mother holds the purse strings to the orchestra, Alex doesn't think it would be such a smart move to ruin his career and marriage overnight. Instead, he smells of a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and murder his young lover while resembling a suicide. Enter Columbo and guess what? It takes him about two seconds to realize that murder is more likely than suicide. It doesn't take much longer for Columbo to connect Alex to the victim, and soon he follows him around where he goes. Although Columbo is sure Alex is his husband, it actually takes a while and a few false leads (no one Columbo really turns off) before he has the decisive evidence. <br /> <br /> Along the way are some top-notch extra characters ranging from the perishable young neighbor to Jennifer Wells and the English mechanic who sounds like he'd be more at home on Coronation Street, through to the confused giant player who almost gets ready for the murder (he also saw Jennifer Wells, the busy girl!). And there is even a brief como from Commandant Lassard from the Police Academy movies. As with Leslie Nielsen in "Lady In Waiting", it is impossible to take him seriously (I bet you are thinking about the speech he made on the podium, right?!) But it's Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes and Peter Falk, who steals the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine as Mrs. Benedict. From the moment she discovers Alex calling Jennifer Wells' number from memory, she is deeply disturbed by exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful achievement as she struggles to trust Alex despite her intuition telling her that something is very, very wrong. Columbo does not help by interrupting his game of tennis to ask her incredible questions about Alex's relationship with members of his orchestra. As for John Cassavetes, it's a shame that he didn't make any repetitions like Columbo villains because he could have been up there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the all-time greats of the show. But this achievement is amazing! He is another who falls into the "highly annoyed" category and loses all patience with Columbo instead of being kind to him and indulging him. Despite this, when the fight is finally up, he reluctantly recognizes Columbo's genius. It's really a great show. It loses a few very small points for its straight sledgehammer display of classical music, as highlighted by many of the posters here, but none of them have any significance for the logic of the story or the characterizations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting! Finally, if you have not come across it, there is an amazing rock of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett early 70s show. I'm absolutely convinced that Steve Coogan saw this clip and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip resembles knowing that I know you from the critical introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra enters the action, plays circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara cheat and ridicule the host. It may not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavett show clip provides a good insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. It is evident from the quality of "Etude In Black" how well the couple worked together!
