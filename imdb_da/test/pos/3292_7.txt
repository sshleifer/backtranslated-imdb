This was on odd movies. I liked the adventure of it even though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murdered a federal official. Then he is a refugee on the run. They later blow their house and then he finally commits suicide. It looks like they should just have made a movie for a more mature audience or made it more family-friendly. <br /> <br /> This was on odd movies.
