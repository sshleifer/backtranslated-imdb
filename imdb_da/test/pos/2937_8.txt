Yes, I see this show. Because my boyfriend sees it of course. Well, that's what I'm telling my friends. But as no one has ever known me, I can say this; I love it! It is excellent trash can TV. <br /> <br /> First there is the panel; Tyra herself, who does not miss a single opportunity to talk about herself, but she must be taken seriously as she is completely businesswoman. Then there is Jay Manuel, a sober gay guy, very serious and incredibly professional, and Miss Jay, an outgoing "queen" of the catwalk and a damned funny guy and Nigel, self styled as the only man on the panel. <br /> <br /> Second, the show is a profound look at a low industry, and we must give it to the producers to show us the inside, which can be informative and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Finally, the edition is great; there is just the right mix of everything; The girls who live together in the ego house, their impressions on sets, the competitions themselves and the verdict. All this slips smoothly with the right beat. There are no lengths. <br /> <br /> Of course, there must be other factors that led to eliminations that we don't see in the shows; The panel consists of shabby divas, outgoing and quick on the bitch; Woe to those who offend them! But that being said, as long as a participant does not step on his toes, their judgment is usually fair - I think. <br /> <br /> Give your brain a break; If you can't beat them, join them and get started with watching this kind of reality TV with your loved ones. It will require more, somehow.
