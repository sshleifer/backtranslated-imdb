I have looked at Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very horrified by Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Last but it starts to wear thin because of many factors for me. First, my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, which shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube, which is generally fun or that people are accidentally injured (some intentionally). Umm, this when we see 4 to 5 times a week shows again and again the same things, I really have not seen anything so good and I can only laugh at people who are actually likely to break their throat and become paralyzed so many times. The show is like a late show will be / Colbert Report will also be with the policy, if you do not live in a blue state and are not an automatic liberal, this humor will be old too, McCain is old, yes yes, whatever. Libs have no influence on making fun of themselves because they are not wise enough to realize that they would end up as a sense of humor that they can laugh at themselves, so that is almost every show bash McCain or Palin, sheesh. So we get the same old peoples to be hurt as we are supposed to laugh at, and then some left-wing political humor that never laughs in itself out of its own weakness. I want to keep an eye out since I look at work, and that's all there is to hope for, I am entertained, but it gets a little old. I liked filling in the host of Chris and Alison even though they were actually a good change in the pace; Perhaps this show could make a rotating host thing. Olivia, which I thought at times in the beginning was really fun, has resort to this constant pouting answer, and it gets old, lol. 7 out of 10; It will keep you in a young mindset, which is good if you are a younger baby boomer like me (mid 40s). Maybe a cartoon of the day would be another segment they should do, there are lots of things they could use.
