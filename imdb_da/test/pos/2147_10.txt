I saw the gate of the heavens on the opening week almost twenty years ago. Tickets were sold in advance based on the great expectation of seeing Cimino's long pursuit of his 1978 masterpiece "The Deerhunter." The reviews came in, and critics ruined the movie with violence. An influential New York film critic led the way and most critics followed and the 3 hours. 40-min. film was pulled from the distribution. United Artists had Cimino shortened the film by about an hour, and it was re-released many months later for equally horrible reviews and bad business. The movie at that time cost about $ 40 million (now considered low budget), making it one of the most expensive in history, and Cimino had free clothing on the endless retreat project, even though it was only his third movie. "Deerhunter" had also had a negative backlash based on a perceived political ideology that was not popular. I mention all this to present a possible bias construction of Cimino. At that time, I thought the movie was very good, and when I saw the shorter version, it was still very good, only smaller. The film appeared again in a museum in the early 1990s. They had to show the long version, but they couldn't find an existing print. Nevertheless, when I watched the film years later, I thought now that Himmelporten was a masterpiece. Finally, the long version began to appear in a couple of selected cities I had to see recently, and it was well worth the wait. Heaven's Gate begins with the graduation ceremony at Harvard University. Two of the candidates are Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt, and we are some of the shortcomings in their characters early on. Despite the mandate, Joseph Cotton, in his speech to the graduate class, uses their education to enlighten and enhance their country, as many of the candidates behave as if they were part of an elite country club. The movie flashes for 20 years to Johnson County, Wyoming. A cattle company called the "Stockholders Association" has hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants who claim they are cattle thieves. Kristofferson's pages with the immigrants, while John Hurt is part of the association. Though Hurt is totally against this insane act, he is too ineffective a character to do something about it. A massacre takes place, but the immigrants do well to defend themselves. An American cavalry is going to save the association to claim them after most injuries have been done when they actually sanctioned the mass killings. Kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss, and the film ends with him years later as part of the elite class in his Harvard days, who are married, bored on a yacht, but died on the inside. <br /> <br /> This is a very complex movie that is brilliant in all departments, such as themes, structure, direction, filmography, writing, music, editing, set design and acting. Kristofferson, Walken, Hurt, Huppert, Dourif, Bridges, Waterston and Cotton are all good at showing very complex signs. Some of the great complaints I read about this movie state, which is ugly to look at, incoherent, too long, that the characters do not make sense and that the words are often incomprehensible. In his defense, Himmelporten has the appearance of photographs of the period, like "McCabe & Mrs. Miller" did. Some of the scenes are smoky looking to suggest the industrial revolution or sometimes horses, wagons, people pass by from all sides that create a sense of reality. (The critic who called it was one of the ugliest movies ever made, like to use thumbs a lot.) But despite all that, the composition of each frame and cinematography is impeccable. The movie makes much sense if you watch it. Everything is not spelled out by the viewer, and one must carefully observe to understand the motive of the characters or its themes. Regarding its length, it is a beautifully structured piece, sometimes moving, poetic, exciting or devastating with almost a large scene after another. At times, some of the words are incomprehensible, especially in some of the scenes that are busy with activity. But one could understand such a film like this by using film language, the gaze between characters or their actions. One day soon, this film will be re-released in its full length, so people and critics could give it a try. Don't let Michael Cimino become another Orson Welles - appreciated in his lifetime and unable to make the kind of great movies he is capable of doing.
