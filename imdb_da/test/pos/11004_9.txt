This is a beautifully filmed film that questions the future of all native peoples, especially nomadic tribes. Focusing on the Saltmen in Tibet, the movie is moving at a pace that can make some Western viewers unpleasant. For some people, life continues at the same pace as it has for thousands of years. This film follows a group of tribal people on their annual two-month search for salt. Their tribe lives its life in a traditional way (slowly by modern standards) and always counts with their many gods. This is a remarkable film that will retain a piece of what can unfortunately be history. Worth having time. Don't be in a hurry when you see it.
