First, you should not be fooled by my surname. My mother was thoroughbred Italian, so I really know Italian families, and I love mobster movies, even the fun ones like this. <br /> <br /> For those who have poorly ripped this movie (you know who you are) you must have your movie rights taken away from you because you don't know what's good. This is a wonderfully fun and well-arranged movie. The fact that almost no one is Italian in it is part of the joke, as far as I can see. And what red-blooded straight man could complain about spending an hour and something like Michelle Pfieffer? Puh-lease! When I watched this movie, it won me with the opening song of Rosemary Clooney, who was as Irish as you can get, but her pronunciation of the Italian words in "Mambo Italiano" is flawless and sets the tone for what to follow perfect. (Hell, I even bought the post the next day because of it.) Just the look of any garish thing in the apartment that I personally saw in my relatives houses but not in the same place (which I found hysterical) sold it for me . <br /> <br /> This movie is like Goodfellas on nitrous oxide. I'm just wondering why there aren't Burger Worlds, and what happened to the food these guys should have? My guess is that the crew ate it. "Fries are crispy. The shakes are creamy." My mouth wanders almost as much as it thinks of the beautiful wife Pfieffer. (And I never thought of clowns anyway.) And the three best things about this movie are Mercedes Ruehl's painfully funny mob king, asked Dean Stockwell as his philandering man Tony "The Tiger" and last, but FINALLY, not least, the great curl by Oliver Platt who will get more comic roles. And note to myself: find out where the black chick went. Ouch! Why does she work so rarely? This picture is right next to the big mob movies as it should be.
