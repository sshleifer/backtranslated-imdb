Judith Ivey as the scamming old whore is amazing. Emily Grace the young girl. Is innocent and exciting as she learns what goes down. Excellent direction and camera. The story is dark and disturbing. Molding is good. Shows what happens and can happen with a disadvantage. Large independent film. Small cast. The pace is slow first and then moves well. A great movie to show your teenage daughter's ambition to leave home early, to the open road and adventure. This movie has a low budget impression for it, but it works because of the low life forms and areas that these people are moving into. I will never stop a rest stop without thinking about this movie and checking my tires before going.
