This movie was amazing how good it was! The reason is extraordinary and the spectacular performance. At first, I thought it wasn't that big because of a summary, but after the first five or ten minutes of the movie it struck me that I was dead wrong. I literally cried about four or five times in this movie, and in spite of this I must have seen the same scenes again and again about thirty times a week! No, the singing scenes were not as amazing as they could have been, but the plot is what really gets you. American or Asain, I would recommend it to anyone - and I have now. I guarantee that after seeing this, you will get the best out of it and its plot. I hope you feel the same and also write a rave review!
