I would love this movie. Everything seemed to be in place for an enjoyable, if not groundbreaking, movie. It was set in the south of France, beautiful and recognizable actors led the cast, and I really admired the lively African costumes, proverbs and music. Despite all this, I didn't love it. Movies must convey their opinion at first impression, but "Secret Laughter" does not. Nimi and Matthew, played by Long and Firth (both leading romantic leads and should have known better), exude as much warmth and passion as dried fish. I deliberately used 'dried fish' because it was one of the few - too few - strong lines and moments sprinkled all over the film. Another winner was when Nimi caught Matthew snooping around his apartment. He finds a book with her first name written on it and says, "Your name is Nimi, I never knew." Then he insists that she call him by his Christian name. I watched this scene carefully as Matthew asked Nimi over and over to "say my name" and realize that until that moment they always called each other on their surnames. I thought this was a turning point for the movie and I expected it to get better. It didn't. Why does Nimi and Matthew always seem to be on ten steps, even in the "say my name" scene? What can Matthew like about Nimi, apart from his obvious beauty? And why would a sensible woman like Nimi fall into a comic book writer who sees his marriage as something he can put to a halt when a beautiful exotic adventure comes together? And I would like to add that it was a little difficult for me to get behind a romance based on infidelity. Yes, Jenny is a vicious harpy, but if I was in her shoes, but I would probably match her Cruella tactics to stop my husband from punishing. Believe it. The story suggests Nimi's painful past, but never fully investigates it. Some critics say Firth seemed a little awkward here and I agree. For the benefit of the actor, the actor called for more reliable longing and passion as the early 19th century snob, Mr. Darcy (and while wearing the scary britches)! As for Long, shining in 'Love Jones', there were times when she seemed to concentrate more on her accent than playing her character. Still, there were many moments ?? 'says my name' scene among them ?? when she was in total control and came across really good. Nevertheless, 'Secret Laughter' is not without its redeeming qualities, and I have found that it grew on me with multiple views. Nene was well portrayed as supportive and well-intentioned, although she did not fully understand Nimi's attraction to Matthew. I absolutely loved it when Nene confronted Mama Fola in the dueling proverbial scenes. My husband liked it, and usually he is the first to sigh and throw insults on the screen if he doesn't like what's going on. He even chuckled on stage when Sammy asked Matthew some very honest questions about sex. So there you have it. 'Secret Laughter' was good enough to entertain a spoiled curmudgeon as my hubby, but an avid moviegoer like myself would need more than one show to understand what the director and author were trying to convey.
