I also watched this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The camera was very well done if the memory serves me correctly. The boy was a bit much, but the girl's character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and it could have been intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I haven't seen the movie ever since, and I wander why it's gone. I would love to see it again to see if it was as good as I remember. The Elton John soundtrack was excellent.
