For a movie like this, there is always something to follow in the coming years. Clive Barker, the man who brought "Hellraiser", makes a horror movie that is part-Goth, part-mythology, and all the horrors. "Nightbreed" is a bunch of mutants that only come out at night and roam around the place Midian. Now, a man named Boone (Craig Sheffer) says he is suffering from hallucinations, he goes to this shrinking Dr. Decker (David Croneberg) who "helps" Boone with his problems. For weeks of this situation, Decker claims to be a purist, whom he is only a hate in disguise. However, Boone enters Midian and claims he is one of the mutants there. But a mutant named Peloquin (Oliver Parker) sees Boone as meat! However, his bid bites to Boone, so he is one of them now, after being killed by a madman of firearms. After being misled by Decker, Boone does everything to protect Lori (Anne Bobby) from him. Lori saves a mutant from the sun, and in turn helps the others. I liked the women's mutants who give a smoky death kiss and Porcupine Woman who dreamed that Boone is showing her power so seductively and deadly at the same time. I have enjoyed this horror movie all the way, and the rule is, never trust a shrink! Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars!
