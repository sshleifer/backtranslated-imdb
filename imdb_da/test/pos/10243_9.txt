The Milkwoman's story is a simple, unjustified love that has remained strong despite the last few decades. Now 50 years old, Minako Obha (Yuko Tanaka) lives alone and works two jobs ?? One like cash registers in a supermarket, the other as a milklady, makes her daily round at the hills of Nagasaki. One of her stops is with Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), an official who tends to be his nurse Yoko (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita used to see each other as school children, but after Minako's mother and Kaita's father, who seemed to have an affair together, their own relationship was destroyed. Located in her sick bed, Yoko knows that her husband's feelings for the Milky Way are not completely gone, and for Kaita's sake, after she's dead, she tries to construct a means to bring them back together. <br /> <br /> Although history can be simple, the emotions it deals with and the means by which it expresses them are truly where the film's heart and beauty lie. The film takes its time to showcase the simple daily routines for each of the characters, their actions being taken by an old lady who writes their story to a book while looking for her own husband showing signs of dementia. In the process, the social relationship of people depicts from different ways to live by how they interact with each other every day, how relationships form, and how past and present can collide. The director handles this wonderfully with a strong structure and visual style. It is only later in the film that history begins to follow a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic path, as if it were actually designed to fit the narrative structure of the book being written. It's all validated by the emotional depths the movie touches, most effective in Yuko Tanaka's superb performance.
