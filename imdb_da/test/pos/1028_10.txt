>>> Great News There is a BBC DVD release scheduled for July 31, 2006, UK - there is also a scheduled release in states - don't know the date - can't wait! ! <<<<< br /> <br /> >>>> below is my original comment <<<<<< br /> <br /> I agree with all the other reviewers - it's simply overwhelming that one of the greatest television drama ever been released on dvd <br /> <br /> The story is gripping - the play is excellent and character development is enthralling! <br /> <br /> Here in England we have a story about getting TV drama series and movies out on DVD through popular campaigns. It is very difficult to see why the rights owners do not go into DVD production? I'll e-mail one of the leading players in this grassroots movement and see what happens. Who made the production? was it the BBC? RW
