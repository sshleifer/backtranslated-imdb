This series is very undervalued. Like many others I came to Farscape after the series had been canceled. Bought season 1 and was surprised to find a cleverly written drama infused with a balanced mix of excitement, romance, humor and of course sci-fi. Just outside the bat, it got 10 to be the first series or movie to satisfy us how our hero - and any alien with whom he comes in contact - speaks English! Okay, a few others have broken the problem, but Farscape did it best. The point is, the authors pay close attention to details to make the show as credible as possible. <br /> <br /> With so much programming out there, it's a shame that balanced, entertaining series like Farscape don't get enough exposure and recognition to remain in production. While enjoying the four seasons and fortunately the four hour miniseries, we may be able to make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show.
