Being Cornish and brought up with tin mining, this movie is very special to me. Filmed in and around various places in Cornwall, it depicts the story of two of your children being caught down a mine with a group of miners. <br /> <br /> The title 'Haunters' refers to 'Spriggins' - Ghosts of Child Miners who live in the mine and are said to bring evil to all mine there. Events take place with an American who wants to invest in local tin mining, but when the young local kid Josh bothered by observations of a young boy's ghost, he and his American "boyfriend" set out to solve the mystery behind his death , climaxing in the rescue of itself and several miners from almost certain death when a new shaft is opened, and Spiggins stores them. <br /> <br /> Top films, albeit low budget and short, but worth seeing if you are from Cornwall and / or in tin mining!
