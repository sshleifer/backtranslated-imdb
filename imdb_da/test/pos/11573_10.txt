This is probably the best movie filmed for at least the last five years. I always thought getting people crying is far more difficult than letting them laugh. If you want to see 400 adults crying loudly in the same room, watch this movie. It's breathtaking. Javier Bardem performs the role of his life. You will cry, you will laugh, you will smile ... The most deserved fact is that in Spain everyone knows about Ramon Sampedro. Personally, I knew the whole story and even the end of it. So the excellent movie is like the story is told. And in this field is Amenabar a Master. <br /> <br /> This movie is a MUST.
