It's a unique movie as it gives us our only chance to see the young Noel Coward in all its ironic glory. Because he seems so reserved and detached, he is perfect for the role of an illegal cad who actually uses all those around him. But in the deadly serious (no saying) last act when Coward is to do as the Flying Dutchman, he is much less comfortable. <br /> <br /> But his way with an epigram is endless, and Hecht & Macarthur has given him some gems (Macarthur, really - he was the couple's white). <br /> <br /> The movie is brilliantly lit by the great Lee Garmes, but has little camera movement except a storm sequence. Hecht and Macarthutr cared for one thing - get their dialogue on the screen. (PLEASE NOTE: H & M itself has a blink and you miss them as pimples in the flophouse scene). The most notable supportive player is the only Alexander Woolcott, infamous Broadway columnist and close friend of both Macarthur and Coward, who appears to be one of the bitchy writers who were always waiting in Coward's reception room. <br /> <br /> Curious that Woolcott would be willing to make a film clarifying the legendary Algonquin Round Table, of which he was the founder, and Macarthur of an assistant. <br /> <br /> Scoundrel actually won an Oscar for the best story, although the victory is probably due to more Coward's impressive presence than any splendor in the plot. It's Coward, Woolcott, and the dialog you remember ...
