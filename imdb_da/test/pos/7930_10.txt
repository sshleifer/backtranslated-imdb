Eisenstein was not only one of the largest Soviet, Russian, film directors, but one of the great masters of the cinema, among Griffith, Murnau, Ford, Hitchcock, Welles and others. One of the greatest things in all his films was the edition, very personal, and in this movie is unusual. This was his first sound movie, and the use of musical scores by the great Russian composer Serge Prokofiev in the order of battle is a perfect contrast between music and image. Watching this movie is like taking a class or a lesson in Cinema, something that not many film directors can afford. I never get tired of watching REAL CLASSICS like this movie. I hope more people in the near future will recognize a good work of art.
