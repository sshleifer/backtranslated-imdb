It is a successful example of a 1950's biopic. It has the stalwart and beautiful young hero - yes, not so young anymore on the screen; Excellent, if unlikely, direction of Billy Wilder; a stirring fully orchestrated musical score of uplifting scales and, when required, heavenly strings by Franz Waxman; strong supporting players a gripping story; amazing photography of Hitchcock's favorite Robert Burks; and a story about a single historical event. The movie begins with Jimmy Stewart as Charles Lindbergh tries to get some sleep at a Long Island hotel before his epic solo flight across the Atlantic, from New York to Paris. And he can't sleep. <br /> <br /> The plane itself is filled with flashbacks to Lindbergh's personal story and purchase and construction of his unique high-flute monoplane, The St. Louis Spirit. St. Louis, Missouri, is home to the partnership that sponsored the flight. (Even in 1927, money spoke.) Anyway, the movie HAD has several flashbacks and Stewart's story. What is the alternative. Observe the units? Thirty-three hours watching Jimmy Stewart sit still on the control of his noisy airplane while days and nights come and go? I found the script and direction impressive for their time. Of course, unpleasant things are left out, so as not to introduce more ambiguity than the contemporary audience can cope with. <br /> <br /> My report is that the howling mob surrounding Lindbergh on Le Bourget merged the plane into pieces for souvenirs. And of course, nothing about the pilot's relief tube, although it would have added more humor. Some of today's viewers will find some events corny if they think too much about them. Aloft, Stewart chats with a friendly hike that, on his own quietly affected way, awakens him by landing on his cheek at a critical time. Later, St. Christopher's medal, which Father Hussman gave him, gently against the glass crystal of one of the instruments, just as Stewart desperately tries to land. Atheist Stewart is rescued twice - once with a fly and once by God. <br /> <br /> But don't remember. It's an impressive movie. The landing at Le Bourget, with an exhausted Stewart behind the stick, confused by searchlights, sweaty by fear and coinciding with fatigue, is truly convincing. "I want to tear this airplane up," he tells himself, and we can believe in him. <br /> <br /> Flying an airplane is not at all like driving a car. There is no even curved highway to tell where you are going, no paths for guidance. You are busy every second. You have to see the instruments, check each wing tip to see that they touch the horizon, on the plane's nose and constantly hold up, down and sideways for other traffic, although the latter would not have been much of a problem for Lindbergh. He was alone over the sea. <br /> <br /> Why? In one of the film's folklore moments, Stewart and Murray Hamilton, two 1920's gypsy infantry tribes, originate near their plane in a Midwestern field. "What is it? What makes us love to fly so much?" Asks Hamilton. (No answer.) Later, his financial supporters try to talk him out of the flight. Five other pilots have already died trying it. "But don't you understand? It must be done," says a passionate Stewart. <br /> <br /> It's not much answer either. Why should it be done now and why of Lindbergh? Why not wait ten years and stop wasting in the meantime? The answer, dear Socrates is partly in our glands. Pilots are a calm and safe mass, given to occasional arousal jags. Their main problem can be an addiction to an inner rush of adrenaline. Just for fun. Some of my best friends are pilots. Still, Lindbergh must have been right guy. He deserved to be treated like a hero. Not just because of the flight itself, but because of his later behavior - quiet, modest, a family man. We can easily forget his admiration for Hitler as he has more than done it by testing Corsair warriors in the Pacific and advising Navy on how to customize the planes and get the best performance out of them. <br /> <br /> See if you have the chance. If nothing else, it is a story lesson told with visual splendor.
