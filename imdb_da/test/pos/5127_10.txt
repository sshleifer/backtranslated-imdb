I watched the movie "Hoot" and then I immediately decided to comment on it. The truth is, NATURE needs protection against us because we are the dominant specie on this planet. Some people think that if they have money, they can do whatever they want, which is probably like, but if they think of the future more, they think of themselves that they would do something useful! This movie is not just about children, this film shows us that children are usually the ones who care more about it so adults do. When I was twelve, I saw some water lilies, and I knew they were protected by the law and didn't even dare to touch those who didn't fear the law, but feared that I could actually hurt them. (I'm currently 15). What ever was the play was amazing, the 3 main characters are well interpreted, and we must all learn from them. I hope you all think about what you saw in that movie !!! and enjoy!
