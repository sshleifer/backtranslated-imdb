Giant Robot was the most popular Japanese television series ever seen on Indian television. It was targeted at children, and we saw a robot for the first time in our lives. <br /> <br /> Many Indian children must have seen a machine for the first time outside school books. <br /> <br /> The series also showed a child in an adult organization struggling with evil. There is no doubt that many of us, who have seen Giant Robot in our childhood, yearn for our own robots and as a stopgap arrangement, look at our computers the same way. <br /> <br /> This show also featured ideal adults (referring to Jerry, Johnny's buddy friends and Unicorn chief Azuma). We grew to respect Japanese progress and regard Japan as the ideal Asian nation. <br /> <br /> BTW, then there were no satellite TV channels in India and the owned television broadcaster did not show much of Disney cartoons. I think that was how children's series like giant robot were appreciated. Today there are Pokemon etc, but they are not as fascinating or prolonged as the Giant robot.
