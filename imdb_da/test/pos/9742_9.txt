One of the most famous of all movie series! Still interesting today, even though it has an "old movie", it looks. The second series looks better, but simply does not match this one. Actors are doing well, especially Middleton and Lipson. Great editing of the universal expert crew member. The musical score was tracked from Universal's "Destination Unknown", "The Invisible Man", "The Black Cat" and "Werewolf of London". And what good action music it was! If there was a choice for all-time best series, this (no doubt) should be # 1.
