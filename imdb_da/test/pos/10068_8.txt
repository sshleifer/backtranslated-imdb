"What's his name?" "Loudon." "Loudon what?" "Clear." <br /> <br /> The gag still gets me, two hundred years after the movie was released. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie again and I love it today. I must have seen this one hundred times a day, and when I bought the DVD recently, I still remembered some of the dialogue. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a young woman imprisoned for a crime she does not commit. When she comes out, she decides to seek revenge. Griffin Dunne (what happened to him?) Plays a lawyer for his fianc√© father (John McMartin). The future father-in-law asks Loudon to take Nikki from prison to the bus station and to ensure that she arrives on the bus as part of a supposed new PR program. A seemingly easy task, but there are complications abplant, a fun dialogue and some admittedly stupid but fun scenes along the way. <br /> <br /> Madonna has a stupid voice in this movie, which until I was able to see with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible to me (therefore only 8/10) but on the other I can't imagine she doing it in her normal voice. <br /> <br /> This movie shows Madonna's cartoon (for lack these days, perhaps), and she's really fun in the role. Dunne makes a good foil, while Haviland Morris is perfect as the fervor of openness. Yes, it's predictable, yes, the jokes could be better, but I think it's a good movie and will be happy to sit down and watch it 100 times more.
