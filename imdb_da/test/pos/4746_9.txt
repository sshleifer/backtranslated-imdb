Roy Scheider is not Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood, but who is there? Seven-Ups is one of the better cop movies, even today, and is second only to McQueens Bullitt and the Dirty Harry series, which is not a bad company. There are three things that seem to make a good cop movie: A trustworthy script with great plays, great ticket scenes and some heavy actions. This movie has all three and car chase scene is better than in Dirty Harry. Scheider plays the head of a group of policemen out to get Nys villains sentenced to seven years or more; hence the name Seven-Ups. Overall, not quite up to Dirty Harry or Bullitt, but far better than all the movie films made since the Dirty Harry series. 10.9.
