"Bon Voyage" has the fast pace that in some ways reminds me of the Indiana Jones / Star Wars movies - it's like you're on a fast train or roller coaster. It is billed as a romance, mystery, thriller and farce; It is all this and more, including honest observations of French society's reactions during the Nazi invasion at the beginning of 2. world War. And it is also an exhibition of juggling that involves 7 protagonists. The scenes all seemed historically accurate (to my eyes) and gave an excellent feel to the period. <br /> <br /> All the actors were well-cast and gave good performances, but the IMO the most amazing was that of Isabelle Adjani who played the role of an opportunistic, self-centered French movie star; Not only did she play quite convincingly the role of a young actor, perhaps half of her age, but she also played her amorous wiles convincingly yet in such a way that the audience sees that she is only half serious and more complex as a person than just a gold digger. Her character and energy propel the film through from the beginning to the end. It was not until I read Roger Ebert's review that I discovered she was 48 at the time of the movie. What a beauty! <br /> <br /> I appreciated the end - it's satisfying, but lets you write your own conclusion about what's happening to the protagonists. <br /> <br /> As another user commenter observed - did not arrive late; you must be there from the opening scene. Good advice. <br /> <br /> I gave it 9 out of 10.
