Lightning strikes a scattered cemetery; The name of Adam 'Batman' West: All pop up on the screen before the opening credits are even over, and yet, despite these pretty naff items, a dark night is not as cheesy as it might seem at first. <br /> <Meg Tilly (Jennifer's sister) plays a beautiful student Julie who reluctantly advocates staying alone in a mausoleum as part of her dedication to exclusive high school clips The Sisters. What Julie doesn't know is that the other 'sisters' plan to freak her out with some ghoulish pranks ?? or that the latest body to be arrested in the mausoleum is the 'psychic vampire' Raymar feeds on the life force of scared young women. It is not the most original set-ups, but fortunately there are enough inventive touches to help set this movie apart from the competition, my favorites are macabre views of everyday objects embedded in the walls of Raymar's apartment and the eerie way whereupon the moldy bodies flow through the mausoleum's cold marble corridors during the excellent finale. Hal Trussell's impressive steadicam filmography and Tom Burman's wonderful macabre special effects also add immensely to that chilling atmosphere.
