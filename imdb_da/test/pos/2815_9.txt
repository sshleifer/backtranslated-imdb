I lack cable vision and no longer have "DirecTV". So, being a rural court, I have to wait for DVD releases. Blonde loves, but not lace, of course I have not only "Barb Wire", but I have "Stripperella: The complete first season". I have not yet found "VIP" or another season for Stripperella. I have the "Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding" DVD. I have the problems of "Playboy" that Pamela Denise Anderson asked. I could go on. I love Pamela! There is no one or anything that can blame me for enjoying Stripperella. But there are certain elements that I do not like but live with, for other series also show smoking and alcohol consumption, sometimes. But these are my personal disadvantages, and I'm not trying to let them ruin fun in a series like this for me. I was also surprised by the change in animation style but I customized. But the amount of female nudity dropped, and this is a big disappointment, as much of it is expected in a series with a premise like this. But then again I adapted. One of my favorite episodes of "Mork & Mindy" was when they met Robin Williams! So, of course, one of my favorite episodes of "Striperella" is when Pamela & Tommy visit the club and the comparisons begin! If there really is a "Season 2", I hope I can find it, because I have to complete my collection completely. I recommend this to other admirers of the female form and lovers of blondes. (Hey! Psst! "Blonde" & "blondes" is the feminine form of spelling "blonde"! Your software should already know it!)
