The story of this movie is pretty amazing B grade stuff, but the manuscript required a scary guy to play the lead, and in 1940 it meant Peter Lorre. And Peter is in his craze in this one as owner of the island of Stephen Danel, who gets the prisoners paroleed for his detention to work on his diamond memory. On arrival, the parlors discover that they are slave to my workers who can be beaten or killed at Danel's whim. <br /> <br /> Only two things seem to be worse than the slaves; Danel's wife and monkeys. Monke ticks him so much that his violence against them is likely to lead to the only meat slaves receive. Lorre is perfect in its role here and creeps the screen on industrial strength. Although the script is not Casablanca caliber, editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes. This is a very clear story, but I'm not sure which niche this movie filled. For a long time after a short topic and too short for a movie of my own length, I am not sure how this was marketed to theaters. <br /> <br /> I just caught this for the first time in a late evening / early morning TCM show. Lorre fans will not miss this if they have not seen it.
