This deceptively revoked, low-key, eerie pace of the Aussie crime thriller unravels with a relaxed ease and relaxed self-confidence is a pleasure to see. The zealous beaver working class kid Jimmy (an appealing feckless Heath Ledger) longs to do something out of his unwavering ordinary life. Jimmy gets his big break when local crime kingpin Pando (an excellent Bryan Brown) assigns him an easy curvy, which means delivering $ 10 grand to an old lady. Jimmy finds himself kneeling deeply in serious trouble when he loses Pando's money. Author / Director Gregor Jordan is engaging in simple narrative about how things are not always what they are blown to be young love, all actions have consequences and it mocks old chestnut about how crime does not pay, acts as a charm thanks to a wonderful wealth of deliberate less eerie details, a strong subtitle on man's duel capacity for both good and evil, a good sense of undisturbed irony, the chillingly material way of violence is presented, and the amazing foundation of the various complicated drawn warts'n'all low-key characters in an instantly recognizable and completely credible banal everyday reality (eg, Panda shows playing Scrabble with a flunky and at some point interrupts a business relationship with a lighthouse to talk to his son over the phone). Judging from his fine-grained and bipedal depiction of the cunning, not to be disappointed with Pando, Bryan Brown undoubtedly qualifies as one of the finest actors to recover celluloid. A robust and satisfying little sleeper.
