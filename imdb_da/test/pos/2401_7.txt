I watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively. Anger rose in me to see the ruin of Hanoi after the 12-day bombardment. And by living in the country right now with my parents who have lived in Saigon for 50 years, I understand that we are much better now and that would have been better if the American does not bring war here. In the film, I learned more about the different kinds of wars that America was planning in Vietnam and what disasters they caused. The series seems to be doing well with interviews with the real people. But I do not like that some people only give generic opinions, like the analyst at the end of the series, I forgot his name. There must also be several documentary images, such as life in the South Vietnam army camps and the Nordic countries (if possible). There is also a sudden change from the year 1972 to 1975 (I'm not sure if the intermediary was censored because I saw this series on TV).
