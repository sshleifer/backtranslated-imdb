I think this movie is different from most movies I've seen. It was exciting in a way, and no matter what others say, I say I was surprised at the final solution. Certainly couldn't see it coming !! Though sad, it's worth seeing .. I can't think of any movie that would be like this! The actors knew what they were doing. If you say this movie stinks, you probably say what most people would say. But if anyone says this movie is common, I totally agree. And Norman Reedus should pay more attention. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm freak, but I liked it very much. That was kind of mess, but who cares? I'm tired of boring and ordinary movies.
