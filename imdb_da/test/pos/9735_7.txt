I don't understand all these bad reviews. I think this movie was one of the best in the puppet show series. To be made on a low budget, one can understand why the special effects and plays were not spectacular, but they were not quite terrible. Greg Sestero brought a lot of charisma to the role of Andre Toulon. He has a lot of potential and I hope to see more of him soon. And even though the film was not excellent and there was minimal violence and doing, this movie was a lot of fun. I am a great puppet master and have grown to expect blood and make from the movies in this series, but I can say that I never get bored through the whole of watching Retro Puppeteer. So if you ever get an opportunity to watch this movie, don't automatically see it as unworthy of your time. Give it a try. You like that.
