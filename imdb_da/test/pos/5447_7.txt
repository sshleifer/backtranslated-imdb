Leno speaks through his punch lines. This spoils the joke for those of you who haven't figured it out. His show is held in a micro-studio, for one or two reasons - the small amount of laughter is amplified and few will see him. The letterman set is the polar opposite - Ed Sullivan would be proud and the balcony is always full. NBC, sticky NBC, will never get it. The founder David Sarnoff's megalomaniacal business continues to be all about the money. At least, CBS has a little family feeling about it. <br /> <br /> Leno collects cars or stamps while Letterman drives cars. The difference is informative. <br /> <br /> When I chatted, I used to ask other chatters to send me an email if Leno _ever_ said something that was fun. I never got a single email. Letterman has excellent timing. He can also reuse the most eerie joke in such a way that it becomes one of the funniest things in that night show. Letterman has built other careers. Paul is now known and respected in his own musical right. Even Paul's other band members receive recognition and career advancement. Biff Henderson has become a name for America. Even the companies in the same block as the Ed Sullivan Theater are getting a boost. What has Leno ever done for anyone else? Personally, I'm happy that Dave moved and Leno got the Carson concert. I have never seen NBC show before and had no reason to leave. <br /> <br /> The Top Ten list is an American icon. It's also Letterman. Leno is a caricature dream, nothing more.
