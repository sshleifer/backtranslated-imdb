This is actually fun. I really enjoyed it even though it wasn't the original at all, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great together! All the characters are cool and the story is pretty good, plus Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy are simply amazing in this! Rene Russo is excellent in his role, and there are plenty of laughs to have had (especially when Deniro matures Clint Eastwood and Danny Glover's lines), plus the finals are just amazing. Yes, it's just another round of the "Buddy Buddy" movie, but it works because of the amazing chemistry between De Niro and Murphy! Plus it also had some great ticket scenes! It's not that much right, but I found it very fun and a perfect way to pass the time! But the biggest villain was very weak and was not very good at all. This is far from being the best "Buddy" Buddy "copfilm, but it is still a very entertaining one and I thought it was pretty well made and written too! Plus the end was quite fun! This is actually really fun, I really have enjoyed it, although it was not the original at all, Robrt De Niro and Eddie Murphy were good together, I highly recommend it! The management is very good! Tom Dey does a very good job here with great camera work, cool angles and keeping the movie At a fast pace, the actor is a lot of fun! Robert Deniro is fantastic as always and is great here, he is fun, very sympathetic, had great chemistry with Eddie Murhpy made his usual amazing stuff, drawn some really funny faces, seemed to enjoy itself, had some fun lines and had a really cool character! (De Niro Rules !!!!!!!) Eddie Murphy is also great here, he is fun, just as De Niro did his usual fun things, natural way s loved being in front of the camera and while he can do this in sleep he was still very fun to watch! (Murphy Rules !!!!). Clean Russo is wonderful here! She had a cold sign, and although she didn't have much to do, she added a lot of screen presence and made her character interesting always, she was just amazing! (Russo Rules !!!!). William Shatner is funny here surprisingly and did not exaggerate it and brought some good laughs into the movie. The biggest villain is ok, but a little weak and rather bland, he still did what he had to do enough. The rest of the throw makes it fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. *** 1/2 out of 5
