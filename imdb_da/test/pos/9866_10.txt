This review is based on Producer's Cut: <br /> <br /> 'Halloween 5' was a huge disappointment at the cash register back in '89. Personally, I have always loved it and am proud to have it in my collection. But because of the failure and also due to rights issues, it would be 6 years before we would see another installment. The film had the opportunity to be one of the best if not the best in the series. A hardcore fan who writes the manuscript, the return of not only Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis and George Wilbur as Michael Myers, but also the return of the character of Tommy Doyle from the first film, a large studio supporting the project and an autumn release all made the film sound a hit in the production. So what went wrong? I give you two good reasons: Re-shot and poor editing. Due to a poor test screening and also the unfortunate passage of Donald Pleasence, the film was changed and not for the better. The film, like parts III and 5, fueled the box office and got negative reviews from both critics and most of the series fans. But then, thanks to the magic of booting, the original cut leaked, and many fans, including myself, were very happy. I want to finish this part of my review by saying this: This movie is so far my favorite 'Halloween' movie and I'm not afraid to admit it. Advantages: The score is simply spell binding. Has some of the best writing and dialogue in the series. 'Halloween 4' emulated the original because it was more about excitement and mood instead of blood and gut, and 6 are the same. Great performances, especially from the late and much missed Donald Pleasence. Moves at a fantastic pace. An interesting explanation for Michael's evil and why he does not want to die. Some brutal kills. Some pretty shocking moments, my favorite is the one involving Kim Darby's character. A lot of really cool nods to the previous movies. Some good surprises. Like the two previous successors, this one has a great cliffhanger end. Disadvantages: Although the explanation of Michael's evil is fascinating, it makes him a little less scary. Since when can Michael move from place to place so fast? <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: This was the first 'Halloween' I saw in the theater. I was so excited because I had really thought 5 would be the last one, and then I heard this happened. I enjoyed it at that time, but over time I saw it for what it really was: A great movie caught in an OK with a horrible ending. Why should the filmmakers listen to the people at the test examinations? If they had released this superior version, it might have done a lot better and the series can't get stuck in the mess, it's right now. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
