Clint Eastwood plays a wounded union soldier found by a girl from a confederate boarding school and he is taken in and used back to health rather than turned to confederate soldiers. Seems that women's folk music in this place has ulterior motives. Geraldine Paige, the chief advocate, does not justify turning him into the Confederacy and even leaving him as his cousin. Of course, when the man makes it feel better, he becomes quite the woman's husband and does pretty much the rounds, but when he gets busted, he gets really busted. In fact, so badly he gets his leg cut off, but it is for his own good, of course, not out of retaliation. Things are carried a little longer, but when some women don't get what they want. I haven't seen this for years, and it still has some creepiness to it that today, standards are still pretty strange. Not typical Eastwood at all. If you haven't seen this, it's worth seeing. 8 out of 10
