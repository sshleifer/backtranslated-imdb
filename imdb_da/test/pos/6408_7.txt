Compared to this, Tarkovsky is a freak freak. Compared to this, Bela Tarr is MTV. Compared to this, the movie "Russian Ark" is a roller coaster ride. <br /> <br /> I have just described 3 of the everlasting experiences I have ever known, and this tops them all. But that doesn't say it's bad. On the contrary, I really liked it. But it was a task. <br /> <br /> I don't want to describe the plot because you can easily find it elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the plot is INSANE. It is one of the most creative and bizarre ideas since "Becoming John Malkovich". I think the interesting plot is the main reason I loved to nod (also humor was nice. It is something we rarely see in slow artistic films). Here we see a bizarre turn of the norm. Most movies have small plot and small fabric; but they take 90 minutes with a lot of eye-catching pictures to keep us excited. But "The Hole" has 100% plot / theme without much to please the eyes. In this respect, I assume that it is a truly intellectual experience as if reading a painfully sensible novel like Thackaray's "Vanity Fair" (which I have never been able to finish!). <br /> <br /> If you have a huge attention span, I think you really like this movie. Despite its molasses pace, it is extremely creative and imaginative. It's like Jean-Pierre Jeunet on quaaludes and with a dull, dusty camera lens. Good luck.
