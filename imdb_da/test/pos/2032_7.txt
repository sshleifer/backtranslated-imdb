Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid flick in all respects. Everything from acting to film was solid. Not a perfect linear plot line, but there was nothing you couldn't see coming. Maybe a bit melodramatic on points, but again, a pretty decent movie anyway. Definitely worth checking out. If you have any doubts about which movie to rent on the weekend, give it a try. Although you may not want to run out and buy it, I found it worth it.
