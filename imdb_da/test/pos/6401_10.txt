We all agree. It was a great show and let die die before it's time. I've decided that if I really enjoy a show, it's often the kiss of death. I love the peculiar, ensemble cast shows, and a good setting always helps. I really expected to see many of these stars in other TV productions, but short of Mariska Hagartay, who played Fisher Stephens crazy girlfriend, I have not seen many of them except in occasional comoros. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Key West, Northern Exposure, Gilmore Girls and Veronica Mars ... all amazing shows, all unfortunately gone before their time. <br /> <br /> Hear us, loud and clear, we want Key West on DVD ..... thanks.
