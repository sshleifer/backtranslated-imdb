Soul's Midnight Stars Armate Assante (Simon) staring in "The Mambo Kings" and Elizabeth Bennett (Alicia Milford). Along with the sexy vampire vixen, Lucila Sola (Iris), Simon lures pregnant Alicia and her husband Charles into the netherworld of Souls midnight. Assante sinks his fangs into the script by writers Brian and Jason Cleveland and you enjoy watching him and Iris kill. Alicia and Charles (Robert Floyd) are trying to stay alive while gore keeps your desire for blood sated. <br /> <br /> (spoiler alert) In today's filled landscape, it is not surprising that a back-stabbing preacher is being bitten. Looks Cool? lots of details at the Borgo Hotel and cool special effects at the end. I had a lot of fun watching this movie ?? It does not take itself seriously and looks good.
