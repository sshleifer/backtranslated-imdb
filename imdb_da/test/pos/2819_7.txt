------ Spoilers ----- Spoilers ----- Spoilers -------- just a few small <br /> <br /> So on Satilite channel, missed the first 30 mins movie, will keep this comment short and informative. <br /> <br /> The movie is about 5 characters. The action is very poor for afew characters. 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people, but it backfires and 3 kidnap the 2. This is one of those types of movies where the screenwriters are trying to become thoughtful or philosophical, mystical and ... you get it point; But do for themselves, personal, lack of thinking, they fall terribly short. Like one of those caught there should be some kind of psychology geek part, but his tongue can't speak it. The authors believe that if the geek uses a lot of 8 letter words, amateurishly - unconsciously, I think the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it. I wish I could give an example, but I can't remember anyone - just as it was said. The end was also poor. But one female captivity acted as an old and relatively clever lady, although she and the rest had a lot of clich√©s. So why should I give this movie a 7 stars if I thought of everything above? Simple, I give all seven stars to LISA KELLER - a sexy one $$ momma. She's fine lol I'm a beautiful beauty, and she's exactly that. But don't let me confuse you because I'm not a pervert and this movie is NOT a porn in any way. their is something about her, I can't explain, but I like it. I can remember the scene where a captivity has struck, and as he looks for a way out, he encounters Keller. She tries to get her way, but she has no chance. He throws her down, kneels on the stairs and he pulls down his pants, no panties;). Now, even though she has a fantastic ass - and this shot leaves a little to the imagination for a long 30 seconds, I think - it was her facial expression that got me. She wanted it and that look made me think I was behind it. I would have torn the luggage up! After this expression I could not look more objectively at me, I was in love. laugh out loud. I'm happy to have seen this movie, but if Lisa Keller didn't play the lead, I'd have changed the channel .. Well ... after I saw the scene I mentioned above. I'm a LISA KELLER fan, but it looks like she's not a consistent actor since this 2003 movie is her latest. But I look forward to another movie with her in it.
