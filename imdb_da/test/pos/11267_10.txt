I had the pleasure of watching Saltimbanco live before I saw the video version of the show. While nothing compares to being there, the people behind the video did a great job of capturing the taste, feeling, sensation and so much more. The amazing performances of Saltimbanco's amazingly amazing troupe are beautifully recorded throughout. The video flows as smoothly and artfully as the production itself. A wonderful experience.
