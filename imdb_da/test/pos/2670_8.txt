This short topic gathered kudos from every possible site for its claim of religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> After a session on a recording studio, Frank leaves Sinatra and arrives at a group of children looking up at another because he was Jewish. He talked to them as only an American icon could about the meaning of prejudice and what we had just fought for the Nazis. The meaning could not be clearer. <br /> <br /> Both songs from this short topic were recorded and sold big for Columbia records. If you are a dream and the song written for the movie, The House I Live In. The latter is one of the best songs about an idealized version of America, we all want to strive for. <br /> <br /> Sinatra actually recorded The House In Live In again during the 60s for a joint album he made for his Reprise record label. The album is now a rarity and it should not be. His collaborators were Bing Crosby and Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians with the orchestra performed by Nelson Riddle. <br/> <br /> Axel Stordahl was Sinatra's primary music director and organizer in the eighties. When he died, this position fell to Nelson Riddle. Stordahl plays orchestration for cards and the Columbia record, Riddle for Reprise. <br /> <br /> Sinatra aficionados and others should listen to both back and compare. And capture this worthy movie when it is shown.
