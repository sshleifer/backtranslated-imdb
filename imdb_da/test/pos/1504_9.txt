This is an interesting movie. I think it is very humorous, though humor is very black. Fulci is good and fun that works for himself, it's a real fun and really crazy "self-portrait" of an artist ("I make horror movies. If I wanted to make love movies, nobody would buy tickets ..."). And it's really SEXY movies too: Almost all the time there is some "action" or excitement going on; and many sexy girls / women ... Maybe it goes to the heart of why someone starts making movies / art in the first place ... It is a really psychedelic trip, perhaps best seen a bit full or a similar state of mind. There are also some really ugly scenes, of course, because it is Lucio Fulci. In fact, some of these scenes are quite obnoxious. Anyway, it's one of the three best and most complete Fulci movies I've seen (the others are House By The Cemetery and Zombi. Haven't seen The Beyond). In fact, the script everywhere, in my opinion, is pretty brilliant. You can watch this movie as a portrait of an extreme neurotic or a person suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (fashionable words): The character has a compulsive need to confess "crimes" or bad thoughts; He has not even done crime in particular. And he asks himself constantly: What if I did it? What if I want to do that? Have I done that? Will I do that? He overreacts and exaggerates his thoughts. I'm sure Fulci has been interested in psychology, and maybe even reads some of the area; For example, in his "House By the Cemetery" movie there is a character called Freudstein. This is perhaps the most concentrated and rather personal movie Fulci did. I also like the simplicity of the photography / pictures in this movie. The only thing that disturbs me a little is sadism, especially against women; I don't quite understand why? Is it entertainment? Is it art? Is that horror? Anyways and overall, this is really interesting and well made movie, absolutely recommended classic movie at least for fans or anyone interested in this genre. For the others it may be too much.
