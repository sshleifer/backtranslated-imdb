There is absolutely no doubt that this version of Tarzan is closest to Burrough's vision. While he was happily collecting his royalties from the films produced during his lifetime, he often made it clear that they were a little more than the joking children in his stories. The movie studios' ridiculous obsession with casting Olympic swimmers like Tarzan was beyond ridiculous. I think we should consider ourselves fortunate that they did not put their views on bouncers. <br /> <br /> Before this movie, the most faithful adaptations were in comics and comics. As nice as some of these were, we had to wait seven decades for a filmmaker with the integrity to respect the character he had been created.
