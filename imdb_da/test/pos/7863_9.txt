In the short period between Clint Eastwood's strict spaghetti westerns and his Dirty Harry movie, he and director Don Siegel joined forces to make this unusual image. Eastwood plays an injured Union Army corporal during the Civil War, occupied by a southern school of girls until he recovers from his wounds. It has been a while since the young women (most of whom seem to be teenagers) have had a man on site, so they are reluctant to approach the local rebels. The resulting situations are often humorous, shocking, erotic or even grotesque as Eastwood slowly regains its strength and begins to bow to the business. <br /> <br /> The basic story almost sounds like a pornographic movie. We have a masculine man suddenly surrounded by young nubile women. Most of them are sexually attracted to him. And he is more than willing to spread the love among them. The material never slides right down to the level of "tasteless", however. Eastwood, Siegel and film photographer Bruce Surtees are such talented filmmakers that the film always retains its dignity. Eastwood's John McBurney is like no other character he has ever played. McBurney is an amoral, conniving and lustful charlatan. He knows that most women, even the youngest, want their bid, and he lets more than one of them have a shot at him. McBurney often uses flattery to lubricate the women and then uses his robust look to roll them in. He is like a drunk player at a cocktail party that often hits other women even in the same scene! Eventually, his lustful ways give him great pain and loss in a way that you must see for yourself. This author would not dream of revealing the specific consequences of his actions, but there is no doubt that he has them coming. <br /> <br /> Eastwood typically offers good performance. He seems to have a blast with the role until things get really ugly, then he gets bad and ugly. Geraldine Page is a treat like steely B * tch that runs the school. We know she wants McBurney as much as the other girls, but with her checkered past shown to us in flashbacks, we find that it's not all she's after! Mae Mercer as a slave belonging to the school also gives a good performance. She knows, of course, that McBurney is a skunk from the beginning and she never lets her fake charm bring her guard. This is a sign you want to know more about after the movie is over. She seems to have a greater knowledge of the world than anyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> Beguiled did badly in his theatrical release. No one was absolutely sure what to do about it, and some of the content made no doubt a few eyebrows in 1971. For example, we see Eastwood romantic on an early stage a 12-year-old girl. Is he just trying to keep her quiet when the insurgents come close, or does he really enjoy it? Probably both! A fantasy sequence later even shows Clint to get it on with not only Page but her young assistant! Really some interesting times in this. It's good that Eastwood became the star he did or it could be long forgotten. <br /> <br /> Recommended. 9 out of 10 stars. The dog.
