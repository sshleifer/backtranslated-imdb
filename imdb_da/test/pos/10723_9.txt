Life went great for New York City advertising artist Ted Kramer. He had a good job and a loving wife. No, in fact, his wife wasn't so affectionate, because when Ted came home late from work that night, his wife, Joanna, had a suitcase packed and walked out the door. He tried to stop her, but she came right into the elevator and out of Ted's life. Well, now beyond his job, he has now also remembered the house as well as their 6-year-old son, Billy; Ted assured his boss that his wife does not in any way influence his work. However, it affects his performance as a father. He ran up when Billy wasted his client's art! Good time later, Ted and Billy received a letter from Joanna, and it was clear from her letter that she didn't come back. Ted was confused. Now he came home late from work on Billy's birthday, which made Billy hurt him. <br /> <br /> Ted was late to work one day and his boss shouted at him because he had missed a very important client meeting. When he came home, he shouted to Billy to sneak ice during dinner. Later he truly told Billy that the breakup between him and Joanna could have been his fault, not the carlight; Ted invited a good friend, Phyllis Bernard over that night, and well, Billy got his first look at a nude woman. When Ted took Billy to the park the following day, he fell off jungle gymnastics and landed first on his toy plane. Ted literally ran to him in the hospital where they were to administer stitches. Then life began to take a downward spiral to Ted. Then he received one day out of the blue a phone call from none other than Joanna! They met in a corner cafe. In the beginning, they have a pleasant conversation, but Joanna informs him that she has returned to gather her son and take him with her. Ted didn't want any of it and stormed out. Good life got even worse for Ted when his boss, Jim O'Connor, took him out for lunch and suddenly fired him. Not only that, but Joanna chose to sue for the custody of Billy, and without a job, Ted was not a chance in hell to win. He hired a lawyer, John Shaunessy, who accused a beautiful penny: $ 15,000 exact change. And that's if they win. <br /> <br /> Ted could also find a new job. It was actually a step down from what he used to do with a significant wage decline, but he accepted with great determination. Finally, the court arrived on January 9, 1980. Judge Atkins presides. Joanna took the stand and Shaunessy continued to ask her why she left Ted and her other relationships and how they were wrong. The next day, Ted took the stand and Joanna's lawyer really grilled him as a cheeseburger. Ted's good friend Margaret also took the stand and she really didn't help. Well, the judge took some time to think about it and probably enough, Shaunessy Ted says he lost. Joanna got sole custody of Billy. How typical! Always judge in favor of the mother. Well, Ted and Billy were just about to separate roads. They had a tearful farewell when suddenly Joanna stopped by. She and Ted have a little talk and well, rather than just giving away the end, let me assure everyone that everything is going well for everyone! <br /> <br /> This was a very good movie. Dustin Hoffman was very good. He earned the Academy Award. I've also seen him in Hook, Meet the Fockers and Rain Man, for which he also won an Oscar. Meryl Streep was good. She also got an Oscar. Justin Henry was also good, so where was his nomination? I suppose the Academy had a rule to give Oscars to children, but the rule was lifted when Haley Joel Osment came together. This movie has great drama, light comedy and is very subtle. It does a good job of keeping your attention. I saw Rain Man on TCM the second night when this came after, and I just couldn't stop seeing. And that's what you have to do. If you like Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep or movies of this genre, I recommend Kramer vs. Kramer! A poignant film about pangs from two divorced parents is fighting over their child. I liked Ted's little talk of ruling in favor of mothers all the time. What was it about sex that makes good parents? In fact, it's the way they have the baby. But seriously, he's right. Why always rule the mother because she is a woman? Also in the cast, George Coe, Howard Duff, who died in 1990, and Howland Chamberlain who passed away in 1984. Look for an up-and-coming JoBeth Williams in nudity in the hallway scene. Anyway, see Kramer vs Kramer today !!! Good movie !! <br /> <br /> -
