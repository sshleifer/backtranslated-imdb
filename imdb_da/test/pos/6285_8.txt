When I first saw this movie playing on TV, I was only new to Pauly Shore as this joke of a comedian carrying really strange clothes back in the day. I still decided to see it and I was impressed. the coast brings fresh air to the screen. In this movie he plays crawling a college advisor who probably also needs his own advisor. carla gugino plays in an underrated role becca, a midwestern "farm girl" with a simple family and a movie-clich√© girlfriend travis. when she leads to ucla, she meets crawling and he quickly turns into a bubbly, blonde Californian girl. She decides to bring her home to the Thanksgiving holiday. When travis decides to propose, becca needs a distraction. Creeps then decide to get everyone to believe that he and Becca are already engaged. This causes the manger to eat the romance between becca's parents, turn to her brother and even get the dancers at the local bar to get a little loose. I'm not going to reveal the end, but I liked it. nevertheless, do not rent it if you want an exciting performance; Rent it if you want to laugh your ass and enjoy an often missed part of the 90's humor.
