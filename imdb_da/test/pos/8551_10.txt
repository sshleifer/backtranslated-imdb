I was packed to see many other people also enjoyed this movie. At first it looked when I was in my early teens and then again several times late at night a couple of times after. So unfortunately no more. I am now almost 49 and so wish it could be made available on DVD. Why not? The best Anthony Quinn role, no one could have been more suited to the part or parts he plays - I've mentioned it to other movie birds of the same age, and unfortunately, no one I know resembles that. As the daughter of a generation who went through World War II and its succession (and I was deeply fascinated by the generation it was in), I assumed that this movie at that time gave me a wonderful cinematic insight into some of today's heartbreaking problems. For classic final scenes, this film is a stand out.
