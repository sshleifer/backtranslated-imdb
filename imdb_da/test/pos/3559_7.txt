Bounty killer George Hilton, smooth Mexican bandit Gilbert Roland (who's great) and bank representative Edd Byrnes are each trying to overcome each other as they search for a large amount of gold from one of Roland's rapists hidden by a betrayal member of his time. <br /> <br /> Even though it's not the largest that the genre has to offer, it's still breezy enough with a lot of glowing, action-packed fun and a satisfying finale. <br /> <br /> Every Gun Can Play is mainly remembered for opening gag, where George Hilton easily cannon down three criminals, similar to Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Django. Next year, Hilton and Roland were reunited with Van Heflin and Klaus Kinski in the highly recommended The Ruthless Four.
