The submarine used was NOT Varangian! "It was actually two boats, P614 and P615, both built to Turkey by Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness, but held onto the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. P615 was dropped, but P614 was eventually delivered in 1945. /> <br /> The confusion undoubtedly arose because someone looked up P61 (as I did) and found Varangian! In fact, the last digit of both P614 and P615 was actually painted .... <br /> <br /> There are some very realistic moments in the movie, these Turkish boats were very similar to the S class, since no S-class submarines survive, their shot (like P61) and the custodian "Forth" are part of an interesting record now, as well as a excellent movie.
