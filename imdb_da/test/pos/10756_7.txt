It must be admitted that Harold Lloyd's best work ended with his last great quiet comedy "Speedy" in 1928. After that, he enters audio films (like Chaplin and Keaton and Laurel & Hardy and WC Fields) and does it better than Keaton, but not as good as the other three. Chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as a producer (but he paced his films so that there were five years between productions). Laurel & Hardy was under the protection of Hal Roach, so production standards for their shorts and sound films were pretty good. The fields first worked with Mack Sennett, than with Paramount, and then freelance. Lloyd tried the route Chaplin took, but with less success. <br /> <br /> He produced his own films but, unlike Chaplin, he owned his own studio. Also, his first two choices were not good (especially "Feet First"). But he started choosing more wisely, and "Movie Crazy", "The Cat's Paw" and "The Milky Way" were all good choices. These three (and possibly "Harold Diddlebock's sin") were his best audio companies. They are all entertaining, but no one is up to "Safety Last", "The Freshman", "The Kid Brother" or "Speedy". <br /> <br /> Of the four best sound films "The Cat's Paw" is the most controversial. Ezekiel Cobb's solution to tearing down the city, choosing him mayor, is extremely extreme for the taste of 2005. Or is it? When a movie is made, what it is politics dictates: "Cat's Paw" dates from 1934. The second year of the Roosevelt New Deal (though controversial for heavier government involvement) saw film films as "Gabriel Over The White House" and "Phantom President "where our leaders made extra constitutional actions to free the nation from internal enemies (and to force disarmament across the globe). Even Cecil B. De Mille entered this action with "This Day and Age", where a lot of teenagers use rats to force a gangster to recognize his crimes. <br /> <br /> For us, the use of force to force someone (even a bunch of goons and messengers like Alan Dineharts gang) to confess is dismissive. After all, the Supreme Court has protected us from the fight against coercion. What we forget is that the reforms we are thinking of did not take place before Warren Court and Burger Court made them. For example, although Mr. Justice Sutherland's statement in Powell ("Scottsboro Boys") case of 1932 was guaranteed that every criminal defendant had the right to advise, Gideon v. Wainwright did not extend this to issue the right to afford the defendants until 1962. The Miranda Case, with the now known self-incrimination warning, dates from 1963. Nothing like this was considered necessary in 1934. <br /> <br /> If you study other films from the period up to 1954 (and even until 1960) tricks used to get confessions - Kirk Douglas fights his crimes in front of witnesses in "I Walk Alone" while Burt Lancaster holds a gun to him. When Lancaster leaves, Douglas cheats to confess under force, only to see the gun is relieved. Suddenly he realizes that he (lawfully - in 1948) has confessed without coercion. Hate to say so to all civil libertarians reading this note, but what Cobb / Lloyd does to Dinehart and his friends in the conclusion of "The Cat's Paw" was not only legal but would have led to their prison sentence in 1934. We can call it heavily survived, fascist or terrible, but it would have worked legally when it was perceived.
