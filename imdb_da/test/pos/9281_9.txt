I totally agree with GarryJohal from Singapore's comments on this movie. Quote: 'Yes, non-Singaporean, can't see what's big deal about this movie. Some of the references in this movie fly across from foreign viewers and mostly Singaporean are actually those who would "get it". It's still not quite the truth, and as a Malaysian-Chinese, I get it "even though I don't speak Hokkien because we have the same" problems "in Malaysia too. I know it's really hard to understand and accept this as a truth, but it certainly is not a 'no real story'. I was happy to watch this movie outside of Malaysia because it will definitely be banned in Malaysia, which means you either get it in "illegally copied VCD" are or DVDs "or hope someone should be kind enough to" share "it on the Internet, this is not a" second violent teen drama ....... "because it portrays the reality that exists in Singapore ( and also in Malaysia) in an interesting way (sad + humor) .I was just a little sad to know that this movie got about 20 cuts in censorship.
