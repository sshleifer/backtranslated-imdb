Having traveled around the world, it started me that Australia really lacks a thing that other countries have: history. Fortunately or unfortunately, Australia was not set up after a war, it has not had a bourgeois war and most of its political history is rather .... boring! Nothing "big" happened to mark a kind of turning point in Australia's history ... until the dismissal of the Whitlam government by Australian Governor General John Kerr. <br /> <br /> For those who are Australian, you can skip this section and move to the next. This is for the benefit of curious non-Australians! Australia was colonized by the British. As time went on, it became clear that Australia was able to stand on its own two feet. The United Kingdom therefore allowed Australia to set up its own parliaments, laws, courts and so on. Australia's law and policy would no longer be delivered directly from the British; Instead, Australia will be governed by the Australians themselves, although courts, precedents, parliament and so on are largely modeled on the British system. This shift was codified in the Australian Constitution. Despite the fact that the Constitution legally establishes Australian governments, legislative procedures, courts (but for the curious - no bills), the two "pro-crown" sections were included and remained there until today. These are considered more or less like "the crown's reserve powers (king / queen in Britain)." The first group of sections relates to the creation of the Governor-General's Office. In short, the Governor General is considered the Queen's Chief Representative in Australia and is described as the "Australian Government" Department. Once a piece of law is passed by the Australian Parliament, the Constitution states that it will only be law when it is signed by the Governor General. As such, the Director-General is considered by some as nothing more than a rubber stomp that performs an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the crown. Theoretically, the Governor General may refuse to sign a law passed by the Australian Parliament if he considers it appropriate. If, for example, the MP Adopting a law allowing police to shoot any Australian at the age of 50 (hypothetically of course), GG could refuse to sign it and it would not be the country's law. However, this power is theoretical and has (to date) never been exploited. By "convention" (which is the word's word for the events leading to the dismissal), the governor's petition is practically acting on behalf of the Australian Government, and if the government goes beyond the law and the prime minister instructs the Secretary-General to sign it, he will almost always doubtless. In fact, governor general acts at "convention" according to the advice he has received from the prime minister (and the prime minister alone). The second aspect is Paragraph 64 of the Constitution, which states that government ministers have officials in the "pleasure" of the Governors. Now, the 1975 events covered by this film have given rise to a precedent for this particular section: If the governor-general is somehow "dissatisfied" with the government and / or the prime minister, it seems that this section Allows him to legally sack the government (which happened in 1975 ... hence the title of the movie "the dismissal.") Whether or not the "General's Joy" can be interpreted as "the unrestricted right to dismiss" is a contentious point, even if it led to for rather heated exchanges among Australians at that time - especially considering that the Governor General is not elected by Australia's population. Now that this background spectrum is out of the way, let's get back to the discussion movie. It was well made. The pace was patient, but didn't need it at all. The drama was well-contained and very realistic. It did not over-dramatize the events and most importantly, it did not portray its view from a political perspective. On the contrary, I felt that it was fair and balanced, even though text was drafted before the credits indicate that the filmmakers are unlikely to approve the General Governor's decision to dismiss the Whitlam government. But I would not describe the film's superiors as a pre-tension in either direction. <br /> <br /> For accuracy, it was almost the place. The filmmakers certainly did their homework and clearly read the books and scriptures of all the actors involved. There were a number of finer details that were exceeded, largely because they took a long time to explain and ultimately had little influence on the events of 1975, so I forgive them for it. In addition, I find it difficult to recreate the public feeling of the post-Vietnam war era, but Noyce looked pretty good. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was delighted that the film tried to raise individual policies of both sides without being analytical, obsessive, or judgmental about them. In addition, everything we traveled, for example, Connor's pipeline, had a major impact on history. The filmmakers realized that their task was to tell the story of the events that led to the dismissal and not to present political approval or opposition to policies and views. This was smart because it meant that the movie could not be accused of misleading a page's policy. <br /> <br /> The dismissal is probably the most incredible piece of political history that has taken place in Australia in its short life. I'm glad it has been crystallized in celluloid. Required view for any Australian.
