I can honestly tell you that this movie is the most amazing movie ever !!! If you're in the mood for a comedy, I totally recommend this movie! So here's the summary. There is this girl (Nikki) who is fourteen and a half and she goes on holiday with her father (Andre), whom she has not seen for about two years. She expects the holiday to be quite boring until she meets this boy (Ben), who is much older than she is. So, to try and impress him, she says she is not on holiday with her father but her lover. This is a hysterical movie from the beginning to the end, and I strongly suggest it. So rent it and enjoy !!!
