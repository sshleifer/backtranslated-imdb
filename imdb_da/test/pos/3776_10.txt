This is sweet. The actor who played the nurse with gonzongas is the same actress playing Elvira's mistress in the dark. Another little treat is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was housewife by Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is the most amazing story ever to be told. It should sell more copies than the Bible. My parents participated in suggesting the release of this movie to a local cinema. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it. The lady who forwarded (family member) was beaten by the theater. I was 3 years old. I have burned through 4 copies on VHS and finally got it converted to DVD. It is beautiful.
