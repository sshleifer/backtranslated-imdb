I would read all the negative reviews for "Anna Christie". You know the grip on the static camera, outdated plays and wording of the manuscript. But when I saw it yesterday, I found it remarkably influenced and comfortable. Yep, Clarence Brown's camera stays mostly stationary, and I'm pretty sure one of the microphones was hidden in the light of the ship. Yep, there is a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences. It's an early talkie with primitive technical aspects. But ... there is Garbo, Marie Dressler, George F. Marion and Charles Bickford, all of whom show that the big play is timeless. I think "Anna Christie" is still one of Garbo's most iconic performances. And it is a wonderful achievement from the Divine, in a role that is quite atypical for her. Yes, we've seen Garbo tired and almost beaten, but never with bags under the eyes or her bang back by whiskey. Garbo played so many (lovely) costume roles that to see her playing a modern woman is fascinating. She is not balanced by heavy dresses or makeup. This performance seems pretty raw from Garbo. The plot from the O'Neill game follows the tired Swedish prostitute Anna and her reunion with her sweet sailor father. Anna had enough problems for any girl of twenty when she told drunk, jaded Marthy (Dressler) in a bar. She finds comfort in a life at sea and romance with a rough-haired but good-hearted fisherman (Charles Bickford). But her past threatens to destroy everything. <br /> <br /> Charles Bickford is overlooked in Garbo's long line of (mostly inferior) men. He is an actor who can actually share the screen with her and not be swallowed by his magic presence. The couple have good chemistry together and seemed to enjoy working with each other. Dressler can never be accused of underplaying, and once again grand lady is up to her old tricks, but she is amazing and convincing in her role, never annoying as in the terrible "Dinner at Eight". I never really heard of George F. Marion before, but he was wonderful as Garbo's father. <br /> <br /> This is Pre-Code, and rather murky and dark by MGM's standards. I really enjoyed it, and while it may break in some places, it's still wonderful.
