This movie gets a 10 because there are a lot of gore in it. who cares about the plot or act.this is an italian horror movie people so you know you can't expect much from acting or plot. everyone knows fulci took footage from other movies and added it to it. Since I never saw any of the movies he took from it, it didn't matter to me. The Italian godfather of gore out made himself with this movie. It's one of the Goriest Italian movies you'll ever see. Gorehound should be without this movie in their horror movie collection. Buy this movie, no matter what a dog's dream comes true.
