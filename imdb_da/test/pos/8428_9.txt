I just get the chance to dig into former Austen movies, and I picked this up because persuasion has been and always will be my favorite work of Jane Austen and Anne Elliot, my favorite Austen heroine. So it was with great expectation that I popped the disc into my player. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed either. I knew there should be some withdrawals, so I will enter them and try not to be too thick about them. Anne Elliot is the most introverted of Austen's characters; She is the least flashy and the smallest twig. There are passages in the book, where Anne says nothing - only her feelings are described. This works fine in print, but how can you transfer this to the big screen? Shortly after thought-provoking voice overruns (which would be boring in four hours) you are back with a series of shots where the heroine says little or nothing, and has to communicate everything about her facial expression. This may leave the feeling that the film is slow and lacking for that purpose. If you need a more open style in Austen then this movie is definitely not for you; But if your style is more subdued and you tend to pick up unspoken "vibes", this will meet all expectations. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Anne Firbank (like Anne Elliot) is an actress whose face can convey much. She looked like I had always imagined that Anne Elliot would look like: not a knockout - Anne should not be the elegant of the family - not even in her first youth - also highlighted occasionally by lighting and makeup. What you see is a person who is very much like Austen's character: A person whose appearance you might pass once; But hear her talk and look closer, and she becomes more attractive, the better you know her. This is Anne Elliot, who is brought to life by Anne Firbank. <br /> <br /> Captain Wentworth's portrayal is handled by Bryan Marshall. The bitterness is never apparently obvious (save on the concert scene); And yes, I found it hard to believe he hurt Louisa Musgrove interesting as she was shown. But it's another point in Austen's book: he didn't find her interesting; he was trying to find her interesting, and ultimately failed (sigh for relief). So it also fits with Austen's original story. I especially liked the portrait of Lady Russell, whom I believed in the book, was not portrayed as really bad; This also comes in this adaptation. <br /> <br /> So this is a movie that closely followed the book; I could write much more about how faithfully everything was reproduced, but I would run out of space here. Charles Musgrove remained one of the most fluid characters (good fun), Mary the most annoying (I died to get her just driven up - but I had the feeling when I read the book too), Captains and Admiral, I thought charming . <br /> <br /> I thought the camera a little bit stiff. There was little or almost no barrel from one screen to the other - perhaps because it's a TV movie. A scene - CHOP! - The next scene, the actors go from the right, continue to the left, and - CHOP! - Another scene where the same happens. It was the only part of the movie that I felt cheated a little. A low budget must turn out somewhere, I suppose. <br /> <br /> And as I said earlier, if you like some pace to go with Jane Austen, don't bother with this as you will find it too slow. I enjoyed it tremendously as it brought a wealth of details (the sets were richly elegant!) To an excellent adaptation of my favorite Austen novel. I highly recommend it!
