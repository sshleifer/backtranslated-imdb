This anime tells the story of the battle of Mamodo King. Every 1,000 years, 100 Mamado children are sent to Earth to fight to determine who will be their next king (in the original Japanese, the creatures are Mamono, which literally means magic / evil). Each Mamado is paired with a human partner and given a magical spelling book. Man can use this book to unleash incredible powers in Mamodo, and when a Mamodo is defeated, their spellbook is accumulated in flames (conversely a Mamdodo's book can be captured and burned directly). Then Mamodo returns to Mamodo world. <br /> <br /> The titular character is Zatch (Gash in Japan), a 6-year-old mamodo with electric powers. He is mated with Kiyomaru Takamini and a 14-year-old genius. Zatch is initially reluctant to fight, but learns that some Mamodo are evil and decide the battle of king is wrong, he decided to fight to become a "friendly king." <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell has made a comparison with Pokemon, but a better comparison is Digimon. Like Digimon, Mamodo and Human have one to one, a symbiotic relationship. Also, unlike Pokemon, both shows have an actual plot. <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell has character growth and evolving relationships, and some pretty adult stories (like love for racism, slavery, mind control, etc.). It even has some decent plot twists and mysteries.
