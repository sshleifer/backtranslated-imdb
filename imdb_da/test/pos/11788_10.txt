The aah yes training program was a great one. Not only were many women in shape, but many teenage boys also got a good workout. I'm not saying that the show was in any way not suitable for family viewing, but if you check out the other works from the producer, you will find more adult themes in his works which are also excellent. Many of the viewers looked forward to the show, both men and women got all the good information and a wonderful release from the training. The girls were perfect and beautiful, the show is a classic and must do well in syndication. The view still needs to be on, as there is never enough choice to see when it comes to health and beauty.
