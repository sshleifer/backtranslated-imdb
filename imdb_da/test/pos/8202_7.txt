It was a movie that made you think a little. Some share a little cheesy, some share pretty good. Plot became thicker at times, and just when you thought Angella (Sandra) found a friend was the friend of fraud or death. All I have to say is that DENNIS MILLER should have been in the whole movie. His character was the best, very refreshing, after all the horror Angella went through. He would have lifted me and Angella through the dumps.
