Forever Strong is a type of movie we've seen many times before, only in different types of genres. But that said, I really thought it was a great movie, Sean Faris shows the kind of potential that usually lands actors in great time. Apparently, this movie got a limited edition when I wasn't even aware of it, but I saw it in the video store and decided to take a chance with it after I remember enjoying Sean's performance in Never Back Down. I ended up making a big decision, I'm not a fan of rugby, what ever, but the movie isn't about rugby, it's about putting yourself in your life, challenging yourself and achieving your goals there is much more than the simple plot suggests. Initially, we don't give anything amazing about what happens to Rick, he's verbal, full of himself, and quite arrogant, we feel he's completely sealed his fate as a problem maker. Along the way we see changes in his character, he begins to hang out with better people, he begins to improve himself, we learn how much negative impact his father has had in his life, it's just a big turn and the movie did a great job of making Rick from the cocky dot to a kindhearted person. Rugby action itself is not that bad at all, unlike the things I played and then in high school, it was actually quite fun to watch and beautifully choreographed. A great young caste combined with some veteran experiences helped this movie immensely, it just did a fantastic job to avoid what might have been a run of the mill's type of thing for an exciting and effective drama. I also liked the conflicting contrast between The Coach | Garry Cole | and Rick | Sean Faris |, it made for a very interesting story, and I loved watching him help Rick along the way it was emotionally and cordially at the same time. This is a really hidden gem, I'm really glad I discovered it made me think of my life and many times I need something like that. <br /> <br /> The performances. Sean Faris is excellent as Rick Penning. He reminded me of a horrible mass of a young Tom Cruise cocky, yet very charismatic and talented. Turning from a cheerful teenager to a kind-hearted young man, it was a tough role, but Sean took it off with pure perfection. He clearly put his heart and soul into this movie, so great kudos to Sean to put so much effort into this amazing movie. Gary Cole is excellent as the preaching yet cozy coach who wants to help the kids. I always found him to be sympathetic, he always has some kind of presence he leads to his movies. Neal McDonough is great as the selfish yet pressed father of Rick. For most of the movie, the script leads you to believe that he is no more than a selfish bitter man who wants Rick to be like him, but ultimately you begin to see the real him come out, I felt sorry for me a bit. Julie Warner is a good character actress and she plays the good hearted but clueless mother well. Penn Badgley is committed to playing a real jerk, and boy does he ever do well. On several occasions I would pop him one so I have to say it's a good performance. Arielle Kebbel is not the interest of love much of a part, she did. Nathan West plays a somewhat mysterious character, he did pretty well. Sean Astin is billed as a big player for the movie, but he hardly does anything, he did well with what he had to do. <br /> <br /> The bottom line - Forever Strong is a good movie, it will definitely make you stop and think about how your life was much better when you believed. Don't let this drop you by, you won't regret it. <br/> <br /> 8 1/2/10
