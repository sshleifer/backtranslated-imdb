After reading so much negative pressure on this movie over the years, I had always avoided it, but the advent of the cheap public domain DVD encouraged me to finally give it a view. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it has been transferred from a bad copy. The modern prequel, shot on tinted stock, is the veil and contrast that does not exist. Faces are sometimes difficult to make. That said, the actual story is entertaining, and Lou comes across as a accomplished actor, more than in many of the boys' movies. <br /> <br /> When the movie changes to the Jack story, the movie is changing to 'color' and I use that term resolved. Most shades are orange or brown. The greens look particularly bad. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Ford as 'Polly', the giant girl, was a big plus for me as I enjoyed her in an early 'Andy Hardy' look. <br /> <br /> With so many negative comments down to the actual quality of the print, I'm still happy to give this movie a 7. It gave me a lot of laughs and it's more than the larger selection of Comedies I've seen over the decades can cope. <br /> <br /> One to see if you get the chance.
