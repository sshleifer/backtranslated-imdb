Normally, Anthony Mann made westerns with "the big guys" - James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda. . . A-list cowboy stars. But in this B + movie he tackled something very different and had a lot of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western. The protagonist, played by Victor Mature, is a staircase / mountaineer, and they are usually romanticized in movies - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson, the kind of thing that the hero is not a typical mountaineer, but a pure rock heroic figure that is connected with real mountain men. Not here. For once, a true mountaineer - vulgar, raw, animalist - is the central figure, and it is something to see that gives Mature one of its better later roles. The married chops are provided by Robert Preston, excellent as a self-absorbed Custer type cavalry commander, and James Whitmore, the poor man Spencer Tracy, as another of the ancient timers who feel trapped between increasingly hostile Indians on one side and the conflicting power of civilization on the other. Even more impressive is a very young Anne Bancroft as the officer's wife, who was originally repulsed by the mature pigs character, and then finds her own civilization fins slip away as she begins to realize, for her own shock that she is attracted to him. Rarely has there been a distant fort interpreted so precisely on the screen without the romantic lure that John Ford gave such a place in his masterful Fort Apache. The fighting sequences are large and especially violent and particularly impressive if you have seen them in widescreen format. Good show and underestimated film around.
