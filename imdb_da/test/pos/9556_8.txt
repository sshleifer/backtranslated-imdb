The "Best in Show" is an often hilarious mockumentary that brings us into the dog show world and some of the dog owners preparing the event. The only thing that separates this movie from real dog shows is that the dogs in "Best in Show" seem more sane than their owners! Quiet things from a top-notch cast that includes Eugene Levy (starred in the movie), Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch, and Christopher Guest (who wrote with Levy and instructed). They are all fun, but Fred Willard steals the movie with his explosive fun performance as the dog transmitter, who says the most outrageous things. Plus the dogs are also cute. The "Best in Show" is not exactly the laughing promise I had expected, but there are laughs and it is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
