I recently rented "The China Syndrome" mainly because I read that it was this movie that inspired ABC to make "The Day After". However, "Syndrome" is more of a thriller than a drama. The movie is quite political, but I strongly agree with its message - nuclear power, but extremely effective, is too dangerous for ordinary use. The risk is simply too high. Hopefully, those responsible for real nuclear power plants are far more responsible and ethical than those depicted in the film. Given that the real near-catastrophe of Three Mile Island happened just months after this movie was released, the issue in question sets. (In fairness, the case was probably more of an incompetence than corruption.) "Syndrome" is not only critical of nuclear power, but also of modern news media similar in "Network", much more serious. Although I am a journalist, I am quite familiar with how people perceive the media; but it was a little scary to see that even in the 70s, the television news had already sold out. When Jane Fonda's character tries to convince her boss to let her make real news instead of fluff, she is not advised to try the change as "research" finds out that people prefer a beautiful girl to make fluff, not hard news. <Br /> <br /> What really makes the movie memorable, however, is the incredible excitement generated in its final third. During this period, the viewer fears constantly for the protagonist's life whether the danger comes from hired thugs or the potential destruction of the nuclear power plant. And the very first scene - I won't give it away of course - but it will keep you guessing. <br /> <br /> On a final note, I got a clear sense of seeing the movie, as it seemed to be more like a television movie than a real movie. However, this could be more due to the fact that the rental band I watched was rather old and not formatted to fit TV screens like videos and DVDs are today.
