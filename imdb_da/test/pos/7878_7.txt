A fascinating relic of the turbulent cultural / political aura of the late 60s (also in the class struggle), which ironically, in the light of its obsolete and occasionally embarrassing conservative views, fully exploits the permission of some time in the mainstream cinema, which emerged as a direct result of the liberal stance it claims to criticize! Norman Wexler's sharp Oscar nominated manuscripts are well-adopted by Peter Boyle (in a power plant performance) who manages to make his horrible, down-to-earth but hypocritical and opportunistic character (with a barely disguised fascist streak emerging in the remarkable violent conclusion) equally, even admirable; Yes, he comes across inappropriately as a flabbier version of the young Marlon Brando! Like other generational gibbs in his era as TAKING OFF (1971) and HARDCORE (1978), but also nihilistic vigilante films such as DEATH WISH (1974) and TAXI DRIVER (1976) - interestingly, two of these also have Boyle - JOE in the end Seems like an exciting and strong drama that could have been a masterpiece if it had had a more experienced director at the helm.
