This is a love story set based on the television news. The three main stars, William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks create a love triangle while working at the Washington Bureau of a television network. Tom Grunick (Hurt) is the beautiful reporter who gets smeared to be a star. Jane (Hunter) is the producer who acknowledges that Tom lacks the intellectual gravity to be a real journalist, but falls for him anyway. Aaron Altman (Brooks) is the man who shares her faith in journalistic standards, is also the man who truly loves her. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award, but lost to Cher (Moonstruck!). She was robbed! This is Hunter's movie.Here character Jane is smart, ruthless and completely driven. She is also hilarious neurotic. Her performance is perfect. Just look at her face when she sees the bond on Tom's interview of a rape victim. The scales literally fall off their eyes. <br /> <br /> Wiliam Hurt's performance is less flashy. He plays a man who is aware that he is a homo and a fraud, but is smart enough to know that his rise will be facilitated by people like Jane. He gives some tips on a man who calculates extremely. <br /> <br /> The film comments on celebrity, journalism, integrity, and commercial pressures on news in a bottom-focused medium. It predicted that the news would be stupid, that the standards were slowing down due to commercial pressure. <br /> <br /> Think about this: This movie was released before the end of the Cold War and before the rise of reality TV. Yet, it predicted stupid news. Paris Hilton's release from prison was treated as a major news story! To see how prophetic this movie is, just watch your news stories and note sets, graphics and presentations. Tom Grunick and his clones live really well!
