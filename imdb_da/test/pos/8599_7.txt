Nothing is worse than the genocide in the history of our world. This film attempts to describe the horror a particular family is facing - a common narrative - in Hiroshima's atomic world. The most memorable parts are the graphic and carefree images that the people of Hiroshima face after the war. However, the story becomes more concerned about the effect on a particular group of people and how they manage to get on with their lives; In other words, if you don't really worry about them, the movie becomes boring. However, it is hard to be indifferent when a family's homeland is destroyed. I'm not sure I would recommend this movie because it says very little politically and honestly not keeping my interest in family issues.
