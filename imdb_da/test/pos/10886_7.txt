This game has cartoon graphics, not much violence and really short levels - so why do people say it's so brilliant?!? Because it always keeps your attention, it catches you and refuses to let go! You will try several hours to try to find the cursed recorder, try to figure out how to get into the room without warning the guards, etc.! The levels are only short when you know what to do - until you spend hours trying to figure out where to find correspondences where you can find helicopters and so on! And you want to have fun while doing it! Well worth a rental!
