I had the pleasure of watching this short movie at the Miami Film Festival last Saturday and just let me say I was amazed. It was the only movie out of the whole program I loved. It is beautifully shot, composed, edited, acted and written. After the screening, I saw the director at a party and asked him what he was doing next. He said he was working to find financing for the functional version of the short. He described some scenes for me. It sounded like the kind of first movie that launches greats in the industry. If you ever get a chance to see this card, I highly recommend taking it. Hats off to star crossings.
