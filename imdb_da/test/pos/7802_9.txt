It will soon be 10 years since this movie was released .... still makes me laugh .... If you enjoy this movie, try the new Hera Pheri .... t'is fun. And my favorite movie should be when Salman realizes that he has no bullets left in his gun while he has the upper hand and has everyone at gun point ... and he actually says it aloud !!! You just want to bash him .... but you know you can only do it if you stop laughing !!!! Fantastic movie .... 10/10
