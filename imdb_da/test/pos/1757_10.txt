For years I have remembered a song "JUST A COUPLE IN A CASTLE" ("No, twenty moonbeam square, just a couple in the castle in the air"). I couldn't find the song, but I remembered it had to do with cartoon errors. I made a reference to the movie on the internet. I had watched the movie when I was only 9 years old at the Ligonier PA Theater. I was happy to find out that it had Kenny Gardner singer with Guy Lombaro (I'm a Lombardo fan). And then to see that it was produced by Fleisher Bros., who made another very good full-length cartoon feature of "Gullivar's Travels" (also remembered fondly). The songs were also associated with Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, who are among the very best. No wonder I remembered the movie, the song and the colorful animation. As a full lengh musical, this is a movie that should be remembered as one of the best of the early full lengh musicals. Now that I remember it, the plot may not have been earthquake, but was very well presented and makes it easy to see abd lovely movie.
