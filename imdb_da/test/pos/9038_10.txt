This film was filmed, filmed and premiered in Oxford, Miss. Most of the extras were locals. I've been to Oxford and it has changed a lot. This film contains Will Geer as the sheriff, he was later blacklisted. It was writers and actors of social dramas such as this film and Wrath grapes that were the target of HUAC a few years later. I can't remember if the actor who played the young Mallison boy (Claude Jarman Jr) did something after the TV series Centennial (1978), but he was fantastic in this previous movie. And don't miss Elizabeth Patterson, who later played in Little Women.
