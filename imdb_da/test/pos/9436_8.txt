Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) begins this story in disguise and helps smuggle the famous physicist "Dr. Franz Tobel" (William Post) out of Switzerland and under the Nazi waking eye who wants his bombing plans. The Allies will of course also have it, and Sherlock is there to help. Dr. Tobel has invented an instrument that greatly helps with the accuracy of air bombardment. <br /> <br /> Holmes and Dr. Tobel certainly comes back on Baker Street, but the researcher would rather be alone, for a mysterious reason, even though he had promised English to help them, not the Germans. He remains true to that promise, but there are some desperate moments for Holmes and the English along the way. <br /> <br /> It's an entertaining movie and one in which our famous detective doesn't use one, but three different aprons. He needs all the help he can get when he goes up against his arch rival, "Professor Moriarity." One complaint: If Moriarity was evil, he would have given Holmes free without smearing an eyelash instead of giving him openings to escape. It is also sad when the usual dim-witted Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) has to save his boss from a certain death a few times! Yes, there are some credibility issues in this story but if you can put your brain in wait a couple of times, it's a fun movie to watch .... and it looks beautiful thanks to the great restoration job on this DVD. It makes the old print lively with some fantastic visual images, especially the night time shoots. Another note: The one who made the English subtitles in here spelled or misinterpreted at least half a dozen words. It's very sloppy work, and not the first time I've seen this, the whole series looks at the restored DVD set.
