'The English Patient' can rightly be compared to David Lean's film, whose sweeping epics such as 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Bridge on the River Kwai' must have inspired Director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed, and as 'Lawrence' is in North Africa but during World War II. The story is complex, but it boils down to a forbidden love between a perceived and often difficult archaeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas. The story is based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje, told in flashbacks by Fiennes' Count Laszlo de Almasy - the titular character. The fact that his name does not sound like he is English plays a central role in what unfolds. He has been incinerated in a plane crash, just as the film opens and is cared for back in Europe by Hana, an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this story epic is the great sweep across place and time, and the evolution of characters beyond the two bad loved ones. The film makes it clear that true love and passion, even with dreaded consequences, can make life worth living or worth dying for. If you are romantic in heart and can appreciate a movie without the normal happy endings and simple moral codes, you may find that 'The English Patient' speaks directly to you. <br /> <br />
