After a decade of turbulent turmoil, American films began to shift gears and turn their cameras away from war-like battlefields, political corruption, and general social turmoil to the more intimate world of family dysfunction. The Customs of the Selfish Baby Boomers began to take on the American family as they grew up and if their own children had made themselves felt. <br /> <br /> "Kramer vs Kramer" is one of the first of these dysfunctional family dramas that will remain so popular during the 1980s, and is one of the best. It will be a pretty bum rap now because it is known as the movie that hit "Apocalypse Now" for the 1979 Best Picture Academy Award, but comparing these two films is like comparing a banana with a marinated chicken breast: they are not distant the same, but can't we enjoy them both? Director / writer Robert Benton is not trying to do anything fancy with his movie; Its strength lies in its performances, namely Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, who play especially a divorced couple who fights childishly and selfishly over their son. The courtroom scene, in which they pay tribute to parental responsibility, and where each is forced to harm the other in terrible ways, is devastating and feels authentic. The film does not present Hoffman's solid father as a whole or Streep's dismissive mother as a villain. They are neither good nor bad like humans - they are simply bad for getting married. The film is tearful in the final, but not in a manipulative way. It serves its right to induce sobs. <br /> <br /> Degree: A
