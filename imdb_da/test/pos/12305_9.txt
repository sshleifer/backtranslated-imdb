"The Dead" is really a work of art. It was clear that John Huston intended to show that he was still "in full passion for a passion" by doing so even as his body failed him. This film greatly influences and lingers in mind long after it's finished. Reading the Joyce short story certainly allows more depth for the characters, especially Gabriel's inner turmoil, but the essence is all there in this movie. As a statement from an artist of his love for life and his craft, "the dead" stand alone.
