The focus on the key relationship in a young man's life, his relationship with his father, was well portrayed in this movie, "The Greatest Game Ever Played." The film captured the essence of how important it is for a father to validate his son and let him know that he has what it takes to follow his dream. It did not matter that economic and social class morers presented obstacles to being overcome by both father and son. It also didn't matter that others praised the son in a bubbly party. The most important thing was that he saw his father's hand and then his face of approval. The real life challenge for both father and son had been met. Considering that in reality history completely held its amateur status and became a businessman, it very much confirmed that everything that went before the fight was the training ground for a valid relationship between father and son.
