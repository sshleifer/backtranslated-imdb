This is one of the films that was never published and was therefore missed when it originally played in the theaters. <br /> <br /> I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately set up in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I often wanted to watch the movie again, but couldn't even remember its name and never saw it in the rental stores. <br /> <br /> James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. While you are an action movie and have a western style and theme, it can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of their taste in movies.
