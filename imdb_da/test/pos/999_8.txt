From the start of "The Edge of Love" the viewer is transported to the striking world of WW2 London. We follow the lives of four people who might be created just for this movie, an exploration of female friendship and the tribes caused by it by marriage and adultery. Apart from one of the characters, Dylan is Thomas, perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish but sometimes really despicable. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on Thomas' writings of love and romance. These were adapted with a sharp manuscript by Sharman MacDonald (Keira Knightley's mother). The director John Maybury claims that the other three main characters were real people. <br /> <br /> All fours are performed very strongly. Sienna Miller is Dylan's wife, Keira Knightley is cabaret singer Vera Phillips. Matthew Rhys is Dylan Thomas, and Cillian Murphy is William Killick. The first part of the film takes place in London under Nazi air reports, where Vera is being persecuted by Willaim, a soldier waiting for deployment. At one chance, Dylan meets with his first love, Vera. From there, Vera meets Caitlin, Dylan's wife. While the three are drinking, William breaks with Vera's guard. <br /> <br /> The movie follows their lives when Vera and William are married and he is sent to war. Vera has become pregnant and returns to Wales with Dylan and Caitlin. There they face a greedy existence, where Vera supports Dylan and Caitlin with her husband's war pay. During these times Vera and Caitlin's friendship grows. It also makes Dylan's betrayal with Vera. She gives in. This creates the first test for the two women. <br /> <br /> When William returns from war, he hardly recognizes his wife and has no connection with his infant son. Diseases get worse as Dylan periodically monitors his friendship battle with stroke fatigue (post traumatic stress disorder). William realizes that something has happened between Dylan and Vera, and in a drunken rage, Dylan's house shoots. <br /> <br /> "Edge Of Love" begins as a stylish romance in war-torn London and ends in the sharp, gritty life of motherhood, adultery and murder attempts in Wales. The treatment of PTSD is well done and should speak to an American audience. Some day (see end). <br /> <br /> Every star has a good moment. Miller, as she elaborates on nails in her head in response to her abortion by another man's child. Knightley and Murpy when he finally binds with his son. Oh hell, almost all their scenes are awesome. And Rhys, when he purges on the booth to get Vera's husband sent to prison. <br /> <br /> But the real star of the movie is Jonathan Freeman's cinematography and John Maybury's direction. They seem to understand that no matter how good the story or historical Thomas is, it's a movie dominated by two great actresses of our time. And they cherish their scenes with amazing shots. Although this is not the best imagery, it is a very good movie (much more engaging than "The Dutchess"). It has a visual lyricism that highlights the use of Thomas' poetry. This is clearly Knightley's second best performance of his career, and perhaps Miller's best. <br /> <br /> I've always had a weakness for the artist in battle, whether it's Hulce's Mozart or Hoffmans Capote. But I was stunned by how little sympathy I felt for Dylan Thomas. His battle with alcohol is well known. But his opposition to William and Caitlin to win his first love Vera makes him be ..... a bad man. So is this Oscar worthy? Clearly no, certainly not this year. It will be released on the state side in March 2009, which makes it not qualified for the academies. This is 9 months after it was released in the UK. Between reconciliation, Miss Pettigrew and Brideshead Revisited, the United States has had its fill of British pieces in World War II. Too bad. This movie is better than the others, except reconciliation. But in this one Knightley's soldier returns, but as a shell of the man who left her.
