No real plot, no sign development, no Scorcese level direction, but seriously, did you really expect any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely fun, almost at the same level as Borat. Certainly, the end draws a little, but if Borat's cameo didn't blow you up, you must be the worst steep boy in the batty boys' story. Sacha Baron Cohen may be the greatest comedian ALIVE, and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach. I dare not laugh. <br /> <br /> If you can pull the ten meter long pole out of your back for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well-timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story of a stupid character, watch this silly movie. You will be glad you did. Be yourself!
