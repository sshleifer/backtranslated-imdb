Having seen Meredith in "Beyond the Prairie" I had to buy another movie with her staring. I can't believe how she got into this teenage girl. It is best to watch this with the sound off, but concentrate only on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a "Beyond the Prairie" DVD. It's worth it at all costs, this one has to pay you to see. <br /> <br /> This beautiful lady needs someone to put her in a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman. Maybe some of her latest fits, but I haven't seen them. She has the smile of a Cathrine Bell and the eyes of Dana Delany with a much younger body. <br /> <br />
