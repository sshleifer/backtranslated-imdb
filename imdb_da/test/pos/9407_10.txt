I thought this movie was excellent. Jon Foster is one of my best favorite actors, he was perfect as Micheal Link. I found it all about being great, acting, costumes, production, directing, photography, scripting and music, etc. <br /> <br /> Spoilers Coming Up! You've been warned! <br /> <br /> Martha Moxley, as they had told the story in the movie, was bludgeoned to the death of his fierce, worried neighbor Micheal Link. Micheal did this by his brother Tommy of jealousy when Martha rejected him and took Tommy instead. Fortunately, they killed him years later, and he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Although I think he should have been sentenced to "natural life" without the possibility of parole. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the cast, the crew and the filmmakers. Two thumbs up.
