This movie has a big chase scene, if you listen to the soundtrack when the cars are chasing each other, it sounds a lot like the soundtrack from the movie ball, you will hear the shift of a 4-speed, and they will show brake pedal in Roy Schneider's car, it's a automatic brake pedal !, I think one of the funniest moments in the movie is when the bad guy Richard Lynch looks at the driver of the car they are in, just as the guy is nuts!. ........ The villain who runs in the garage is also the guy in the first rocked movie, Rocky's boss. good movie! Even when the door is torn off, can you see the guy sitting in the car, just knocking the door open, the guy helping him out of the car looks a bit like Mr Brady from the Brady pile?
