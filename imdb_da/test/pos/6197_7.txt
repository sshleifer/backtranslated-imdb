If you see this series, you get an interesting 10 chapters on a sleeping cell story and each character. And more intense with an infiltration from an FBI. <br /> <br /> Nice story, great characters and perform, but something is wrong (for me of course). The final is wrong. You wait ten chapters and hope for a nice final (it doesn't matter if they meet their goals or not) but ... Well ... I don't think enough. It is a small finale for a large series. Also I hoped for more definitions of character stories. <br /> <br /> But I repeat, it is and interesting miniseries. If you do not want to wait with large series (22-24 chapters), you should see it. I give 7 out of 10.
