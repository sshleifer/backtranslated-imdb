This show is pure entertainment and does not attempt to be a Greek drama. It certainly contains elements of one that twists with the whole plot, but it is incredibly engaging and fun. Las Vegas is the perfect setting for a show, and they will never lack material to work with! Everything and everything happens there! The actors in this show are extremely personable and you really want to see what they are going into and every week. The show is also very fun. The mood comes from signs and situations. Not just thrown in for free. It is a well designed show in that respect. It makes me look forward to Friday evenings, and I'm glad I now own the first two seasons on DVD!
