I saw this scene show when it was broadcast on PBS in 1983. I was involved in local theater at that time and had seen some pretty incredible things out of Dell Arte Players, but Bill Irwin floored me. <br /> <br /> I was most impressed with how a man of his size (he is quite tall and bent) could be folded up into a small box without as much as a pause for adjustment and moving across the stage in a run-off without even a whisper of sound from his feet if he chose not to make any noise. <br /> <br /> Most amazing to me, however, in this performance, he got up his feet under the jack-in-the-box / marionette piece. Those who saw this show will remember that as he climbed from the box and collapsed to the floor with his body frame and limbs akimbo, "he" pulled up on the top of his head as if by a string and did not just rise to his feet but to a full ballet point and did so in a fluid, seemingly effortless movement. Just consider the strength, grace, balance, and focus such a series of movements must take to achieve them as he did! Add to his physical skill his strong and credible characterization skills, and there is an accomplished actor / performer. My jaw fell into the movement and my heart broke in the portrait of a puppet, determined to be more than just a lifeless thing in a box. <br /> <br /> With regard to the unfortunate (yes "tragic" would be a better word) inaccessibility of this piece in home media form, I have noticed that much of PBS's works are not available on tape or DVD. Sometimes PBS exhibits will be available for direct purchase from them for a limited time immediately after a broadcast, but they rarely stay on the market for too long. There are, of course, exceptions, but it is mainly about science and history of documentaries; Rarely does a piece of art remain in print for a long time, provided it has ever made it to VHS / DVD to begin with. I do not know why this should be so; Certainly, PBS could use the income from home media marketing of their shows, but they didn't use it much. It's a shame. There are many things I've seen on PBS that I want to own, but pieces like "The Flight Of Flight" are, I'm afraid, a one-shot, once in a lifetime, treat, never repeat on PBS again And never to be available for home purchase. It really sucks. I am fortunate to have caught it when I did. <br /> <br /> Oh, our local library got a copy of "The Flight Of Flight". And yes it was stolen.
