The management is brilliant, the casting is remarkable (though I would have loved to have seen a little more of Aaron Lustig (from Y&R fame) who played Paul Shaffer). I have only two smaller quips about the movie, as subtle as they are. One-Roebucks Leno is excellent, but his scene presence (that is, under what appears to be the loss of one of his late show episodes) is a bit underwhelming. Two-part of the spooky language. I am willing to tolerate spooky language as long as it is not used effortlessly, and to some extent the film was free. The language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce Bates' pathos otherwise well depicted Kushnick by her frequent use of it and served to make Roebuck's Leno a goody-goody by his lack of use (of course, if the characters really responded to this way, kudos to everyone). Nevertheless, the play is excellent in television and video. The film thinks I had the potential for the big screen, but would have required re-casting for the bit parts, and another director too (the aesthetic feeling is the Larry Sanders show, good for HBO, mediocre for cinematic purposes).
