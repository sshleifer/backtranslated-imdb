The box is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word image: Imagine you've been binging on pixie sticks and paint vapors for the last month while looking other than Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenaline in your IV. The dream that you have in a coma in a coma will be something like this movie. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: A man appears at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it. Press the button, they will get a million dollars in cash, and a person they don't know will die. I'm not trying to spoil anything, but from there things go into a plot that is so intertwined and complex and purely original that it makes you question your beauty. But hey, most of us have been sane for a while now and the change is good. PROS: Great story, generally good acting, not a slow moment when it goes. It questions human morality, which is rarely if it is ever asked in popular culture. This film is deep, it matters. It's not the summer blast key (there is nothing wrong with it); This movie had a relatively low budget and it showed in some places. But I think it's maybe what makes me very straightforward. <br /> <br /> CONS: The first twenty minutes before it goes, is really quite slow. At the end of the movie you get so confused that you just have to sit and think about a good half hour. I can guarantee that this movie does not get rave reviews from your peers or most critics; It is too strange and there are no explosions every three seconds. In fact, there are no explosions of any kind in this movie (besides your brain popping from trying to understand exactly what the heck just happened). Personally, I don't think it's a bad thing, but many will. <br /> <br /> RATING: Take and 9/10. I've never had an experience like watching this movie. The only reason I can't give it a 10/10 is that it's just too wrapped up in itself. There are several great things that are inexplicable at the end that still bugs me while I sit here writing this. But overall, this is the best experience I've had in a movie theater for quite some time. But be warned, you won't like this movie if you can't sit back, beat your suspension of disbelief to about 150% and prepare your brain to do some impressive acrobatics.
