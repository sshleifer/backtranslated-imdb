It came from outer space II is a very good movie that has a good cast that includes Brian Kerwin, Elizabeth Peña, Jonathan Carrasco, Adrian Sparks, Bill McKinney, Dean Norris, Dawn Zeek, Lauren Tewes, Mickey Jones, Iilana B 'tiste, Jerry Giles and Howard Morris! The action of all these actors is very good. Kerwin and Norris are really excellent in this movie. I thought they were good. The excitement is really good and some of it is surprising. The film is filmed very well. The music is amazing by Shirley Walker. The film is quite interesting, and the movie really keeps you going until the end. This is a very good and exciting movie.
