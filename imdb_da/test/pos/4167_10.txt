A surprisingly large cartoon in the same league as Batman: TAS and its ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and had recently been able to see them all again, good voice from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay and Maurice LaMarche in different roles. The only nausea I had was Rob Paulson's voice, which seemed a little too old for the title character, but it was not a big thing as the stories were good and the fact that it all has a good time-lapse ends. Some people say it was a cop-out, but I found it refreshing for many series that just left things hanging. Hopefully someday they put this series out on DVD, unfortunately it came out at a time when the DVDs were not yet widespread, and the comic was probably only to sell a certain type of toy that I never found appealing despite it entertaining cartoon.
