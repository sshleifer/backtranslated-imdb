One true thing shows that these are the characters who make a movie. Streep will definitely receive an Oscar nomination for her role. A beautiful drama, One True Thing is an excellent example of film production in the late 1990s - there are still people out there who are interested in making and watching movies beyond the big blockbusters with million dollar special effects. It's not the best picture or anything ... don't be stupid. But the amount of emotions provided by both the actors and the author struck me like a shock wave. I shouted twice in this movie, which says a lot to a 24-year-old man.
