Come across this movie recently after so long to hear about it. It's an excellent, not pretentious movie for people who love movies noir literature and movies. Not "camp" but humorous. <br /> <br /> GREAT CAST! From the grandiose Carla Gugino and Emma Thompson to the German superstar Til Schweiger, this film is a feast for the eyes. Alan Rickman is very funny as the gang's antagonist. Would love to see spin off movies with this character and Emma Thompson solve cases and arguments between them all the time (like Tracy and Hepburn, etc.) <br /> <br /> Intelligent history, great twists and scale photography (don't see unless It's scope because compositions are very rich. Sexy sexy sexy and very fun time. Best Use of Just Like Heaven by Cure Ever (Have to Believe!) <br /> <br /> ********
