Most people are completely unaware that this movie exists. Fox, who paid the judge to do so, has kept it in the can for a while and then spent nothing to promote it. I think many people think it was one of the rubbish guns that was rinsed in late summer. Well, I'm here to tell you that this is a fun and rather scary look at a future that is not so hard to believe. Basically, the judge puts forward the notion that the stupid propagates the wise with a wide margin. Then these stupid ones become more stupid, as they spend almost all the time watching TV and having sex, which produces more stupid people. In 2500, a person with average intelligence today seems to be a genius who speaks "all phaggy". Seriously, this is really so hard to believe. Oh, this future is painfully fun and ridiculously silly, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great as the time traveling army guy hopes to try to get back to a more comfortable time. Where this story will get its cult status is with the many fun single-liners, which "can we family styles" and "hi man, I" bat here! " This is a fun movie and a pretty social commentary on an American society that seems to be faded with self-satisfaction, comfort and stupidity, and I guarantee you that I will buy this on DVD the first day it comes out and over and over.
