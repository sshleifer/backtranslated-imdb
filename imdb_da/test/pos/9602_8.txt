Flying apart, I don't think I've ever laughed at a movie so much in my life. <br /> <br /> I love football as sour, but I tend to hate almost any song or movie about football as they tend to be unrealistic. This was not. <br /> <br /> I saw it once, it was over 2 years ago and it was brilliant. Everyone I know loved it. I can remember gay physio, the sloping pitch at about 45 degree angle and 'shoe' (a player called the name because he once came to training in a new pair of shoes). Brilliant, that's what goes on in park football. <br /> <br /> A certain 10/10. If anyone from the television industry reads this, considering all the crap you are repeating in English telecom, it makes sense to show it again (and Muppets while you're at it). Also someone knows if this was shown on the BBC or ITV. I think it was ITV so it's worth asking if they plan to show it again. They must do.
