HLOTS was an excellent series, what NYPD Blue will never be, at HLOTS, the plots are genuine, the dialogue is genuine, relationships are real. With HLOTS back as a movie, tying up all the loose ends, it was good to have the whole band back together, even a couple who passed by came up (won't say how) the story was fast, emotional and full of spirit the series had week in and week out. Murder, street life, network drama at its best !!!! 5 STARS !!!! Thumbs UP and all that. Thanks NBC for giving us the final we didn't get!
