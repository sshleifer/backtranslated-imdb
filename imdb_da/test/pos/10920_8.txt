In & Out is a comedy with a simple premise. It's fun to be fun and entertaining. The comedy in this movie ranges from the ridiculous to the sublime, physical comedy found with dry humor, with a good veteran play by Bob Newhart. Kevin Kline is predictably in excellent form in this movie, along with Tom Selleck who doesn't play for his expected "square jawed" leading man type. Mr. Selleck plays his humor well and shows a good sense of comic timing. The cast makes this movie successful. Not all gay-themed movies are made to promote a kind of creepy, hidden Hollywood-liberal agenda. In fact, this movie was simply made for entertainment, and if anyone part of these movies makes the viewer think, then it was a by-product of the well-attended work of an amazing cast of professionals. Often heavy-in-cheek, I found myself laughing at the right moments. A firm "B."
