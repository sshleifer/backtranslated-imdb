This movie moved me aged 39 in the same way that all the footage and coverage of Dogtown hit me when I was 13. For all those who criticized the self-promotion of the Z boys interview, they have the last laugh at you. It was their whole: "We are better than all of you and here is why .... (insert pictures of the most beautiful pool curve imaginable)" This was a movie to tell their story and that was their story if you can Like it or not. It was their opinion of their skating that was important ..... not yours or mine. I thought the movie captured their attitude and influenced exactly as I remembered it in the 70s. The reality is that they revolutionized skateboarding, they were the driving force of extreme sports, and they spread a cultural paradigm that reached every corner of americana. This movie gave birth to images of Bertleman on a wave, and Alva and Jay Adams ripped up the California Dream complaint to a whole culture of young American teenagers who just wanted to have fun and get rowed! When I watched this movie, I realized that it was these pictures I lived with every day until I was old enough to move out and come down to So Cal after my family had moved to Nor Cal when I was five . Until I could come back, my friends and I searched and hit the ramp after the ramp, looking for every empty pool possible and mimicking everything Stecyk covered about these guys. We're all educated and have family and careers now, but this movie reminds me of who I was at that age and why I'm still surfing. This is an inspired film that anyone who has an interest in pop culture, extreme sports, 70s or even just good documentary filmmaking will enjoy completely. When it comes to cable, I can't change the channel. Kudos to Stacy Peralta for making a beautiful piece of art!
