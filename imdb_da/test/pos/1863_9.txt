This is definitely a touching film, and a good expression of Charles Darwin's personal struggle. The film is not just about his struggle to get his book "Origin of Origin" published, but also his relationship with his eldest daughter. His daughter was initially the only person in his family to approve his views, something she also had to pay for. One more than him at times. <br /> <br /> Now, this is not an evolutionary propaganda movie, I actually think it managed to stay very neutral. A hard thing to do in my opinion. Of course, it doesn't understand how the characters were treated by the church, the opposite actually. If you need me to use the big words to shed light on this movie; It will be resembled by deists and atheists, but departs from theism. The film tells of evolution, and that is it. <br /> <br /> Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was incredible. Of course, we can all think of Darwin as the old man with the funny beard, but this film is centered on the man in his late 20s, early 30s. Jennifer Connelly (Emma Darwin) is amazing as always, but the actress who impressed me was Martha West like Annie Darwin, Darwin's daughter. Absolutely on the best children's actors in the decade. The story is about Darwin and his daughter, and it's beautifully acted. <br /> <br /> Apart from a few leaps of time that were a little confusing, the production of this movie is pretty flawless. Some scenes were Darwin observing nature is just stunning, and is almost seized by a high-rise National Geographic Documentary. I have to admit, but I'm not quite sure why they chose "Creation" as the title. I doubt it's an irony, the movie is too respectful for it. Well, I'm sure there's a meaning to it, just don't let it scare you away. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 9/10. This is really a big tribute to Charles Darwin and give it a try.
