I haven't seen this movie in 30 years, so I don't know if I want it as much as I did when I was 12. At that time, however, I loved this movie. This is a great "starting chick-flick" for young pre-teen girls. Be careful about the end. There are tears and hard feelings. Looking back on it from a 2008 perspective (with so much more knowledge of child psychology, politics and political correction), I think it would be interesting to see again. Patty's sinister, fierce father, indifferent mother and favored sister helped everyone to make her vulnerable and hungry for companion. Patty was sad when Anton left. She was heart-beaten when he was killed. The anger that was directed at her was shocking. After all, she was only 12 years old. What I strongly preserved is how this film taught me that even "enemy" soldiers are also humans. Not all German soldiers were hateful Nazis. When I was older I watched TV shows like Hogans Heroes and Rat Patrol, which also made the point that the "permanent" German soldiers were not the same as the Gestapo. "Regular" soldiers were drafted. The Gestapo was handpicked among volunteers for their special attitude to hatred. I think one of the privileges of being a Nazi was that they had special tasks and therefore did not go into battle. Their specialties were interrogation and torture. <br /> <br /> Later in the Cold War I would think of Russian soldiers and remember SOMGS. We were taught that the Soviet Union was "malicious". But the reality was that Russian soldiers were not out to destroy America. They had a job. Their government probably told them that our government was out to destroy their lifestyle. Which, in a way, was true since the United States struggled to end communism. <br /> <br /> The lesson is still valid today. German soldiers were not the same as Nazis, just as Muslims are not the same as al-Qaeda.
