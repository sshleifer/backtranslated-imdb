Charlie Wilson (Two-time Oscar winner: Tom Hanks) is a companion congressman ... Who loves to party, enjoy women's business and especially drink her booze. When Charlie's old friend and ex-boyfriend Joanne Herring (Oscar winner: Julia Roberts) wants Charlie to visit Afghanistan, this country certainly needs help. Charlie is shocked at what he saw, especially from all different ages killed or wounded by this war with the Russians. He decides to help the people and rebels fight the Russians who started the war. Charlie, Joanne and a renegade CIA Agent named Gust Avrakotos (Oscar Winner: Philip Seymour Hoffman) will start a good fight to bring the greatest hidden operation in history. <br /> <br /> Directed by Oscar-Winner: Mike Nichols (The Birdcage, Henry, Wolf) made a lively, entertainingly sharp satirical war comedy based on a true story. Hanks, Roberts, Hoffman in an Oscar nominated performance and Amy Adams as Charlie's loyal assistant are very good at their roles. Despite the excellent true life expectancy, "Charlie Wilson's War" never captures real fire, and it's not as much fun as you liked it. Director Nichols and Screenwriter: Aaron Sorkin (a few good men) keeps things moving and the characters are all the way through. DVD has a sharp Pan & Scan (1.33: 1) transfer and a good Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. DVD's only special features are behind the scenes featurette with cast & crew and a real-life featurette with Charlie Wilson and others. "Charlie Wilson's War" is a good movie that could have been really good, but it's not. But this movie is smart enough to please for those who enjoy well-written or well-acted adult comedies. (*** 1/2 out of *****).
