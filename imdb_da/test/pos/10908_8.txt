The first and far better of Kevin Kline's two gay roles. (The other is the boring "De-Lovely" where he played Cole Porter.) Inspired by Tom Hanks' emotional acceptance for "Philadelphia", where he released his high school teacher, the nominated film in this version was, of course, more "Forrest Gump" than "Philadelphia". Here the Hanks character plays by Matt Dillon. The reaction scene of most of the movie is very funny and, as has been often pointed out, is particularly effective as done by Kevin himself, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck (a brave move as he was the target of such rumors as he refused! ), Bob Newhart and Joan Cusack as the last jilted bride-to-be. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks' real teacher criticized the graduation scene, which says people don't work that way in real life. But it's a farce and not real life. That said, it is not as effective as it could be and the misdirection of the final "wedding scene" that makes it look as if Tom and Kevin are being hitched, I found rather pointless, annoying and a policeman . The highlight of the movie for me, of course, is Kevin's scene with the right audio, and it's fun, but certainly not at all realistic when the tape responds to Kevin's actions. <br /> <br /> It's all a hoot!
