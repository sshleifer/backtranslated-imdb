The first time I saw this amazing movie and Alyssa, my star *, who played Frances Ella Fitz, was so big in this movie! It was just so right, and her little dog so sweet! I saw it the first time when I was 11 years old, and that was the best movie I had ever seen and you know what? I still think so! 10/10 ********** = biggest ever!
