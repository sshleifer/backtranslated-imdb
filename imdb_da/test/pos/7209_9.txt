It is the story of three brothers pulling together in the midst of hardship and loss and learning that the truly important things in life are family, love, trust, and forgiveness. The entire cast manages to pull a powerful performance despite some unpleasant one-liners. A great movie for fans of true to life problems that hit credible families. Also worth looking for fans of Dermot Mulroney or Sean Astin. They both do an amazing job that often brings you to tears. Take my word for it and rent it here today!
