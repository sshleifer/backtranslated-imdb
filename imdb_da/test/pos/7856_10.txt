This movie was a surprise. Plot synopsis sounds kinky, and stars Clint Eastwood and the great Geraldine Page. I didn't know what to expect. There is the open scene where the wounded soldier says that age 12 is old enough to kiss and continues to give a child a lingering and very adult mouth to mouth kiss. The child takes him to the girls' pension school, where she lives. He exploits the situation by trying to seduce the staple played by Page, her assistant, and another student. Jealousy, sexual excitement, incest, intrigue and macabre are all reported in this wonderfully original story. <br /> <br /> I've read the other comments here and disagree a little with. But I wanted to clarify a point previously made that there are no sympathetic characters in the movie. I find out there is one. The attractive female slave successfully resists the soldier's progress on a stage that works well because it touches the white man's common story of black women's slaves. Although her strength and lack of illusion is the sum of her experience, she is what I would consider a sympathetic character. She, more than any of the other women and girls at school, has a legitimate reason to participate in what is ultimately happening.
