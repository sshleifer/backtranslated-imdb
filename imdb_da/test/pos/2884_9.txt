In the dramatization of Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminating a number of characters and generally implicated rather than showing Dorian's significant wickedness. If you want a more explicit representation, see the 1945 movie. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly very different men and writers. This story really deals with a theme similar to Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as a fantasy, while the RLS took the scientific route. Both main characters are men in whom good wars with evil, with evil to win at last. <br /> <br /> The actors in this BBC movie also take a different route than those in 1945 movies. John Gielgud says that all the same caustic and cynical quips as George Sanders, in his role, really project Wilde himself, but with a subtle difference. You suspect Sanders really believed in what he said, but Gielgud might say what is expected of him, rather than what he truly thinks. Peter Firth also shows his two sides of his character in a retained way, but then we will not see as many of his escapades as Hurd Hatfield had a chance to show. <br /> <br /> It is a very good production, with dramatization reflecting the essence of the novel, if not all its ramifications.
