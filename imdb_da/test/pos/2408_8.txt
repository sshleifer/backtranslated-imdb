I've seen this movie more than once and it's worth it. For those of you who like martial arts and overcome internal conflict, this is a valuable choice. Having seen this movie, I wanted to be a more productive member of society because I could relate to the inner turmoil of a girl seeking acceptance and needing a path to follow. Of course, Mr Miyagi always gives his sage advice. 2 thumbs up!
