I love meatballs! Amazing characters and exciting situations make it loved here. Bill Murray is hysterical and you must love the 4-mile trail race at the end! An overall classic and one of my favorites now for about 20 years. It brings back good memories of the camp and deals nicely with the experience of being rejected by silly peers and the empowerment brought one by being saved by a sympathetic adult. Tons of great one-liners and a wealth of wacko advisors. This is the kind of movie where you repeat key sets among friends for years. Also, nothing obviously raw and what a sweet late 70's soundtrack to bring on just the right amount of nostalgia. I can't say enough about meatballs; It's a classic. Be observant! All followers are bad stink bombs, who simply bought the name's marketing rights. They have no connection to Ivan Reitman's masterpiece.
