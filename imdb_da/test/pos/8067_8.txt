Annie Rooney lives with her official father and brother Tim in the slums of New York where she is constantly involved in many battles with the other neighborhood children. Annie has a secret on Joe Kelly (whose little brother Mickey is the gang head who Annie constantly fights), who is in a gang that is on the verge of trouble, says officer Rooney. Kelly is sponsoring a dance where Tony is planning to shoot Kelly to come with him to make him look like a fool in front of his girl, but Officer Kelly is badly hurt instead. Tim (part of Kelly's gang) is told by Tony and friend Spider that Kelly shot his father so he goes after him in revenge. Annie learns about this and goes to stop her brother if she is on time. Very good mix of humor and heart in this movie, although the plot does not start before the movie's 40 minute mark. Pickford is fun (though she 33 plays a girl no more than 12-13) and really gets into her character. Haines doesn't play Kelly as hard as he should, but is able to make the audience feel for him at an emotional level. The scenes where the officer tells Annie about his father's death and the end really put a lump in his neck. The mix of all kinds of kids throughout the movie is fun to watch. Rating 8.
