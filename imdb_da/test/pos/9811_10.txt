I'm not sure to call this movie a children's drama or a fantasy movie. When I first looked at this, I couldn't really make the end, and that's the only part of the movie that seemed to lack depth and left me a little depressed for a while. Then I saw it another time and realized how great the actor was and was clueless about why it received the little attention it did at that time. <br /> <br /> Unforgettable performances by the young Mazzello and Wood should have made this movie a classic. Although it was probably supposed to be a fantasy / drama by the original writer / director (Evans), Donner once remarked that he probably did it with a more dramatic point of view, especially ended, leaving much to know what really happened to Bobby - Was he killed, did he escape and really did all the amazing trips? Or was it just an imaginary story woven by Hanks to prove a point on children? <br /> <br /> But on the whole, it didn't shut down a happy ending, which we are so used to in a children's movie. Maybe it's because it's not just that. To see what may have been a more classic ending, check out the official Elijah Wood Site, where you'll find the first rough draft script for the end of the movie (presumably by the original author) <br /> <br /> Also a note by Hans Zimmer music, which is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, a mix of childish and dark feelings throughout the movie. A good CD to get hold of if you can. <br /> <br />
