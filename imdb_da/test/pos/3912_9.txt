This is the ultimate horror movie this year. "House of Wax" is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. This version really puts the Vincent Price version to shame. I know only a few of the young casts in the movie. The ever cumbersome Paris Hilton; The pain in you knows what seems to be more seductive than ever. At least she did not try to copy her infamy. Well, if she likes to do horror, she's better than "Fortune's Wheel" Vanna White. She beats Vanna HAND! And the scene where "House of Wax" was made was no joke. The house was made of wax, and the victims were able to get out of there before they grew up as their friends. The two twins Bo and Vincent (deformed twins) were lunatics from the get-go. The parents raised them well, except Vincent. And I think they were straightforward. How does it come in the second pickup to be scary, but not as bad as the other two. It's another story in the book. I think he had to follow his heart, not the other twins who made Ambrose a tourist "trap" for unsuspecting victims. This movie is like "The Phantom of the Opera" meets "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". And this movie is one of the scary in 2005! Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.
