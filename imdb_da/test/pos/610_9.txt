Mikio Narusa's study of the life of three idle, constant complaints, single ex-geishas in post-war Japan is a wonderful sign. They used to be friends in the old days, but now their relationship is tense because one of the women has become a successful money transferer and the other two owe her. Although moneylender is the only one who has been successful in this reconstruction economy, she is the only one of the three who do not have children. The other two each have a child that they depend on for income because none of them work. Complications occur when the children decide to get married (but not to each other) and leave home. As a result, the bitter, haunting old women become even more bitter and murmur, become full and pamper their rotten children and ruthless friend to the money extender. Meanwhile, the moneylender is even unhappy despite her fortunes. She has no one besides her young deaf girl to keep her company and chance of meeting with two former lovers from her geisha days nowhere - all they really want is to borrow money from her. The three characters are all in-depth in the quickening of their own bored lives and are too tired to fight much, usually choosing instead to step back to the present whole or at least throw complaints back and forth to each other. <br /> <br /> "Late Chrysanthemums" are very slow and not very much happening, but Naruse, like all major instructors, has the ability to do a lot with very little. I have not seen much of his work, but I suppose this is not his best, even though it is very good. The problem is, I think, the whole thing doesn't seem to be too much. But the film is full of good points. Although it is cynical, it is not all that so. Naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters, and he paints lively portraits that make the signs seem even noble in disgrace from their self-made misery. While the film is not a must-see, it is important as a fragment of the work of a large, lesser-known (outside his own country) director, where little is available on video here in the United States.
