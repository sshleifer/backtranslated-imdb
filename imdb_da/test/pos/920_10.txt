The biggest movie ever. <br /> <br /> What about a battle? But if we look through purely cinematic terms, it is clear that the Three Colors Red is a masterpiece. It's not enough just to say this - Three Colors Red is the world cinema championship. If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you agree that Star Wars is not good, if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi both have to take a step back, then Three Colors Red is the foremost masterpiece of all time. As a discussion of human morality, Three Colors Red works at an intensive metaphysical level, with a depth that no one can match. Blue went almost as far into the human psyche, but stopped as it had to pull the rabbit out of the hat. White forced us to reflect on the equality of equality - this was gradually improving, but still not quite there. However, red is the right thing. What he expresses in this movie is an expression of what it is to be human. In fact, what he is expressing is how it feels to be human. It forces us to examine up to the smallest details, the nature of our soul, our ethical self. In Red you can find meaning at one of its several levels. On the first level, Red achieves a high level of verisimilitude - we couldn't have trouble calling Red an unusually entertaining story. However, the coincidences of the film and its greeting force us to investigate the film as a movie. It's like Kieslowski says, "Ceci n'est pas la réalité". In fact, Kieslowski can also challenge reality to pursue a humanistic goal. It's a trick that Kieslowski has tried since Le Double Vie de Véronique, but not before this, his final film, he finally reached to achieve this divine blend of fate, philosophy, and circumstances. The actors and actors also seem to benefit a greater power. Valentine (Irène Jacob) is a suitable name, because she seems to represent almost pure love. However, the idea of ​​first impression is challenged by Jean-Louis Tritignant's Judge Kern, a cantankerous man who eventually becomes an almost omniscient observer of events - a sign that symbolically seems to have the power to bring characters together - A power to make people happy, a power that he could only obtain through Valentine. <br /> <br /> We have the ability to watch movies as more than just a series of pictures. In fact, film has the potential to have more meaning than literature. It does not happen, of course, but at least we have the power to watch this movie, knowing that it gives us the power to achieve what we cannot define but all possess. An overview of this film is read: "A movie about a woman running over a dog". That is it. <br /> <br /> Isn't it? <br /> <br /> -Simon Huxtable <br /> <br />
