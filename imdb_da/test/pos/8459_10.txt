I do not normally comment on movies on IMDB, but in this case I feel like I should. I love movies, and I want to make them, and this movie is a perfect example of good filmmaking. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I've seen on the small screen (originally it sees the air on the AMC, I think and watched the DVD I just looked at) that got me to feel that feeling in my stomach. The little rodent experience that the director would hope you feel while watching his thriller. Jack Lemmon's performance is a fine one and Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas follow. I felt so much empathy of Lemmon, the character Jack Godell, only wished that people should listen to his warning. <br /> <br /> But what impresses me most about this movie is the lack of a score, and that too makes it beautiful for me. Apart from the opening titles, there is no background music to increase the excitement because nothing is needed. And while the credits run, white on black, in silence, that point runs home. <br /> <br /> I use the movie as an example to anyone who says music makes the movie. I think the movie should make the movie, and the music should only amplify it. But for the China Syndrome music, there is no need to cross the realism and urgency depicted here. The characters depict all this far better than the music could ever have. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie, it's one of my favorites. If you like movies, you won't be disappointed. If you like movie soundtracks more, you might not give this a chance.
