Well it is a fantastic work of Aparnaji and some where people like this make us believe that there are many more concepts so far to be expressed and the movie is a good medium to do so. All the great actors together now have nothing to say about acting or acting, but the film gave us a good message through out. It has nicely predicted to condition human mind with the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view, and we will solve all the problem accordingly. The whole professor of the girl has tried their own ways. So when JOydeep discussed with his wife, he says "she's looking for a thing she'll never get" and wife answers "aren't we all?". So it was a big comment that after the movie left me with a big question, are we all sick?
