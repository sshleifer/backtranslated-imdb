This is a great romantic comedy outside the wall of love, work, pandering to the public taste and midlife crises. The protagonist is a talented film director who decides to make a silly PG-13 movie to get out of hock with the IRS. It has an excellent cast, a wide range of humor (from deadpan to slapstick), and fine writing. It is also an angry send-up of the film industry. The meta commentary contains several good cuts between the reality and the film being made, and in some cases the film deviates from strict realism. The result is a multi-dimensional masterpiece of wry midlife humor.
