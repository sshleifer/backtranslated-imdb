As a mother of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I love AristoCats. It is a movie that does not contain double-occupants, no almost-black words such as heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no scabies or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the "best" children's videos these days. The story is sweet and interesting. The music is amazing. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are cute and the various other characters are unique and attentive. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. The characters are also quite well-groomed. I love to listen to Eva Gabor's velvety voice, and so many others are well-known from childhood and also fit the characters as well. It's really a movie about love, tolerance, good manners and fidelity. Who does not want their children exposed to these values? It's a movie I don't mind seeing again and again, unlike Happy Feet, where I couldn't see it all myself once because it was so annoying. I want production companies to move toward making movies more like this.
