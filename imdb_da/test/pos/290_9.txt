Breathtaking at the best, thrilling at the worst, Francis Ford Coppala's groundbreaking epic 'Apocalypse Now' is one of the most iconic and famous films of the 20th century and, in my opinion, was the greatest ever film definition centered on America's commitment to Vietnam. <br /> <br /> What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it is quite different from other movies of the same genre. I have seen many films that have tried to depict Vietnam 'images and feelings', but have not been successful in doing so as an adult film and with particular interest in war movies. Films such as "Hamburger Hill" and "We were soldiers" fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of Vietnam by portraying "heroic battles" which are most often contaminated by the zeal of Hollywood movie production. <Br /> <br /> In the "Apocalypse Now" there are no battles, no heroes or villains, there is nothing in the movie to suggest that it is supposed to reflect the imagery of Vietnam through the physical aspects of the war. Rather, it is a movie that strongly examines and explores the human psyche when it has been plagued by the absolute "horror" of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century. The sheer sheen of the Act (especially the interpretation of taciturn Captain Willard by Martin Sheen), along with the spectacular filmography (filmed in Phillipines), which provides decisive realism for the film's background, makes "Apocalypse Now" an unforgettable epic. /> <br /> Undoubtedly a myriad of emotions and left us with a flow of mediation, "Apocalypse is now" not the bright heart film. It is the masterpiece that requires more impressions to be fully appreciated.
