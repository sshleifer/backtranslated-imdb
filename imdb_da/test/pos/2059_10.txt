This movie is a great rampage of action and comedy, it goes straight into it right from the start there is no dull construction. The chemistry of the leading roles adds to the excitement and expectation of the ending, even though my suspicions were not satisfied. The special effects worked great and were credible! Would have liked another ending, but it still had me feeling. The storyline unfolds well, but it is a movie you have to watch from start to finish, carefully to get all the details to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment. <br /> <br />
