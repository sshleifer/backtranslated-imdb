This 1931 comedy gets better with every show because of Marion Davie's comic talents and a fantastic performance by C. Aubrey Smith. Smith plays a gruff old man who gathers his adult children (from his younger days as a rake) into his falling years. One is American (Davies), an English (Ray Milland, who looks about 18), and an Italian (Nina Quartero). There are some surprises when the plot moves with Ralph Forbes (who is no appeal at all) for Davies. <br /> <br /> Davies and Smith are just amazing together and very touching. Davies also gets to make a few dances and make a few "big" entrances. And of course Davies is just beautiful. <br /> <br /> Halliwell Hobbes, Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray, Guinn Williams, Edgar Norton and David Torrence co-star. Had they given out to support Oscar awards in 1931, Smith might have been nominated. He is just outstanding in this gem.
