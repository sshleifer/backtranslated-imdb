In spite of being dated, "Inki and Minah Bird" in my opinion is an enjoyable and charming cartoon. The work of art is not extraordinary, but good enough. This cartoon has no dialogs, just sounds and music, but this combination works fine. The comic book itself is good, fun, old-fashioned, creative, entertaining and fun. <br /> <br /> This cartoon also makes the difference because it focuses on only 3 characters: Inki (the little black girl), Minah Bird (a very strange bird) and a hungry lion who wants both Inki and Minah for breakfast - he both shocks them during most of the comic book. In fact, I find that the lion is very beautiful, fun and fat enough. I really like the lion. The bad lion is so stupid and loses that you must be sorry for him. To me, the real enemy is Minah Bird, not the lion. At some point the lion eats almost it - too badly it doesn't gulp it, because it deserved to be eaten. <br /> <br /> Back to this animated card there is not a single boring or boring moment. At least for me. The only bit I find stupid is the end because the bird has a great fight with the lion, steals the teeth and puts them on itself. Apart from that, I have nothing great to criticize about this, except for the fact that steak should definitely have gone to the lion and not the bird. In my opinion, this is a very forgotten and undervalued little jewel that should definitely get more credit.
