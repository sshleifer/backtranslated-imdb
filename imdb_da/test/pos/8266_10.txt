I have copied my video of this to DVD so I can enjoy it when I like it and it also makes a very successful (and rare) wedding gift! This is just a wonderful adaptation of a much-loved novel. Everything about it is just perfect and it has been incredibly good. There is always a chance for something old that it may seem a little squeaky for more modern dramas, but 'Precious Track' more than keeps its own. The quality of the play is amazing with Janet McTeer making a superlative caution and a young Clive Owen stomping like the taciturn Gideon Sarn. <br /> <br /> I challenge anyone to see the final sequence without at least sniffing on the sheer romance of it all. It's the perfect movie to watch when it's cold outside and you snuggle up on the couch. I really can't recommend it highly enough.
