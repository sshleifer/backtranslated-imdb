One night at McCOOL'S / (2001) *** (out of four) By Blake French: <br /> <br /> According to Harald Zwart, the director of "One Night at McCool's," This movie is "a dark comedy about women's power over men and how a group of people can all experience different realities, it is the same story told by three different views, and each time we tell the story, we try to reveal a little more about what has actually happened as No one really knows. "" One Night at McCool's marks the direct-debit direct debut of Zwart, an award-winning commercial and music video director who began making short films when he was eight years old. I always get nervous when a director of advertising and music videos turns to filmmaking. We have seen so many examples of how these guys think they are doing another advertisement or music video for TV with their productions. Zwart resists this trend. He captures a particularly humorous truth in "One Night at McCool's", from an inventive, complex play of late Stan Seidel, although it is often somewhat confusing. <br /> <br /> "One Night At McCools" has three men who share their own experiences of a particularly beautiful young woman. In some ways, this movie is the comedy version of "American Beauty", but in others it is a world apart. <br /> <br /> "It all started one night at McCools," each of the three men explains to their various listeners. There is Randy (Matt Dillon), a bid for the local bar, and his cousin, a lawyer named Carl (Paul Reiser) who gets into the place closes. Detective Dehling (John Goodman) arrives when the salon becomes the crime scene for the dead boyfriend of a female fatally named Jewel (Liv Tyler). Randy is the first to see her as a person treats her inappropriately. He stands up for her, and before you can say SEXY, they have powerful sex and she goes into him. In the beginning, Randy is reluctant: "Sexy and violent, all in one night? But who can turn a jewel like Jewel away. <br /> <br /> Jewel changes each of the three men's lives. For Detective Dehling, she pulls him out of a hole of grief since his wife died. For Carl, she makes him forget about her loving family and lovely little suburbs. For Randy, she lights a couple of fires, both positive and negative, later persuading him to contact a bingo player hit man named Burmeister (Michael Douglas) to put an end to his misleading ways. <br /> <br /> It is interesting how the film perceives the three different chronicles - even though Jewel is in relation to the man who tells the story. Dehling sees jewel as a beautiful, fascinating gift from God. Carl sees jewel as two sexy legs and lots of cleavage. Randy is unsure of what to do about her, an awakening to his otherwise boring way to nowhere life. The most exciting element of this film is Jewel himself, though delicious the game of the always lovely Liv Tyler ("Armageddon"). She is not really interested in the men, but what they can offer her. Her motives are too simple, not truthfully diabolical or evil; She is simply a young lady who at an early age has learned that she can get what she wants out of life through her beauty. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of fun with its material. From the enthusiastic entertaining cast, to his fiercely hilarious showdown, "One Night at McCool's", most of his humorous ideas take advantage. What makes the movie even more fun is how the three men's views differ. The actors also have a lot of fun with their characters. Goodman is curiously moody; Traveling suits its kinky, squirmy part quite well; Douglas is blurry and mysterious in one of the movie's funniest performances; Dillon gives his character arrogant personality, although Randy is a lackluster person; Liv Tyler is dazzling. She injects Jewel with the perfect amount of boasting charisma and tantalizing wit. She reminds us of Mena Suvari's intimate performance in "American Beauty." <br /> <br /> "One Night at McCool's" is the first film to come from Michael Douglas' new production company, Furthur Films. It is a creative, genuine and sexy production. Along the way, we are often caught in the twisted structure, but it is a natural answer to a movie that intentionally confuses several angles into a single story. The movie ends with a note that is both black and comical. This is another of these comedies, where serious events take place in a humorous way; i.e. the black comedy. Many movies of this genre come across as either black or too deficient. "One Night at McCool's" is one of the few that actually works. <br /> <br />
