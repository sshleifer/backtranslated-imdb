Surprisingly well made for T.V. Thriller. I don't expect too much from this one, but I'm happy to say that this is one of the best of that kind. It is fast and has solid and interesting events. <br /> <br /> The story is connected since the beginning, and with many hits you can't help finding the movie very interesting. The background story of Thiessen's character is fierce but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood girl's father. <br /> <br /> The "foreign" concept and his actions are disruptive if you believe it is a common disease in society. A series of rapists do not respect society or even their own family, and this movie shows the disease and crime perfectly. <br /> <br /> My beef with the movie was the non-emotional situation when Thiessen's character returns with his horrible husband after he is released on bail. At that moment she knew what he was doing to his young family (played by the sweet Allyson Hannigan). But it's just the typical Hollywood scene that causes more trouble. <br /> <br /> The Climax scene shows Thiessen after his husband when he is committing another rape, so she calls the police who arrive in time just to catch him. The end tells us that the man was sentenced to 99 years in prison in real life. <br /> <br /> The action is also pretty good, and Tiffany is amazing and beautiful as always. The direction is also very good.
