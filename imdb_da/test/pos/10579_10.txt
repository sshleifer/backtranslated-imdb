I love Sarah Waters Fingersmith and was worried about the TV adaptation, as I was disappointed by the BBC's version of Tipping the Velvet (which, although beautiful to look at, was disappointed by Keeley Hawes not being able to sing, and Rachael Stirling not able to trade). Fingersmith is a very well-planned novel with breathtaking twists and I wondered if it could be done fairly in just 3 hours. I don't have to worry. The adaptation was excellent, very small cut out and went together at a blast pace (though I wondered if if you hadn't read the book, you would miss things?). It had the look and feel of a BBC classic costume drama, and I needed to remind myself that this is a modern book. The action was amazing. Sally Hawkins is acting out her heart as Sue Trinder, and Elaine Cassidy, a slow burner who at the end of the story was glowing like Maud Lilley. The love, the passion, the realization of the betrayals should both be performed, were written on their faces. It was a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> I hope Rachael Stirling looked at: How to play a Sarah Waters character!
