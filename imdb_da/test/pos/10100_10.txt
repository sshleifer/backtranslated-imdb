Many horror fans complain that horror has hardly evolved over the last twenty years. I was inclined to accept this until the influx of Asian horror films, a trend that has been blunt. However, it has produced some true classics, and a Tale Of Two Sisters, which at least stands for me, stands out as an extraordinary piece of cinema, and perhaps the best horror movie for a very long time. <br /> <br /> Based on a Korean folklore, it tells the sad story of two mentally troubled sisters living with their father and grandmother. Having experienced a few problems on their first night home, they decide to stick together and deny their grandfather access to their close relationship. The excitement rises and there is the inevitable snap. But what happens after more than a couple of eyes, as history takes several turns, and the scares become more emotional and quite real. At the end, you may need a few moments to absorb everything and merge it into your own heart, but this is precisely the interconnection of horror and mystery that pushes it beyond the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic. One to see again and again, if just to work it all out.
