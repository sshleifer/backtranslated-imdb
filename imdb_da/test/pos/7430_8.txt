Errol Flynn had a great gift for comedy, which unfortunately was rarely used. Based on the right material, this film shows that he could happily have been at home in Cary Grant-style, gentle comedies. Out of his various forays in the genre, this is definitely the best. Patti Brady gives a good performance in the children's section, and Eleanor Parker simply looks great throughout the movie. An added bonus is the wonderful Hattie McDaniel, who unfortunately is underutilized in this movie - a welcome presence anyway. Flynn performs his comic tasks with the same light style that he brought to his swashbuckling roles. The fact that he does look like it is easy does not mean it is. A super little family comedy, great for the Christmas season or another time you want to be encouraged.
