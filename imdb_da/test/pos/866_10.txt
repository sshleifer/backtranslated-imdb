I honestly don't know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review, as a result, I find it hard to describe these shorts. Let's just say there is a good amount of gay sex, some necrophils, some incest, a lot of masturbation and more artificial .... members. And I loved every minute of it. <br /> <br /> Not that it's ALL raw humor. It is not. They mostly expect away from speed gags, with the exception of a sketch entitled "Pizza", where they use a very good one. "They" are 3 / 11ths of the short-lived sketch comedy group that aired on MTV called The State, namely David Wain, Michael Showalter and Michael Ian Black. <br /> <br /> The trio go on adventures, usually play and meet strange and unusual people, people who are often actually more normal than they are. The support molding is also fantastic. Paul Rudd, Julie Bowen, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Sam Rockwell make every play in different sketches. They are also with other The State alumni such as Joe Lo Truglio and Todd Holoubek. The musical choices are also very well-placed. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed these sketches over and over, but they are not for everyone, as they are pretty vulgar most of the time. If you like smart humor that is not afraid to push the boundaries of good taste, then I highly recommend it. If you liked Wet Hot American Summer (Directed and written by Wain and Showalter) or the state, then you should really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I think it can currently only be ordered online. Check out their website and stroke a few sketches to get an idea if you really want this first and find out how to buy the DVD.
