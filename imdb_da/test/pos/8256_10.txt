This movie is an almost forgotten gem from 1979 which, although essentially a comedy, was based on one of Britain's largest banks. In fact, one of the titles that this film is known for is "caper", therefore, that in itself is an indication of the type of film. One of a bunch of beloved rouges who are not the violent or psychotic types who with the cheek a nap pulls out of their biggest job. To be honest, I really do not know too much about the real crime and cannot comment if it accurately portrayed the events that unfolded or the characters involved. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan handles very well and plays PINKY Green and is very credible as an easy going little time American born villain who seems very comfortable with himself. I have to add that sometimes American players fight well with English actors in a British movie, chemistry is not always there, but it is no problem for Jordon to fit right into his role. <br /> <br /> It is worth pointing out that Jordan itself was, of course, one of the most underrated actors in the 70s and 80s and never received the recognition he deserved. He seemed to be stuck in supporting roles and B-movies, not a fair representation of his functioning ability. He has played a corrupt policeman in THE EDI COYLE'S FRIENDS, a sadistic killer during the season. In the secret of my success, he has played a kind of comical Gordon Gehco character, and also in the 1980's EQUALIZER TV show he played a good guy. All this shows the versatility of his plays while interfering with David Niven, Kurt Russell, Edward Woodward and Robert Mitcham. <br /> <br /> In this movie he plays his role effortlessly as a little villain with the eyes of the ladies and you immediately take on his character and clutter for him from the beginning. You can't help like Green, ?? ?? You see, he really wanted to go straight, but when it was chipped, too much of an opportunity seemed to pass and finally he launched the idea of ​​all that money. <br /> <br /> David Niven is the boss and calls the shots, the police inspector was splendidly played by Richard Johnson, who typically portrayed a smarmy but thorough London detective who clearly loves his job. The second supporting cast doesn't say too much, but looks at them, they were all very well-known British character actors who often found themselves playing either villains or coppers (it's not that ironic). Elkie Sommers, Oliver Tobias does what they have to do and it is good to see Gloria Graham in a cameo role. <br /> <br /> For some viewers, especially Americans, it seems ridiculous that someone with a Greens record could land a maintenance job on every thing a bank and come and go when he pleases. In addition, the stunt of the crown court withdrew after the verdict was not as far as it might seem, back in the 1960s and 70s security was not as close as it is now. <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself, there are a few interesting observations. With a small amount of time, drag was too much. There have been other films where this also occurs, ie THE BRINKS MAT. It is not just the disposal or the concealment of the loot, but with so many people involved that someone carelessly, blab or just simply break when they lean. Moreover, the authorities come down on very hard on local rouges when such a large robbery is carried out. Also, they say there is no honor among twenty, but Ivan was adamant that PINKY got his whack. You only had to look at his stare in the quay, whose appearance could kill, a look at total scams! How could he have doubled them all in after taking care of him? You have to ask yourself a question, why is it that bad guys can be so stupid? Did Green really do that he could sweetly talk his way out of suspicion again? Inspector Watford was not at all fooled by his innocent looking face as well as a well-constructed alibi, the entire caper reeked of internal work. In addition, you have to wonder why they leave so many tracks? A notepad with the safe numbers cut, raising brochures for overseas tours, still leaves its telescope and unusual behavior on the day of the robbery that was out of character. <br /> <br /> With some decent but sense police work Insp Watford had quickly measured with Green, picked him up and soon had him sing as a canary. It just shows that despite the deliberate planning things can rave very quickly, there is never a clean escape for each body, some will always get nabbed. Although it is worth pointing out that many of the money were never restored. All in all, an entertaining movie, interesting shots from London and England in the late 70s, well paced, with a great ending. I would highly recommend this especially if you enjoy hijackers. (Note: I recently purchased a DVD from this, but the download was obviously taken from a VHS tape and is of poor quality. Therefore, you don't pay too much for it!)
