This movie is a very beautiful and slow movie. There's nothing Hollywood about it. It is very Danish and the characters are very real. It is the first Danish film to address this transsexual theme. It really is about love that has no sex. I do not want to say that it is about lesbian love, although the two main characters (the transsexual veronika and Charlotte) are attracted to each other. It is a story of love and life. <br /> <br /> The story takes place pretty much in the two apartments. There is almost no background music, which makes it seem more real and intense. The two actors playing the protagonists are great. They really make them real. They are not archetypes, but real people you could meet on the street. I think it's the first time I've seen a transsexual portrayed well. Very well done.
