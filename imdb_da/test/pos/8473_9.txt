A masterful performance of Jamie Foxx is just one of the highlights of "Ray", a 2004 movie, also running Kerry Washington, Regina King, Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, Sharon Warren, Patrick Bachau and many others who all provide excellent support for movies. <br /> <br /> The movie has several main focus: The first is Charles's childhood - the drowning of his brother George, who haunted him for years, the glaucoma that blinded him, and the force taught him by his mother - Bend Don't, don't bother, don't be a curl. She eventually sends him to a special school where Charles's gift of music is discovered. The next focus is Charles' artistic development as a Nat King Cole-like singer, for his gospel music events, his country music foray and the unique sound that became Ray Charles. The third focus is Charles's personal life - his marriage to Bea, his many affairs, his heroin dependence and possible rehabilitation. <br /> <br /> Because Charles lived a packed 74 years, there is a lot of skipping. Although Charles was orphaned in his teens, his beloved mother's death is not in the movie. While appearing on the chitlin circuit and refusing to play in segregated clubs, his near hunger as a musician is not covered. At one point he found a jug of jelly and tried to eat it, but the jar broke. He was down and out. Bea is shown to him when the state of Georgia, which banned him, adopts "Georgia on My Mind" as their theme song in 1979 and presents Charles back to his original state, but he and Bea were divorced in 1977, which is not mentioned. However, she was probably there. Neither was she his only wife - he was married one time before he met her; that marriage is not covered. In the film we are told by an illegitimate child - there was 12. It would have been impossible to get all that and more to a movie. What has not skipped is his glorious music, which seems to continue constantly throughout the film, which constantly enhances his genius and artistry. <br /> <br /> Charles's story is compelling and keeps the public's interest everywhere. Those who scoff at it as a movie for television do not give it the credit it deserves. Taylor Hackford's direction gives "Ray" a good pace, and the film has a lot of atmosphere and evokes the various decades beautifully. <br /> <br /> As Ray holds the Jamie Foxx character, one forgets that he is a comedian who plays a lot. Foxx wore prostheses, made his own piano play and spent a lot of time with Charles preparing for the role. He sews him, but it is not an imitation - he is a flesh and a blood man with hallucinations of standing in water and finding his brother's body; a man full of denial about his addiction, hates the word junkie and believes that he is not affiliated; and he is in denial of his home life and thinks his wife does not know about his various relationships and illegitimate children (in the film, the child); and a man took terrible advantage early in his career because of his blindness, which refuses to move on later. He requires to be paid in $ 1 bills so they can be counted; When he discovers that he is a cousin of a club owner and his partner and was almost cheated out of a record deal, he makes his own deal and leaves his job. <br /> <br /> One doesn't wonder much about Foxx's performance that accepts him as Ray from the first time he appears on camera. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent biography designed, like "Walk the Line," with the artist's amazing music. Whether you are Ray Charles fan, "Ray" is something to experience.
