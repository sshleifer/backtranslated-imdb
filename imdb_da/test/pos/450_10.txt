Most people will consider that Yul Bryner's greatest achievements were as ruler of Siam in KING AND I. It gave him a wide range of moods to test his abilities, from cartoons to tragic, from eager to learn to dominate to hateful . It also proved to his advantage as a "singer" and a dancer. Finally, as it was also his Tony Award winning performance from Broadway, the film also allowed us to record some of the great Broadway performance. <br /> <br /> But he made other movies showing his talents as well as THE KING AND I. His comic book gets even better at feeling fine. Then his appearance as General Bunin in ANASTASIA, or his Ramses in the Ten Commandments. Yet he was terribly close to being a 1950's successor to Eric Von Stroheim as "the man you love to hate." A certain vulnerability in his plays and roles gave him to the film group, even after his best year as a star was behind him - and he increasingly pulled back to repeat King of Siam on television and the stage. <br /> <For me, his best performance in this 1959 drama is with Deborah Kerr, Jason Robards Jr., Robert Morley, EG Marshall, Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard. The film is set in quite modern times - the pulverized tune that was Hungary in 1956, when it looked like the iron curtain was supposed to collapse during the reform of the Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his followers. But the Hungarian revolution collapsed due to poor timing. The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent in thought to crush the rebellion (and arrested and executed Nagy and other reformers). The West was passing by and let it happen: England and France had been caught in the Suez crisis, and the United States had told them and Israel to attack Egypt. Because of the actions of three close allies in the United States, the Western country found it difficult to condemn the Soviet Union's overthrow. It was an unfortunate situation and the Hungarians have never forgotten how they were left in it. <br /> <br /> In the film is Brynner Major Surov, a Russian intelligence officer looking at some of the leaders of the Hungarian rebellion, one of whom is Paul Kedes (Jason Robards). Kedes can get help from some Westerners on a bus trip through Hungary, led by Robert Morley (including Marshall, Jackson, Howard and Kerr). The latter is stored in a hotel while their bus is being repaired, and Brynner mixes with them and hopes to lead to where Robards is. But Brynner is human - he tries to congratulate these people (who all see him as a monster) and in order, when he has drunk a little too much, he confronts them with the issues that have bothered historians since 1945: How is it (Although one notes that Russia had Stalin in charge) that relations between Russia and the West collapsed so quickly? The Allies had worked well together from 1941 to 1945, but after Yalta and Potsdam all kinds of mutual suspicions broke out. Should they? Surov is a good officer, but he is torn half of the loyalty to the communist regimes in the Soviet Union and in Hungary, which he supports, and his growing love for Kerr, who saves Robards, but is also willing to notice it more human side of the Russian major. And when the film reaches its tragic climax, we watch as Surov will decide whether he will follow his duty or take pity on Kerr, Robards and the other Westerners who will leave. It will be a real struggle for him - and one he can win too late. It was a great movie about a tragedy in post-war Europe, and possibly the most thought-provoking role Yul Brynner ever imagined.
