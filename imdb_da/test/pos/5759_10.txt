iv has been a fan of Rik Mayall and Ade Edmednson ever since I can remember the weather its young or bottom. and I just have to say I've never laughed so much in my whole life !!! the guest house paradiso is bloody brilliant! I know it's not going to be everybody's cup of tea (with vomiting, slapstick comedy, violence and spooky language), but then just don't see it if it's not yours. it is not like no one knows what sick and winding things Rik and Ade come up with when they work with each other !! I think it is unfair that this movie has received such a chatter from critics, because I don't think I'm the only one to believe this, this movie is 10 out of 10! :)
