To quote Jason Connery and Mark Ryan on one of the many DVD comments, it was "wobbly music" over the HTV logo enough to make me jump from what I did to stick my face to the screen in a hour. The individual stories included in the series were excellent and the character development was wonderful. Robin of Loxley goes through a very convincing journey over the two series he looks like, although his departure from the program was not planned. Marian also develops her relationship with both Hernes sons very well. Having been jaded for many years in television scenery, I again saw the series on Sky 1 in the UK in the mid-nineties and was even more impressed that the series seemed even better than I remembered. This is not a children's television program, it is about witchcraft, treason, rebellion and injustice. And it manages to do it without showing too much blood. As far as I can remember, you see only some of the red things in the Pilot movie (Episodes 1 and 2 on the DVD player). The DVDs are good and contain a wealth of extras including cast-only comments on Series 3 only (Jason Connery Robin) and Crew 1 and 2 Crew Announcements. The picture quality is very good and the remixed and remastered surround sound is great. /> <br /> The idea of ​​freedom is important, freedom prevails. Nothing is forgotten. Nothing has ever been forgotten.
