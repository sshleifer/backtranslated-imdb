Not a bad MOW. I had expected another movie based on women's problems, but was pleasantly surprised by the thrill. Sure parts of the plot were beautiful hokey, but mostly the movie kept me guessing. Was the nut bar connected to the ex-husband, someone in the inn or was it the guy (person) she cut off? Daniel Magder was excellent. I have seen him in Mom's on Strike and in the Guilt City Association, both MOWs and he is very honest, especially the way he challenges his mother, as a preteen would typically work. <br /> <br /> Laura Leighton also played the typical mother (ex-wife) that both men and women can relate to. She was frustrated enough to work right. <br /> <br /> See if you missed it. It's worth it.
