As I have jumped from film to film at the SXSW Film Festival, this film from the opening night has been with me. Curious because it is a dark comedy with quite a absurdist performance. A family of superstitious fundamentalists in a small community of the same mind is changed by a car accident. Three of the four have the same near death experience where they are fully opened, as each receives a turn of the concept of original sin (I will not spoil this scene with the details). The fourth, a middle school cheerleader, is not only the only physically injured, but also unchanged and is now witnessing what has become her mad, apparently spiritual bankruptcy family. Every new moment brings a new scandal, as they have been innocently naked and honest in every way, terrible her and then society. The forgetfulness of Franklins has the most beautiful sexual awakening scene between a man and a wife who I have ever seen the Sarah Brightman song "Deliver Me", a song that can now bring tears to the eyes. <br /> <br /> The cast is amazing. Robertson Dean as father, Vince Pavia as his son and Aviva as the cheerleader daughter, is excellent, Mari Blackwell plays Peggy, her mother's questioning neighbor and best friend perfect, a much more nuanced, generous, genuine character than what could have been (all in Central America knows a Peggy). And Theresa Willis shines positively like Betty, her mother. There are many risks that the players play the three altered signs, and those risks go away. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie gets a great release - if so, I plan to see it again. <Br /> <br /> Very accurate review at: http://www.fosteronfilm.com/phil/forgiving.htm
