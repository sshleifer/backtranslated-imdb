Murder with numbers is a pretty good movie. Although the plot rolls together at the snail's pace, whatever Sandra Bullock's character gets mixed up with her partner and the movie flashes back to a previous trauma situation she had been in, she manages to keep the viewer involved in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I think it does a good job of setting the eerie form of "who made it" type of atmosphere. It keeps you guessing which of the boys really were behind the murder, if not both. I think Ryan Gosling and the other child (lol) are doing a good job of selling the bully against dork conditions. Not sure Gosling was playing a bad ass, but for a guy who would later be in a movie like The Notebook, he did a good job. When the movie first rolls, I found myself involved in the story, like asking myself, "Oh my God, what would I do if I were in that situation?" As I said, a good CSI-type movie, maybe not for the EXTREME drama movie junkie, but a good all around flick. <br /> <br /> 8 outta 10
