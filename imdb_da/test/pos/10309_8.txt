I saw the Bandit Queen in 2005, over a decade after it was done in a major controversy in India. The language, the strong treatment and the natural spectacle (of a relatively unknown caste for that time) could have been even more shocking at the time of an Indian population who is more familiar with the fantasy cinema. The film, the cast and Shekhar Kapoor, deserve recognition for the breakthrough battle. <br /> <br /> The reason is not very different from a typical revenge drama made in various forms in India. In fact, there have been several fictitious accounts of this particular story itself. The reason why this stands out is that it should be a first person account for a person who actually went through all this and much else that didn't take place on the screen and survived to tell the story. Survived long enough to see her story made in a movie at least. Phoolan Devi did not live very long after being released from prison in 1994. <br /> <br /> The movie scores several times. The kinematics are brilliant. The music is suitable. Thrown, many of which became more well-known names later, are very good. But the manuscript is unclear. Things are moving too fast and in jerks at times. However, it is understandable, because there are just too many threads that must be tied together to make it all coherent. Or maybe I felt it because I read Mala Sens's book, which is more detailed and better, although of course it is not as shocking as the Phoolan Devis travails visual account and is said to be one of the most important sources of the movie . <br /> <br /> There are also some factual ambiguities. According to Phoolan Devi, she was not present when the Behmai massacre took place, and despite claiming to be the dictated account of Phoolan himself, she was shown to attend and in fact launch the massacre. Then the final scene of Phoolan's showing her touching the feet of the chief minister, in fact, has surrendered herself to a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. Only symbolic value, but shows that Phoolan did not want to serve a living, ordinary person. It would have been nice to show the chief minister to resemble Arjun Singh, who many remember was CM of Madhya Pradesh then. <br /> <br /> But these are tiny chinks in this highly-crafted movie, a rare gem coming out of the Indian movie industry made by a man who, prior to this, was best known for the ultimate masala movie from late 80s - India.
