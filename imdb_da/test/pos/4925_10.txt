You do not have to be the fan of the cartoon show to enjoy this movie. I saw it for the first time when I was nine, had been a fan of the T.V show, and my parents laughed as hard as I did. It's done in the classic style of Bugs Bunny comics from yesterday, and given today's vulgar cartoons, I would think someone would appreciate a comic film that depends more on "wackiness" then on vulgarity to get a couple of laughs.
