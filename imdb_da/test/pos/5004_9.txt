I saw it last week, and the outline of the Korea cities was fun. Very heavy in the cheek and suitable for the political climate. Full points to the authors and Spike for that. The part where he gets the translator to draw a rickshaw and throw out Korean words could only be pulled by Spike. This is a brave attempt at Fox. This is a brilliant show, and I hope it pulls off. My wife and I have had it regularly, and even though it collides with a few other programs, we now see it on MySpace. I hope Fox dedicates all the resources to the show and does it daily. I can't wait to see Bobby Lee at his show. With people like Bernard Abedalla behind the show, this is on the right track. Also Mary Mae as his wife looks beautiful.
