After the atomic bomb hits Hiroshima, the charred bodies around lie deformed victims trying to communicate with relatives who cannot even recognize them and a person after another dies of radiation disease. This black and white film, though sad and scary, is not without humor. The story is about a young woman, Yasuko, who was hit by black rain after the explosion. She tries to get married, but everyone is dying and people are worried, the same thing happens to her. After finding a suitable mate (who loses her mind after being in the war for a long time), she ends with signs of radiation disease. This movie is a great portrayal of the nuclear attacks on Japan, it will scare you and may make you cry. The action is good, not too dramatic as many other ww2 movies have been made.
