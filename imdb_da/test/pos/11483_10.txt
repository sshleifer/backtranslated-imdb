I've seen Linda and it's a top-rate movie! The lives of Paul and his wife, Linda, whom he loved as a young man and eventually married. They meet with another couple, Jeff and Stella, and foursome become very good friends. But their friendship takes a twist after vacation together at Varona Beach .... A Twist who never returns the married couples to their former friends status. <br /> <br /> Linda is a must-see !!! ! The acts of Virginia Madsen are acceptable; but Richard Thomas steals the movie with his incredible play ... and the emotions he shows. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie! "Lotta Honey"
