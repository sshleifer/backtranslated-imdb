When Hayao Miyazaki does "tri-fecta" (writes, instructs and animates a movie), he makes a classic movie of all ages. He did it again with Gake no ue no Ponyo. <br /> <br /> The story is about a girl fish held on a very tight leash along with her younger sisters by her father, a bitter ex-human wizard named Fujimoto. The fish escapes from their father and rides a jellyfish to land where she is trapped in a dredging operation and gets stuck in a bottle. This underwater sequence should be one of the most elaborate cartoon scenes ever performed, and is a reason to investigate theatrical release. Miyazaki, who does not fear having a busy scene, has surpassed himself. There were literally hundreds of individually extracted marine animals of every imaginable size that were running at the same time. <br /> <br /> When the fish escapes the dredging operation while it is still trapped in the bottle, a five-year-old boy is named Sousuke spots her in the water and can break the bottle and save her. As she is the result of her father's magic, she has the opportunity for magic herself - and her father is actively trying to fetch her. The boy names the fish Ponyo. When Sousuke learns that Ponyo can speak, her father retrieves her in captivity. <br /> <br /> After a deliberate war with his father, Ponyo manages to flee again with the ability to change into a human being. She meets again with Sousuke in a storm, and the story continues from there in many interesting ways. There is a cuteness factor in this movie rivaling and it even surpasses that of Tonari no Totoro. Joe Hisaishi again provided outstanding musical support. <br /> <br /> The story itself is simple - like Miyazaki's films in general - and should appeal to a wide range of viewers. While I haven't seen it enough to be sure, the movie doesn't seem to be one that will hold scientists in long discussions, as Sen did to Chihiro no Kamikakushi. Nevertheless, this is the ultimate feel-good entertainment movie. I gave the film a ten out of ten rating.
