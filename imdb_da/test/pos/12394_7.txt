I blow hot and cold over Carn√©. He can really be a puzzle for me. I think his inspiration left him a little earlier than it did for other directors of his generation. A man who came to maturity in the thirties with the Popular Front is certainly dissatisfied in France in the Fifties with his fierce commercialism and heavy American influence. He is almost thirty years older than his young stars, and it shows. The party scenes go much further than they should, as if he were trying to buy time for the anemic scenario to work. Roland Lesaffre's character - he plays Pascale Petit's elder brother - seems to exist only to assure the director that his old-style ideas are still obedient. In two hours, this picture is too long. However, let me commend Pascale Petit for her performance; She was a natural person who should have challenged Brigitte Bardot to sexpot supremacy, but somehow lost her way. Andrea Parisy is also excellent as the girl who gets pregnant and wants Charrier to marry her and make her baby legitimate (yes, they still thought that way in the 50s). Laurent Terzieff is the only French actor who could play an anarchist convincingly: he's great here when he saves a cat from death, so he says he can't stand cats. Jacques Charrier reminds me just how mediocre he was as an actor, with the constant little laugh and the naked eyes.
