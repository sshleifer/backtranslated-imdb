While some of the things in Haggard are stupid and unnecessary, the overall package is good. <br /> <br /> Haggard follows Ryan Dunn and his friends Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo) who are trying to win back the Glauren (Jenn Rivell), Ryan's ex. The story is followed and developed surprisingly well, it is not surprising and becomes an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam, although it has a side story that does not hurt the main story. <br /> <br /> And for all Bam fan boys (and girls) there are several sequences of Bam skateboarding, perhaps the weakest aspect of the movie. Phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances, even Don Vito has a larger (but meaningless) roll. <br /> <br /> If you hope to watch a comedy and escape the madness of the Boom, stay away from this movie or enjoy the time you spend with it if you can find it. There are some really fun scenes in this movie.
