I have never really been sure if I liked this documentary or not. It was shown on Channel 4 before a cut version of Revelations, and is on the Revelation video tape before the unknown show. The documentary is basically friends of Bill who said how big he was for an hour with video clips of the show mixed in, a bit like a trailer for the movie you are watching. It also includes David Letterman groveling as a worm for dumping Bill from his show before he died, the reason? Bill made a joke about how Pro-Life people should get burials, and Letterman had pro-life advertising. Look at the video anyway, as Revelations is Bill on his ranting best :)
