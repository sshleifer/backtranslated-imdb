Cocky medical students play chicken with a process that simulates death in an attempt to get a (hopefully temporary) view of the afterlife. Certain plot twists and themes are a bit off the mark, and the play sometimes goes over the top. But the underlying message - about the forgiveness of God and others for our real or perceived sins - is positive and unique in the cinema, and the cast is very good. The last sequence between Julia Roberts and her father is so effectively done that, years after seeing it, I still get chills. Highly recommended.
