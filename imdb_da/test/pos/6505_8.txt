Scratch is a documentary about DJs and their art to dress. From the one line description of the movie, you have no idea how entertaining and educational this little movie is. It is a joyous and vibrant celebration of a cool subculture that is a little known. It's filled with great underground hip hop music, and you'll see some top DJs (such as DJ Q-Bert, DJ Shadow and Mix Master Mike from Beastie Boys) showing their stuff. Going into the movie I was not sure that "scratches" can really be called an art form, or that the disc can be seen as an instrument in itself. Scratching completely changed my mind on these points. What these guys do with their turntables is really amazing - it's certainly a kind of art and turntable if you know how to use it, can be transformed into an instrument you can "play" just as much as a drum or guitar. And you even get a lesson on the basics of scratching DJ Q-Bert (eg how to use the father to get different sound effects). All these DJs in their own way were inspired to start scraping after seeing Herbie Hancock performing his song "Rock It" (you remember that song, not you?) Living at Grammys. What got their attention was not Hancock himself, but his DJ and his scratches. Not only is Scratch scratching, but it does something "scratched" by itself thanks to the creative way this documentary is shot and edited. There are moments when clipping quickly "rewound" and then "forwarding" several times, reflecting (in the movie medium) what happens when a DJ quickly moves the plate on his turntable back and forth while using his father (to "wick" - wicka-wicka "sound". Whether you are a fan of hip hop or not, you can count on Scratch to give you a very enjoyable night at the cinema. After seeing it, I got an itch to buy a separate disc. And I mean this as a compliment.
