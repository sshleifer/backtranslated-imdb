This movie is wonderful! I can see it again and again. Robin hood is perfectly molded and marian is beautiful. Personally, I think Marian's German husband is the funniest character, along with Latrine and Sheriff! While roombeds became dull and stupid after a while, this always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great movie and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles and it is perfected and gives so much meaning and can be seen again and again! You will love this movie if you only see it, except if you hate comedy or don't think Robin Hood should be manipulated. But this old story gets boring and this movie gives it a great new taste!
