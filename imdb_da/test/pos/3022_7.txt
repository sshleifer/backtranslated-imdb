Once you've seen enough movies, there is very little that doesn't remind you of other movies. Nevertheless, this was a clear if somewhat disturbing movie. I had to interrupt it from time to time and come back to it later. Like "Silence of the Lambs", it is the search for a serial killer who has abducted someone and has restricted her to her chamber of horror. As "Flatliners", the protagonist examines a dream world through an experimental procedure. The dream sequences' surrealism is what makes this movie, as one finds the characters in a situation and a landscape where literally everything can happen. And beyond this continuity and "reason" is not necessary, which also makes it a movie maker's dream. The only thing that seems a little bit away is that one ultimately hopes to redeem the serial killer or his demon's exorcism. You actually feel sympathy for the little boy inside the man, but obviously the innocence of the boy cannot be separated from man's terrible deeds. The focus swings as it should from saving the man to save his victim.
