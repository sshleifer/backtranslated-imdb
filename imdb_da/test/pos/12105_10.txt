It's a very big movie (documentary) about Istanbul and their people, and it's music of every kind. The editing and success of the director is very impressive. I have been interested in Faith Akin since I saw "Gegen die Wand" ("Duvar KarsÄ±"), and I admired his work a lot, but this one has been the most touching for me, so I write here. It's not just about Turks or something, it's a very good biography of a city and how the music comes alive in what we can say. There are many people and so many different ideas about even life and love. I liked it very much and it was something everyone and everyone should see it, NOT ONLY, but especially those that were still related to Turkey ...
