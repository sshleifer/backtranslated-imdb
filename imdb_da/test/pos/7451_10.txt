Now that you've seen The Advent Children twice, the story is not as low as the majority have criticized it to be in my opinion. If you haven't played FFVII or don't like it for whatever reason, this movie is probably not for you. Being familiar with the original story is a prerequisite for fully understanding AC, otherwise you will just see the greatest CG animation in your life so far. <br /> <br /> Without destroying the story, I have to admit that after watching AC we have put together pieces with my friends based on our knowledge of FFVII. To see the second time allowed to actually pay attention to the story more and most of the questions we might have had were answered. Some were not. The AC is ready for FFVII players / fans and honestly doesn't try to be anything else. There is little to no realism in the outside FFVII world that serves the purpose. Music is mostly reconstructed FFVII themes with a heavier touch (TBM teams according to end credits) and works well with the eye so without exception. I found the music to increase the experience of the visual fireworks in all situations. <br /> <br /> We all know that you can't put a FFVII in 1.5 hours and keep in mind that the story actually offered me more than I expected. There are two issues at hand in FFVII: AC, and both stories were packed very smoothly between the action sequences. And trust me when I say there is a lot of it. Action it is. I changed my voice from 9 to 10 after seeing it the second time because I had missed some explanatory sequences I couldn't put together for the first time giving some answers. As a warning, it will be easy to ignore the story and concentrate on graphics, but try not to judge the Adevent children because of it. If you don't let the story in, it's no wonder it seems sloppy. I'm not going to praise the picture because I suppose we all know they are amazing, which can be an understatement. In particular, characters speak so much more with their facial expressions than ever before. I hope you keep an eye on the story because it actually makes sense and works well with everything. Get ready for driving in your life, there are no breaks.
