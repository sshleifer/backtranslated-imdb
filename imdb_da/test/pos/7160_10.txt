I agree with the other 9 and 10 star reviews. I saw this at the South By Southwest Film Festival in Austin. Of the 20 movies I saw, 7 were really good, and that was the best for me. I am a sucker for movies that have plot units where characters go through transformations that completely change their lives. The excellent play was mostly done by people involved in television, or it was their first movie. It was written and directed by Jay Floyd. This was his debut as director. Jay's day job is apparently like a clearing administrator for many famous films. Forgiveness of Franklin's was a total joy and extremely fun in spots. This is a movie where I wanted to buy the DVD and watch it again, really a great complement from me. Well done, Jay, yes ... give up your day job!
