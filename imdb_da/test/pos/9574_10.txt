This is the funniest movie I've ever seen. However, I have been laughing hard at lots of movies. This is because Best In Show brilliance is not in slapstick or one-liners, but in sophisticated and layered verbal white. The impromptu dialogue is so quick that you end up not laughing at every joke, but only until more jokes build on each other, each disarms your senses until the jokes climax and you can't help loosen. <br /> <br /> It's a well-shot movie, but what makes it extraordinary is the play. I was impressed with my first impression, but when I saw it after learning that almost all scenes were improvised, I was amazed at it. It was thoroughly comfortable to see the comedians work from each other, building jokes out of nothing and immersing themselves in their characters. I imagine the golden day in Second City was like that.
