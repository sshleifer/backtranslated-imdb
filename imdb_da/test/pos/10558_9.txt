This is a fun, intelligent and somehow realistic comedy about a 14-year-old trying to live his first love while on vacation, and also about the complex, sometimes entertaining, sometimes touching, relationship between a divorced father and her growing daughter ... and how far a woman (not just Nicole, teenager) can go to get the man she loves! I laughed a lot with this lively scenario that never pulls.
