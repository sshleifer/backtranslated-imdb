Felix looks at an actor practicing his lines: "A ham, a ham! My kingdom for a ham sandwich !!!" The dramatic guy who tells Felix must "sacrifice my art and go into the movies." He's in tears. Felix just looks at him as if he is nuts and pushes his shoulders. The old guy tells Felix to "go out" and find money to fund a trip to Hollywood. Felix believes: "How does he expect me to get the money?" In minutes, of course (this is a cartoon), he tracks a shoe owner who puts a "bankrupt" sale at his store. Felix comes with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat $ 500 if it works. <br /> <br /> It does, but the man wants to go alone and leave Felix at home. In a monstrous scene, Felix turns into a folder and that's how he comes to Hollywood and turns into the cat when they get there. <br /> <br /> We are so witness to Felix's attempt to enter the show business. His audition scene is very fun, especially with his imitation of Charlie Chaplin. In addition, there are caricatures of some famous silent movie stars and leaders. All in all, some material is in this 9.5 minute cartoon. It is amazing how much more you can get in an extra 2.5 minutes, provided most animated shorts are seven minutes in length. <br /> <br /> At least there was a lot of fun here and more zany things you could only see in a comic book that Felix has a sword duel with giant mosquitoes! Crazy stuff.
