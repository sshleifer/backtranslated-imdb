I honestly can't believe this movie is not rated much higher. Claude Chabrol could be described as something like a French Alfred Hitchcock, and while this film is only the second of his that I have seen (the first one is Le Boucher), I can already see that this guy is something special on strength of these two films. The film is a French and Canadian co-production and takes place in Canada. The casting consists of British and Canadian stars, and the high quality celebrities are great with the rest of the film; most of which are also of high quality. The movie is a murder mystery and begins when a young girl covered in blood is brought into a police station. Having been questioned by Inspector Carella, it appears that the young girl, Patricia, and her sister Muriel were attacked by a man who killed the sister and only made Patricia flee. But as the survey goes on, Patricia goes back to the station to provide new evidence, revealing a much more shocking identity to the killer. The performance in this movie is excellent. Donald Sutherland is subdued as usual, but he fits the role he has given here very well, and I would not hesitate to mention his performance in blood related as one of his very best. The film also features supportive turns from the British stars Donald Pleasance and David Hemmings, both of whom provide good twists; Particular joy that shows how great an actor he can be and highlights what a shame it is that he continued to waste in Halloween movies. The unknown Aude Landry also gives a great performance in her role as Patricia. The movie is very mysterious for the first hour and keeps the audience connected. When Inspector Carella discovers Muriel's diary, the movie becomes more of a drama where the girl's last actions appear; and while this part of the movie is not as good as what went before it, it is still interesting and leads to a good twist in the end! All in all, blood parents are a great movie that really deserves to be seen better. Le Boucher is a better known bet from Chabrol, but for my money it is at least as good! Recommended view.
