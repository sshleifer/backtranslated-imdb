It is rare that I get the opportunity to go through a movie for IMDb that relates to my own life in such a close way. But as someone who lives with cerebral palsy (albeit less seriously than Michael, one of the main characters in the movie), I don't want to give this movie a 'free pass' just because it tackles a topic that rarely approaches; And when it is, it is usually treated with serious severity. There were minor issues I had with the movie; and I want to address them first so people are aware that it's not my situation that has overshadowed my rating of this overall excellent movie! <br /> <br /> * Parts of what I felt were extremely scary at the expense of realism. If I had a pound every time a well-intentioned public member mentioned electric wheelchairs to me, I'd be much the richer man; But speaking in person, it fits more into the public perception of how we handle our disadvantages, rather than the reality of what actually happens. The same thing about spending time watching disabled people go to the pub - it's not a big thing for us who actually do it, as much as it can be admirable for outsiders. I appreciate that this is from it formerly protected perspective of Michael; but I still think he would concentrate more on enjoying the experience, rather than reflecting on what was a big thing that he actually was there, first. As such, the amount of time we spend watching them is fun feeling a little too much. <br /> <br /> * I felt that the terminal nature of Rory's disease was brought to the attention of late; which means that it was just used as a cheap sentimental device to come between the couple, rather than something that everyone knew all the time, had to be solved. To balance these criticisms, I must dish out a praise of praise as well. Although I thought some scenes showed them to take on normal life, a touch was exaggerated; The script also ventured into some difficult places I wouldn't have expected, and comes out with a lot of credit to do so. Eg. Travel the issue of love and relationships; and shows the daily apparatus often used to help and help the lives of non-people. Although death has come across the dumb emotional shock tactic, the movie as a whole is far less juicy than anyone has the right to expect these types of movies to be. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker can and has made variations of her role capaciously on autopilot for what looks like years; But Robertson and McAvoy share a special interaction to be noted. Inside, I do bodywork that a group of people somewhere has finally made a movie that makes justice to the lifeblood of many disabled people.
