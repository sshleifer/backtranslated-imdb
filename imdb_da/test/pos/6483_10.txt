I think it's the kind of movie you either love or hate, and I'm really not the type to go for artistic films. My mother rented "mullhuland DR" the second night and I almost ran out of the room, ha. But I love this movie. <br /> <br /> We recorded "The Beat" one night when we had just let the tape run and got a great movie that way by accident. Saved it tape and so much on it. I finally got VHS to add to my collection. I have seen it many times and at one point copied the poems. I even tried to preform a scene to my high school drama class. She had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words. She refused to let me do that. If it could interfere with my drama learning so much, it must be good :) Honestly, she never treated me the same after that. <br /> <br /> I liked the play it came out very right and honestly. It wasn't clean and polished, but it was better than that. It was true for life how someone would really behave and show emotions, not how Hollywood does. It was great, especially with the one who played Rex. <br /> <br /> The story was original. Not only are the characters drawn into their world, but you do too. Not your typical person meets inner city children and saves them through knowledge films at all. Just care and friendship make things better. <br /> <br /> The only thing is that even in the 80s, there was more arson and less simple things like rock throwing, but the little innocence didn't hurt movies. <br /> <br /> I think it's a must see. You will either love or hate it, but it does it in some way and it makes a good movie that you will remember and talk about later.
