A lovely story of two evacuates, has become a good little movie, by the BBC. Most children who like a good story will enjoy this. The characters are played very well by a very good cast. Not sure if our American friends will appreciate it, but they get a mention when Aunty Lou runs off with a beautiful American soldier.
