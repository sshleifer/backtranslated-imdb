I loved this movie and I see it every day. I think even though the play isn't that big, it's really just a bunch of guys having fun with a script. I had been watching this movie for almost a year, and when I found it for thirty dollars, I just had to get it. It is by far my favorite movie all the time. It deals with proportionality and at the same time makes a joke of it. I loved every part with Don Vito, especially the one where Valo asks him for a grape when they sit on the porch, and he tells him to eat one that rolls down on the porch. It really portrays him as he really is. The part of "Making Of" really raised me as they dealt with Brandon Novak's addiction to heroin and how much his friends and family were trying to help him. A new movie that is being made, called "Dreamseller", is in production, which is about the story of Novak's dreams, shattered by his addiction.
