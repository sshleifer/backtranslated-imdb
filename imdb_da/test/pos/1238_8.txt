(WARNING - CONTAINS MILD SPOILER) A movie that is almost designed to pause and check your memory - it is limited to an almost empty motel where the large patio looks like a circus ring and the rooms resemble temporary retreats rather than tilflugter; As the characters become more and more preoccupied with the past, the present still falls away until the Countess's ultimate fire appearance in the black Mercedes marks the fusion of reality and imagination. Whether their stories are true and whether Stanton is really the father or just a crazy old man stepping into their stories, it seems impossible to decide. The theme seems to be how love for an extreme and unnoticed nature crushes with stability to the point where reality breaks down; where exotic, misplaced imagination becomes dangerously tangible. The image of the burning motel - a symbol of dislocation afflicted with destruction - is an appropriate strange end to this strange but effective, sincere, imaginative film.
