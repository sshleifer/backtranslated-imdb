This movie is a good movie. The film shows so many themes all in one amazing movie. Driving lessons center around Ben (Rupert Grint) a shy 17 year old who comes to age. The film continues with how Ben is sick of his dominant mother and how he just wants to be himself. Ben then meets Evie, with whom he makes a very special band. The two take a trip, and in the process Ben finds himself and what relationship he and Evie share. This is the movie you see yourself or with another. Either way, you will all feel what Ben is going through in the movie. It's a very heart-warming movie that just makes you think about whether your driving lessons were ever so emotional or as much of a journey as Ben's Lessons.
