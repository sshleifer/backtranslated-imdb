I was a Marine at Camp Pendleton when D.I. came out (1st Marine Division, 11th Marine Regiment, 3rd Battalion, I-Battery). I still remember keeping in line with a bunch of other marines to watch the movie at the "Star" Theater in Oceanside, California. <br /> <br /> We didn't expect the movie to portray everything we saw in boot camp but we were all pleasantly surprised at how good it was with the movie. The idea of ​​using real marines in the film was a good idea (I also think they were all real exercise instructors). As good as an actor like Jack Webb was, he just couldn't "call cadence" as a real Marine Drill Instructor. <br /> <br /> We all got a laugh when "problem" the recruiter's mother came to boot camp to talk to the captain. Never in a million years would this have happened, but it is Hollywood, and we do not let that episode keep us from enjoying the movie. I went through boot camp at MCRD in San Diego during the summer of 1956, and at that time there were virtually no limits to what the DIs could do for you. The "Ribbon Creek" event at Parris Island had not yet hit boot camp, at least not at MCRD - San Diego. <br /> <br /> I agree with what many of the other reviewers have commented on Sgt. Moore's "stiffness" around her girl friend. I think this was only Webb's play, and even though they might have deleted this part of the movie, it didn't really shoot the production so much. A minor note, the character (uncredited) of "Pvt. Rodriguez" was played by one of my drill instructors, Sgt. Peter J. O'Neill. Sgt. O'Neill used to tell us that someday he would be an actor. We laughed secretly at this, but he surprised us all. He was a great drill instructor, and I thought he did well in his part. Also, he really enjoys throwing knives. He often showed his ability to us that summer in boot camp. I have often wondered if he is still alive.
