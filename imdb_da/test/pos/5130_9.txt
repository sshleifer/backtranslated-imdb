Hoot is a nice ordinary movie with a simple message. It was like this movie was for small children, but I know that adults will like this movie. The story is pretty simple. A child who moved to Florida will help a football jerk and an outcast saving owl from the construction of a pancake house. The message in this movie is great especially for animal activists and lovers. The message is about doing everything to save endangered animals. The action in this movie is decent. All three children looked as if they had good chemistry. The music is not too shabby. I liked Jimmy Buffet songs in this movie. All in all, it's a good family movie. I rate this movie a 9/10.
