Is it a perfect movie? No. It is a weird adaptation from a sci-fi book and it contains vampires from space, naked beauties, and the effectiveness of the British army. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this movie, I was pretty young and all I can remember is the sense of awe for the movie and Mathilda May. In fact, if it wasn't for this beautiful lady to be naked the whole movie, I probably wouldn't have judged it so loudly, but considering her beautiful glory, I'm actually considering voting it! <br /> <br /> Lucky for me I was reminded of the movie and saw it again now. Imagine the Raiders of the Lost Ark or Poltergeist special effects splattered into a pretty decent sci-fi story, but with absolutely the best performances. I still enjoyed the movie immensely (as well as Mathilda May), but it was a mixture of nostalgia, compared to the crap films they make today and actually want more when it ended. <p> <p> Bottom line: if you are a sci-fi fan, don't miss this movie. Oh, and I mention Mathilda May is young, pretty and naked?
