This film set the standard for African American film quality when it was made. I heard about various stories on the movie over time that there was a push for an Oscar nomination when it was released. This movie plays on different emotions and you feel completely safe for all the characters. Well, some of the actors are a small tree, but fortunately these parts are not essential. The music is sensational, and if you don't think the ending is a tear, you have no heart in your chest. If you see "Cooley High", you will see that many, many movies have copied various elements from it to enhance their own films. The biggest example of this is "Boyz N The Hood".
