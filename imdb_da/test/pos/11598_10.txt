When I watch this movie, I also get excited when I see bed scenes of the miss world. She has a beautiful and charming body. When cute lady makes bed scenes and show her fully naked body ... I think man has hard to resist .... I think it's time for sweet girls who hishita bhatt also do naked scenes. At least no one wants to c naked body of ugly women like Seema biswas to c in the bandit queen. I agree with what mallicka.b has said. The film is portrayed in a way that appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. Feelings are not conveyed correctly. I think a few not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. In my opinion, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes she looks a little funny, which is not ultimately what the film should have portrayed. I also noticed a little overpowering in some of her scenes. I'm a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) Can't help it; sorry. 'Raincoat' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not at all impressed
