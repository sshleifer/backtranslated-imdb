Charlie's Wilson's War demonstrates with deep truth just how useless wars can be, especially to the very people who use countless hours and finances to fund them. Virtuos performances and remarkably memorable characters along with a monstrous sarcastic script catapult movie, hell of the continuously unpredictable Mike Nichols, to the top of the year's best. Politics has never been so much fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a Texas congressman who is credited with almost one winning the Cold War. He is associated with lots of drugs, women and Scottish. He also takes an unexpected interest in the events in Afghanistan and the fear of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Using Gust Avrakoto's (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a cursed mission candidate from the CIA and Joanne (Julia Roberts), a wealthy socialite, he raises money to provide Afghanistan with rocket launchers and anti-tank weapons that they need to cause serious damage to the Russian military. At the end of the late 80s, the Cold War would come to an end, and the funds would be cut immediately, thus eliminating all the help of the widespread country to rebuild and rain. <br /> <br /> The action is exquisite, although it can be expected from the more than obtained cast. However, much of it should be attributed to the script, which allows each character to be inconceivably well-developed and memorable. And a cordial help from this credit goes to the novel of the same name, which is hilariously honest. Tom Hanks provides yet another unparalleled performance like Charlie Wilson, the man who did so much for so many and still relatively unknown. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Gust, a character who is living boffo in both his physical and his wry cynicism; The infinite Hoffman shows once again excellent commands in the characters he portrays. Julia Roberts is perhaps the only weak link in the movie, with its generic snobbish character and non-subtle enough accent. And then there's Wilson's "jailbait" squad of young secretaries scampering to keep him happy. Led by the always lovely Amy Adams, each supporting role has its joyful moments. Defeating the Soviet Union was not an easy task, especially in view of the many conflicting goals between the various political leaders. "Why does Congress say one thing and do nothing?" asks a dissatisfied politician. "Tradition mostly", Wilson returns. Everyone seems to have ended the cold war, but a blind eye is turned to the atrocities that are taking place in Afghanistan. It takes a trip to the war-torn refugee camps in Pakistan to motivate Wilson, as well as his biggest economic source, Doc Long (Ned Beatty). Wilson uses strategic ties with committees to raise arms finance in Afghanistan from $ 5 million to $ 10 million with a simple command, but Pakistan's president blames the idea of ​​winning a war for such a trivial amount. At the end of the Wilson campaign, $ 1 billion is being sent. Dollar to Mujahedin to shoot down Russian helicopters - the first step toward victory predicted by Wilson. Apart from the film's reach, unresolved turmoil in Afghanistan led to further, less eerie problems, which Wilson suggested. <br /> <br /> During Charlie Wilson's war, the main characters from the US travel to Pakistan to Afghanistan to Jerusalem to Egypt, but anywhere they go, sarcasm always follows. There is a surprising amount of comedies in the movie, considering the political undertones are generally serious. Hoffman gives jokes with almost every dialogue exchange, like Hanks, with his naturally witty, woman-seeking ideals. A scene early on that gust is continually being ushered out of Wilson's office as he tries to correct a legal problem with his pose of beautiful gals ("you can teach them to write, but you can't teach them to grow breasts") reminds me of a slapstick routine from Marx Brothers. <br /> <br /> With the press focused on the drug claims against Wilson instead of the important issues of the Cold War and the conflicting desire officials to budget their help, it is clear that the politicians at the end of the movie are still unaware of what is really necessary. And since the manuscript is so quick and wise, some audiences may not be able to keep an eye on all the dialogue intensive events. But, as the politicians are unaware of the difference between Pakistan and Afghanistan, it is essentially another argument in support of Charlie Wilson's point. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie
