One of the most unfairly maligned programs at all times, "Terry & June" was also one of the most popular sitcoms in the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> It started life as 'Happy Ever After' but when Eric Merriman decided he didn't want to write any more, it changed that, and thus the fall of Aunt Lucy and Fletcher became Medford's. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was cozy, homely, middle class stuff; The plotters ran the lead from clich√©s from the chief to dinner, the president arranged a jumble sale, and unwanted relatives are going to stay on the weekend. It certainly wasn't "terribly lazy comedy". Because it wasn't "wise," it wasn't supposed to be. It was fun and well done and it was enough! <br /> <br /> I also loved the 'alternative' boom of the '80s (' Spitting Image ',' Black Adder ',' The Young Ones', etc.), but also had conventional things like this. If nothing else, it provided alternative comedy with something to be an alternative to. I found it boring, but then like Ben Elton received both this and Benny Hill. Well, family-oriented comedy has anything but disappeared from our screens, but where has it left us? Look at the latest T.V. forms. All soap and reality dross. The few comedies left are aimed at teens, meaning they are jams filled with swords, body functions jokes and explicit sexual references. And they are not extremely funny either. <br /> <br /> The alternative comedy boom was good in many ways, but had a dark side. It made conventional sitcoms seem old-fashioned, drove away talented writers and artists like Spike Milligan, and ultimately led to such invisible drifting as 'Little Britain' and 'Tittybangbang' (heaven helping us). If it is not broken, do not correct it!
