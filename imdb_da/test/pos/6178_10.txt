Center on Czech WW2 pilots ?? the older Frantisek, the boyish impulsive Karel and in the background the quiet piano player Honza. As the film opens, it is 1950, the war is over, and Frantisek and Honza are imprisoned in a former monastery. In their now Soviet-controlled homeland, they are the 'enemy of the people'. Honza is seriously mistreated by her communist compatriots and dies. In 1939, many pilots succeeded in escaping German-occupied Europe and coming to England where they joined the RAF. Despite their high motivation and experience, they face RAF reluctance and British rigid upper lip. Finally, they are vigorously fighting in the Battle of Britain. But Frantisek and Karel find their friendship hard tested when they both fall for the same woman. <br /> <br /> In terms of romantic subplot, this is very much like Hollywood production Pearl Harbor. But in light of the film and Frantisek's eventual fate, it is also possible to read the English woman's treatment of the two men as symbolic of the British treatment of the Czech and Polish RAF pilots. It is convenient to forget about them when the war is over. br /> <br /> In addition, the film is much smaller clich√© than Pearl Harbor, and the figures are more fully realized. Dark Blue World also scores against its amazing antenna dog fights, seamlessly created using a mix of models, actual live action aerial films and exits from the 1969 epic The Battle of Britain. <br /> In short, Dark Blue World is a well-crafted, moving, thought-provoking and exciting drama that puts Pearl Harbor to shame. Highly recommended.
