Oz is one of the most insane and addictive television experiences ever. <br /> <br /> After catching pieces of this on SBS, I was first skeptical, but now I have finished the 4th season, I unfortunately know that this brilliant show is nearing its end, (6 seasons), and yet I still can't get enough of OZ. <br /> <br /> Want something that will push your senses and your stomach to the limit ... Oz suits the bill, hands down. <br /> <br /> This is not the child's thing, the people's violent, brutal and not beautiful. Why is it an experimental unit within a maximum security prison. <br /> <br /> Tom Fontana's Oz is brilliant in all the right departments, actors, writing and steering. <br /> <br /> HBO's Oz site is also highly recommended for beginners for information on this series. This was the first hour show produced by HBO and it shows what a masterpiece it is and that others will follow. <br /> <br /> Thanks HBO
