OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it (typically Malibu Barbie), but the rest of the actors are just good! I watched the movie last night, and it kept me through the whole movie. Chad Michael Murray is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he is just an Ace player. Total hero man. The maid, who is the sister of nick (chad), is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different with movies out these days, most of them go with psychopath, possessions, ghosts, but here you have a theme about waxing! I totally got creepers out of the wax models in the house, even though they looked so real. I still don't have the story of the twins at the moment, I'm just waiting to get the DVD to see it all over again. Thumbs up for such a big movie! 11/10. All the people who do not like it do not bother 2 criticize my opinion as most of the time it seems cool to do so. I also think the Paris scene when she strips her underwear is quite inconvenient. Why not just get a dog to shag some cat .. be more entertaining then. When the Paris death scene came up, I thought it was poor when she was still running, even though a knife just went up on her foot. Hmm .. interesting. <br /> <br /> CHAD ALL THE WAY!
