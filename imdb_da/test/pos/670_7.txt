Ida Lupino is caught in her own home by crazy Robert Ryan in "Beware, My Lovely", a 1952 RKO movie. Lupino and Ryan made three films together and worked well as a team that was both accomplished professionals and strong artists. In this movie, based on a Broadway game called "The Man", Lupino is a widow of World War II renting a room in his home. She is very active and well-liked in her community, and although her husband has been dead for two years, she is not ready to move on. The man renting her room goes on holiday, and Lupino hires Robert Ryan to help her with an abundant cleaning in the house. He is kind enough to start, but later terrorizes her, locks her in the house and does not allow her to answer the phone or door as he becomes violent and more in touch with reality. <br /> <br /> Character played by Ryan appears at the beginning of the movie that runs away when he discovers a dead body in another house he works in. It's not clear if he's the killer or not, as he seems surprised to see the body. He may be a split personality who, when his personality becomes ugly against Lupino, does not seem to mind his activities when he comes out of it. He does not know that he has the keys to Lupino's house in his pocket and does not know why he has tickets for a party that he bought from toddlers who came to the door. "Beware, My Lovely" is a very exciting movie, and the two leaders give great performances. The excitement builds to a very high level and ends in a way you don't expect.
