I am a Petty Officer 1st Class (E-6) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were far fetched. The most distant was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) went inside the sinking vessel to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room ... it would never happen. Swimmers must not enter any vessel regardless of the circumstances. Second, the Command Center (supposedly in Kodiak), it looked more like a NASA command center ... we don't have any hi-tech equipment. Thirdly, the captain of the exhaust will not run search and rescue cases like 10 people on the clock. In fact, it would be an E-6 or E-7 as a SAR Controller and maybe 2 other support staff such as an Assistant SAR Controller & a Radio Watchstander. Otherwise, the movie was dead, I think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in CG and their roles in search and rescue instead of just Aviation-based rates. Some of the scenes from the "A" school reminded me of my days, those and the stupid things I did and got into trouble in my younger days.
