Hey, it's just TV. Sure, it's STAR TREK, the most beloved blah blah, and it's a great one, but it's all relative. What it boils down to is a guy in eleven ears who grooves with a swatch of pizza-colored shag carpet. There is a kind of THIRD MAN noirishness for tunnel hunting, and it's frightening than many episodes of what's after all one of the better TV shows. The excitement is actually exciting. Dad feels really dangerous. As a young child, I think I was crying when Spock told me that this hideous creature was so sad, scared and horrified as the people who ate. This was one of my early lessons in empathy, a lesson enhanced by the EMPATH episode, which was, if less exciting, even more melancholy. What troubled me when I was five was that this thing, which looks like meat and tomato barf, somehow actually consists more or less of rock. Now, that kind of choice may seem visionary, a hippie designer's idea of ​​transparent-glass-one-universism, but it can just sneak off the fabric age.
