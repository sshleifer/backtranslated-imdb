You've got to watch this movie ... I saw it as 13 years old at the theater, on my very first date ... Fast forward for 20 years and I'm now gay (Many thanks One Dark Night !! LOL!). This movie shot in hell out of me like a child (mausoleum still does!), But as an adult, the excitement of this movie is not in history, but rather the hysterical grin it holds ... Highlights listening to naming teens call each other, from "nerdlebrain" (my personal favorite) for "turkey". Also keep your eyes peeled to the scene where Carol (the blonde, sister) is trying to hang her phone up on a soda (can't believe they don't transform it!) ... Other highlights include Adam West too much dramatic eruptions and gooey bodies. If you are a fan of real horror, I would suggest this movie just because it to me is almost a parody of horror. There are def. a creepy factor, and the plot is a good one, but don't look at it if you want to be afraid of your wits (unless you are like 10 years old or something).
