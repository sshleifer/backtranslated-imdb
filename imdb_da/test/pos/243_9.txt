A great musical lead role Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. He owns a nightclub where she dances. She's not a star yet, but she gets a big break when she is chosen as a maid to Vanity, whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother. When he sees the similarity, he immediately chooses her for a competition his magic runs. Hayworth's novice fame works primarily at Kelly's club, but her star is rising so fast and so high that his grip on her begins to fall. This is not the most original of land, but the two leads really make it work. It also helps that the manuscript is fantastic. Kelly is not yet at its peak, especially his top actress. His dance, however, wow. Hayworth is the star, but Kelly claims the movie's most memorable moment as he dances passionately with his own reflection. It is of course a start of Fred Astaire's shooting dance in Swing Time, but I think Kelly en-ups it, which is hardly credible. In fact, this has to be the most amazing dance sequence in movie history, perhaps saving the final of an American in Paris several years later. The rest of the songs are also excellent and the songs are even better. Still, Rita doesn't sing her own songs (well, she can get a couple of them, as her song's voice seemed to be different sometimes). Her dance is wonderful, like the rest of her plays. It's hard not to love her in anything. She is truly one of the few truly beautiful women of the classic era. Not plastic like many of them; No, you can really see the warmth of that woman. Her smile is so disarming. Phil Silvers has the role of Kelly's best friend and he is also very funny. Kelly-Hayworth-Silver's trio is, of course, the core that became the Kelly-Reynolds-O'Connor trio in Singin 'in the rain eight years afterwards. One of the greatest music tracks in the film seems almost completely pilfered with the "Good Morning" song in Singin '. I think Singin 'in the rain is the better movie, as Cover Girl is a bit rough around the edges. However, this gravity simply adds to the charm. There are aspects of this movie that hit Singin 'in the rain, and even an American in Paris. For example, the central relationship is more emotionally involved. Instead of the dominant older man chasing the little girl (Leslie Caron and Debbie Reynolds were only teenagers), we have a very nice relationship with two people who look more like equals. There is no hunting around - an aspect that unfortunately makes many of the best musicals a little sour you must admit. Kelly and Hayworth are a couple from the start and when it starts to break, I really felt it. 10.9.
