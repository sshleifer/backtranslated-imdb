Honestly, I loved Michael. Although there was "give me a pillow, I must take a nap" parts, it was cool. I think everyone did a good job in this movie. and nora ephron is in my "ok" list of directors. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see John Travolta as a pot belt angel. It's not so often I see one in a movie. some people can call this a boring movie, but for me I loved it. angels and everyone.
