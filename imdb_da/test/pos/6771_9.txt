Not sure how I stumbled upon this movie, but I'm so glad I did. We were initially discouraged by the fact that it was subtitled, but even my dyslexic brother who hates reading (especially on the weekend) enjoyed this movie. I found the script fantastic and the way it was delivered in such a dead-pan way only added to sausage piles on my sofa. Not sure whether it is so much fun for the native Danish as the comedy seems to be enhanced by the subtitle's tonelessness and the ambiguity of the translation. I have not seen many Danish films (or anything for that matter), but judging by this film I guess they are not limited by the same political correctness as elsewhere (gifts blessed them), which makes Eigel's character a Breathe fresh air because let's see the special need is fun. There are so many beautiful one-liners in this movie that puts American sitcoms to shame.
