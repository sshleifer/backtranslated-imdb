I really liked this movie. If other people want to give it an average of about 5.0 / 10, it's their choice. I would give it 10/10. Sutherland's performance as a private eye is absolutely fantastic. The story is fantastic, human, exciting, intelligent. The dialogue is good. The story may not be perfect, but still - the mood of the movie is good enough to compensate for it. Furthermore, the end is incredibly cool and their jigsaw puzzles really come back to each other. So anyway, I liked it. I also thought that the female actress performed very well. I'm not a big fan of detective films, but one was really good, also because it doesn't give a prejudice about conventions of the supernatural.
