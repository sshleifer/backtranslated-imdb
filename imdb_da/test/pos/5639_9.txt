Okay, so I'm a sucker for a good documentary, especially where it tells a modern Don Quixote story. One warning: I met Mark Borchardt in the winter of 1995/96 while still working on the Coven. But I save that story for later. American Movie, which began to produce not long after, accurately portrays the person I knew, even though it was more profound than expected or believed to exist. This is at the same time a very funny and very sad movie, and is brilliantly performed. Mark comes across as his own worse enemy: his childish ambition and optimism - which I admire - is undermined by his apparent artistic awkwardness as well as his bizarre fiscal expectations. But he is also a charismatic guy. His loyal Sancho Panza sidekick is as likeable: loyal if frazzled to the core. Like Don Quixote, American Movie presents an often-ignored inefficient aspect of freedom - that people will be drawn to occupations for which they are not particularly suited, regardless of repeated failure. It's a good movie.
