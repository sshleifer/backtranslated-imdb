It's Christmas time! A birth in terms of rebirth, or at least this one can be hoped for in the Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema does not make a piece of art of this size. This is an absolutely modern film that can also be seen at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. And finally, it is also a great production for Italian standards of the time. In this film, there is a rare balance of various elements, all of which are understandable and comfortable at various levels of refinement. True poetry, real humor, true tenderness, real drama, real beauty. No rhetoric, no easy surrealistic shortcuts, no typical touristic Tornator-like imagery, no overhand action, no director autoreferentialism. There is also a cool use of two heartbreaking Nina Simone songs whose music I reckon on has never been used in a proper way for a score. So if this isn't going to be a real revival for the Italian cinema, it's an extraordinary development for Emanuele Crialese after his 'Respiro' another final beautiful movie. "Nuovomondo" must not be missed, it is the kind of "medicine film" that is useful to enjoy filmmaking, filming, helpful in enjoying and understanding life. Francesco Cabras
