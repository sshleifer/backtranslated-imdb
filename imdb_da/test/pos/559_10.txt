I watched this movie last night on HBO and didn't expect to be hooked - I usually go to sleep when I see HBO. But it happened and you will too. It is a tragic documentary (2002 Oscar Winner) about a murder of an older female tourist in Jacksonville, Florida, and subsequent investigation, arrest and trial of a 15-year-old boy. Watch this movie today and get a feel for how we have evolved as a community. This movie was most deserving of a valued Oscar - you are being moved to tears.
