Bears about so much resemblance to Dean Koontz's novel Jessica Simpson makes a rocket researcher. If you have read the book, I suggest you put it as far out of your mind as possible before watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Watchers are your typical "Boy meets dog, the dog turns out to be super-intelligent government lab experiment, dog and boy pursued by super-intelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by the same lab, and oh yes, I mention the shady government agents who pursue the monster pursuing the dog's movie. <br /> <br /> Corey Haim is the boy, Barbara Williams is his mother, Michael Ironside is one of the evil governments, and Sandy the dog is good , the dog (called Furface here, Einstein in the book.) The monster effects are ridiculous, much of the dialogue is ridiculous, the manuscript rarely makes sense or is credible. The street can write messages on a keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no! Hmm, it must be the puppy's chow, not? Haim's performance is enthusiastic but shook as he performs the stupid dialogue with the smallest man Good skills Ironside has been the highlight of many a bad movie, and that is no exception. He easily gives the film's best performance, even though I am forced to add that the dog (which is a wonderful darn actor himself!) Comes in a second. All in all, it's a horrible stupid movie, and yet. . . And yet I saw it three times within a week. And yet I can't help suffering it. Hi, what can I say I have a taste for junk - and Michael Ironside (not that I've ever tasted Michael Ironside - I'm sure there are laws against it). But any movie that can make me laugh hard (yes, even inadvertently) cannot be all bad. Lime it up for a guilty pleasure, a "yes I know it's offensive stupid, but I like it anyway" movie. It's hard for me to judge this. On a normal scale, I have to give it a D, but on my own personal cheese scale it is encountered up to an A. Yes I know. I'm strange like that.
