This is breezy very entertaining drama with an excellent cast. Garfield is fine as a boxer hiding from the police with the bad crew Dead End Kids. Most notable of these are the beautiful Billy Halop, who has some very moving moments. Gloria Dickson, who in real life died very young in a house fire, is strong and very attractive as Halop's sister, and in the early stages Ann Sheridan, on the brink of stardom, is a groundbreaking one. May Robson is very fun as a crusty old grandmother, but Claude Rains proves that even a great actor can bleed if mis-cast (the one who thought of throwing him like a tough New York policeman?). <br /> <br /> Here, Busby Berkeley proves that he was a fine director with or without music. The film moves at a great pace, and the water tower is very exciting and well-photographed. The ending is constructed and the plot is not spectacular or original, but I still found it a very enjoyable experience.
