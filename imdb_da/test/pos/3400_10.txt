I had always heard of this great mini-series, but seen it for the first time this week, July 2007. I can see why it started career from so many young players. The story is exciting and gives a wonderful insight into the period before and during the civil war. I cared about the signs and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people believed in the 1800s. Many historical facts were thrown into history, and it was interesting to see history books come to life. The costumes and sets were beautiful! I thoroughly enjoyed seeing both I and II. Part III is a disappointment.
