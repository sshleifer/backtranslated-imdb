As I review through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of IMDB have written on this film, I find it very interesting how few "in the middle" are comments. Everyone loves it, or they hate it. After seeing Apocalypse Now approx. 30 times and recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without these magic digital machines ?????), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who has a very special place in my heart for this movie. "Why do you want a movie that is so confusing?" ask many of my employees. The answer is this: Forget the war, forget the brutality .... This is a classic story of society that protects against those who refuse to conform to the status quo. Brando represents the person who has his own way of working. They (Big Brother) sent him out to do the job, he does too well without complying with the accepted "standards" of death and destruction (am I the only one worried about the fact that we have "standards" for death and destruction ????) so they send out "Conformity Police" to eliminate the individual. Hmmmmmm .... Draw any parallels between this and things you see every day? With the deepest respect for Mr Coppola, who I think is one of the best instructors all the time, I think he is exceeding his original intent with the movie, and probably didn't even understand it before the movie was released. The subtle subtitle that permeates the entire movie has far too much to be planned and depicted; instead, it seems to have grown like a wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. Again I must repeat: I think FF Coppola did a reference work on this whole production, like the throw and the crew, but the sum of the film exceeds the individual bet ten times. So if you haven't seen the movie, rent it, see it, then watch it again, and maybe a few times, and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life. Only then make an assessment of the quality of the film. Those of you who have seen it see it again with the mindset previously described. I think you can only get a whole new appreciation for the movie. Or maybe not! Whether you love it or hate it, be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful storytelling style!
