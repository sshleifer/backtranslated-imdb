When Liv Ullman's character says, "I want me to be in someone else's dream, and they will be ashamed when they wake up." She not only refers to being an unwilling player in the war of society, but she refers to being an ignorant participant in life itself. At the end of the movie, when she says she had a dream that she had a baby and she was trying to take care of it, but she forgot something else, the implication is that she forgot what she learned in the war, she Just survived, like her own mother, she will not be able to pass on important lessons to her own child. And therefore the cycle of the shame of ignorance will continue ... ad infinitum ...
