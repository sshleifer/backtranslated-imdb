I have always enjoyed Frank Sinatra's music, and recently I wrote a vacation script about her life story. I have been fascinated by the life and legend of Ol 'Blue Eyes. However, I have never seen any of his films. So I wanted to see if his performance was as great as his song. Well ... it was! I was blown away by his performance in this movie! He really does a tremendous job as restoring heroin abuser Frankie Machine, who tries to put his life together again and audition as a local band drummer. <br /> <br /> Otto Preming's direction is also good. I haven't seen any of his other movies. I read his biography on IMDB. He seems like one of the directors who was very misunderstood and people had opposed him. Seems like the kind of person who appeals most to cult enthusiasts. I haven't seen enough of his movies to know for sure whether he's really brilliant, but now I'm curious. I want to see more of his film because he judges by his attempt at "The Man with the Golden Arm", this guy has talent. I also loved the music for this movie. The score certainly contains the kind of music I will remember if I ever hear it again. This is how you know you have a good score. The supporting performances are also good, including Darren McGavin as the local fabric protector Eleanor Parker as Frankie's wheelchair-based wife and Kim Novak as his lover. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how filmmakers handled the subject of substance abuse, as opposed to modern-day movies like "Trainspotting" and "Requiem for a Dream." Back in 1955, the word "drugs" gave rise to controversy, and if you watch the film, they kept the subject at a very discreet level. There is only one scene where Frankie actually gets heroin injected into his arm, and they showed a close-up of his face's reaction rather than showing the needle graphically poking in his veins. But it delivered its message without feeling the water down. In a powerful drama like this with powerful performances and direction like this, you don't need graphic depictions of drug abuse to keep the audience fascinated. <br /> <br /> "The Man with the Golden Arm" is a dramatic gem that all movie buffers should check out. It really is a great job! <br /> <br /> My score: 8 (out of 10)
