"The devil in the dark" is William Shatner's favorite episode. It is also one of my favorite episodes. The program is pure Star Trek because it deals with one of the series' main themes: respect for other life forms. I don't think you could get a clearer example of one of the show's most interesting ideas. In this episode, Kirk and his crew must confront a monster killing miners on a distant planet. History is an excuse for exploring the right that people should destroy creatures that are an important part of the environment. Today's concerns for environmental reasons make the show more relevant now than ever before. It is extremely well written and done with the gusto of our beloved cast. A memorable sequence implies that Spock joins the monster's mind. Lots of tension between Spock and Kirk (they will solve the problem using different methods) adds the fun. Shatner and Leonard Nimoy are doing some of their best work here.
