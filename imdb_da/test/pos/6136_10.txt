I have been looking for this mini-series for a very long time. I watched this movie when I lived in the back of Russia many years ago. I'm curious if anyone who has the recorded copy of this movie can send me the copy. I am willing to cover all expenses and pay for the extra tapes or DVDs. This is one of the best TV shows I've ever seen. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Israeli history and world history after World War II. I'm also trying to find a book (I've heard it's even better than the movie), but the new one costs about $ 50 on Amazon and I've never bought a used copy. my email address is yurets777@hotmail.com Thank you for your help.
