Jewel Thief is a rare race movie - quite outside in his story, but nothing noir about the presentation. A young man, Vinay, played excellently by a new face, raised Dev Anand aged 40+, divorced from his police officer, and found a job in a jewelry store. Soon, random people come up to him and call him Amar. Using just a few pithy moments, the presence of a "doppelganger" is established. Then a woman Shalini (Vyjayantimala) emerges and claims to be engaged to said doppelganger. She is accompanied by her loving brother (Ashok Kumar) who is so convinced that Vinay is actually Amar, he makes him take off his shoes and prove he is not Aamr, the 6 toed one. The super cute daughter Anju (Tanuja) is absolutely enchanted with Vinay. In the midst of this confusion there is a jewel thief on the loose, and he steals on will. Slowly we learn from Vinay's meeting with a super hot nightclub singer (Helen!) That the thief is Amar the doppelganger. Many many beautiful women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) are after the hero. The police, including Vinay's father, are completely committed. Vinay slowly falls for Shalini / Shalu, and her brother seems to bless the association. The action moves to Sikkim, as Amar is the next hoist. The rest is for you to see - the duplicate, the girls, the men hanging on Vinay's words, thinking that he is their boss Amar, the loving brother's sister duo - nothing works right and it takes the famous storytelling (and direction) by Vijay Anand to finish this story in a very entertaining way. The movie has many moments that you will wonder until they are tastefully woven into a grand finale on a dance in a palace in Sikkim. I wasn't a big Vyjayanthi fan, but she's quite competent here, even on her chubbiest. She is able to add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way, but is best when she is carefree or dancing. Tanuja is sweet as a button and I loved her in this movie. I wished so much for her to get the man. Dev was good Dev. If he didn't go like a man with a congenital shoulder fault (a shoulder always lower than the other one), I would imagine who they had found to imitate him! Yet his style, charm and charisma were incomplete. In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara, only Dev could look cool with a fishing rod attached to a large plastic fish! Ashok Kumar was simply amazing - Dada Moni did not miss a shot all over the film and made it one of history's books. <br /> <br /> SD Burman scattered magic with songs such as Baithe Hain Kya Oske Paas (Helen in a blood red cock imitation dances at a bar top), Aasman Ke Neeche, Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera and my personal favorite seducing number Raat Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diye. <br /> <br /> If you want a great story, with more twists and turns than a seamless one who wants to be kept guessing, but amused and entertained - then buy or rent jewel thieves. Better to buy it so you can go back and see it again with your friends. This is a keeper.
