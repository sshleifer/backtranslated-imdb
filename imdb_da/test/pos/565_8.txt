I saw this on HBO because it won Oscar one week earlier. It compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas. <br /> <br /> The story is of a 15-year-old black child who was brought to trial for Jacksonville, FL, murder of an elderly white woman based almost exclusively on the identification of the victim's husband and a decree by the defense claim was forced. <br /> <br /> About half of the footage is out of court; It is complemented by images of the defense lawyers (two public defenders) explaining their case, interviewing witnesses and visiting key locations. This is edited with a minimum of unnecessary repetition and placed in logical order. The camera's work is quite solid. And there is a mildly surprising epilogue.
