Oh my God, what a story! This movie is very good and it had to be God who had done this! You did a great job. The action was really good, you chose the right actors for sure. This movie is so good I'm really glad you made this because if you didn't, I would never have ever known about this story because I'm not a big golf fan and I think it's a bit boring so thank you. I really enjoyed it and therefore I gave the movie a 10 10. I liked Shia Labouf, he was also perfect for the role of Fransis Quimet. I hope most of the things you put in were true too. Oh, and some parts were fun and others, I was just really happy.
