Not everyone, but most of this story is that Buster is wrong for "Dead Shot Dan", a notorious criminal. <br /> <br /> There is really no story, just a series of adventures to show Busters physical talents that are amazing and his comic timing. The 27-minute movie is basically an adventure after the other, which mainly involves someone chasing our hero. Previously there are a few police officers on their beats running through the streets after Keaton and later it is "Big Joe" Roberts, a rotund cop - and Dad a girl Buster is interested in - chasing him. These latter scenes were the best I thought, with many wise gags involving the hotel lift, where Big Joe and his daughter live. It was Keaton at its best. <br /> <br /> It's just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares? It is Buster at his slapstick best or near it, and it therefore serves its purpose: to entertain us. Just think: 85 years after this movie was made, there are people (like me) still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics! Cool!
