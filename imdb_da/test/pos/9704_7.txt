Like the first, the JACKASS team is back to try to kill themselves with the way they find fit. In addition, it fits you into a tractor deck and rolls down a slope. Or will you be deliberately smashed by a bull. Or something even worse. <br /> <br /> The first one was wild, and that's how you can describe it. It was also very hard-laughing movie. But this one is completely nuts. It has even more dangerous stunts and even harder laughs. So, I think watching stupid idiots getting killed will be the most fun this week. So before BORAT comes out, I'll laugh my A ** out.
