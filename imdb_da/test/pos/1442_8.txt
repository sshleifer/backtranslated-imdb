Great little groundbreaking film (in 1955) on an important subject. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much of Sinatra's performance and was pleasantly surprised by it. Loved Kim Novak! She was beautiful! <br /> <br /> Loved the jazz score by Elmer Bernstein! As big as the Lazlo Schifrin for "Bullitt"! I am very surprised that it does not appear to be available on CD (if anyone knows about the audio track's availability in any other format, they should write it somewhere!). <br /> <br /> Preminger's direction was, as usual, borderline flawless. <br /> <br /> Have not read Nelson Algren's novel or have any idea how faithful the manuscript was to it. The subplot of Frankie as a "hot" card dealer was also a surprise, just as there were a few other things. But look for yourself. It is very worth seeing ...
