We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival and liked it. <br /> <br /> This movie killed in the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The three leading actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are well matched with their roles and are excellent. It was a pleasure to witness the dynamics between the three of them, as it worked properly. <br /> <br /> I think Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we will see much more of her in the coming years. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't take the easy way out. Thumbs up to the Italian team that put this movie together. Highly recommended.
