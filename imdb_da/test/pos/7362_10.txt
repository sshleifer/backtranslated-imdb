Wow! My mother bought me this movie because it was for sale really cheap in some stores in my town and she knows I love scary movies. At first I looked at the cover and sighed and thought it was a regular B movie trying to be scary. I was so wrong! I made the big mistake of seeing it alone, my parents and my brother were sleeping and it was really late. After I watched the movie I was so scared I shook ... I didn't even dare go up and take the video tape out of the VCR! I slept with the lights on ... <br /> <br /> This movie story is about some teenagers driving off the road and staying overnight in the woods and telling scary stories ... The first story is really scary and it gets you to hug a pillow very hard if you see it alone. The other story is also scary, but not the same as the first. The third story (my favorite) is really, really scary. It scared me most of all stories. It's about a guy driving around the country on a motorcycle. One night when there is a storm outside, he goes to the nearest house and knocks on the door. A girl opens and she is dumb. Will not tell you more, but you will get chills when you see it may add that my heartbeat was really abnormal when I saw it). The "Campfire Tales" main story has a really interesting and surprising ending. I know some guys said it sucked, but me, my boyfriend and my friends loved it and it was a long time since we got it scared. Rating: 10/10, oh, by the way, it's not like Urban Legend that Everything is so scary.
