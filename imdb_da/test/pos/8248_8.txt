David "master of debonair" Niven plays Big Boss (IVAN) adorning the unlucky Richard Jordan (PINKY) by forcing the rude ex-con to exploit his bad new position in a bank. Elke Sommer (Miss Pelham) most effectively gives the female interest that Pinkie simply cannot withstand. <br /> <br /> It seems that they couldn't decide on a name for this movie, so they used four instead .... makes sense ??? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this turns out to be one of the level's last roles. All in all, this movie is fun and worth seeing if you manage to catch one of its rare or late night television screens. <br /> <br />
