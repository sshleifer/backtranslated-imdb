It may not have had the big budgets, celebrities or endorsements of Scream, Urban Legend or I know what you did last summer, but Campfire Tales had one thing that these three movies lacked: true horror. <br /> <br /> This film tackled the subject of urban legends a year before the real title and less than enchanting urban legend did. It was exciting, masterfully scripted and logical in a way I know what you did last summer could only dream of. Finally, it kept its focus and ended with a flurry, while Scream fizzled and died. What is most exciting about the movie is the fright that the authors and directors achieve. The overall story of teenagers around a campfire was classical fear of the unknown (but certainly expected) death that awaited them in the forest, but the stories are even where the film really shone. <br /> <br /> The opening phase is pure, fast-paced urban myth. It is based on a popular play, and the director plays this with the style and pace of the action, making it more exciting because we know what will happen. <br /> <br /> The first bonfire story is a straight forward. Based on another popular myth, we do not actually understand this to the end, both because it fits so well into the story and because the action keeps our attention. Being the trilogy thriller, this plays our fears of the unknown and contains several successful "jump" sequences that do not feel almost as cheap or unpleasant as those in movies like Scream or Urban Legend. <br /> <br /> The second story is more excitement. This time, even though the characters still don't know what's going on, we do it and it gives horror. There is no need for excitement here. <br /> <br /> The final story features elements of the supernatural and uses a creepy / trippy atmosphere to scare the viewer. Because we can relate so easily to the characters and their situation, our fears come from their intensity and what they cannot explain. This is the true ghost story in the trio. I didn't expect to enjoy Campfire Tales when I rented it. I figured if I didn't like her more reputable, bigger budget models, how could I like it? <br /> <br /> The truth is, however, that this movie is successful, with others falling far from the mark.
