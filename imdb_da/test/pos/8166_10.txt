First of all, I would like to say that I am just an amateur with commentary on movies and that English is not my native language, but that I felt a strong feeling that forced me to write about such films; possibly as a way to thank and congratulate C. Jay Cox, the cast and crew for such brilliant production. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I saw "Last Days" for the first time. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought it might be like the movie "Priest" that I liked to show a gay priest out of the closet. But "priest", perhaps because of his limitation of Catholic ideological beliefs, did not deliver the needs of my spectator by revealing a deeply sad end. <br /> <br /> "Last Days", on the other hand, broke the concept (and some others as well as the principles of Mormon); Present a tender and cheerful story that leads it to a happy and emotional end and yet awakens a sense of God's blessing and hope. A great movie! <br /> <br /> Somehow "Last Days" made me feel L.A. like an engleby. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes amazing gay love stories!
