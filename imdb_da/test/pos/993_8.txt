I didn't expect to enjoy this. In truth I saw it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but was not credited. Knowing Dylan Thomas and really appreciating his poetry, but consciously and quite confused by the man, I did not feel that I had to see a two-fit of his lame-bohemian life that remained. And it wasn't. critical and yet appreciated it was. it made me cry. Kiera Knightley was great, even with the slightly strained Welsh accent, and it's a sad story they tell. Dylan Thomas is not the hero, unfortunately he was not in his entire life, nor is it really the so-called "feisty woman" of the game. it's the cillian the william of the movie. A man who leaves the woman loves to fight for a war they ignore. His challenge to recreate with that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what beautiful performance from that actor. I thiink this movie is undervalued because it was marketed so badly. Dylan Thomas fans will expect something more from their so much-flawed heroes and get smaller, and that's good how it was marketed. It's not a movie about Dylan Thomas and it's much more interesting for it.
