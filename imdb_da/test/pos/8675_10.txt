Quite differently, with lots of understatement and black comedy, it's a movie that gets to see, but those who do it will remember it. This film creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way. What is it about? Estrangement, I think. Probably up to the viewer, but I found out that this film is trying to say something about the cold and emptiness behind all designer furniture and perfect facades. Don't know if I'm right. But this movie really came to me. See it. I really hope that the team behind this movie is making more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own, a kind of weird style. And I forgot: Casting here I am sovereign, with Trond Fausa Aurv√•g being perfect in the role of the compassionate man who does not understand where he is, what he is doing and why. The confirmation of not understanding the purpose of life (in the city) is what makes him annoying. All the others do as they are told and pretend (?) To be happy. This film is a good and humorous commentary on life in 2006.
