I watched this series on television in 1990 and absolutely loved it (I was nine years old). I bought the first DVD box about six months ago and got it second a few days ago (thanks to my dear husband). Gosh ... It was hard to sleep with all the thoughts in my head ... what was to happen to Madeline and George etc. Slave problems and civil war have always fascinated me (a 25 year old Finn). I advise reading slaves in the family by Edward Ball for those who want to look in the past and try to understand what has really happened. I'm not sure if I want to see the sky and hell after so many people have told here that it wasn't really that good.
