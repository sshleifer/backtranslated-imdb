This may not be the most exciting or incredible episode they've made, but in my opinion, it remains as one of Star Trek's and Sci-Fi's most original episodes. Most of the ideas from the retro Sci-Fi series, especially Star Trek, have been recycled several times, one hand mostly being the one-time triumph. This among the episodes that impressed me most towards the end. Another thing I like about this episode is how it has created such an exciting and captivating story with so few special effects. Now without criticizing the episode, I have to admit that the effects are very dated, but then again what can you expect from a 1967 television program? But still the item ("Horta") in this episode is basically just a blanket with a little colored rubber on it. But you forget this after approx. 1 minute and you just start thinking about it as it should be. Also the caves do not look like stone, but again you forget it after a few minutes. This episode is a living proof of how good acting and a good story can make you ignore the visual effects. The action from the headrest is as usual great. This episode contains the series Second Mind Meld of Spock and is one of my favorites. So to put it simply Leonard Nimoy is definitely a scene stealing here and his acting is excellent. Not that Kirk or Bones doesn't get their share of the episode, but Spock is the most exciting one in this episode. I like that episode is not about a particular character, but evolves around the trio that handles a foreign problem. It's also nice to see an episode that doesn't just happen on Enterprise. <br /> <br /> Like most Star Trek episodes, this episode tells us to have an open mind. I don't want to ruin the story, but evolve on what initially seems like a typical monster story. It has killed more people and must therefore be killed. But is it really all there is to it? I can assure you that the explanation will not disappoint you at last. This is still my favorite Star Trek TOS episode and I give it a 10/10.
