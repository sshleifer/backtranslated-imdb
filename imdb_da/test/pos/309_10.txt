From all the Vietnam war films, this is probably the most scary and disturbing, and it really says a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out. It has this freakish feel to it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It's not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war films. What pushes such a high level is: <br /> <br /> The management was fantastic here. Francis Ford Coppola shows his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors, he makes you feel like you are in the war. Most others just show and show you the atrocities of war. However, Coppola makes you confused, shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story. This is something I have only experienced very few times while watching movies. The script was, of course, also fantastic. It brought you into the middle of the movie. It never made me bored and this movie is three hours. The cinematography goes hand in hand with the direction much added to the freakish experience of watching this movie showing all the chaos around yourself when everything looks calm. The play was bone cooling. Just look at Marlon Brando also give his last great achievement playing a fake, out of whack colonel. When I think of a crazy soldier, I think of Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. With Brando n this movie you will not look at his eyes. Like the movie, he was freakish. For me, this achievement is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Martin Sheen gave a very profound achievement and probably the best of his career, making you see everything through his eyes all the game he experiences and yet wants him to come to his goal. It's just a wonder why these two didn't get Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall was able to show some of the delusion with his ridiculous fighting strategies, among those who played music to tell the enemy he was coming. Duval's character, who asks one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a fight, was also shocking but credible. Other great supporting performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest, all of whom summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a clich√©. Also for a time cameos were used in good use with Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford, whom I both love. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. It has a message, and everyone involved in doing it is best. There is no more I could ask about this movie with its amazing play, director, writing, filmography and good ending. See and you will see why it meets its title Apocalpyse Now.
