Yes, I'm a fan of the FF7, but how many people are watching this movie NOT going to be? And then I review this movie from a FF7 fan perspective, and without regret. (I didn't want to know how to properly review the movie for someone who hasn't played the FF7 game.) Visuals - 10/10 I loved Advent Children. It's a sensuous delight - a complete audio-video overload. Visuals were breathtaking: some feats were accomplished, which I simply wouldn't have thought possible with an animated feature. When the action scenes came, they were, for lack of a more precise word, a roller coaster. With dramatic camera handling sweeping across from range to range, seamlessly integrated bullet-time effects at crucial moments, to the sheer level of detail - it's hard to fail. The animation looks great budget, the style and the image are great, and the effects sometimes made me forget that I was looking at animation rather than live action footage. Over the course of hours, I could repeat myself on the amazing quality of the visuals, but it simply wouldn't do it any justice. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10 The sound was fabulous. The voices of all the characters did not disappoint (no one sounded stupid) and the sound effects were bold and sharp. The music - from the game, which (in my opinion) had the best game soundtrack ever transferred beautifully to the movie. Most of the memorable games from the game are present in the movie, though often using different instruments to fit in better with what happens. There were a lot of stronger rock and less thrash metal music over the really intense action scenes from time to time, but it all fits well into the movie's situation at the same time. History - 7/10 The story and characters would be the movie's main mistake. Both aspects were just not as little as in the game - but then again the game could use 40+ hours to develop these points - the movie has only 90 minutes. As far as the story goes, the plot was not bad or anything, but just not as ambitious as it was expected by someone who played the game through. In reality, the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. The game was so extravagant with the intricate plot twists and history of progression / development that the movie never really stood a chance of competing in the same league. Instead, the film took the more sensible approach - expanding the action and trying to place so many in jokes and themes in itself rather than trying to restore the massive story factor that was originally a driving force in the game. The lack of Materia use also gave me a controversy - the history of the movie chose to use small (but not zero) matter, and instead lots of supernatural fighting skills and skills. I would hope that if a successor was made, it would incorporate Materia much more extravagantly and more importantly into the movie. There were also many plot holes in the movie - all that can be forgiven if you think of Advent Children as a random anime, but seem ridiculous when you realize how it was based on a game that performed plot tremendously. <br /> <br /> Signs - 7/10 The characters, while all are present in one form or another, do not necessarily shine to their true potential. There is simply not enough movie time to use with all of them. And then all their background stories and abilities are not fully highlighted, and in some cases barely even (Red and Cait Sith leave absolutely no real lasting impressions). Even Cloud, which is the focal point of the movie, I do not feel enough of his well-known game skills. The matter of matter is a strong reason for this. Having said that, it is a joy to see cast in action, even if it is in such a role that they do not fully exploit them. The new characters were the ones who made me most of the battle though - Bad Guy Trio and the child Denzel - There was a huge lack of explanation about any of them. Anyone who is willing to use their imagination can probably fill the issues with something reasonable and done with it, but objectively, the question is still there to be commented on and is therefore somewhat disappointing. Value - 10/10 Replay value for this movie is excellent - I'd like to see it again in a larger and higher way - bigger screen, higher volume. Pleasure - 10/10 Regardless of the flaws in the movie, they simply weren't big enough to prevent my enjoyment of it, and I honestly think it will be the same thing for most people. I enjoyed Advent Children tremendously and encourage colleagues FF7 fans to see it.
