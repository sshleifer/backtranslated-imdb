A fascinating piece of life documents a man and wife and their marriage told through the eyes of their sons. We all seem to think that our parents lived happy lives, that their marriages were full of fulfillment, love, and good memories. Unfortunately, many of us do not know this with their own families and their parents. This wonderful little documentary is told through the camera's objective and emotional perspective on the son of a family who has just experienced the death of their mother. The son is a documentary filmmaker who has filmed his older family for many years, as he is called "posterity". Three months after his mother, his father forgets his long-term secretary. Suddenness of this occurrence stuns the family and pushes the son to dig into his mother and father's past life. What he reveals is a fascinating look at the lives of two fairly ordinary people who like so many of their generation to marry early for the wrong reasons and found themselves in a family life where they found that they were just "doing". A wife who at times herself was bitterly lonely and illegal and a man burying herself in her work. She and intellectual in heart, he is a much simpler person who seems to find most of his pleasures in the calm loneliness of work. Of course, they are wrong for each other, so much is clear. Yet they keep it out, for what? Well, it's part of the mystery they sometimes show love to each other at times, if not ever much love. You will not find any really shocking revelations here, except on adultery on both sides, which is in good part what makes this such a gem. You really feel that these could be your own parents if circumstances were different and actually make a question of life for their own parents.
