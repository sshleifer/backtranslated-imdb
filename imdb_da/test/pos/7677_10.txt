I watched this movie when I was very young. It's my all time favorite. I had not been able to get a copy until recently, and I saw it back so many good memories. I loved Sidney Poiter's portrayal of Porgy, his character with such strength and courage. Pearl Bailey's part, although small, was not unlike many of our own family members. My favorite songs were and still are "Bess You're My Women" "Porgy, don't let him handle me" and of course "Summertime".
