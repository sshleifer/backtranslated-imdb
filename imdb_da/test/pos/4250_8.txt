"Putney Swope" is a unique low low low budget pearl from the late 1960s that would probably have been forgotten in time if it hadn't been for two things: Paul Thomas Anderson (Don Cheadle's character in " Boogie Nights "Buck Swope, after the eponymous all in this movie" and the limited DVD release. Seeing "Putney Swope" is like listening to hardcore punk rock: it can't make much sense (at least for me it didn't look for the first time), but you have to respect the movie for its passion and unnoticed rebellious message. I didn't understand many things about "Putney Swope", but for the most part I liked it. The more I think about the movie, the more it grows on me. The film is announced as a parody of New York's Madison Avenue, best known in the 1960s as the world's advertising capital. Members of Generation X and Y may be lost on this concept, but fortunately "Mad Men" is on TV to give us this otherwise lost piece of US History. What you need to know before watching the movie is that these advertising agencies were basically men and even more wholly white businesses. <br /> <br /> With this premise in mind, the film opens up with an advertising agency meeting. The members are predominantly white except for Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson, who carries an eerie resemblance to Dick Gregory in this movie), the token of African American on the table. The board members are so self-centered and rare that when their president dies before them, their only concern is who will become vice-chairman. Without removing the body from the board, they begin a paper jam to select the next chair. <br /> <br /> Putney Swope is chosen by a landslide but not because the other members believe Swope is qualified. Voting for Swope was an unfortunate attempt by these board members to sabotage any other member's chance of being elected chairman. With their plans retreating, Swope takes the responsibility and "sinks the boat," everyone fires with one of the original members and hires all people of color in their place. <br /> <br /> After this time, the movie was (for me) very strange and difficult to follow plot-wise. There may not have been a plot really. The whole idea of ​​the movie seems to be a "what if" scenario, with the result that the new "Truth and Soul Inc." Company would be unconventional but successful anyway. The company ends up making so much money that members build a huge glass house to keep cash in for inexplicable purposes. This may be because Swope does not trust banks, although this point is not affected or explained in the movie. It can also be metaphorical in some way, but who knows. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie takes place inside the advertising agency, with occasional scenes in the White House with a president who, for some unknown reason, is a midget. My assumption here is that a certain political joke was made, but I can't figure out what. Was the filmmakers saying that the president is a small, insignificant part of American life? Were they to say that recent elected officials (Nixon at that time) were insignificant candidates? I do not know. However, I found it a little annoying that the man playing the president had a striking resemblance to future President Ronald Reagan. It's fun to make that connection 40 years after the movie was made. <br /> <br /> What this movie may have benefited from shows how consumers outside the advertising agency responded to the new ads. Of course, the advertising material had a weird, fun appeal to its unconventional creativity, but have those ads convinced people to buy the product? If so, how? The movie suggested the idea that the new ad campaign was successful through customer interaction and calls from the White House. However, it would have been revealing to see average people, since demographics have always been most profitable for advertisers. Although the parodies and political messages that this movie may have made probably not tested by time, this film still had many unique qualities. Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X-factor for him that gave him great benefit in this movie. Swope's coarse voice was actually Director Robert Downey, Sr.'s voice called in, sometimes poor, but suited the character as well as being an authoritative outsider. He hires and burns workers randomly, but he respects everyone except one of the employees to revolutionize the advertising agency and seek new ideas. <br /> <br /> The movie's premise was and remains incredibly risky, especially when the film was written and directed by a white man (Robert Downey, Sr.). However, this film rejects being the victim of negative black stereotypes, which will lead to the rise and fall of the blax exploitation genre years later. While some of the sex scenes may be slightly off-putting for some viewers, the main message is that a variety owned and run business can thrive through innovation and risk-taking. Many people should not take a positive note away from this movie, but I did. <br /> <br /> "Putney Swope" remains an overlooked movie from a strange era, and Downey, Sr. (Even in spite of his son's latest comeback), he was never given the recognition he deserved. But if you find a DVD of this movie, buy it and watch it. If it is on Netflix, go there. It's a movie that can be confusing at times, but it's worth watching for its blessing, ambition and its inconsistent stature even in today's film standards.
