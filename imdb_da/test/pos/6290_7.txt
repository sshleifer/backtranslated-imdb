Despite me, I really really like this movie. Pauley Shore always makes fun and fun, and here is no exception. He is just as good at playing Weirdo with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> His performance in this, though not the case for him, is so good, it seems to lift other cast members' performances. Maybe it's because he is the kind of guy it is easy to jump off. The clich√©s about the country's life in this movie are fun and the way Shore's "city boy" Crawl is so in violation of Lifestyle is also fun, but it's not just him who is a fish out of the water; Comedy also comes from the fact that for any "ordinary" person or people, Crawl is a freakish nightmare of a person. That's why this film works in such a good way: We love Crawl, he's a breath of fresh air, but we can also sympathize with Warners. He's a hell of a culture shock. Although this movie is classic Pauley Shore, there is no great brainpower needed to enjoy the movie, enjoy what you do, and there is even a "never judge a book by it's cover" type morals here somewhere. Not bad, not bad at all.
