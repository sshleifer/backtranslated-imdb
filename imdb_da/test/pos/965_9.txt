SPOILER ALERT !!!! This was my son's review of the movie that he wanted me to write. He wrote this, I swear. <br /> <br /> With Malcolm in Middle Frankie Muniz and Nickelodeon's Amanda Bynes, they will go to show business. They do the actress Paul Giamatti. He stole Jason Shepherd's essay on Big Fat Liar and make it a movie. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) must go to L.A. to get it back. Jason's father doesn't believe he wrote that essay. So every time they see each other, Jason Wolf (Paul Giamatti) asks to give Jason's father a call because he wants his essay back !!!! Wolf does not make the film, but the company's president does. In the end, the family and Kaylee watch the film, Made by Wolf Pictures and based on a real story written by Jason Shepherd.
