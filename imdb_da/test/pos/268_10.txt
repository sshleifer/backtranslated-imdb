I am surprised that my, so far, is the only comment on this t.v. movies ... as far as I know, the series itself has had a great successor, proofreaders and real people, has praised it to a person. Let me tell you right away that if you are a sucker for gritty police drama, you will like "The Lost Child" Tennison, the heroine, throughout the Prime Suspect series, has fought male police officer throughout the series, coming to her present, relatively powerful rank in the police hierarchy through hard work, obstinacy and pure talent for police work. She is essentially an ambitious career woman, but she has a romantic side and is definitely no man-hater. Unfortunately, her relationships are affected by the evil hours that her career requires, and she has never married, so when she finds herself pregnant from her recent affair, she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother and threatening her entire police job, let alone future. progress or abortion - which she chooses. This abortion never awakens much in the subsequent drama - it is very carefully traded in less than a few minutes, a wonder of economics in scripting and editing - but it is always there as a counterpart to Tennison's desperate attempt to find another "lost child "- a kidnapping victim - before it's too late. The story takes many turns before the surprise ends, and one is fascinated by the plot and the characters (although I found the many villains a little overdrawn), the police and especially Tennison are not always competent or no matter which characters, given the unpleasant work they have to do in the dizzying underworld that this series is usually in. <br /> <br /> Mirren has said she will not do any more films in the series but excellent as she has always been in the role of Tennison is the series itself as "actor proof", as it is another addiction to my -Dick Wolf's American "Law & Order" - whoever is in there, each could continue forever. Like my eager hope.
