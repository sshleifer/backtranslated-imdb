Enjoyed 'The Busty Man' http://ow.ly/PTTp (my wife didn't, so I saw it broken in a few days.) Judges are mostly confused - most agree on allegorical, but not what ' Heaven ',' hell ',' socialism ',' capitalism '? <br /> <br /> Most people do not want to escape, and that is essentially forbidden, goes with most of these opportunities. So presumably, you should project your favorite concern / prejudice / fear of it. <br /> <br /> So I want to say that it's about an a-epicuristic life. A live desatured color, literally in the film, figuratively in the interpretation.
