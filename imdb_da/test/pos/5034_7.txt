This is another of John Travolta's "come back" movies, and if he continues with characters and movies like this, his coming back will take hold. <br /> <br /> This is so sweet ... sickly, so if you're not in the Romanesque comedy scene. If you are, this is an innovative RomCom. Each performance (including Skippy the Dog) was beautiful, without much more than a trace of the irreverence found in "Dogma". (Although I as a movie, I loved Dogma!) Travolta is hardly brash in her performance, as the previews make you believe. He is an angel, and if you consider yourself to be well-read, you understand that angels were far from perfect. You will therefore not be offended by this movie. Even those who are too sensitive to such things should not be offended by this work, as Nora went to great lengths to make sure that it was the least abrasive as far as possible on the subject. <br /> <br /> I love this and love it more every time I see it. It is beautiful and sweet, engaging and endearing. It ranks a 7.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
