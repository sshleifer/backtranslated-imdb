After a very long time, the Marathi cinema has made a good movie. This movie is one of the best Marathi movies ever made. It shows how an old grandfather is trying to save his grandchild's eye. He tries everything possible in his hands to save the baby's eye. Doctor and a family of his attempts to help him in his attempt. It is by grandfather, the boy and the doctor are simply amazing. They have shown a true picture of a typical marathi life. Each action has some significance in it. I would recommend watching this movie when I originally thought this would be a documentary type, but it was beyond my expectations. This movie will really touch your hearts. I would expect more Marathi movies to come up with performances like this.
