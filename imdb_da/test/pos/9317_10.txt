Before I continue with the new millennium, I will go back in time once again because I had completely forgotten these pearls !!!!! <br /> <br /> In 1987, while still a "low" company in the 80s, Disney was able to launch a series of television films called "Not Quite Human" about a geeky teenager, as in "Inspector Gadget "looks like a human being but is really a robot !!!!! Now this SCREAMS 80S along with other movies like "Tron" and "Honey, In Shrunk The Kids" because it combines everything with yesteryear with tomorrow's technologies !!!!! My parents remember to watch this on the television back then when I was just born or something. But my very first meeting with this movie was on the Old Disney Channel (once I have seen this and the other parts on my 12th B'day in May 1999 !!!!!) <br /> <br /> "Not completely human "is a very good series of movies to see if you can ever find these movies again. <br /> <br /> Has this been shown recently? If so, give me an email or personal message. <br /> <br /> 10/10
