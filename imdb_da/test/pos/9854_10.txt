This documentary is not just one of the best documentaries I've seen, but also one of the most moving and quiet beautiful movies I've seen over time. It follows the lives of two Sudanese young men, Peter and Santino, as they try to make their way into American culture. Peter and Santino are friends first, but they are gradually getting more and more apart when Peter goes to Kansas City, and Santino remains in Houston ("a country called Houston"). Santino's beauty is in his eyes. He takes people on his back, he supports an apartment full of other Sudanese, pays the rent, does everything for other people. He is a silent affliction. Peter looks to himself, gets a high school education while playing basketball and making Christian friends. It seems that director Megan Mylan didn't know what she was getting into with this beauty of beauty. Peter and Santino are great characters who move you. But the real strength of this movie lies in its comment on American society. It doesn't judge. It shows the strength and weaknesses of our world and how difficult it can be for outside people. I suggest you find this movie and look at America through the lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people. <br /> <br /> My grade: 10/10
