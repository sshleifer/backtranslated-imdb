The only problem with Marry with Mob is that it's not fun. It just looks like a romantic comedy, but almost nothing happens is fun. But if you can look at it as a movie, where almost no fun happens, then you have a really good time. It is also an excellent mob file, as per. Title. Extremely sparkling. But the director, Jonathan Demme, is one of the few prevailing cult directors who completely embraced the 1980s in his work from the decade instead of understanding that it was still the 1970s. <br /> <br /> The opening points combine the 1980s animation, Italian-Americanism and mise-one scene on top of each other at once. From there, despite the 1980s, it feels right. The lighting from Demme's frequent film photographer Tak Fujimoto and the jukebox soundtrack rife with very varied pop and alternative jams has gone and it is controlled and nuanced as part of the atmosphere. Demme is good at colorful instantaneous characterizations in his visual and sometimes seemingly outrageous composition of a fun mix of styles, a plot that could have gone any way where a agile FBI agent played by a very gentle Matthew Modine tries to infiltrating a mafia family sees a chance when a pistol game played with Michelle Pfeiffer comes to her, trying to leave the criminal lifestyle after her penetrating husband, on what you would hope in an Alec Baldwin performance is wacked. <br /> <br /> The way it works is for a while because Demme seems to have a firm hand on the wheel. He knows the importance of showing us the very subjective and relatable life-at-home scenes with Pfeiffer, as well as her worries and longings as a morally conflicting mother, even though her relationship with son Joey has been taken for granted. Which mob's son listens to partying mom when her father's boss played with Dean Stockwell's trademark naturalness and by far the scene-stealing stand-out of the cast, giving him such awesome gifts? On the whole, Demme's lathered-on stylizations can easily be considered a novel that takes a fun crime story. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, we find that we have gone the wrong way because inevitably, Modine and Pfeiffer have to fall in love. It is not inherently bad, and every now and then it actually feels tolerable, but as a romantic subplot, it is not treated interestingly or not at all because it skips various different clich√©s that meet the original expectation of a cheesy 1980's date flick And for that audience I think it has just the right impact. But for a person who has found himself really interested in the story and the aesthetic approach, it is a depressed state in tedium. So it's a decent movie with big flaws at certain points, but as a date movie or a nostalgic piece for those who grew up in the 80s, perhaps so many date films in the 80s, the entertainment value is not so likely to fluctuate with exception of the aforementioned deficit in real laughs. There may be a couple of scoffs, and it's very wide tongue-in-cheek, but I didn't want to leave the comedy time with the big hopes I had originally entered. Whatever the case, there are additional pleasures in the bitrolls of major character actors who have now begun to fade, such as Nancy Travis, Joan Cusack and Oliver Platt.
