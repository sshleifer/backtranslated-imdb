This movie reminds me of great movies that temporarily awaken me with the realization that the emperor is actually naked. Our electoral process is undressed and gloomy. My consciousness has increased and I want to see the world change. After a short while, I lulled back to my little complacency and "bubble life." In the movie's best feeling, this work will be fermented into an edible stew for me and as in "Network" I will be sentenced to say "I am as happy as whole and I am not going to take it here!" But to whom? My strong youthful idealism is slowly reduced to the concerned parent with calm beliefs or rather "beliefs". "Man of the Year" reveals how much I long for honest and sometimes humorous taking our current political situation. Dobbs' line "I breathed because I thought," What the hell is it lit up, it's in my hand, I'll breathe it. "" Be refreshing or would have been when Clinton was president. Why can't politicians be honest and set the tone for debate? We humans need to realize how much veneer is being performed as genuine? I'm already sick in this election process, someone else? Let us turn off the blinds and set an agenda for our elected officials and take them to task (not re-election) as they continue with evasion and lack of representation of citizens. This film can inspire us to increase our expectations for politicians who track rhetoric. Great film!
