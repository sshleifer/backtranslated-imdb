This movie was a wonderful body, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in odd places and a huge energy. The famous film director (protagonist) and the events he is trying to manipulate through movies are all involved in fascinating ways, as he is almost out of control of a prince who has never heard of him. There are wonderfully rich images throughout and paths suggested but not followed (exactly what goes on with the ugly wife of the pedestrian tourist wedding director?). The end is all the better for being sloppy. Realism and logic are not what you should look for here. If we are to turn our weddings and our imaginative lives over to film directors, we should be prepared for a wild ride, this film seems to suggest.
