OK, I'm Italian, but there aren't so many Italian movies like this. I think the plot is very good for 3/4 of the movie, but the final is too simple, too predictable. But that's the only slight mistake. The consequences of Love in my opinion have great sequences especially in the beginning and the great soundtrack. I would very much like to have the lighting work on it. The best thing about it is a great, great actor. You know, if your name was Al Pacino, everyone would have ever talked about this achievement. But it is only a great theater Italian actor named Toni Servillo. Yes, somebody tells me this movie and this kind of performance is too slow, it's so boring, so many silences, but I think these components are amazing, it's the right way to describe the love story between a very talented young girl on. best daughter of Italian actor Anna Magnani, Olivia and the old mysterious man Toni. One of my favorite Italian movies.
