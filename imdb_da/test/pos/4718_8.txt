It was high time that a film about the situation in a largely ignored Asian country like Myanmar should be made, and Beyond Rangoon is Hollywood's answer. Originally, I thought Hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 uprising and add in the traditional Hollywood spice of the Titanic-type love between the leader hero and the Burmese male leader, who happens to be an old man. Fortunately, there was nothing like that - which can also explain why the film was not economically successful. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie was honest to God and I was happy about the accuracy of events portrayed. Apart from the fact that the film was performed outside Myanmar in Malaysia and Thailand, and I missed the exotic Burmese sites, I couldn't find much flaw in the movie. <br /> <br /> You cannot blame the movie for the desperation of the people and the ensuing overwhelming actions. After all, it is real events in a civil war. His Zimmer music is definitely the USP of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it. <br /> <br /> I was only a year old in Rangoon (now Yangon) in this tumultuous time. When I heard a movie was made on my real-life experience that I was too young to absorb, I had to get the DVD and it was unnecessary to say that I could hardly get any complaints about it as it is an eye-opening deficit for me.
