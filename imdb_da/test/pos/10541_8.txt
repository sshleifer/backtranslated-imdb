I know what you say, "Oh man, Pinochio is not scary!" But this movie goes beyond much more than a maniacal pinochio. Behind it tells the story of a mother and her daughter who are strangely attached to her doll Pinnochio, who seems to talk to her. The only strange thing is that no one else can hear the doll except her. Ultimately, shocking revelation is that as I will shock you. See it. Try it.
