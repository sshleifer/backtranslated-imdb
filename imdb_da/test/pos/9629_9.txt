The Patriot is a well thought out, well-produced film that will draw the viewer directly into the story and keep them involved in the end. Granted, it's not in the same vein as Under Siege, et. al., but it is definitely the trademark film that can be described as Seagal's second era of film. Not so much Action movie with a nod to a story thrown well but a good story, matched with a point and injected with some of Seagals endless action sequences. Is it the kind of movie that hardcore action junkies will enjoy? Probably not. But for those of us who not only like our action but also appreciate a well-informed story, this is a big step forward for Seagal. It's almost like the transformation Clint Eastwood made when he tried to step out under the shadow of his "Dirty Harry" series. Whether man, he had continued in the unique direction they were heading, would forever be keyholed in a particular role and guaranteed career in their career ...
