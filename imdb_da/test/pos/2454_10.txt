I had never heard of this movie and only got it because I am a Martin Sheen fan. Now I am surprised why it did not receive the praise and recognition that it truly deserves. The four characters give you all the feelings for them. The father tries to assert his authority. The mother is still clinging to traditional family values, and both try to keep an eye on performances despite the total fragmentation of their family, the daughter wants her own life and the son haunted by her experience in Vietnam. It was thought that this was a scenario that should have been played in thousands of "ordinary" families after Vietnam. Emilio Estevez as Jeremy was excellent - totally uncomfortable with his war experience, which none of his family could relate to. The screen chemistry between him and his real father Martin Sheen was amazing. And there were times when Emilio's inflamed face was like Martin's in "Apocalypse Now". I am sure that, as Martin has spoken Apocalype as one of his best films, Emilio will count this as one of his best too. The scene with the gun was complete thinking, as all the emotions were there on the family's faces. Brilliant plays by Estevez, Sheen and Kathy Bates. I watched the movie for the first time last night - and today was the main story in the news of a golf war veteran who had shot several family members. How many more young men should their lives be destroyed in war?
