Without a doubt, movies are a powerful medium, more so than ever because of the availability of DVD / video, giving the film maker the added assurance that his story or message will be seen by possibly millions of people. The use of this medium therefore places a congenial responsibility on the part of the artist, inasmuch as films may be educational as well as entertaining, which dictates that certain subjects must be contacted accordingly and with a similar sensitivity and sensitivity. For example, a movie such as Spielberg's "Schindler's List" is important because it keeps alive what should not be forgotten, and as history tends to recur, Spielberg's films can be seen as a valuable tool to prevent a relapse of this tragedy. In the same vein, this film, 'Focus', directed by Neal Slavin, is important as it illuminates the anti-Semitic problematic reality which, for many years beyond the number, has hit millions of people, still unthinkable today and resembling Any manifestation of bigotry will continue itself if left unchecked or ignored. Born of a xenophobic tribe, it is a disease that infects society, which can be terminally unabated; And with its transparent insight into the state, this film is an effective vaccine that can at least help spread its spread, and hopefully it can act as a step towards eradicating it altogether. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) served his country in the Great War, and has since lived a quiet, conventional life in New York. He has had the same job as staff manager for some twenty years and owns the house, located in a middle-class neighborhood where he lives with his mother (Kay Hawtrey). Lawrence is the kind of guy who's fine by thinking of his own business and refuses to get involved in relationships that aren't (he feels) his concern. All this is changing as with the advent of 2. World War II, Lawrence finds with the owner of the corner market, Mr. Finkelstein (David Paymer), inexplicably a target for the neighborhood xenophobes, has adapted to 'Union Crusaders' a national organization currently taken to channel their fears and hatred of Jews, or anyone who even looks like a Jew. And suddenly Lawrence finds that he can no longer stand on the sidelines and see that the game is being played; because now he is played, whether he will be or not. <br /> <br /> Working from an intelligent, well-written play by Kendrew Lascelles, which he adapted from Arthur Miller's novel, Slavin presents a chilling scenario that greatly explores the effects of bigotry on them against whom it is smoothed; And considering the fact that this is not just a hypothetical situation but a picture of reality, it becomes the more inconsistent, even unpleasant. And what makes the movie so effective is Slavin's obvious understanding of his subject, and his studied presentation, which is thought-provoking in it's subtlety. In the opening scene, Slavin establishes Lawrence's `character 'and very soon after confirms it on another scene, allowing the audience to observe and assimilate how Lawrence's mind actually works; thought processes that lead his life. With that in place, Slavin can take his audience along with Lawrence as his problems gradually begin to unfold. In this way, he effectively illustrates how the problem progresses rather than simply stating the problem and addressing it upside down, increasing the viewer's emotional engagement and ultimately improving the film's impact. <br /> <br /> Slavin makes an important statement with this movie, which is not just a charge for bigotry, but also a warning of apathy. And to his credit he never strikes you over the head or engages in subjective pointing to do his cause; Instead, he continues gently and takes great pain to be as objective as possible with everything he submits to your consideration. His approach is that of a film diplomat; And that's an approach that serves Slavin - and his movie - quite well. As Lawrence, William H. Macy - one of the best character players in the business - provides a great achievement, establishing the credibility and credibility of his character with a sensitive, honest, and introspective depiction. He never tries to circumvent the personal errors of Lawrence's nature, but instead uses them to create a distinctive three-dimensional character that not only makes him convincing but serves to confirm the integrity of the portrayal. What makes it so convincing is Macy's ability to convey the process of examining his own conscience, which successfully enables the viewer to share in the experience of his personal epiphany. Ultimately, it is the strength of Macy's performance, more than anything else that makes this movie so distinct. <br /> <br /> Another of the film's strengths is the performance of Laura Dern, such as Gertrude Hart, a depiction that effectively complements Macy's work as well as Slavin. Dern gives tremendous substance to her character, captures her physically as well as emotionally, and her colorful zeal throws a striking contrast to Lawrence's reserve, which works extremely well for her character as well as the movie itself. <br /> <br /> And just as Sean Combs recently (in "Monster's Ball") made a good case of dismissing the acting efforts of an established "rock star", Meat Loaf Aday gives a strong performance here, like Fred. Lawrence's next door neighbor. It also shows that a true artist will produce whatever kind of canvas he has got to work with. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Michael Copeman (Carlson), Kenneth Welsh (Father Crighton), Joseph Ziegler (Gargan) and Arlene Meadows (Mrs. Dewitt). The kind of movie that makes a filmmaker proud of his craft, 'Focus', provides a memorable experience that hopefully will also be enlightening to those who are unaware that such relationships have existed and still do - even in this, country's free country 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
