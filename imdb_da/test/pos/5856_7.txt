Now I know that Sandra Bullock produced this movie, but she needs to learn that sometimes you have to make some sacrifices to advance the story ... which doesn't try to make the whole movie about her character! <br /> <The story is about two high school students (a rich and popular, the other smart and anti-social) who formulate a plan to commit murder and follow it with the number ... just to see if they can get away with it. Enter Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin as detectives trying to resolve the matter. The boys have planted evidence, created alibis and cleared up for themselves so well that the police fall for the whole action. But Sandra has a feeling that everything is not as it seems. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a great little Hitchcock style thriller, but the movie spends too much time getting to know Sandra's character rather than focusing on the crime itself. You see, something happened in her past that continues to speculate her throughout the film. And we learn all about it ... All about it. It just gets a little boring after a while, especially when you are in the middle of an exciting murder investigation, and then stop this study to hear about what happened to her earlier. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the right winners in this movie. They play their characters convincingly and with just the right amount of evil. If the script had spent more time focusing on these characters and kept the detectives there just to do their jobs, it could have been an incredibly entertaining thriller. With the way it is, most of the excitement is lost. They should have cut all things along with Sandra's character and made it as a separate television movie for the Lifetime channel. But I give up. It's an entertaining movie anyway. I recommend this movie ... but wait for video / dvd.
