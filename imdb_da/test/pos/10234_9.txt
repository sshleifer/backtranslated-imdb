Adapting his own novel "Cabal" to the screened author / screenwriter / director Clive Barker this amazing story of outrorror and fantasy. Craig Sheffer plays Boone, a young man suspected of being a serial killer. The police guns him down in front of Midian, on the surface of a cemetery, but which is actually a paradise for monsters that have been cut off by society. When claiming Boone and making him their own, this causes consequences for everyone, including Boone's sweet girlfriend (the very sweet Anne Bobby) and dubious psychiatrist (a most entertaining David Cronenberg). <br /> <br /> "Nightbreed" shows the kind of wild and twisted imagination that I don't often see in movies. First, Ralph McQuarrie, an old conceptual art hand who has been working on such films as the first three "Star Wars" entries, helps Barker create great visuals for "Nightbreed" that start immediately with opening credit sequence. Visual and makeup effects are elaborate, and production design and filmography are quite impressive. Barker and crew do a wonderful job of creating this completely different world of compelling signs. It is colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in. And, of course, there is a strong sense of social commentary on intolerance and bigotry, not to mention the heavy consequences that may result from a person's actions. <br /> <br /> Great supporting performances add to the fun. Cronenberg exudes a lot of vicious intentions and is a real gas as the bad doctor, while Charles Haid is a fine love of hate-hane-type antagonist, a pretty scary police officer. Doug "Pinhead" Bradley is again buried under heavy makeup like the tired Lylesberg, and is solid as a stone. Hugh Ross is fun as Narcisse, like Catherine Chevalier as Rachel (as an added bonus, she brings her breasts in order). Simon Bamford, who played "Butterball Cenobite" in the first two "Hellraiser" pictures, also appears here. There is even a cool como from the 50s and 60s sci-fi star John Agar. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman delivers another of his great scores, and Barker pushes us through the thrilling story to a stunning apocalyptic showdown. /> <br /> "Nightbreed" is a great genre movie worth checking out for anyone who hasn't seen it. I give it a warm recommendation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
