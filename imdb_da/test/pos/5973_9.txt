I agree with another reviewer, it's such a smashing movie that will be hard to see again soon, but for quality alone, it deserves repetitive viewing. The complexity of the characters, the incredible filmography and the amazing direction make this movie worth the emotional price to watch. <br /> <br /> There is a scene, of the two partisans pulling through the snow to escape a patrol, that is, perhaps, for pure physics, the most amazing achievement I've ever seen. In fact, but not episodically - the story is flowing - this is a movie of memorable scenes. There are lotions among the partisans, the snow scenes, the ruined farm scene, the meetings of the houses, the interrogation, the "basement" stage, the "rise". Everyone stands out as jewels in a necklace. <br /> <br /> For me, religiosity is not open. Frankly, I don't think it would have been allowed in a Soviet movie. I see this as an existential parable of the value of life. Here is a story where the hero - and he is a true hero - becomes the villain, and the weaker one becomes the strongest. Is this a mysterious process or a dictated by circumstances? There is a transfiguration, but does it come from inside or outside? You have to watch the movie to understand the problems, because they cannot be discussed without giving away too much of the story. I can't say enough about the action. It's hard for me to choose which of the leaders is more influential. I'm not familiar with Soviet films from the 70s and are not familiar with any of the actors, but they are all amazing. I also note how director Larisa Shepitko uses children. They remind me of Giotto's baby angels. <br /> <br /> There is a little muddling in the end. There is apparently a prior relationship between the soldier Sotnikov and the interrogator Portnov, but this is left dangling. And the final scene is a bit ambiguous. But compared to the overall experience, these quibbles are. This is a movie that marks you for life.
