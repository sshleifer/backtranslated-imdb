Shwaas is amazing! Considering that the producers had a poor budget, they have done an excellent job. It's a must see. The little child has done an excellent job with many emotions flowing through his eyes. Grandpa is the best. The photography is amazing. Technically correct and very creative. It helps to add many feelings to the general content. The movie will keep you engrossed and not be surprised if you shake the movie and the story is discussing you for a few days. I sincerely hope they make it to the final Oscar nomination <br /> <br /> Enjoy and Don't Miss It
