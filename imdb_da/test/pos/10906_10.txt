Joan Cusack steals the show! The prerequisite is good, plot line interesting and the manuscript was OK. A bit too simplistic, as an outgoing story of a gay man was so positive when it is usually not quite as positive. Then again it is fiction. :) All in all, an entertaining body. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed was the "inside-joke" aspect. Since the target audience was likely to be equal, they cannot get homosexual "stuff" in the context of history. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline showed a facet of his play that the writers sometimes do not take into account when proposing Kline for some. <br /> <br /> This hit the mark.
