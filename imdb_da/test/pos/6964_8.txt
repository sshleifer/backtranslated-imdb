Okay, so Ghoulies 4 is a little bad. And it doesn't really even have the ghouls in it. And the play is bad. The story is stupid. But I forget to mention how funny this movie is. It's so campy, and so ridiculous it is for fun not to enjoy. There are only 2 ghoulies in the movie and they do not seem to be relative to Ghoulies in the other movie. But they are pretty funny. And fun that Jonathon Graves returns to this one. If you saw first, he was a character in it. In my opinion, it is better than the first. There are some classic scenes and some classic lines, one in a grocery store. "NOTE! K-Mart shoppers!" Watch this if you enjoy bad movies. It's so bad, it's good. And have I mentioned Barbara Alyn Woods hot?
