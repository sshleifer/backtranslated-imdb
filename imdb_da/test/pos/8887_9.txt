We live in sad times today, where it seems that all comedy films and TV views are painfully unfunny and added with cheap, raw or bad humor. Most people do not know what it means to really laugh at a comedy, and these people desperately need to see "Throw Momma From the Train." I say with some hesitation that this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen from the beginning to the end. The comedy is so unpredictable and twisted just enough to make us laugh a lot many times through. Don't be fooled by the murder plot. The reason is not serious enough to make us care or worry about what will happen. The story involves a young man (Danny DeVito) wishing to get rid of his annoying, grinning mother (Anne Ramsey, nominated for an Oscar in a role that was completely flawless, in my opinion) and doing so by killing Billy Crystal's wife whom Crystal wanted to die to steal her novel. I will not spoil the jokes and gags in this movie, but all I can say is that you should watch this movie if you want to laugh. Fast and genuine, a real treat for comedy lovers, and the kind of movie you just can't see today. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 out of ****
