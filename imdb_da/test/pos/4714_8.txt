I came across this movie on TV. I hadn't heard of it before and almost changed the channel, but it hung me fast. <br /> <br /> The story of the Burmese people's struggle against a military dictatorship was provocative. The level of brutality that some are willing to use to hold on to power is hard to believe. It makes me grateful to live in a country where the government is unlikely to shoot people on the streets. <br /> <br /> The story of Laura Bowman was a good thread to keep the story of the political struggle together.
