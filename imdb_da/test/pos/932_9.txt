Not only is it difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski's trilogy, it seems that the filmmaker wants us to do the opposite: see them in sequence, Blue, White and Red, and consider them a complete work . It is true that they are different stories with different themes: freedom, equality, fraternity, and each one is developed with unique uses of intrigue and artistry. They are each worth seeing independently, but I think they are best seen as one work. Overall, I would rate the trilogy as a 9; individually, I place each in my top ten in the years 1993 and 1994. The color of red is most memorable in the third film as the backdrop of a billboard ad whose profiled model is the core of the film's three main characters. The other two letters make a double drawing of a varying degree of recognition when they first come to the ad that is larger than life along with a busy intersection. This ad is not a big part of this movie's movie, but its image is striking and is one of the reasons I have called Red, a "mind-bending" movie. This is the third of Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy, based on the blue-white red of the French flag and the three parts of its motto, 'Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood'. The films are primarily focused on these themes, keeping together the basic levels of one, two, or three main characters, but in each movie the complexity of the plot escalates as the three principles go from fundamentally personal (Liberty, Blue) to relational (Equality, White) for social (Brotherhood, Red). Red is my favorite of these movies, and I give it a 9. It's in itself a great movie, but you should see Blue and White first for the full effect.
