This movie tackles the issues of loss, personal struggle and transformation in such a smart, artificial, sensitive and visually great way that I was completely transported. It is a rare gem of a movie called Beauty and Women. You have to see for yourself. Dreya Weber (Jane) portrays the championship in a remarkable, if not broken, personality in a way that every woman will relate to. I found the honesty of the emotional interactions among the signs to be very refreshing and deeply engaging. There was nothing in this movie that told me "low budget" in terms of quality. Nothing. The fact that it is a low budget film is a tribute to the film's creators. The final sequence during the credits will also knock off your socks. It's a brilliant celebration of Jane's choice. Unexpected and inspiring.
