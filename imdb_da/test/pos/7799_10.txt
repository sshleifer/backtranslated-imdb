The movie Andaz Apna Apna in my books is the top 5 intelligent comedy movies ever made in Bollywood maybe even Hollywood. <br /> <br /> When the movie was released, I was 8 years old and I heard it was a flop, but I never understood why it was a flop ... but let me tell you one thing .. This movie would have more money by selling home tapes and DVDs and by showing in TV movie channels than any hit movie in theaters. This movie has been shown countless times in movie channels, and I think now that public love and television producers are repeating the movie over and over again. I have personally watched the whole movie more than 80-100 times, and I still love it ..... <br /> <br /> The performance of both Aamir Khan and Amar and Salman Khan as Prem is the mindset but I especially liked the performance of Aamir Khan as a street smart guy .... his dialogues in the movie are Hilarious ... the story is simple and heres how it goes ..... <br /> <br /> Amar and Prem is poor, lazy jaws and comes from a poor family of tailors and Amar's father is a barber. Then they both get the news that a millionaire's daughter from London comes to India to find a suitable match ... both Amar and Prem believe this is an excellent opportunity to become super-rich ..... therefore they are both go out to woo Raveena Tandon .. (millionaires daughter) ...... in their journey they both hate each other and each one tries to fool the other to marry Raveena ..... between comedy scenes is so hilarious that you would have a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach by laughing ....... and then there is Raveenas Uncle (Millionaire's like brother) Teja, who wants to avenge himself from Raveena's father .. ... since he is broke and Raveena's father is a millionaire ...... his plans include kidnapping Raveena for extortion Raveena's father, for whom he hires 2 butlers ..... <br /> <br /> but later are we going to know that there is a twist in the movie (see the video to know) ....... then there is Shakti Kapoor as crime master Gogo, who is also incredibly fu .. .... <br /> <br /> What stood out for me was the dialogues in the movie that have become a kind of play ..... Aamir Khan uses his "aaila" brilliantly and Salman goes like " OOima "........ and for Gogo there is" Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soota Nahi Hain to Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahi to Gogo Aa Jaega "...... every scene is so fun .... .. <br /> <br /> I especially liked it when Aamir Khan and Salman Goto get Raveena from Teja, and they both go in a Luna with "chillar" money in a bag .... that scene is so fun. I recommend anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu to watch this movie ...... this is a movie I would recommend having a DVD and you will never regret it. ......
