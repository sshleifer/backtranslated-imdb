I had heard news about this movie from Anime Legend Hayao Miyazaki and I would like to see it. But I was lucky enough to film online on YouTube; After watching the movie, I knew it was another Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli classic. <br /> <br /> This movie inspired by my favorite adventure "The Little Mermaid" is about a 5-year-old boy named Sosuke and his relationship with a goldfish princess named Ponyo, who longs to be human and be with Sosuke. I will not give you more details, you will have to watch the movie for yourself. So overall, one of the best animated movies ever made, with lots of imagination, adventure and humor ... I loved it!
