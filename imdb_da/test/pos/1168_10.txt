We usually think of the British as the experts in carrying out great adventures from the Imperial Age, like the four feathers (1939) and Zulu, simply because the imperial age was mostly British. Here, in the wind and the lion, we see a wonderful reproduction of American's own imperial age. America's prominent power under Teddy Roosevelt is the reason for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel, which despite her gentility, is beaten by the hard, male nobility of her prisoners, who in turn are disarmed by her beauty and mockery. (Politically correct prigs who are eager to see some small "native" peoples or cultures can be sure that the way the Arabs and Muslims are depicted here is far flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict at the current world stage.) What makes this story different is the amazing production values ​​- flawless photography, composition and editing - the amazing casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith plays a rowdy Teddy - and live story. Although the wind and the lion are widely spoken through the eyes of the sons, each family member can identify with one of the characters, be it Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's celebrating heroine, John Houston's fabulous John Hay, or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, brilliant, ruthless lies, Roosevelt's "Big Stick". There is a transcendent scene at the end when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing moor on his white steed. This is high adventure at its best.
