I had no plans to look wasted when I saw the MTV previve, but since I had nothing better to do or see on a Sunday night I saw it. <br /> <br /> Wasted wasn't a Requiem for a Dream, but it was a very good movie considering it was made by MTV. One thing that drew me to see it was the summer Pheonix sister of the late and wonderful river Pheonix staring. I suppose talent is running in the Pheonix family because she was good and that is Jaquien, even though it is not the River. Nick Stahl also gives a good preformance as a junky jock. There is not much else to be said about wasted. It was a dark, depressing and insightful insight into the life of three small town clubs. I recommend it to those who like the topic. 8.10
