A great achievement by Clint Eastwood and especially John Malkovich in my opinion his finest one to date. Malkovich had this nail right down to the floor, it's incredible. Eastwood is agent Mike Horrigan, an aged and cynical secret service agent who completes his career disruptive counterfeiters and chases routine tasks. But a task that seems to be run by the mill in the first place becomes complicated and deadly serious. Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to investigate a threat to the president of a "wacko". As fate would have it, Horrigan has not stumbled on a deceptive nut, but a professional lone wolf who has a large bone to choose with the White House. As Horrigan dives deeper into the "Booth's" world, he attracts the evil attention and the unspoiled admiration for him. Horrigan was JFK's top agent and present in Dallas, Texas, when he was murdered and blamed himself for what happened. Now he feels that it is up to him to stop the current head of state to enter the list of dead presidents. But this killer has turned the tables on Horrigan, and now he is hunting for a life or death cat and mouse game. Who's winning? Who wants to die? It's a race against time to save pressure from a chameleon-like enemy that can come to anyone. My favorite Secret Service movie and as good a nail bits as anyone.
