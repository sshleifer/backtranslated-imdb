Let's not cross the bush here, Taylor Hackford's undoubtedly slender movie has suffered to make it stand out from the biopic genre except Jamie Foxx's extraordinary career creation. Remember the year they surrendered the special effects Oscar to the Terminator 2 boffins, undisputed? They should do the same with this year's best actor gong. <br /> <br /> Ray Charles's story is worth filming is not in conflict. In fact, the many setbacks to his traumatic childhood are well managed and poorly exploited. But for such a unique life, the film looks incredibly formal and known. It follows the story of a flawless genius template almost to the letter: adversity and exploitation, women and drugs, inclusion of wrangles, band squabbles, rehab, yes yes yes. And surely there was more humor in his life than we are treated here? <br /> <br /> I greatly appreciate Charles's music, but how nicely cut medley would have kept the story rolling, Hackford rejects almost near-length renderings of too many songs - in the gin joints, in the recording studio, in concert halls , infinitum. Narrative, and for non-devotees, they begin to act as a cinematic brake. It may seem like a hard judgment on a music biopic, but with a catalog as extensive as Ray's, we need a taste not the whole dish. Otherwise we would buy the albums. <br /> <br /> Intrigued as I was, I looked more than once at my watch. So for all Foxx's sheen, maybe Ray could have been better served as an HBO two-party?
