Of course, how could he. Of course, he chose several aspects from the excellent film, which was also based on the sensational French case of the self-proclaimed "World Health Organization Doctor" who murdered his family and himself when he finally became impossible as a scam. Emilio refers to his son as "monster", he sings to the radio in his car, he hangs out on park benches and he specializes in investment schemes to deceive his family and friends - all this and more direct promise from "Time Out" as came out the year before "No one is life." It's too bad because this movie is pretty good alone with good acting and writing. While Vincent from "Time Out" is a much more subtle character who seems to have a sense of ethics, although at times getting angry with knots, the protagonist here sees no sign whatsoever except for his winning appearance and charm. Seriously, where the part where he used X-rays showing his son-in-law's cancer to make more money from his father, he exploits a subtle twist on the same scam to avoid exposing his fancy home to not paying the lease time - It's almost too much. The guy has no shame at all. In fact, he is more like the driver of "Stepfather" than some poor schmuck being fired and so humiliated that he does not face the disappointment of his family and friends and feels compelled to invent a shiny new life for himself himself, as Vincent did in "Time Out". Thus, one can feel the tension mounting in "Nobody's Life" and the violent conclusion that comes. One thing "No one's life" has that "Time Out" was absolutely lacking was a love interest apart from the protagonist's trusting wife. It is not difficult to understand how the sexy babysitter was able to fascinate and induce Emile to the extent that he ignored the danger of his natural curiosity and allowed it to lay its less than carefully constructed con. Considering the reservations mentioned, this is a pretty good movie that we found entertaining. If you yearn for something that touches similar elements that go deeper and more intellectually and spiritually satisfying, I strongly suggest "Time Out".
