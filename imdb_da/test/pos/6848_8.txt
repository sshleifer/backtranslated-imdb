30 pieces of silver and a kiss for luck. This was another totally unexpected gem. Usually I'm not even a thrill / thriller fan. This satisfying 100 minutes has more twists than a boardwalk pretzel. It has titrating erotic romance reminiscent of "Body Heat" in more ways than one; it has police and crime; political intrigue and just a touch of daytime tree. It has just the right touch of fierce violence that every professional "by-the-number" crime job must apply. Emma Thompson, (FBI AIC), delivers her role with grace and humor and gets my vote for the best fake southern accent of a Limey. Alan Rickman (local policeman), who always seems to steal the show, is excellent but not overbearing. They work well as a couple. Lots of plot misdirection that never gets out of control and is connected coherently at the end of the movie. And who is this amazing woman, Carla Gugino? I want her to carry my children. Carla, if you're out there, let's make lunch
