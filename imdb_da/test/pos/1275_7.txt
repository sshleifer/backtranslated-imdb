This is definitely Nolan's most intimate and thought-provoking piece. Not to say that Memento or Insomnia is bad, but they were certainly up to several Hollywood standards ... while the following is more of an indie flick. The story is very brilliant and very well developed. Overall ... see this if you are a fan of any of Nolan's work, I am sure you will appreciate it more.
