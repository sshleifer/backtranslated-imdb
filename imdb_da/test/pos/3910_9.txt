I have heard many different opinions about this movie and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it also did not give me the best impression of the movie .... then being pulled to the cinema by a group of my friends And sitting there expecting a pile of pants, I was shocked to find out that I was scared stiff all the way through the movie. It was predictably yes, but the build-up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the movie made it really scary for me ... I saw all the way through my fingers. So I say go and see for yourself and decide for yourself, and if the fact that it's a scary movie doesn't convince you to see it, then it also has Chad Michael Murray in what can't be bad to see in a few hours eh?
