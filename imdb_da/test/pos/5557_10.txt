Faqrscape is really one of the shows that just has it all, great plays, great cast, good writing, set, chemistry, muppets ... it has it all and then some, except a home. This amazing series seems to have it all but and ends. TPTB seems to think this is a series of consecutive single-set shows when everyone who is watching this is an ongoing, epic, love story that has an end to be seen. If you have never seen Farscape, do a service and check it out on DVD when season 1 is released in October .... and season 2 is the best there is! Watch reruns on the SciFi channel to catch up and then start the new season in January to March when most shows go into hiats and make sure to watch. If all goes well, we'll get our end!
