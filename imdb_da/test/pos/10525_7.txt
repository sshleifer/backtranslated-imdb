This interesting, lost movie (written by Terence Malick) stars Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest as two wacky southern brothers on an attempt to open a seafood restaurant. Margot Kidder was never more beautiful, and Forrest should have been nominated. Originally titled The Dion Brothers, this light heart with a violent end is a pure joy! <br /> <br /> Where's this movie? I've been searching for it for 30 years. Keach was still great back then, and I'm surprised it didn't have more of a cult afterwards (maybe doing so). These guys are a crack-up with more ambition than brains, but absolutely lovable dudes! A 7 out of 10. If you can dig it up somewhere, you will have fun.
