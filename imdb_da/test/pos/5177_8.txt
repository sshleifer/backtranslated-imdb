Live just down Hwy from Georgetown, Co ... I remember this movie well and thought it was great! The story seems like something John would do even in real life, but there is something that I will always remember most about the movie. For those of you who don't live in Denver ... every Christmas, the city of Denver, Co puts a fabulous display of lights and decorations on the Civic Center in downtown Denver. Well ... when that happened, during the filming of this movie, there was a need for a Nativity scene. So ... it was borrowed from the Civic Center display ... with permission by the way! Someone had forgotten to advise the powers that were and it was reported stolen! A hectic search began with law enforcement for a few days. Finally someone spoke and remembered to lend it to the Georgetown movie staff! It was returned and put back where it belonged! As it turns out ... it wasn't so much in the movie ... you can hardly see it during the Christmas show with the kids. It created interrupting a disturbance though ...
