I've seen this movie about 50 times already and it doesn't look like I'm ever bored. I always see it with my best friend and it has become a kind of tradition for us to see it almost every month. Every time we watch this movie, we both get really emotional and we laugh and cry in front of the TV and sing all the songs in high voice and finally we dance. Now we know almost all the dialogues of heart and watch the movie feel like watching our own old friends on TV. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect! although I have to admit that the story itself is a little cheesy, but the characters, the dance, the music and even the place where it all goes, make you forget about it and you start to believe that things are really happening and that the song "All you need is love" actually has some kind of meaning. I'm really a normal person and not too serious about this comment, but I just can't wait until next time we can see Dirty Dancing.
