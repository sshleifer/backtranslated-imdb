I really enjoyed this movie and I'm not a classic music fan. The story of the harsh street kid who discovered classical music and changed his ways was great to see without being sentimental or unbelievable, though some details had me crabbing my head. (Frankie and his dog can stay in the basement of the school without any of the students or teachers discovering him? Where did he eat? Bathe? Has he ever changed clothes? What has he fed his dog? The owner of the school didn't seem to that it was important to inform the police about finding a missing boy, but let him live in the basement indefinitely? :-)). But we can let such unrealistic details slip and just enjoy the touching, fun and slightly exciting (for me anyway) story and wonderfully talented kids. <br /> <br /> I loved the scene with the mothers standing shoulder to shoulder at the steps that prevent the policemen from entering the school: I doubt they would get away with it today. And I liked the lovely touch about the boy Frankie stealing from turning tables on him (although it never went right anywhere), and Frankie's friends ultimately help him. All in all, a great movie for everyone!
