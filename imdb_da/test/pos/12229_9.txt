A tender movie that represents how our daily lives are a catalyst that makes us change our thoughts, behaviors and feelings to people we are not. This story is a love story where true emotions arise. I credit Malcolm Jamal Warner (Win) and Challen Cates for outstanding performances. A movie that is definitely worth seeing is a holiday road trip that turns into an emotional turn-around. I suggest seeing it.
