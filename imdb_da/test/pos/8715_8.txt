Most of the Brigitte Bardot movies I've seen have failed to take advantage of its captivating screen presence. Unfortunately, she got really good roles in movies of undeniable quality, which was a real supervision. She deserved them and was able to demonstrate her full movie power when they arrived. As Genevieve in "Love on a Pillow", we had a clear exception to the development of light, whimsical cars, for it was an interesting artistic film with a reasonable measure, and in it was a 28-year-old BB with her most appealing. "Une Parisienne" is another who offers an extremely captivating Brigitte in an interesting, well-crafted comedy exploring how an ambitious lady man can be convinced to remain faithful to an incredibly beautiful young woman. There are several good performances here. Her playboy husband, Michel, is a "prince" played by Charles Boyer, another, with entertaining efforts of good support casting. As for Brigitte Bardot, the way she looks at this movie is the way I remember her as a child in the fifties. She was 23 in 1957 and well ahead of her time, more beautiful than any other actress, including Marilyn Monroe. Her curly, coquettish sexuality, abundantly shown in multiple breast-beating, skintight dresses, simply jumps out of the screen. She was more hip and sweet than American women today, nearly fifty years later. Obsessed with their careers and still desperately clinging to feminist politics, they come out as a bunch of clueless lesbians. In stark contrast, the kitten was sexually liberated, intelligent and clearly independent, long before it was fashionable, yet fully understood the power of her unusual femininity, she used it for a higher purpose than merely self-interest - she believed in love. A still image simply couldn't do her justice. You had to look at her slim but successful shape (with her 20-inch waist) easily crossed a room. You had to see the wild blonde mane, staring into her big, brown, seductive eyes, and listening like her full, pouting lips spoke French. In a close-up at the end of this movie she flashes and flirts with the camera, her beautiful orbs twinkling. What a treasure! For fans of Brigitte Bardot, "Une Parisienne" do not miss.
