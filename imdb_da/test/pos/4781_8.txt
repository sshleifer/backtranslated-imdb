This era was not only the beginning of sound in cartoons, but of a cartoon character who would go down in history as the world's most famous mouse. Yes, Mickey makes her debut here in this exciting story about life aboard a steamboat. The animation is good on time, and the plot - although a little simple - is pretty jolly. A real classic and if you ever manage to get it on video, you won't regret it.
