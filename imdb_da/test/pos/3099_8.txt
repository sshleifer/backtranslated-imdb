This is the first of Ma and Pa Kettle's flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in everything she does. Fun to see Ida Moore like Emily, the daffy old lady on the train .. God, she was always old; She was in "Desk Set" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents". Their new house is also a co-star here - it's the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care about. LOVE painting gag. Watch for TOM ... he star in "Nanny & Professor". Unfortunately, he died really young ... oddly enough, his last role was on the "Death Cruise" series. strange. Directed by Charles Lamont, who not only directed several of the Kettle films, he also made a bunch of Abbott and Costello flicks, so he must have known one or two things about comedy. Fun story, plain, simple humor. Even the release date was April Fool's Day, 1949. The story starts by showing us what is behind and the countrymen they are (the neighbors are even Indians), but as the story progresses, we have sympathy and respect for them.
