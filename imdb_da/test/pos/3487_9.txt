A very exciting giallo from the director of "L'Anticristo" (1974) begins this with a brilliantly handled sequence involving a priest, a little girl, and a broken doll. But the most important story is about madman (David Warbeck) to marry a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money. The reason, though not original, is really exciting, the action is good, and there are several skilled and entertaining murders. The result of Francesco de Massi is quite effective, some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's "The New York Ripper" (1982). Highly recommended to fans of Italian cinema!
