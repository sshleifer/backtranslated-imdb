For a movie like this little hidden gem that comes out in the 80s, it is shocking how many people know it. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth a visit. It has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills. I remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but I couldn't remember the name of it, so I came to IMDb some years ago to ask for help finding the title. I eventually got the title of the title and bought the movie. I still love it as much as I did all those years ago. <br /> <br /> buy this movie !!
