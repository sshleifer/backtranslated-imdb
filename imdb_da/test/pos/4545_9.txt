Well, of course, the critics hated it. This is not a movie that goes to the great critical recognition. But the fact is that it is really good. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you don't like it, Chris Farley's physical comedy mark, or David Spades extraordinary peat, you won't like it. But for the rest of us the film has many hilarious, and for that matter, sequences, and the plot is not half as stupid as "Black Sheep". The parts that are not meant to be humorous are actually done well, not what you would expect from a movie of this ilk, and the play is really good. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is without question Chris Farley's best movie. I give it an A and suggest you give it a view.
