For the greatest criticism of the movie ... The love story: It wasn't a love story. There were two people who confused getting together and trying to find humanity in someone. The same thing happened to soldiers and the Russian boy. It added a feminine touch, but now come and look at American movies ... no how close to love story. There was no story: does war have a story? I think this is a stupid criticism. The story is this. They start with 400 men, and the film narrows to show the life of about 10 men and how each one did their part and died. Death is the ultimate end to any story. Just because there wasn't a good ending it doesn't mean it doesn't have any history. <br /> <br /> There was a terrible truth in this movie. I would not necessarily call it "anti-war". Of course, it had a political statement, but the film was not just about politics. In fact, except for a few cases where the captain? appeared, there was never a choking air of Nazi Germany. They were far enough outside the largest Nazi party. The fat cats wouldn't go into Russia! Perhaps not exactly and not a Hollywood hit, but it shows a fine knowledge of the common soldier (I want to say just about any nationality and war) and what to go through. It was a losing battle, of course, the movie will be depressing. And to the person who said it was gutsy (and stupid) to even portray Germans as victims: there are victims on every side of every war (any real soldier tells you that). <br /> <br /> This film is a fine balance between film and documentary. A couple of issues with it when arguing for just one, but it recovers the best of both worlds. See it as such. Beware, because it is a hard movie to see if not graphic, emotionally. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for them to make a film about Iraq. It will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial, I want to see who is having a hard time doing it first. (Jarhead does not count)
