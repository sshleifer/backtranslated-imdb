While my kids enjoyed the movie (and subsequently told them to buy it later), I think I got more from what they did. The scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life (I didn't use the cutter commentary, but I thought so). It's a good, good midlife movie, a bit juicy and some scenes seem less good than others (why does the child stay with Bruce Willis after he knows his mother is dying?) But all in all, good time . It also gave our family something to talk about - did my children think my life was boring? What do they expect at 40? How do you like a movie that has a good conversation with your children?
