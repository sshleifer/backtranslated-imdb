I didn't know who Bruce Haack was before we saw this movie. I had just seen MOOG doc, which was okay, the only problem was Moog led a lot of content life, and doc was good ... content. Haack's story is full of all the negotiable tragedies people buy in these days, but it has a big heart. Although the film does not go so much in the tragic things, one can feel that Bruce accepted the price of making music in his own way. There are so many elements that make up his heritage. The invention of the folkodian, where Bruce could actually play music by touching people. It must have been challenging to document Haack's "scatter-brained" production, which basically fell into every musical category imaginable (even rap music), but the director cut the piece together very coherently and managed to capture the spirit. And thrown ... what a group of characters Bruce spoke to, but what do you expect from a telepathic guru, stumble with children and fight the music industry. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in music history, it's the ordinary, but it's important.
