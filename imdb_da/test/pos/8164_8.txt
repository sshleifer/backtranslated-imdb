Four holy young men from the land of Mormon go to L.A. to preach the gospel to city pagans. But one of the young Mormons is a repressed homosexual who "happens" to cross paths with a very "out" young L.A. (What would film images be without coincidence?). These two very different young men become friends and are in the process of influencing each other's outlook, which in turn creates an inevitable clash between homosexuals and Mormon cultures. It is the prerequisite for "Last Days", a film from 2003, written and directed by C.Jay Cox, even a former Mormon missionary. The history of the film is of course very relevant, especially in modern America. Variations in this story must be told and recalled and resumed, hopefully in future films ... because the underlying theme highlights the hatefully superior attitude that Christian fundamentalists often point to gays. In its nature, "Last Days" is provocative, and I doubt that the film was well received in Provo or Pocatello, although the manuscript is intelligent, sensitive and insight.
