This is a wonderful sequel to the award-winning Lonesome Dove miniseries in the 1980s. This successor may be better than the original. It is certainly more family-friendly. The language is more subdued. There's a lot of violence, and a particular scene with Cherokee Jack is particularly cruel. But generally a good movie. The action is amazing. William Peterson is amazing. Such a great dramatic actor with a quick sense of humor and comic timing. Jon Voight fills the appropriate Tommy Lee Jones' shoes as Captain Call. Ricky Shroder gives a great heartfelt performance as the young boy who grew up with no family to claim him. Highly recommended.
