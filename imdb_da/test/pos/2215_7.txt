"Admissions" is a fine drama, although they are some issues with the end. Lauren Ambrose plays Evie, who tries to avoid college. In order not to pay attention to her overworked mother, she makes poems that everyone thinks her mentally challenged sister wrote. All the actors are top notch especially Lauren Ambrose and Amy Madigan. They both put in great performances. The Climax is also very powerful. There are only two bad parts. First, the character of Stewart Worthy is played by Christopher Lloyd. His part is underdeveloped. The other weakness is the end. It goes around in circles, which I had not expected with 84 min. Operating time. Besides that, the film is definitely worth seeing.
