007's Goldeneye is one of the best N64 releases ever. <br /> <br /> Better than this game? Now ... Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Episode I-Racer and the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is far better and superior game. But I still love Goldeneye. <br /> <br /> This is the best fit from a Star Wars custom movie only. The story is perfect. It's like you're in the movie. <br /> <br /> The graphics are excellent. The movements are extremely realistic. The enemies' artificial intelligence is the best part of this game. I loved playing the scene, where James and Natalya break from the Janus base, as Goldeneye prepares to burn it. Escaping without calling an alarm was very difficult. Exclusive cameras and managing your fire are major aspects of the gameplay. It's also the toughest game I've ever played. N64 games are usually very, very easy. Goldeneye is the only exception. I'm still trying to beat 00 Agent difficult level but winning the lighter levels was already a big win. I loved when Alec Trevelyan asked, "For England James?". I replied, "No, for me!" It happened just the moment I blew him to death. Like in the movie. I love reaching all goals. <br /> <br /> Multiplayer games are even better. First, I was killed every holy second. Now I know how to win. I love to force my playmates by playing on License to Kill. <br /> <br /> The music and sound are amazing. Super Mario 64 is similar to an Atari next to this. The only thing I would still hear was the Goldeneye theme song that is being played at the end of the movie. After Zelda was released, I almost missed missing out on this game. It is still excellent, though it has already been surpassed. I hope other 007 games are produced. <br /> <br /> Great Job Rareware! Nintendo was very smart to omit this game exclusively on the N64. Great job Nintendo!
