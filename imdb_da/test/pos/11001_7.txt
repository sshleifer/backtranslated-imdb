I enjoyed watching Squire Trelane jerk around the crew in this episode, but after a while it all seemed a little too long. Sure, histrionics was a bit of fun for a while, and the end was a pretty good way to pack the whole grip together. I think the problem was that I enjoyed watching Trelane when he was full of bravado and fun, the fun seemed to disappear when Trelane became violent and unpleasant. Talk about a mood killer - go from the unpleasant but gracious host to the guy who judges Kirk to death! But despite this, the episode was entertaining and worth my time. For de-hard Trekkies, this is a must-see, for others it is just a beautiful run of the mill.
