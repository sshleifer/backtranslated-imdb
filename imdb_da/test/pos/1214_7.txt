This was a very good PPV, but as Wrestlemania XX some 14 years later, WWE ran so many battles on it, some of the games were useless. I do not go through all the matches on the card because it would take forever to do so. <br /> <br /> But great highlights included the big pop for demolition that wins the Haku and Andre the Giant roof belts, The first mixed tag battle with Randy Savage and Sensational Queen Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes and the late sapphire and the first breakdown between The Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan. <br /> <br /> Some battles were a waste of time. Just as the Bolsheviks against the Hart Foundation were only about 40 seconds long, Koko B Ware vs. Rick Martel were short and Big Bossman vs. Akeem was too short. <br /> <br /> Mr Perfect vs Brutus Beefcake and Ted DiBiase vs Jake's Snake Roberts were very good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating - B
