Definitely a "must see" for all fans of film noir. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a fine script and sharp, razor-sharp directions, a top casting comes together and acts as a well-oiled watch to produce a crackerjack psychological thriller. <br /> <br /> Wonderful characterizations articulate the film's strong message of racist and religious tolerance. It is difficult and almost unjustified to designate a particular achievement because there is no weak connection throughout the company, but Robert Ryan as the hate meeting and violent white supremacist is really the spine. <br /> <br /> Making this movie in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage. Now, all those years later, at a time when modern films are dominated by a ridiculous abundance of spooky language, just boobs, curvy actors, and deaf soundtracks are refreshing to come back to the basics of quality filmmaking with a display treatment like "Crossfire". <br /> <br /> Another low budget gem from Hollywood archives.
