Beguiled was one of the few early Eastwood movies I hadn't seen before I gave the DVD a spin today. And from that it opens the sepia-fired shot to the macabre climax, I was totally excited. For many filmmakers, these days replace special effects, fast editing and dizzying camera work instead of character-driven stories, but director Don Siegel knew how to get the maximum effect from this relatively simple plot, and the characters are credible and compelling. <br /> <br /> History relates to a ladies finishing school that happens to be at the edge of various skirmishes during the American Civil War. The South Supporting Ladies find a badly wounded EU soldier (Clint Eastwood); nursing him back to health, he begins to manipulate the sexually frustrated women to his own ends. Geraldine Page is excellent in the role of the capital with a secret, and her descent into madness is subtly conveyed. For a movie that largely takes place in a single place, it never loses visual interest. There is even a chance that the normal status quo that has long been abandoned when Eastwood's machinations are uncovered could return; But the mistresses and students fall down on a darker road ... This is a completely different style of film from the same director's Dirty Harry, made in the same year, and yet they are both equally amazing. Eastwood is great to play against his usual stoic anti-hero image, but there is also some mysterious quality attached to his character. We never really learn much about him before his imprisonment, and the viewer is free to determine his well-demanded persona. Villain or victim Whatever you think is all I can say I thoroughly enjoyed it.
