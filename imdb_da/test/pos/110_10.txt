Deepa Mehta's "Fire" is groundbreaking, bold and artistic. A masterful social commentary on women's situation from conservative Indians in the upper middle class, this is a movie no one should miss. Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give star performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible. YEAR. Rahman's music is the work of genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film. Mehta uses Rahman's score and together they create such amazing sound montages that effectively reproduce the world's perceptions about Radha and Sita when they see each other in support. This movie is not about lesbianism, as many have felt it. Lesbianism is only part of the movie. It is unfortunate that most people tend to write the movie without calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning.
