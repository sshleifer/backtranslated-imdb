Lackawanna Blues is and excellent movie. The casting was perfect. Each actor and actress was perfectly suited to the role they played. Their chemistry together was amazing. The action was excellent. I felt I knew the signs. I could almost feel them. They reminded me of people I knew as a child growing up in the 50s and 60s. Oh, the memories !! My personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for everyone to see. I've seen this movie so many times that I can almost recite the lines as the characters tell them. I can't even list my favorite part because I have so many favorite parts. Thanks for getting back some of my youth that I never look at this day and age ... and it's black people who love each other, look at each other, respect each other, care for each other and do everything we can to help each other. Must go now. I'll see it again.
