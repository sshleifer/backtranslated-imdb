Motorama viewers should already be keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Baghdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less take place in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric traces of characters) by author Joseph Minion's comedy, "After Hours." In a kind of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10-year-old boy crates in his frenzy, steals a Mustang and runs away from his grossly neglected parents. It begins as a journey through salvation (which is evident in scenarios with John Diehl), but when he joins a scratched game called Motorama, he is easily defeated by temptations and loses his childish innocence. He travels from a crazy fictional state to another summary way to get Motorama cards from participating gas stations, just as he can spell the award-winning word MOTORAMA and be eligible for the $ 500 million cash prize. <br /> <br /> Along the way, he has been struggling with dozens of weird characters such as Flea, playing a high-powered bus fighter, Meatloaf playing a crazy cyclist, and Mary Woronov and Sandy Baron (a Seinfeld regular) as two violent kidnappers. <br /> <br /> The DVD renovation can be very misleading, just as previous attempts to sell this movie to the non-cult market first with taglines compare it with Home Alone and Thelma & Louise. The latest one calls it a love story with the roofline, which means that the film is about Jordan Michael Christopher on a fairy tale to meet the dream girl ... who, despite the size of her picture on the DVD cover, is actually only about 1 second cameo by Drew Barrymore as the fantasy girl that Gus dreams of. Why didn't they just market what it was? Thought it might seem bizarre at first view, it's actually a well-designed tale. <br /> <br /> Motorama is great material for fans of strange b-grade comedies. This was quite an interesting story, and especially because of the strength of its lead role - Jordan Michael Christopher (unfortunately few other screen credits) - and the clever metaphor associated with the plot. Hopefully its re-release on DVD will make it easier to find cult fans.
