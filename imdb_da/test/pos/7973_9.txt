This is certainly one of the best western films produced in the new millennium. It is a tribute to all the stars of the major television western classics, and that is the ultimate revival of the Western movie. The story of two brothers who meet after the war between states and end up on different sides of the law is nothing new but interesting, and shootouts and the atmosphere are good. There is some graphic violence that bad guys are carved to death with an ax or women being shot down in cold blood, and Lee Majors does not participate in the action at all, so I gave it 9 out of 10 points. But it's still one of the best new western productions I've ever seen. I have had the honor and pleasure of meeting Chris McIntyre at the West Festival and having a good conversation with him, and I have had the chance to meet Buck Taylor, who performs the role of city physician. In my opinion, we should be very much committed to Chris McIntyre for his efforts to bring together the many stars of the classic television westerners and SASS around him to perform in a new Western like this. Chris has an excellent talent for choosing the right actors for the protagonists as well. Both are young and promising, and I think we should see more of them in future Western productions. I sincerely enjoyed this western movie - it was worth every minute. I hope Chris McIntyre will continue to work on other Western films and present us with some more amazing productions like this one. Good work, Chris! Jasper P. Morgan (Pete)
