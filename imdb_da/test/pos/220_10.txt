After reading all these reviews I am very surprised to see that no one has ever noticed that this show was based on 195C to 1960 NBC police "M Squad" with Lee Marvin, I read reviews comparing it to "Dragnet "and some of the Quinn Martin police show, but if you see M Squad, you see it was based on it. At the end of the 1958 episodes of M Squad and beyond, you can see Lee Marvin, who plays lieutenant Frank Ballinger, comes out of his car and then hes shot and he shoots back, the start of Police Squad is pretty much the same ( including Jazz music), and then Lee Marvin tells what's going on (Im Lieutenant Detective Frank Ballinger, M Squad, a special department in the Chicago police) and in the Police Squad Leslie Neilsen does the same (Im Detective Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Squad, a special department of the police ministry) etc. in one of the M Squad episodes, there is even Johnny the shoeshine guy character and in an M Squad episode entitled "More Deadly" there is a Police Squad episode titled "A Substantial Gift (The Broken Promise ", which is the same story!
