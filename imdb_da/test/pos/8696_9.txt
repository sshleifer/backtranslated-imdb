So many early British audio movies that I've watched video suffer from either poor transfer quality or poor sound or both. Fortunately, I could get a copy of this movie on a video of excellent quality so I could focus on the story itself. <br /> <br /> And an outstanding story was that. At first glance, the passengers on the fake bus looked like a rather boring party (except the always lovely Jessie Matthews). But when the film went back to show each passenger's story on the day before the accident, I discovered that the cast, unlike the original look, was a talented group of artists, skillfully aimed to bring a real individuality to their characteristic characterizations. <br /> <br /> Viewers can have different preferences about which two passengers will face a tragic end and which will survive. But the film holds your interest as it keeps you guessing. This movie deserves a much wider audience - a true gem of the early British cinema.
