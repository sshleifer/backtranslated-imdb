All I can say after watching DVDs in the first season is that I can't believe that NBC "green-lighted" this show. It is as different as it is currently stored for Lost. Those who miss X-Files can just have a worthy successor. Not as mysterious or intense as Lost, I think it's generally more entertaining. <br /> <br /> This kind of extended story is hard to make. I think it can degenerate into childish dribbling if most of the elements do not coincide. But what they do and I think the cast is excellent, sharp writing, placement and props first rate, and the special effects are very good for a television budget. Sure it pushes what is plausible, but as it makes it never so silly to insult your intelligence. Bottom line is that this is a fantastic Sci-Fi drama for the whole family. I doubt it will be a classic with a long time like X-Files, but in the meantime I recommend getting the DVD if you missed it as I did the first time. In this case, I have to see shows have just risen with another series! PS: I just heard it was shot from NBC ... Here Sci-Fi hopes to pick it up.
