Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has a poor flight for over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flight. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers), and the two start an action with planes and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is wounded, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over and falls for his brother's boyfriend. Then things get exciting and terribly dreadful. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pre-code due to several reasons. First, Jim and Jill have completed their relationship without being married and do not intend to have a wedding. Secondly, Eilers is shown in her underwear and very limited scene when the production code came into force. <br /> <br /> This movie does not jump to the dramatic love triangle and therefore ends up bittersweet.
