I would rate this movie aloud on my list of Ingrid Bergman films. Ingrid's beauty aside is her talent clearly in scene after stage. She was sad, genius, flirtatious, nice fun, loving, tender, carefree, distressed, happy, etc. You say that, she was all these things and more. -Also <br /> <br /> compelling. Ingrid plays a notorious woman (Clio) who returns to New Orleans and falls to Texas Gambler, Gary Cooper (Clint). I especially loved the scene where they sit at the dining table and say nothing, just staring at each other. She in an elegant white dress and he in a beautiful white cowboy <br /> <br /> outfit and sat there watching her adoringly. What chemistry! What love!
