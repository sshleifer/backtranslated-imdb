The plot of this movie is not complicated. A very attractive young girl goes to Europe because of the reasons for her older sister's suicide ten years earlier. There she meets with her sister's former girlfriend and together they travel to all the places where her sister went, and gradually the causes become clear. <br /> <br /> But what makes this movie so special and hovering over the limited plot is the beautiful depictions of the characters. Although the older sister's boyfriend is a drop-out hippie, he has noble ideals, moral standards, and incredible strengths. And even though the older sister we see in flashbacks shares these ideals, she doesn't have a sense of limitation or balance, how much there is too much. And even though the younger girl is extremely loyal to her sister's memory, she gradually finds the strength that her sister was only a normal girl. The most special moment in the movie is when the young girl and sister's girlfriend finally stops fighting their attraction to each other. I can't remember ever seeing more beautiful, touching, romantic tenderness in a movie! In all these ways, this is a really beautiful movie, a movie that has to be appreciated and seen over and over again. 9 out of 10
