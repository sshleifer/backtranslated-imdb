The inspiration for this movie was the fact that American gangsters are good dresses, but the Aussies. Well, when you might kill a guy as soon as you look at the flash, then you can dress as hard as you like and people won't criticize you. <br /> <br /> Jimmy is a fighter, an illegal boxer, sometimes bouncing and offered work by Pando, the local gangster chief of the cross (it is Australia's infamous Kings Cross District, not the cross in London fame as many a British backpacker find out the hard way). Because of the emotions of love, he behaves a lot, loses a lot of money and has to come to Pando before Pando and his weight can kill him. <br /> <br /> Lots of dark humor, interesting action, revelations about Australia's underside and human nature. It is very centered in the Australian nature and examines the nature of Australian criminals (as opposed to the American and British). One problem is that each of the elements in the story does not have enough fabric and depth, but it is a painting with broad lines that covers many areas that are not covered earlier, so as an overall package it is worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Keep up with "Chopper" and "Dirty Deeds" for your Aussie Crime party or "Lock ware and two smoking barrels" and "Miller's Crossing" for an international that falls outside of criminal gangs party . <br /> <br /> That way, Bryan Brown is a great actor who has just made a huge number of really bad movies. Here's one of his amazing movies.
