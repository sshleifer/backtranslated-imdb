This kind of entertainment is needed in our modern world. You can see "Ma and Pa" in adults, with your family (children, age or just by yourself like me. They are gentle but gentle are so refreshing in a society of children killing children, a terrible war, inappropriate prime tv and poverty.We do not even get a hint about where all these kids came from! Give me modern plumbing and i would like to become a boiler Humor does not require offensive language It is difficult to follow conversations in shows where each Second word is soft, relax, take your shoes off and clothe your recliner with a good old-fashioned glass of lemonade, and just breathe easily to see Ma swept the chickens from the table at lunchtime!
