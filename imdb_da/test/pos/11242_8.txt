I can't say this show is perfect. Perhaps everyone remembers the previous commentary on the old Tuesday 10:30 slot occupied by the childish humor of Butch Elvira Curt ("There is a space shuttle humping a 747!"). Oh, the glory of love to hit any button on the remote to make it change. <br /> <br /> Face, comedy can't draw a showcase and create the comic genius of the truly Canadian Trailer Park Boys. But hey, they try. <br /> <br /> This show is by far one of the better original shows. However, none of the following will live on the apparent "players" showing their stupidity by capturing girls: <br /> <br /> a) "stupid" girls - of course, they can't realize they're like the girls on the show . Ignorant. Go on the man's meat, you can call yourself a whore tomorrow and get his name. He looks good, he must be popular and beautiful. HAHAHAHA !!! Oh, but you would never do it! No one would ... if they knew it happened <br /> <br /> b) Unsocial guys who think women like fine guys - Of course, seeing these guys succeed with what you fail or don't even come to To experience, you can cook your prime flavors. Look closer, they are shot down for most of the time. They say stupid crap. <br /> <br /> c) girls respecting each other - apparently seeing your separate distinct female species caught in real-life situations is wrong wrong. No one is being played. Women are not objects, they cannot be played because they are all very faithful angels who need clubs to talk politely with each other without fear of guys trying to pick them up. <br /> <br /> Oh wait ... hmmmmmmmm <br /> As much as EVERYTHING means this show is not fun, and it doesn't teach you anything, I have to take the opposite side . The show is very good in detail on how the conditions work for both men and women. The way they think and the way they think of each other thinks of and the social hierarchy. It's fun to see and hear the guys making quite idiotic comments on things women say ("My grandfather recently died" "Oh ... Well, we're having fun tonight?"). Moreover, its a club. The place people go to have fun and get laid. No matter who you are, you need to go to a club to get or pay attention to someone. Guys go there to test their games and pick up girls. Girls go there to flirt with guys and find the one who sweeps her off her feet best. List! <br /> <br /> If you are a guy, learn a thing or two about different approaches and the different effects they have. If you're a girl, learn what these "studly" hairstyles really like, and learn to tell them apart from real guys. The next time you are broken up by one of these douchewads, don't realize because of him because you're stupid and thought he was the greatest guy ever since he was clearly a dick to you all the time
