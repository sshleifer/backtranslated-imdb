UK-born Australian helmsman Alex Frayne demands attention with his strange necessity of a meticulously read, visually stunning modern love (2006). The following steps of a man who is unable to control a drastic change of personality, prompted by the death of a close-up, provide a fascinating study of human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film Australia. John (Mark Constable), his wife Emily (Victoria Hill) and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small southern town to take care of their deceased uncle's (Don Barker) property. While Emily and Edward check in at a local hotel, John begins to ask the locals about Uncle Tom's death - some say he committed suicide, some are unwilling to speak. Confused John comes up with his own theory - Uncle Tom lives and well hides in the nearby bushes. <br /> <br /> Unless occasional dialogs used to ease its heavy atmospheric tone, Modern Love could easily be mistaken for a Sokurov movie. Shot with a 16mm camera, its leached color scheme is strangely evocative of the Russian director's reflective assumptions in human pain. Perhaps it is no coincidence that it was at Moscow's international film festival, where Modern Love had its premiere. <br /> <br /> Looking under the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visuals, however, reveals a slightly different image - while Sokurov's film tends to remain painfully intimate, to a point where they deliberately detach the protagonists from the surrounding environment by blurring everything in a big splash of the director's favorite yellow, modern love that gives birth to the Australian landscape. John's gradual psychological transformation depends on it, and the more the story progresses, it becomes clear that nature was an integral part of Frayn's vision. <br /> <br /> In Sokurov's second circle, a young man returns to the Russian landscape to bury his deceased father In the cabin where the old man once lived, everything is covered with dust. He gathers the few old clothes scattered around and places his father's body in a coffin. Then he asks goodbye and bury it. The rest of the film is a prolonged reflection on the collapse of the Soviet Union, the loneliness and dissatisfaction that many left behind. <br /> <br /> In Modern Love, there is something ironic enough that love is not present. On the contrary, it is pain, loneliness, and dissatisfaction with "modernity" that suddenly invades John's life. Unlike the other circle, here the protagonist has the opportunity to transform his modern life. His wife and son await him, yet he goes away. Slowly but surely, the present begins to fall under the weight of a somewhat confusing past. I doubt Frayne, who is meant for modern love, to be so strikingly similar to what Sokurov did in the second circle. The pacing, and especially the confusing framing, is exactly what transforms this movie into a near meditative experience - a difficult and tremendous crazy approach to the deconstruction of human psychology that the two directors have mastered to perfection. <br /> <br /> Mark Constable delivers a premium performance as John adds even greater depth to his highly challenging character. His facial expression is excellent. Both Victoria Hill and William Traeger match perfectly with their performances pic-tense visual style.
