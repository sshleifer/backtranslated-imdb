From the difference I knew it was going to be a great movie, the pace, the cinematography, the personalities native to the Dallas area, the spreading of characters, not least the director Oliver Stone and of course Eric Bogasian ... The movie starts on a Friday (suggests occult initially) and starting with a radio station in Dallas that hosts their number one talk show, The Barry Champlain Show (Based on Talk Radio Host Alan Berg) ... Barry (Eric Bogasian) is the weary radio talk show host and his job is such that it is mandatory to pontificate all the sensationalist nuances of the radio audience feeding in his show ... He is trying to commiserate with a lot of communities departing beaten lonely, vulnerable, indecent phone callers who have the masochistic desire to stay public disappearance, Barry Champlain is effective at dealing with this insecure ilk, by socially pursuing them, rather than simply subjecting them to mere admonition ... New techno logos serve a stigmatized purpose for the Dallas radio audience, and the key concepts take a back seat to perversion, talk of "baseball scores, orgasms, and people's pets !!" It's all a cacophony of drug-induced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia !! This high-profile gun liner is something that Barry Champlain thrives on !!! The overdue patos, the fake prosecutions that deviate from the institutions and puveyors of pornography and the overall pop culture problems, serve as fleeting ammunition for Barry Champlain's styled battlefield! <br /> <br /> The setting for this movie is perfect because there is a two thousand foot drop in ideology. In the center of Dallas, there is an indulgent sense of cosmopolitan awareness, leaving 20 miles away an important chapter in the Ku Klux Clan !! ... The game is based in Denver, this is where the actual story takes place, other small theater games depict the cities of Louisville, Atlanta and Cleveland. Dallas is the city where the movie takes place, I thought it was an excellent choice !! ... This film illustrates how people have a horrid and erroneous and deadly misunderstanding of the Jewish people in America, controlling the banks, their agenda is different from everyone else, and their intellectual literature leads to perversion !! These pre-determined performances compound Barry Champlain's overall dilemma !!! Barry Champlain's personal undoing is that he is irascible and non-responsive to his alcoholism, and his abrasive and politically controversial character is his ultimate extermination, which is what makes the film so credible! <br /> <br /> The characters in the movie were well portrayed, Dan, tailored to the middle-hat hatchet man (played by Alec Baldwin), who constantly watched Barry Champlains every move !! .. Laura, his girlfriend, also his producer, will constantly feel that Barry is one who is always misunderstood !! Ellen, his former wife, is the recipient of Barry's anxiety and selfishness, but cannot completely renounce his feelings for Barry regardless of the personal destruction path he is gaining in! The Dallas radio audience is a melting pot of socially misplaced retro assets, denied by their own real shortcomings !!! ... In part, everyone's suspension, including Barry Champlain's own suspension, is what Barry Champlain is in! ! His audience suffocates depravity, demands improvement and ultimately Barry Champlains pet project for ordained sinners !! Social culture conflicts will be Barry Champlain's demise !! <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing !! In my opinion, Oliver Stone's best picture, including Platoon and Natural Born Killers. This statement in itself tells you how magnificent a Talk Radio movie is. The story counseling and collaborative production of Eric Bogosian is simply compelling !! The camera's angles, the dialogue, the scary character images, all in top. The cinematography of the Dallas skyline at the end of the movie is amazing !! Dallas has the dubious distinction of being considered a megamethrop ... So now, like in Los Angeles and New York, there are crumbling baby cases for many to count, cheap homes from hell and budget cuts that will mean that there will be a significant number of people who will be dead at this time next year !!!! ... Dallas claims it is a major metropolitan state in the uncertain way in which human degradation prevails !! The city has the lynching radio listeners who have given a pejorative spin to the wonder of nationwide air wave communication !! It's the culprits in the movie !! The ghoulish tabloid derelicts who want to meet the big bad wolf and their decadent curiosity have morally wiped out "The Last Neighborhood in America"
