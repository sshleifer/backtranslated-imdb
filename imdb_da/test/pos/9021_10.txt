In this movie "Virtual Sexuality", 17-year-old Justine is not in love. One day when she gets up, she joins her friend to a viral reality conference where she is introduced with a machine that can change your look, dody and whatever you want in Virtual Reality. She decides to try it out, but starts making a girlfriend herself, her dream day. Then there is suddenly an explosion in a gas pipe, and her creation comes to life. I'm no longer saying you'll have to watch the movie, which is quite fun to watch.
