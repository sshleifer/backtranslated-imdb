_The Wild Life_ has an obvious resemblance to _Fast Times at Ridgemont High_, and _The Wild Life_ comes up short. <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> Some other city wrote the above comment. Of course, the wild life is not Ridgemont. Ridgemont is the quarterly 80's tile. However, the wild life is fun if you are not whiny about mindless movies that are mindless movies (especially when you know it should be a thoughtless movie at first). The little Latino from Scarface is in this movie and he is just disrespectful ("I have Visa ... Masterrrrr Charrrrge !!") The Colonel also makes a look ("trial ..."). RIP The Colonel 1931-1997. <br /> <br /> This movie is no worse than a 6 compared to other genres, btw. It's no worse than a 7 in the form of other 80's teen comedies on it. It has the very feel of a Cameron Crowe movie. Only stanels gave it a 5.
