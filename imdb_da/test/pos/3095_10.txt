You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this movie whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with pictures of planes landing at an airport, a plane after another diving into a miraculous track. You can just guess that this movie is not about a "story". At first viewing, it is even easy to believe that the initial images are repeated shots of the same plane. The original drama is in urgency of your perception, which is based on your will to experience the movie just as a series of images. If after this opening you will see the movie, you will not be bored. You can even be fascinated. The movie can be an emotional experience; it can be an intellectual experience; It can be both. Judging from the DVD comment, which is crucial, was primarily an emotional experience for Herzog, and at one point he explicitly speaks about how the film is a collaboration between the filmmaker and the viewer. There is plenty of room for the viewer to make this movie exactly what he or she will do about it. Take a gamble?
