To keep it as simple as possible. This is a very good show. It is well written and has a fantastic cast. It is not filled with blood and gut. And centering on a disgraceful policeman and his relationship with his former wife, his son, his former partner (Andre Braugher), his childhood wife, now a priest (George Dzunzda) and finally the person who enters his hack in that episode . You will probably find something like this in your city NO. Is this still a good story YES. And it's nice to see a man portrayed as a good father despite his mistakes. See more than one (2-3) and you will see why many of us are hooked on this show. And thank you David Morse for making this character so interesting. Another good job!
