One of the best TV shows out there, if not the best. Why? Simple: It's hard to show real life in prison without clich√©s and predictable terms. This is not Prison Break or any other show that actually compares to the Oz show Sopranos resembles a children's story. Profanity, curse, shootings of explicit violence and use of drugs, vile scenes of male sexual organs and rapes ... all this and more in Oz. But this is not the best part of Oz; the characters are the strongest point in this show; they are all excellent and not annoying, even though we are looking at brutal criminals. The actors are excellent, my favorite is the actors playing Ryan O'Reilly and Tobias Beecher because they are so unique and completely change their behavior. And most of all ... they have no remorse for their actions. Overall ... Oz is a great show, the best out there. Forget about CSI and show off stupid doctors ... this is the deal ... OZ!
