Terry and June in my mind is a completely classic, along the line of blessed this house with the late side james and the late diana coupland, but terry scott will unfortunately be missed even though he died in 1994. i have all the dvds up to press and i am looking forward to getting all 9, also would be nice to see "happy after ever" released on dvd <br /> <br /> June whitfield continues to be strong and terry scott will always live in my memory <br / > <br /> Terry Scott Rip there are not many comedies today that I can think of that will remain in the legend list and yes the middle class comes on some people's wicks, but I don't mind, I think it would be brilliant to see a party at Terry Scott's life
