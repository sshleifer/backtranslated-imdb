This movie is absolutely gold. If you haven't seen it, do it. Mani Ratnam expands again. This movie also introduced me to Nandita Das, though everyone shines in this movie. My only regret is that I have never found a copy with subtitles for the song's lyrics. We are led from the jungle of northern Sri Lanka to the serene beaches of southern India, as well as from the terror of war to the ultimate conquest of love for the human heart. Beautiful, subtle, witty, with a few hidden surprises waiting for the viewer, this movie stands out to be seen again and again, and the story of the story, The Paraply, is done as well as we see the scene unfolding from drawings in a book . Lovely. See it.
