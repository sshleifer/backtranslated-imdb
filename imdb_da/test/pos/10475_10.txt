Some have commented that the subtitles are not a problem in this movie - I ask to be different - disturbances in facial expressions and subtle interactions between the characters are such that you cannot afford to take your eyes off even in a fraction of a second. I tried to look at the DVD in English to overcome this problem (don't make this mistake, the result is a travesty). The only way to get the full benefit is to see it two or three times quickly so you know it and ignore the subtitles. An actress master class - not in the dialogue, but body language. <br /> <br /> It's the little things - the postmaster / shopkeeper blows out of the chest and goes in for the hat before sending a letter from! France! The general's confused expression as his joy in a bunch of perfect grapes evokes a biblical reference with a depth worthy of being there. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is amazing and the gloomy minimalist village with its washed out color just highlights the party's opulence when it comes. I have a friend who claims to be descended from Borgias and whose family motto is 'If it is worth doing, it is worth doing for excess' - Amen. <br /> <br /> I laugh a lot and cry every time I see this movie
