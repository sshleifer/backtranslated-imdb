The 20th animated Disney classic is often criticized by many as "mediocre" or poor in quality, but it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Too bad that "The Aristocats" doesn't get the deserved credit. I see it personally as one of my favorite Disney classics. <br /> <br /> Despite being extremely undervalued, it is one of the funniest Disney classics. It is full of fun (some of them hysterical) moments. <br /> <br /> Edgar, the greedy butler, is the villain of the movie, but he's a perfect comic relief. He's one of my favorite Disney villains because he's so funny. <br /> <br /> Every scene with Edgar and dog dogs Napoleon and Lafayette chasing him is among the most fun you will ever see, especially one when Edgar drives his motorcycle in the river and around the bridge, with the dogs chasing him . It's hysterical! <br /> <br /> But the classic humor comes not only from Edgar or the dog's dogs. Other characters have their moments as well. <br /> <br /> The quality subject is not perfect, but remains at a high level. Even after Walt Disney's death, these artists knew how to be faithful to Walt's spirit and "Aristocats" is one of those examples. They don't make them like these today! <br /> <br /> As usual, legendary Disney actors tell the characters. In this case we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram. The people are cool in general: Thomas O'Malley, Duchess and her 3 kittens, the mouse Roquefort, the spawning cats, the English geese, the dog's dog and the horse. The human figures are also included: the eccentric and friendly retired opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, the comedian Madame's old lawyer Georges Hautecourt and Edgar himself! <br /> <br /> About the soundtrack it has some good and captivating songs as such as Thomas O'Malley's theme (but I can't remember his name), "Everybody Wants to be a Cat" and "The Aristocats" (sung by Maurice Chevalier), for example. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in Paris (France) in the year 1910. Above all, this is a joyous, beautiful and very comfortable movie. A timeless classic, which is often underestimated and forgotten, but worth much. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be on the Top 250.
