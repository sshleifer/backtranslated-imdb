Gemini effect is a vampire martial arts movie available in Cantonese with English subtitles. It is a Jackie Chan production, and he does a special guest work, although not for those who liked Shanghai Noon / Knights and the other recent Hollywood flicks he has become known for, this movie is much more special than that. br /> It was originally called The Vampire Effect, but as a very popular Chinese female pop duo called The Twins (Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung) took the two leading roles the title was changed to cash on their fame. The movie will appeal to three types of audiences: those who love martial arts films, those who love vampire movies and those who fall into the Hollywood slot games, generally go out. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for the movie is that the vampires are aware and a secret society seeks to hunt them before we all taste the undead. This bloody work is done by some martial artists who drink some vampire blood to give them the edge they need, yes it must be thirsty work! Things go pretty much to the course until a particularly scary European vamp finds out that if he gets a set of keys held by all the vampire princes, he can walk around in sunlight, etc. And generally eat whenever he wants. To say more on the plot would ruin the pleasure of watching the movie. The twins consist of an assigned vampire slayer (Chung) and another sister (Choi). It's the twins who really do the movie; with some of the freshest and funniest plays. The fighting scenes they perform are fast and furious and well choreographed with a mix of real athletic and thread work. To add cherries to the cake, the twins are both pretty nice to see as well. <br /> <br /> The direction is sharp and the manuscript is sharp. There are only 3 things that let this movie down: makeup for the vampires is pretty bad, Jackie Chan seems to be in the movie, just for hell of it and adds nothing to the content, and some of the slapstick comedy tries by the male vampire hunter is quite lame. Fortunately, the twins edit the day with an originality for the film, which is usually only found in European films. The best scene for me was one of them (Choi) who only communicated by screaming, her ability to convey her thoughts through this medium was a comical joy. There are many other touches of originality in this movie - I especially liked the coffin complete with surround sound stereo and TV screen! And it's the movie's many original touches and actors who stop this from being a tired old flop and making it a must see movie.
