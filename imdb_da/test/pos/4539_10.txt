This is one of my favorite movies all the time. Pretty pathetic you say? Well, yes it is. But Chris is amazing, incredibly fun. His innocent brilliance comes out in this movie more than in any of his other films. Look at both motel scenes when Spade gets caught with the zipper down, and the other: "I GO BACK FOR GOD'S LOVE !!!"
