Since the amazing `Prime Suspect 'series reaches part four, there is no loss of momentum, it is in itself a significant achievement.' Prime Suspect IV: The Lost Child 'has the solid support cast that we take for granted in these British dramas, but of course, beautiful Helen Mirren dominates easily. Our eyes never leave her while on the screen. The search for the title's lost child leads the superintendent Jane Tennison's CID team to a major suspicion that turns out to be a doomed pedophile who now lives with a single mother and her two young daughters. The insight we get in his mind is one of the emotional highlights of this mini-series, but it can be too strong for many stomachs. The action sequences are handled brilliantly with the handheld camera right in the middle of the voltage, and there are gripping tensions during the climax siege. All in all, this is another magnificent political procedure drama.
