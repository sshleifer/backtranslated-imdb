I rate this a 8 because of the film's premise. The action was fine, no one stood out as fantastic or appalling. It is worryingly true that intelligent people have fewer and smaller children, or choose to have none at all ... while stupid ass "W in '04" followers grow like rabbits. And although I don't believe that the earth will actually exist for 500 years, I can see that Mike Dommer's parodied prophet is going to be like life imitating art. The world is driven by idiots, and it will get worse as the intelligent thinking people become the minority and the "git is finished" fans exceed them. The proof is our farce for a choice. <br /> <br /> But I'm going down. If you are lucky enough to have this game in your city, you should see it. I paid my $ 7.50 plus popcorn to watch FAR WORSE waste than this (Date Movie or Napoleon Dynamite anyone?). There are laughs that are curls, but generally it is entertaining. If you have half a brain, you will think about yourself how this movie, although fun, is spot on (exactly) and a * little * bit creepy. I'm not surprised at all that this movie is almost completely unknown when Fox was the one who distributed this and they didn't want any of their get to see this and think "maybe I'll read a book and don't see "Next" or "Cheaters" or "Ow my balls". "If our society does not stop the depression of everything and the English language's bastardization (ahem, Mr. Bush), then this is where we are going.
