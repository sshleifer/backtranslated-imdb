SPOILERS A Jewish Frodo? Yes, it's Elijah Wood again. <br /> <br /> Ever since Elva Wood Woods conclusions, which Frodo has found it increasingly difficult to get away from the big part. By playing a football hooligan, a psychopath and now a young Jewish American, Wood has tried every route he can to escape this type of test. Now, with "everything is enlightened" he can finally have achieved this. Playing a role that is not as radical as other efforts, he really comes to the soul of his character. Yet it is not like Wood does it alone. Aided by a magnificent adaptation of first-time director Liev Schreiber and a wonderful achievement by novice Eugene Hutz, Wood has found a magnificent production to spread his wings. "Everything is Illuminated" is a magnificent, moving piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Safran Foer (Wood), a young American Jew, embarks on Ukraine to find the mysterious girl who saved her grandfather and helped him come to America Arriving in the country, Jonathan meets all the talking, all dancing Alex (Hutz) and his racist grandfather (Boris Leskin). Traveling across the country, the three slowly learn more and more about the history and relationships that Alex and Jonathan never knew existed. <br /> <br /> It's a weird feeling when the movie progresses in the second chapter (it's actually divided into four superiors). The first part, while occasionally a little fun, is mostly serious and intense. So when we get a short story about Alex and his family in the second part, it's a weird move to switch from serious to fun. It doesn't quite work, but when the film progresses, it certainly teaches that it is lesson, as this mix of humor and sadness fuses finer when time goes by. <br /> <br /> For the ultimate credit for all involved as history continues, we begin to fall for the characters more and more. Elijah Wood is magnificent, Boris Leskin is so intense and strong that it raises questions why Hollywood has never noticed him. Most notable of all, however, is the newcomer Eugene Hutz. Hutz plays an intensely restless character and is absolutely brilliant. He shows the split between his family and the real world with almost perfect skill, and when his character communicates with Wood, you really connect with him at a deeper level. Without Hutz, the story is so strong that the film will still be magnificent, but with him it hits the next level. <br /> <br /> As a debut for the actor, director Liev Schreiber, history is also a brilliant piece to start. A passionate work (Schreiber's grandfather himself an immigrant to America), he really manages to embrace the feelings of the content and by presenting us with some really beautiful scenes and some amazing shots, he really manages to come home. The last half hour is especially so beautifully created that it is a challenge for a tear that should not form in any viewers. It's a moving story, and with Schreiber's help it becomes even more powerful. <br /> <br /> Constructed with love from a passionate instructor, "Everything is Illuminated" is a beautiful piece. A road story with a difference, it is wonderfully acted and wonderfully written. It's a movie that everyone should see, and it's the perfect way for Elijah Wood to finally put Frodo to rest.
