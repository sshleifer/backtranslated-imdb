There is a sign of The Lost Highway that says: <br /> <br /> * STORE SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> (but you already knew that, right?) <br /> /> Then There are many people who apparently did not get the point with this movie, I would like to contribute with my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense. As others have pointed out, a single view of this movie is not sufficient. If you have a DVD from MD, you can "cheat" by looking at David Lynch's "Top 10 Hints for Unlocking MD" (but only at second or third view, thank you.);) <br /> <br /> First of Everything, Mulholland Drive is really brilliant. A masterpiece. It's the kind of movie that refuses to leave your head. Not often are the comments on the DVDs very accurate, but Vogue's "It comes within your head and stays there" really hit the mark. <br /> <br /> David Lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look - cinematically, has a great actress (especially Naomi Watts), a joking soundtrack of Badalamenti, and a very dreamlike quality to it - but it is also possible to involve the viewer in such a way that getting movies has before. (When is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldn't leave you and everyone felt compelled to talk and write about, whether they liked it or hated it?) <br /> <br /> All in all, enough about everything it is time to justify these statements. <br /> <br /> Most people who have gone through an effort to assemble the plot will come to the conclusion that the first half of the image is an illusion / dream sequence. Of course, it is too bad for anyone trying to make sense of the movie by expecting "traditional" methods where the story is laid out in a timely, logical and linear way for the viewer. But for those who expect it, I urge you to check the director's name and come back again. ;) <br /> MD is the story of the sad death of Diane Selwyn, a wannabe actress, hopelessly in love with another actor, Camilla Rowles. Due to Diana's lack of talent, she is constantly struggling to advance her career and is unable to deliver alone and parental expectations. By realizing that Camilla will never be her (C. gets engaged to Adam Kesher, the instructor), she hires a hitman to get rid of her and then has to deal with the guilt he produces. <br /> <br /> The movie first starts with what may seem like a strange opening to this kind of thriller; which is 50's dance / jitterbug contest, where we can see the main character Betty gives a good performance. We also see an older couple (which we will see twice more in the film) with her and applaud her. <br /> <br /> No, wait. That's what most people see the first time they see it. There is actually another very important fact that is given before the credits - the camera moves into an object (though it is blurred) and the scene quickly fades out. If you look closely, the object is actually a cushion that reveals that what follows is a dream. The main characters are seen in the first half of the movie: <br /> <br /> Betty: Diane Selwyn's imaginary self, used in the first half of the movie, which constitutes the "dream sequence" - a positive depiction of a successful, hopeful young actor (all opposite of Diane). 'Betty' was chosen as the name, as it is the right name for a waitress at Winkies. Note that in the dream version, the waitresses name is 'Diane'. <br /> <br /> Drawing: The Fantasy version of Camilla Rhodes, which, through Diana's dream and using an imaginary car accident, has turned into an amnesiac. This makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diana's love. She is then conveniently located in Betty's Diane's most luxurious home, which Betty has been allowed to live in. <br /> <br /> Coco: In fact, Adam's mother. In the dream medium, the woman in charge of the apartment that Betty is staying in. She is mainly a strong figure of authority, as can be seen in both parts of the film. Adam: The director. We know from the second half that he is engaged to Camilla. His only purpose in being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a bag for Betty / Diane as she develops such hate against him. Aunt Ruth: Diana's true aunt, but instead being out of town, she's actually dead. Diane inherited the money back from his aunt and used it to pay for Camilla's murder. <br /> <br /> Mr. Roach: A typical Lynchian character. Not genuine; appears only in Diana's dream sequence. He is a mysterious, influential person who manages the event chain in the dream of the wheelchair. He serves much of the same function as the backward dwarf (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> Hitman: The person killing Camilla. This character is basically the same in both parts of the movie, although it is done in a slightly more foggy way in the dream sequence (more below). Now we have established the different versions of the characters in the film, we can start to dive into the plot. Of course, I will not go into every detail (nor will I put it out chronologically), but I will try to explain some of the important scenes to Lynch's hint sheet. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, Camilla was re-produced as amnesiac through its unlikely survival of a car accident in the first 10 minutes of the film, which left her completely vulnerable. What I found very exciting with MD is that Lynch constantly gives hints about what's real and what's not. I have already mentioned the camera that moves into the pillow, but note how there are two cars running in each lane approaching the lime. <br /> <br /> Only one of the cars actually hit the lime; what about the other? Even if they were away from the accident themselves, would they not try to help the others, or at least require help? My theory is that since this is a dream, the presence of the other car has just been set aside and forgotten. The page, which Rogert Ebert so blessed puts it "Like real dreams, does not explain it, does not complete its sequences, dwells on what it finds fascinating, rejects unfamiliar plotlines." <br /> <br /> Shortly after Rita crawls down from the crash site at Mulholland Dr. and going her down the hill and sneaking into Aunt Ruth's apartment, Betty comes and we see this scary old couple running away, staring ghoulish at each other and laughing at themselves and the camera. This is the first indication that what we see is a nightmare. Although the old couple seem to be unknown to Betty, I think they are actually her parents (when they greeted her at jitterbug competition). Perhaps she did not know them so well, and did not have as good a relationship with them as she wanted, so the couple is shown to be very comfortable and helpful to her in the dream. They also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder and Diana's sense of failure to meet her unattainable goals in her life. <br /> <br /> A fairly long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hit man. Diane apparently sees him as the greatest force behind the campaign, trying to push the director to accept Camilla's role in the movie (from Adam's party in the second half of the film), and he therefore occupies a large part of the dream. Because of her feelings of guilt and remorse against the murder of Camilla, a part of her wants him to miss so she turns to a stupid criminal. <br /> <br /> I think this scene is Lynch's attempt by completely turning his audience over as they get a false sense of seeing the movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe love that "Something just asks me bad" line. :) <br /> <br /> The next interesting scene is one with the two people at Twinkies having a conversation about how one of them continues to have this recurring nightmare involving a man who seen by him through a wall outside the dinner they are sitting in. After a little talk, they go outside and continue walking toward the corner of a fence, accompanied, of course, by excellent music that matches the mood of the scene. <br /> <br /> When you reach the corner, a bum-like character appears with a fate face out behind the corner, scaring the living body out of the man who has the nightmare. This nightmare exists only in Diana's mind; she saw the guy in the dinner when he paid for the murder. So in short, her occupations translate into the bad guy's nightmare. The boom also means Diana's evil side, as can be seen later in the film. Cowboy (along with the dwarf) is one of the weird characters who are always present in the Lynch landscape - Diane only saw him in Adam's party, but just as our own dreams can assign insignificant people to whom we hardly know much of our dreams, he can play an important role in the dream. We also get more tracks during their scenes, that what we see is not true (his sudden disappearance, etc.) <br /> <br /> Cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the director when he meets him on it odd location (the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream). Also note how he says he will look again if he (Adam) does good, or twice, if he does evil. Throughout the film, he is seen twice, suggesting that Diane did it badly. He is also the one who awakens her to reality (that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her demands on him who appears twice), and shortly after, she commits suicide. The Espresso scene with the Castigliane brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, the composer, as Luigi) is probably the result of Diane having an espresso just before Camilla and Adam made their announcement on Adam's party in the other half. It could also be a statement from Lynch. <br /> <br /> During the scene where they enter Diana's apartment, the body lying in bed, Camilla, notes how she assumes Diana's sleeping position; Diane sees herself in her own dream, but her face is not her, even though it had the same wounds on her face as Diane wanted to shoot herself. This scene is also filled with some real Lynchian creepiness. When Diane didn't know where (or when) the hitman would come to Camilla and finish her, she just put her in her own home. <br /> <br /> In fact, Diana's audition for the movie part was bad. In her dream she delivers a perfect audition, giving the entire crew ecstatic about her performance. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is the fact that the money that was actually used to pay for Camilla's murder is now displayed in the Rita / Camilla bag. This is part of Diana's undoing of his terrible action by getting the money back effectively since the murder has not taken place. <br /> <br /> When her neighbor arrives to get her piano-shaped ashtray, another tip is given; She takes the ashtray from her table and leaves, but later, when Camilla and Betty have their meeting on the couch, we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table, suggesting that Betty's meeting with the neighbor was a fantasy. /> <br /> Catching the phrase of the movie Adam is the audition actresses for is "She's the girl"; which is exactly the same words that Diane uses when giving hitman Camilla's photo CV. <br /> <br /> The blue box and key represent the major turning point in the movie, and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed. There is a lot of symbolism here; The box can represent Diana's future (it is empty) or it can be a kind of Pandora's box (hitman laughs when she asks him what the key opens). In any way, it is associated with the murder using the blue key (located next to her after the murder has taken place). The box is also seen at the end of the film in the hands of the unpublished pimple. <br /> <br /> Club Silencio is a nice little addition to further remind the viewer that what he / she sees is not real. It also means that Diane is waking up to her reality (her reality is a nightmare she is unable to escape even in her dreams). During the chilling scene at the end, how scary old couple returns, Diane is plagued in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's my $ 0.02. Hope this can help people base themselves in this movie and call it 'the worst movie ever' or something in that direction without realizing the plot. Lynch is usually about creating irrational fear, and he also achieves it with this image as well. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
