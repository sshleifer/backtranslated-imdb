This movie surprised me. The box is misleading, tagline is misleading and the costume and tone of the movie is misleading. The movie is pretty gory, well-acted and beautifully shot. The special effects are top notch and seem to be before their time until you realize that this movie came out in 1979, not in 1963 as it is tone would suggest. It's a unique take on Dr. The Moreau story, and one of the better versions filmed. The first fifteen minutes is the highlight and the most shocking, but the film never falls apart. Definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of dramatic costume / horror classics and gore fests.
