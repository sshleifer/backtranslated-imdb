This is a really good series. I love the show and I'm so glad it hasn't been canceled yet. It has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very amazing. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything just like my mother and me. ya for Gilmore girls. I run out of lines. but I love how Luke and Lorelei relationships are shaping up. they should be together. and i absolutely love Sookie St. James! she is so amazing. and the show would not be anywhere without Michel. the whole show is dry humor, sarcasm and life in a very small town where everyone knows each other .... especially Gilmore Girls.
