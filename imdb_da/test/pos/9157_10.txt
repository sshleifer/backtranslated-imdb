Hey, you're not alone! I remember Nichols! I was only 17 when it was on. I remember James Garner was one of the coolest actors, and Nichols was such a good show. I couldn't believe it was in such a short time, wish I could remember the last episode, I probably haven't seen it ... there was no vcr back then so when it was on you saw it and if you missed an episode It was gone forever, unless it came back in the summer. In any case, it would be good if it came out on DVD, but I don't think that many even knew about it. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Garner wanted to beat Rockford Files a few years later, and he took his friend Stuart Margolin from Nichols to play his sidekick Angel.
