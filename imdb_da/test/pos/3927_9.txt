I've never seen the original "House Of Wax" so I didn't really know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new movie. After a little wobbly start by introducing our young characters, "House Of Wax" changes gear and becomes an extremely effective horror excursion. The plot really doesn't matter too much here - I think most people see that these stranded children are going to meet with a creepy killer and find some terrible things in the growing waxing house. It's about the special effects here, and they're top notch. Viewers who like their horror movies with lots of blood are happy here, but there are also other ghoulish effects. Production design and sets are excellent and the cast makes the most of their under-written roles. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people just wonder how Paris Hilton has performance. To be honest, Hilton praises itself quite well, and she doesn't portray "herself" as so many people predict. Her character is sexy and sweet, and I think her good work will hopefully change many people's opinions about her. Elisha Cuthbert is also good, moving from her previous movie, The Terrible "The Girl Next Door." Her character is accomplished a lot, and Cuthbert turns out to be a celebrating heroine. Chad Michael Murray, like Hilton and Cuthbert, is pretty much looking at, but unfortunately it's not as convincing as the "bad boy" in the group. I predict good things for "House Of Wax" As the audience at the screening I participated hollered, screamed and clapped through many parts of the film. Congratulations to the castrator and the crew for a job well done. <br /> <br /> And congratulating Paris Hilton for proving many people wrong. As she always says - "It's hot."
