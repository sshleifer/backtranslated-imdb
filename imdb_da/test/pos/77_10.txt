Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson while on a mission for Germany. The songs are beautiful. The two are well-bred. Julie demonstrates a more temperate side in this movie than the nice girl she usually plays. <br /> <br /> A semi-German, half-English girl singing beautifully and entertaining the troops in WW I, Julie sings some outstanding Mancini songs. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie. Some will say it is a "chick-flick", but then what. It is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Supporting characters are slightly stereotyped. It can't be up to Rock's performance in Pillow Talk, Magnificent Obsession or Giant. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards shot the film in Ireland and authentic WW I-type aircraft were used in the movie. Landscape for England and France is absolutely fantastic.
