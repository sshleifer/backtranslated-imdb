Contrary to what many might think, since this film is a "counter system" type of movie and attitude. It is an excellent portrayal of the "system" of the question and how ridiculous it really is. The funny parts of the movie are actually funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic simply refuses the obvious truths about life. And it is to learn what you enjoy. That's what college should be about. <br /> <br /> I notice that a comment should have at least 10 lines. I think I have given my opinion on the matter. Then I now write a few more lines just like filler. I hope you have been entertained during this time. I encourage you to watch the movie. It is well worth while you follow it and immerse yourself in the movie.
