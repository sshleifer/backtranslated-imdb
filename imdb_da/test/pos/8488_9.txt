A few days ago, I saw the amazing "House of Sand and Fog" and I was impressed by Ben Kingsley's great performance in the lead. I decided to watch "Ray," trying to understand how and why Ben Kingsley didn't win the Oscar for Best Lead Actor. Having seen Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray Charles, I agree with the academy: he really deserved to be awarded. I like Ray Charles, I was not his fan, but it's amazing the parable of Jamie Foxx with him. The movie is fully supported by Jamie Foxx, who participates in most shooters, and his movements on stage are similar to being a reincarnation of Ray Charles. With regard to history, I saw the extended version on DVD, too long, but also very comfortable, with many beautiful songs and scenes that primarily show a junkie Ray Charles. My biggest surprise was finding out that Ray Charles was completely dependent on how he treated his own family. The presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the movie. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ray"
