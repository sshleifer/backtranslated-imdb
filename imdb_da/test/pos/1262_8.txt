This was a great movie for only 67 minutes. There was one aspect of film noir contained in this movie, and I'm glad Nolan picked to film it in black and white. The reason is simple but entertaining that keeps you engaged. Even the dialogue was good with the actor. It reminded me of what should come in Memento by not being in chronological order. I liked how the protagonist tried to use what Cobb taught him, for example, to say "everyone has a box" in which he put his personal stuff in. Also on the author's door was the batman logo, which seemed ironic because Christopher Nolan Later would lead Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, two other amazing films. There is a big twist in the end, which I will not spoil for anyone who has not seen it, even though I suppose what would happen when Cobb gave the young man D Lloyd's credit card. I also liked how the author had a copy of the Republic of Plato one of my favorite philosophical books. This is definitely a movie you have to see more than once to get the full aspect of it, plus it's only an hour long. There is also a circular aspect to it by quitting where it began, which I thought was pretty brilliant.
