"Traffic 1989" is an Emmy award-winning six-part miniseries from Britain, which was the inspiration for Oscar's winning "Traffic 2000". The five-hour film breaks the opium / heroine trade for the viewer from handcasting poppy seeds in an Afghanistan field to the "head rush" of a mainlining junkie in an apartment in England. Traffic not only offers entertainment value through interleaved dramatic stories, but also provides an overview of international drug trafficking at all levels, similar to who, where, how, and why issues in the old and unstoppable drug supply / demand machine. Synergistically entertaining and educational, "Traffic" will prove to be time suitable for teenagers and up. (ONE)
