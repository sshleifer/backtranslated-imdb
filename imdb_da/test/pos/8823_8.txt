Much of my childhood was spent lying in front of the wireless listen to Round the Horne or Hancock's Half Hour or watching Carry On movies. Probably the most famous line in comedy "Infamy! Infamy! They've all got it confusing!" still makes me laugh. This is a rare insight into the man behind the comic, and the whole production is a brilliant mix of tragedies and comedies right down to the final quote from the coronation court read in four different voices by Michael Sheen. He was brilliant in the role. Most of the other members of the Carry On team were so-so, and their Kenneth Horne was very good, but Michael Sheen carried the show and there was a price for him. <br /> <br /> It left me feeling "wow". To quote Kenneth Williams, to the cynic who says 'life is a joke', the only answer can be 'yes, let's do well'.
