Todd Sheets has created one of the greatest LOW BUDGET Zombie movies ever. The story is amazing, gore is grand, the psychos are evil! Still, the film is erroneous in its petty dialogue and sluggish imaging at times. In spite of this, ZB2 delivers what every Zombie movie needs to do, make, good plot, a fast paced adventure in macabre. If only MR sheets were given a 100k budget, this movie would make every zombie film ever the almighty Dawn of the Dead. But as time goes on, he gets better and when he gets better money gets into his pocket. Thus, this man allows this modern day Genius to make his vision better. <br /> Just remember that Zombie Bloodbath 2 was just one of his great stepping stones when he was on top of Gore Mountain
