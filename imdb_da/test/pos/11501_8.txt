This movie is based on a true story. The author of the novel with the same title, Einar MÃ¡r Gudmundsson, had a brother who became mentally ill. I found this movie very moving, after the protagonist's path into the disease to see how he is trying to cope with the life after the diagnosis, and how he makes friends in the mental institution, everything is very convincing. There are also some great fun events also in the manuscript. The title of it gives nothing away about the story. You have to see it to understand ... and listen to the music, which twists and turns your heart and soul up and down as the movie progresses. A must-see for everyone.
