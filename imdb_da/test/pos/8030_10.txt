I'm a big fan of the spy genre and this is one of the best of these movies. The task is based on a true story that has been a little decorated for the big screen, and it really takes you on a fun trip. The film has a great cast, starring Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. <br /> <br /> The name leader Quinn is reluctantly recruited by Sutherland after a fairytale meeting with Kingsley, who believes that Quinn is the famous terrorist Carlos de Jackal. Because Quinn looks very much like Carlos, Sutherland stops nothing to recruit him because Sutherland is obsessed with the terrorist's capture or death. <br /> <br /> The training sequences are awesome. Quinn is really being tested by Kingsley and Sutherland, who have to withstand attacks from remote snowmobiles, from eating the same food every day to being drug with a hallucinogen. He must even learn to love a woman Carlos wanted. <br /> <br /> The movie has some amazing action scenes with Quinn avoiding allies because they believe he is Carlos and in his final mission when he is killing the jackal. Throughout the film, Quinn must fight with the new personality he has achieved against his own. Will he remain as ruthless and free as Carlos, or will he return to his life for a good man and father again? <br /> <br /> If you like the spy genre, this is a must see. The action is only used to propel the story of this thriller forward; no free explosions or battle scenes. Rating 10 out of 10 stars.
