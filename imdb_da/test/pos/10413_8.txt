This was one of the best half-hour horror / suspense / fantasy shows in the eighties without a doubt. It was a good thing that the show was scarcely enough to throw with every episode, and it stank as far as the production values ​​(ie sets) went, but it was enough that I had to give it some credit to be gutsy with the plots. I mean the plot of each episode was edgy enough that even I, a hardened horror movie, shock-movie and 70's gate-house buff became a little sick and scared. Great show, just amazing, no matter what the other reviewers have said here. My favorite episode was called "Bug House", yes it was the title I think? Yet, it still gives me the will every time I think of it today, almost 20 years after the first premiere. Others appear as "Tales From The Darkside", "The Outer Limits" and (of course) "The Twilight Zone" was definitely better worth producing, but in my opinion they have nothing as far as plot lines go compared to this sick little show! It definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon that was "Tales From The Crypt".
