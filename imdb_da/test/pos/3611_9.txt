'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a great movie in itself. It is nothing like the book that can disapoint its burning followers. Still, the film is a masterpiece, seen on its own. The views are spectacular and the play isn't too bad either !! Nicolas Cage was brilliant - so different from his usual action hero type character. Penelope cruz is amazing and holds the film together. I think this film should be judged as an individual project - not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres was entitled to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, John Maddon. Go see this movie with an open mind - you will love it; because below is the touching story of love and war.
