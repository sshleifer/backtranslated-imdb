Good movie, good story, good characters, I enjoyed it immensely enough to buy the DVD when it came out. <br /> <br /> The real-life story that is said to tell is more fascinating and exciting than anything the fictionalists could ever bring. My friend, who is in the media industry, said they should not show insider acts like this, it gives the company a bad name. As if. <br /> <br /> However, there are some issues with the DVD: First, the volume is terribly low, so you have to drive the TV volume to watch it. I note that this is also the case when HBO runs it, so it is in the original production copy. Secondly, for the first five minutes, the left side of the video is cut off, that is, the image is cut off approx. an empty card from the left. After five minutes, the screen fills correctly, left to right. Relaxed technical production as such is very amateurish, and I do not know why the director and the manufacturer release such sleep. <br /> <br /> Still, even with the technical flaws, it's an enjoyable story, one of HBO's best I think.
