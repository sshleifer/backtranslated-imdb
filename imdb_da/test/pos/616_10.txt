I just started exploring the wonderful world of Monsieur Ozone. I have only seen four films so far, and with the last in line it hit me that they were all actually lonely women and their actions. Not a single non-lonely female character out of 12, and everybody causes great stresses on the environment. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is too good. The <gay theme is an almost standard part of the background for Ozon's film, so it doesn't take the accent (though the character's appearance can). Look for the emotions, not for their objects. Very nice and fleeting, really like a summer romance, and while you are relaxing in thoughts and minds, it gives some food to the soul.
