Police Squad! (1982) was a fun show that ended prematurely. But I guess it did, before it became too repetitive and unfunny like so many American TV shows. The geniuses behind this fun show were the team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker. Ever since its straight act in the comedy hit AIRPLANE !, Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian. In this short life, series he had a chance to play the right man in a crazy comedy once again. The bizarre titles for each episode gave away the end. Men Lt. Drebrin (Leslie Nielsen) entered so many strange cases that they should be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Tooo, they have never released this on D.V.D. If a show were to be republished, it should be. A brand new generation is waiting to see this show! <br /> <br /> Recommended!
