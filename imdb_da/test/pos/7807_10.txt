It is simply ridiculous how underestimated this movie is. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It never does, it never goes slow, it's a movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot. This together with the brilliant writing makes this a great movie. Aamir and Salman are outrageous, even though Raveena and Karishma are fun in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shakti deliver some good bad comedies, but Viju Khote and Ajit-wannabe are the best with their dumbfounded bad guy intentions. If you want to laugh and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you won't regret it. Most Indian movies end up at the end because they are 3 hours long. This movie is just as long, but I wish there was more when it ended, because it's a great flick.
