How I interpreted the movie: First thing first. There wasn't a single scene in the movie where you see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands on the wall. But the same cannot be told by the bitch. Eventually you see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message was "There was no Taylor". And the whole movie was a fantasy of Ben's imagination. There was also no scene during the torture moments, where some of the bugs confront or are in the same frame as Ben. It was Taylor all the time. But in reality, Taylor was Ben. If they were two different people, then why was there no scene that showed them both in a frame of horrible times? But of course before you both see them together, and that's just Ben's imagination at work. Even when Ben was out of jail, the text on the screen clearly says that Ben's story was unrealistic, and there was no place he had explained (read my cars, etc.) Even after Liz Hunter leaves Kristy and comes back to find Ben , she doesn't find him. Why??? Because Ben (Taylor) was looking for gals. Instead, Kristy always has the world to check out Taylor's (Ben) webcam, photos, etc ... Somehow, everything sums up to just one fact that Kristy and Liz, both knew what Taylor was Ben. So my conclusion is that Ben was the schizophrenic, and the movie where you see him and Taylor in a frame was nothing but figures of his imagination. Otherwise, if there really was a Taylor, then they should have found him given all the detailed explanations that come from Ben.
