I was in the movie right away. I've seen the other Coen movies except Raising Arizona, and I've noticed that each of their movies has a color. Fargo is gray / white, Lebowski is light orange and this film is a pleasant yellow. <br /> <br /> The bright pleasing qualities of this movie start right away. Soon the look is accompanied by the great, great music. It is the old folk sound, the kind of music that was written at a time when music was enjoyed as part of daily life. Enjoy all, chain bands, church choirs and just prison escape. <br /> <br /> Now, if prison escapes. I don't know what crime their characters might have committed as they are a very very friendly group of guys. Clooney is amazing and nails entirely to her role. <br /> <br /> See this as soon as possible. I think it can be enjoyed by someone at some level. For some reason, the theater I was in was full of old ladies and old men, and they loved it. <br /> <br /> You will also love what I promise. I had to get my hands on the soundtrack right away.
