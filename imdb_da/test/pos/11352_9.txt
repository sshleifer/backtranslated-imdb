When I fisted at the movie, I told myself, "so a movie can be made like this." Wong Kar Wai's beautiful poetic love story caught me all the time and even after the movie. I must admit that this is one of the best love movies, perhaps best of all I have ever seen. The content and form overlap perfectly. When we see the secret love, we see the signs in delimited frames that limit their movements as well as their emotions. Beautiful camera angles and lighting make the feelings and the blues themselves touching. I would like to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee for their amazing movie that creates the mood for love. The music also defines the sadness of love, which plays along the beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in desperate mood. And of course the actors' performances that make love so genuine. Eventually, all elements of the movie are combined perfectly in the direction of WKW and give the audience the feeling called love.
