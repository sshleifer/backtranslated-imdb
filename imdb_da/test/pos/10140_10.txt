This movie reminded me of the live dramas of the 1950s - not like the recent "Failsafe" that seemed more of a stunt than anything else, but a TRUE moral drama that is both engaging and thought-provoking. Anne Heche is more than credible when the army officer has an affair with his superior, played by Sam Shepard, and Eric Stoltz is wonderful when her lawyer defends her against the military. I waited for their affair to begin if they just looked so good together. This movie is apparently based on a true story and it is a relief to be asked to think of real problems for a change. <br /> <br /> Directed by Christopher Menaul, who also did The Passion of Ayn Rand (with Stolz) and the Prime Suspect series, this is a film of panache and style and is definitely worth seeing.
