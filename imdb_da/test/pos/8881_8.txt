A picture with Danny Devito and Billy Crystal. They are both famous actors, and in this charming comedy, they try to kill each other's pet fight. Billy Crystal's Pet Peeve was his former wife who stole his book and put her name on it, and Danny Devito's pet flaw was his evil mate. Billy Crystal is a writer and a teacher apparently and Danny Devito is one of his students. This comedy classic is very entertaining and for all ages. Danny Devito seems to be a kid in this movie because of his evil mother who keeps him down all the time. She says things like "You have no friends!" And when Billy Crystal fell down, she said, "Bring him before he stinks up in the basement!" She also puts Danny down by calling him "Lard ass!" and other things just to make him angry.
