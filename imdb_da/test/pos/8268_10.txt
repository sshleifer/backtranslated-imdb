Having known and loved this book since I was eleven, I was afraid to see it come up as a movie - what if they had made a terrible mess of it? In case I have not worried at all. Everyone was very well thrown and the play is great, it followed the story very well except for the strange addition of the scene in the prison which did not add anything to me. But it's really the most beautiful love story, and I'm so happy to video it so I can see it again and again. My only gripe is - why didn't they give Kester a green vest "that made him such a personable man"? Such a simple thing as they went to so many problems for everything else. If you get the chance, see this, it's excellent.
