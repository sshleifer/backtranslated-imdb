The movie Haggard is one of the funniest movies all the time. It has cast from the CKY (movies) and also has a large soundtrack. If you have seen any CKY or Viva La Bam you will notice that everyone (from the two) is in it. Below are the parents of Bams and many other people. The story is about Ryan Dunn's girlfriend Glauren (Jennifer Rivall) who cheats him and he tries to get back to her. He does this by getting Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Dicamillo) vandalized her house. There are many different characters with many different stories. <br /> <br /> There is good music on the soundtrack. Bands like him and her, CKY, Gnar Kill, Daniel Lioneye. Iggy and Stooges Pop, and New Order. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Viva La Bam or CKY (the movies), I doubt you will like this. If you do that, this movie is great.
