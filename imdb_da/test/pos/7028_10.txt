I first saw this movie with my fiance many years after it came out. I thought I would hate it, but to my surprise it is so cheesy that it is great. We have spent many hours resuming parts of the movie ("Sylvia ?! Yes Mickey?" Or "I'm sorry you had to see the Baby. Sometimes we see things in this world that we don't want."). My economy jumps up every time I imitate Neil. Also the music is classic and fun to sing along with, especially on weather trips. Of course, I do not admit any of this to my male friends. It's like a guilty pleasure. I look seriously at Dirty Dancing once a month or more, and it is just as good every time. Jennifer Gray is also so sweet in this movie. It's too bad that her career never really went away.
