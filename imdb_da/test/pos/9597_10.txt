This is a real gem of a TV movie. Based on a completely untrue story, the ongoing football league club follows their course in the English FA Cup, where chaos follows and players all sports seventeen styles. The end is unexpected, the performance is good, and Nick Hancock shows that he can do anything other than a host sports show. My only regret is that I didn't lose it.
