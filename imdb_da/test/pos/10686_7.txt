In this movie, astronauts sent to explore a newly discovered planet have to deal with several dilemmas, and they make it intelligent. The film approaches the main theme in a unique way and unfolds it gradually, although it can be guessed in advance. <br /> <br /> The action is very good, but sometimes stiff, as some late-60s plays may be. It can also be something decent and even melodramatic, especially after the plot theme reveals itself. Visually, it has a scene similar to the previous year's "2001: A Space Odyssey", and it tends to dance the movie. Some of the actors continued to star in the 1970's "UFO" show, which is lovely campy and worth checking out on DVD. <br /> <br /> Despite these small points, the space flight itself is realistic and, in view of this, in 1969, the scenes inside the spacecraft's cockpit also had a realistic look. (Look for some 1990s / 2000 video technology in use!) One thing: I suppose a love scene has been cut, but I can't prove it! It would have been a distraction anyway. Unlike most Sci-Fi movies, this movie will make you think about the plot and well worth a visit. I'm happy to have this movie in my video library.
