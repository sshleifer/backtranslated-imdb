A dangerous psychopath murderer Jacob Goodnight is hailed in the abandoned and decaying Blackwell Hotel, alone with its nightmares, until eight teenagers turn up for community service along with the policeman who wounded Jacob four years ago. When one of them is kidnapped by the killer and her fate is uncertain, the remaining criminals must fight for their lives ... "See No Evil" was ruled by pornographic filmmaker Gregory Dark and it's stars WWE superstar Kane as relentless psychopath. The support is horrible and there are no surprises here, but there is enough extreme violence to do for slasher fans. Overall, I liked this movie and you should also, if you are in mindless slasher flicks.Sure, it's clich√©, but who cares.7 out of 10.
