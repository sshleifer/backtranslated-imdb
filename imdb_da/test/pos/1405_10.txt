A brash, self-centered squad arrives at the WEST POINT with a dangerous clever lighthouse setting against the Corps. <br /> <br /> In a role tailor-made for him, William Haines shines in this very pleasant honorary tale & friendship. A class-A scene steals, Haines in the first half of the movie is up to his usual Silly Billy behavior, which under normal circumstances should have made him restricted to the guardhouse. The latter half, however, becomes very serious and leads up to Haines' moral redemption and gives him a good opportunity to expose his plays. If WEST POINT does not quite reach the caliber of Haines' former TELL IT TO THE MARINES (1926), this is undoubtedly due to the absence here of a costar of the charm and quality of Lon Chaney for Haines interacting with. However, this shelf for the army is very effective entertainment and should be appreciated in its own way. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford stands out as Haines' love interest, the virgin daughter of the local innkeeper plays. Joan is pertinent & beautiful and especially shines in her first scenes when she meets Haines on a Hudson River ferry and is exposed to his usual immature antics. Haines & Crawford made five silent movies together and were huge friends for life. He was the much larger celebrity of this period and gave her many tips to move on in Hollywood. A superstar even in the early 1930s, after her enchantment from the MGM in 1932, she emerged by encouraging her career change to interior design. <br /> <br /> Little William Bakewell is effectively thrown like a Plebe who idolizes Haines; their relationship is actually given more of a sentimental treatment than that of Haines & Crawford. <br /> <br /> The film was made with full cooperation from the war department. Extensive placement of the film at the Academy helps enormously with the production's mood, which was given amazing production values ​​by the MGM. <br /> <br /> The West POINT has recently been restored to give David Davidson an exciting new score.
