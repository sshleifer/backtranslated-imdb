After seeing Big Fat Liar, I think Jason learned a lot more. When he told the truth that Marty stole his story, it was like a boy crying wolf. People heard him, but they didn't believe him. No one did anything to help him. Moreover, not only does Marty's movie stink, it does his advice too. The truth is not overstated. I'm so glad he was exposed to what he really is. Everyone found out he was stealing from that boy, including his parents. Not only did he steal from that boy and lied about it, he gave them another's work and tried to call it himself, which is plagiarism. Does he not know that plagiarizing a person's idea is illegal? Another reason why he was fired. He is not trustworthy. He is a liar, a cheat, a thief, a villain and a plagiarist. Do you have Marty? You're a plagiarist. Plus, you have everything you deserved.
