Last year I fell in love with Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd, so I wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and I found this at the library. Although I think Burton is best, probably because I like movies much better than theater, it's still a great production of history. I haven't seen any of the other versions, but I'm trying to get my hands on them. <br /> <br /> Having seen Johnny Depp as Todd, it's hard for me to imagine someone else in the role, but George Hearn does a great job. Angela Lansbury is amazing, as always and all the songs are amazing. I found myself singing together. This is a game you will not miss, but try to see it before watching the movie version so you do not have a biased view like me.
