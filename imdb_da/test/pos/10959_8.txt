Shadows add the smell of New York's streets like no movie before it. This kick off Cassavetes' direct work is as atmospheric as the political and original spark for renewal in the American cinema. Perhaps it encourages to see Cassavete's first work in a dual function with another debut, Godards À bout de soufflé. Both films have shaped the cinematic production of their countries over decades, and both spirits a particular ease and infinity, which was later rarely achieved by the films in their careers. Shadows tell from three African American siblings Ben (Ben Carruthers), Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) and Hugh (Hugh Hurd). The story is set in the New York jazz environment, and the driving rhythms of the soundtrack play an important role in the feverish, sometimes almost dreamy, atmosphere that draws throughout the film. Not much happens in the plot. The lives of the three siblings are defined by problems in love affairs or in their jobs, but on both levels the norm deceives. Without moralizing gestures, Cassavetes simply describes the mechanism of racial exclusion, public and private life. It was about the cinematic depiction of racism, a breakthrough film in the United States. <br /> <br /> This movie also owes much to the performances of the three leading actors, all of whom were almost completely unknown before. Especially Ben Carruthers established with his energetic depiction the image of a new self-awareness of young urban blacks in America, a picture that characterizes Spike Lee's films from the 80s and 90s. It was clear that none of the three undoubtedly highly talented actors could start a great career afterwards. Hollywood was not and is not ready to ethnically expand its star system, and therefore Goldoni, Hurd and Carruthers found only small artistic niches in television and independent films later. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Shadows is one of the less "beautiful" movies ever shot and one of the most beautiful at the same time; a film of shades and spaces with a camera that just sees the flow of life in the crowded street corners, bars, hotel lobbies, apartments that evoke an exciting walk through New York's vibrant streets.
