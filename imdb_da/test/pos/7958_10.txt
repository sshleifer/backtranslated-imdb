Palwol in Christmas is very Korean, if you have been in Korea or have Korean friends, you should know what I mean. Korean are very traditional people, they see love very quitely. a kind of feeling you don't find in today's world. So I think this movie is so special. It is wrong to compare this movie with "Love Letter" by Shunji Iwai, Japan is very good, but could never make one like Palwol in Christmas. If you have a chance, you can watch this movie for yourself.
