I can understand how Barney can be annoying to some, but the hatred he gets is very ridiculous. Barney was made simply from the beginning and simplicity is not bad, especially for the young ones he is entertaining. I personally find this show for a very undervalued period. Barney & Friends is a very educational show in my opinion and even 17 years after debut (and almost 21 years after the character's debut on home video), he repeatedly shows that he still appeals to young children. Maybe less than in the early 90s, when Barney was Hannah Montana of the time, but he's still a classic. As a fan of Barney myself, I feel I have to defend him in a way that doesn't seem like spam. The way the little guy learns things can be very simplified and unrealistic, but would you rather hear them about war? Be grateful for one (a costumed dinosaur, but still) there to comfort the children and let them be children simply. In this day and age, I feel that we are rushing to grow up, and Barney is there to say that you can still be a child of the heart. In addition, many of Barney's lessons about current episodes of plagiarism, honest and yes ... even death, appeal to everyone, not just his audience. In addition, our children must learn to be kind and respect others for who they are, and he helps them to do so. In short, Barney can be annoying to some people and I understand why, but cut him a little. All he and his friends (along with HIT Entertainment, his production company) are trying to do is help the kids not only learn the necessary skills but also have fun and also look at the positive parts of life. If more people listened to their children's favorite character and saw him through the eyes, we might not be so negative about him and possibly life himself.
