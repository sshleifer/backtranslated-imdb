Minnie and Moskowitz are the most pathetic and shameless love story I've ever seen. Between Minnie, a disillusioned museum consultant whose battered boyfriend dumps her and leaves her even more tense and confused than she already was, and Seymour Moskowitz, a caretaker so desperate for attention, that he spends his nights at bars and restaurants that worsen people, There is a chaotic and disillusioned struggle from the start. Like many connections we see every day. In almost every love story there is a man and a woman, the man is confident, fun, either classically warm or attractive in his own way, whose shortcomings are charming and the woman a wounded soul who could have any man she wants to choose This guy because there's just something about him. These movies make everyone feel so good because the characters embody what every man and woman will be, not what they are. Minnie and Moskowitz, instead of decaying fantasy in the realm of romance, portray people who might just be more ordinary than the attractive, self-confident people with so much experience playing on the court. What is the story of the love affair of the ugly, alarmingly unpleasant man with no life and no job that we all go into, or the woman is so stunned by uncertainty that it is difficult to talk to her? <br /> <br /> This movie is not as fascinating as Cassavete's Faces or Opening Night, but it has the fast-paced quality that Cassavetes always fought so hard to do, which is a monster portrayal of people under the ego who hides Behind himself in almost every other movie. Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassel, who provide exciting pitiable people, are hardly sympathetic. Moskowitz drives us almost angry, let alone Minnie. He imposes himself so strongly in his life, the date is an explosion of our inner interior, which corresponds to the screaming monstrous turmoil on dates we have all been on, rejections, we all have gossip and arguments we all have had as we know was our own fault. I admire a movie like Minnie and Moskowitz because, as the brand is with the films Cassavete's hell, it identifies with us in 100% honesty. Our egos do not matter in the company of its characters, and thus a huge achievement per year. Performance of the actor.
