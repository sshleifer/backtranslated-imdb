In the end, it is clear that the murderers planted the murder weapon in Mrs. Columbo's car and it was in the police ballistic laboratory. <br /> <br /> But where did the gun come under the cap used in the demonstration? Wouldn't the murderers have cleared under the hood? They had a whole week? Or did the Columbos cops repeat the camera / gun under the cap used in the demonstration? How did they do it without breaking into the car? Maybe that's why the murders seemed surprised at the end. But how could Columbo replicate their camera / gun unit and get it calibrated to their central fob? Columbo must have got the gun back from the ballistics and had it replanted under the car's hood and been very fortunate that the rest of the unit with the camera was still there and transmitting. <br /> <br /> This was a 10/10 show until this brilliant plot error at the end.
