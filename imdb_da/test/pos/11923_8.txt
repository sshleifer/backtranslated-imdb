It's really not worth having a 'best picture' consideration, but as entertainment goes, it does the job! This is one I have seen, with pulse help every time, at least a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Most of these actors were unknown at the time they were made and we can recognize them from other work. Those who do not have current name recognition will probably not. <br /> <br /> This was a fun adventure. Kind of like The Little Rascals, if they were just serious.
