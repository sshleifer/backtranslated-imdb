*** Contains spoilers *** <br /> <br /> A great movie this, starring Brad Renfro and the always wonderful Joseph Mazzello. I like Joseph Mazzello, out of all his movies I've seen to date, I've loved every one of them for many different reasons, and The Cure is no different. Brad Renfro also does very well in this movie. Cure is a drama / forthcoming film from the point of view of a sick child and his friend. The basic idea is: Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) has AIDS. He ends up being friendly with the child next door (Brad Renfro), but Erik's mother is very narrow, uninformed and somewhat "thick" when it comes to Dexter's disease. She thinks AIDS is contagious as Common Cold, so she doesn't want her son to go anywhere near Dexter. <br /> <br /> After many attempts to make their own cure without success, the boys on their way to New Orleans find cure after reading a booklet about it. After getting their kick from Playboy Magazine, Dexters health goes south shortly ago, and as his health slows down, there's still enough life in the boy with Erik for two pranks to like to stop breathing. Unfortunately, the bad Dexter actually dies of his illness and leaves poor Erik wondering why he couldn't find cure. Throughout the film he ends up more with Dexter's mother than his own. It's a very cordial movie to watch and isn't quite perfect (movies are rare), but you won't worry less about what you get involved with in the movie more. A must for Joseph Mazzello fans, one of his best performances ever. Very well-recommended must-see movies - if you can find a copy :)
