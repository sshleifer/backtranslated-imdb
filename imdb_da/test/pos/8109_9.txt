The movie has been made when Hitler (and Mussolini, who is also in the film) was top and many politics, and even the Roman church used to close eyes on brutality and malice for Nazism. Especially in the United States there were many people who had not understood what really happened in Germany and Europe (eg Charles Lindenbergh). It would be like today a great actor would make a parody of Berlusconi or Chirac. Chaplin may have made many mistakes in his life, but this is truly a masterpiece of humanity and IMHO a great demonstration he was a brave man. The movie is fun and deep, the final figure has a terrible strength and is still updated. I think this movie is one of the best ever made.
