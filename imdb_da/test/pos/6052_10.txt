I have seen this movie and anyone who has been with the marines or any branch of the service can appreciate the accuracy of this movie. It is a must have for any collection. Jack Webb does an excellent job as the hard training instructor. My father went to Marine boot camp at Camp Penelton and says this movie is so accurate that he feels like he's back in basic training. There is a line in the movie where Jack Webb's character gets angry with a boots to kill a sand flea. Well, let me count you that there are nothing but sand fleas in the camp. I've been there and can appreciate it. In fact, the exit to the camp is Las Puljas, which in English means fleas. You have to watch the movie to appreciate what I say. Anyone who is in WWII movies starts all the matches right here with the drill Sgt. A must have for you collection
