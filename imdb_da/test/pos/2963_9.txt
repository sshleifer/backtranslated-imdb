A talented high school graduate senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl, she helps him realize that he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well. <br /> <br /> All too often, these drama falls into the formula and tells the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE is Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but beneath the surface is a much more unique individual than we normally see in this genre. Matt is the center of the action, and he is a realistic teenager, both over-confident and vulnerable, optimistic and cynical at swing. Affected by Amy, Matt grows into a man of character and heart. He again forms friendships with his teammates who influence his growth as an athlete and as a team player. FULL RIDE has all the elements we love to watch in a movie - great plays, admirable characters, exciting sports scenes, exciting drama and a love story. Although you may have seen these elements in other films, FULL RIDE is assisted by beliefs that are sincere and occasionally moving. Perhaps it is most impressive about FULL RIDE that it is reality. Although the author of the previous comment seems to disagree (obviously a disgruntled student, who for obvious reasons got a bad character in his film class), director Mark Hoeger justified the film in a credible situation and location and does a good job to get down to the laugh of what life is like in a small town. These characters are real people who are rooted in realistic situations that often create the most compelling entertainment. On one level it is a love story, on the other it is a character study, and yet another is a simple football movie. All these ideas come together to form a coherent vehicle.
