this movie is simply amazing .. unfortunately in Portugal not even a shadow of him ... and i agree with a previous opinion, only FF fans will really give the movie the right credit ... but for the rest .. i dare you see it. the story is amazing and i thought the game has ended the story, but the writers have given us a great story for god for all rpg's ... the cheese as usual came from heaven;) ehehe but the little details they gave us (us fans of the game) are beautiful. As the ringtone is Battle-winning song in the game, and even some movements are quite familiar just seeing it's a great movie great story, good animation ... just a 10/10
