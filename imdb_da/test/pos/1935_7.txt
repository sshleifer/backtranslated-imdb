This is one of Barbara Stanwick's earlier films and it certainly has an unconventional theme. She makes money by dancing with men in a dance hall. She really does not like the work, but it lives. Her boyfriend seems like a beautiful guy, but she is also pursued by the rich guy Ricardo Cortez. Well, after marrying, it turns out that her "nice guy" is a twentieth, female vase and rich Cortez turns out to be a fool of a guy. At the end of the movie, Barbara simply had enough that any SANE woman would go from this horrible marriage. <br /> <br /> In the 1920s and early 30s, Hollywood did just about everything you wanted and some of their films had themes or scenes that would surprise many today - like nudity, adultery, and bad language. While the TEN CENTS A DANCE is not a blatant example of this morality, it has a theme that would never have been allowed after the hardened production code was created and enforced beginning in 1934. In some ways, the code was large - after all, parents needed not to worry about what their children saw in movies (such as the nudity of BEN HUR, 1925). However, it was also a tendency to hygiene some of the films too much - and that is no way that this film could have been made and approved because it tends to glorify divorce - a serious no 1934 and beyond. It's really a shame as I don't think the TEN CENTS A DANCE was bad at discussing this - especially when the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a stinging thief. Nevertheless, the film could be interesting and thought-provoking. Still, the film could end up with her to divorce and marry a man who herself was twice divorced. Plus, it was a good pace and suited its relatively short maturity. Give this a look. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Ricardo Cortez was not Spanish, but changed his name because of possible prejudices because he was Jewish. He was an excellent leader of his time, but today everything is but forgotten.
