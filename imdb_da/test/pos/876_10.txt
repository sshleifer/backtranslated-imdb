I love this movie. It's the first movie Master P has ever done. It is based on the story of his life. It's low budget, but it's very good. It shows how Master p grew up in New Orleans projects. <br /> <br /> Not only did Master P in this movie, he was also author and director of Moon Jones. The DVD also has The No Limit ice cream party on it. This film shows how Master P goes from evil to good and how he has to deal with things around him. It also has many of The No Limit Records roster in this movie. You should buy or rent this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie to watch, you're like rap, or a Master P fan. I don't wanna spoil this movie for you. Join this movie as soon as possible and watch it. You will like it.
