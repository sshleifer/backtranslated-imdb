This episode of Buffy was one of my personal favorites. Also number three of Joss's personal favorites too. The section highlighted very little dialogue, and despite the good people at the Emmy's deciding it, it was a nomination. Unfortunately, it did not win. When Hush first premiered, it received about 6 million viewers, which was the highest rated episode of season four. It should tell you something. Although there was little to talk about, people managed to intrigue enough to tune in. These gentlemen (who played my mimes) were some of the scary creatures the show has produced (or any network TV show I've seen). Nothing is scarier, so a bunch of silver-fired men comes to you with a scalpel as you smile away. I think the actors, despite the lack of dialogue, did a fantastic job on the episode.
