I consider myself fortunate to see a wonderful movie with two wonderful actors. "Kramer vs Kramer" was great for me because I think I could relate to it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my parents are divorced. Although I was older than Billy in this movie, I felt his pain and confusion. Having two parents whom you thought was happy and end up hating each other is the worst. In fact, through this movie, I think it made me realize that my parents are also humans, and they had just as much pain as my sister and I had. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie, this was a good one. Yes, it's dated, and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would recommend this to many people because I believe that most people can relate in some way. There are fun, sad, happy and soothing moments that are carried away wonderfully by these great actors. It's a good movie and deserves more credit than a 7.5. <br /> <br /> 9/10
