Fun movie! The script is terrible, but the quality of the actors saves the day. John Hurt is perfect, like Jane Alexander. Beau Bridges is fair and the actor who plays his wife is very weak. The story is the true star. Based on a true story, the pace goes well and the whole concept of escaping East Germany sucks you in and keeps you. Joyous ending gives enough elation to compensate for script. Don't expect Academy Award quality, but it's a great trip for the whole family.
