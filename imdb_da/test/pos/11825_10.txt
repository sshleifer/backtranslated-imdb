Cure is an excellent reality drama that deals with a very sensitive subject. It is the story of the deep and dear friendship between two boys, Eric and Dexter. The latter has acquired AIDS from a blood transfusion. Thus, he and his mother (Annabella Sciorra) have been excluded, cut off by the public and labeled as a dangerous company, mainly due to a common lack of public knowledge of the disease. <br /> <br /> When Eric (Brad Renfro, known from 'The Client' and 'Apt Pupil') and his mother move into the house next to them, he has to deal with public insults and fear to catch AIDS itself. But Eric overcomes his fear and risks everything. First he starts talking to Dexter, but eventually he climbs over the fence and enters the witty boy (played by Jurassic Parks Joseph Mazzello) and his game. Very quickly, he develops a true friendship with Dexter, who is delicately built and weak because of his condition. <br /> <br /> The central theme of the movie ?? the theme that makes it pervasively authentic and tragic at the same time? is how Eric and Dexter try to find the ultimate cure. Initially, they experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves ?? who are very naive, but also true at the same time, as it shows how young children deal with such malignant diseases and how strongly they still believe in the magic of the world. When they hear of an alleged cure that has been developed in the south, they do not hesitate and go for an adventure that will bring them even closer and symbolize the ultimate quest for hope. <br /> <br /> They saw a fleet and head south on the Mississippi River. What starts out as a true adventure becomes a dangerous business that is emotionally exciting and educational at the same time. The scene, when Dexter reveals his fears and talks about the end of the universe, where everything is dark and cold, Eric calls him on his sneaker, a symbol wherever the boy must go, Eric is and will always be with him; He never has to be alone. This sequence, one of the most convincing in the film, has a very convincing interaction between the two actors who manage to avoid unpleasant and corny dialogues and deliver a very genuine achievement that eventually smashes in its tenderness and honesty. br /> <br /> I will not continue to describe the plot as I do not intend to give away too much information. However, the ending is emotionally tough and makes the audience so much a part of the tragedy that everyone who sees the film will feel personally affected. This aspect makes this movie so strong, so excellent and so compelling. The emotional burden of any character is so genuine and so blunt that even the tougher members of the audience may need some hankies. A 10 makes right for this movie and is not too high a rating. There is hardly any other movie I've seen in my life so far that handles such an emotional problem with so much humor and sensibility. It is the story of how two boys make each other's life richer and how they teach each other lessons of life. Thus, Dexter overcomes his isolation and grief, and Eric learns what really counts in life; And both realize how much a gift is true friendship when it comes to the most difficult moments in life. This movie is tragic ?? But its message is pure inspiration.
