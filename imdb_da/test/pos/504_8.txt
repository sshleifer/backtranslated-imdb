But close to the comic film, it doesn't matter. This movie moves radically away from the upset "Interview with the Vampire" (though it does well) and slips into the wonderful action scenes. Very convincing story and interesting with surprisingly good plays from everyone. Disadvantage - bad graphics. Does it mean anything? Nix.
