This is a movie that will brighten up your day, for sure. Kermit the Frog is just a regular seed in his swamp when a talent agent stops by and tells him that Hollywood is looking for frogs to be in movies (lol). Along the way, Kermit meets Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, Gonzo and his chicken Camilla, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. But subsequently Kermit holds a restaurant chain, Doc Hopper's French Fried Frog Legs. All in all, Kermit and Muppets make it to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended for everyone, young and old. It has some great music tracks, like "Rainbow Connection," I'm going to go back there one day "and" Movin 'Right Along. "The Muppets also use many forms of transport in this movie. Kermit bikes, Fozzie runs a Studebaker and a Second car, Gonzo takes flight with a bundle of helium balloons (which is one of my favorite moments by the way;)), and Kermit and the rest of the Muppets finally go the rest of the way from Electric Mayhem's bus (Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Janice, Scooter and Animal) who meet them in the desert after Fozzie's car crashes, even some Sesam Street Muppets make cameo appearances (ie Big Bird go on the road to NYC to break into public television.) The end is also a very heartfelt moment, every single Muppet created is in the final scene, with a final "Rainbow Connection" replay. <br /> <br /> But the bad Muppets worked so hard on their movie sets so it The whole thing comes down and the camera explodes into a giant Ball of Sparks You think everything is destroyed and destroyed, but the rainbow is going to shine through the roof at the end, and it all sums up the magic of this movie and you know everything in order. <br /> <br /> Perfect 10/10. Watch it and you'll be enchanted by the fun and sadness of this movie.
