I watched this movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005. I agreed with the assumption that if it were Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank, it had to be least decent. Well, after a kind of slow start I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was completely satisfied with the end product. <br /> <br /> I have to admit African and Xhosa (?) Accented English by some of the actors was hard to understand, but like watching "Waking Down Devine", "Trainspotting" or other movie with strong acclaimed actors, I adjusted after approx. 15 minutes. And I tried to find out why Hilary Swank was South African and sounded like she was trying to accent but sounded very American ... as if she was making a slight attempt to put the accent on. But later in the movie that more revealing about her character and how she moved to the United States as a teenager, you begin to understand how she might have lost some or most of her accent. So it began to make sense that only certain words could get an African lil to them. <br /> <br /> I know it's a little faint for one to use movies as education, but one of the great things about this movie is that it was interesting to see a dramatization of a truth and reconciliation test . I had heard about the T and R process in South Africa after the fall of apartheid, but I didn't really know how it worked. <br /> <br /> The final verdict is that although some of the scenes felt a bit constructed, this was generally a very strong movie. The final order in which the "truth" comes out was the strong end to each movie hoping for. A particular must look for anyone who cares about what is happening outside their borders.
