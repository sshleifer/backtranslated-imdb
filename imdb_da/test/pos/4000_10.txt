The fire gives everything ... This is one of the film's most masterful meditations on art. Seen in the 19th century, Korea tells the story of the famous painter Ohwon, but instead of adhering to sweet anecdote, melodrama or psychological egg hunt, it depicts a series of episodes throughout its life, all of which are beautiful works of art in themselves . It does not give any interpretation of these episodes, but leaves them for the viewer to contemplate with Ohwon's paintings. In this way, the viewer goes into the same form of contemplation as Ohwon, and minus his talent can "feel" into the inspiration of his paintings. Part of why this is so effective is the complete masterpiece of the 19th-century Korea and the musical / artistic world that Ohwon moved into. There are so many beautiful images of the world outside the paintings that we get a mirror effect, seeing the beautiful world of inspiring Ohwon, Ohwon living and looking in the world and the works of art he creates all reflect each other. <br /> <br /> The story is told with extreme economy. A feeling induced is almost never lingered with or explained, it just appears fast, so is gone for the next to appear. As an analogy, it is a kind of Mozartian work of art (endless and rapid succession of good ideas) rather than Beethovinian (Obsessive lingering on a good idea). It has a classic restraint, like Ohwon's paintings. There is really no music that suggests how to feel apart from a few classic Korean pieces that are used with great efficiency in multiple scenes (and mostly played by characters in the movie). A frightening picture, if I remember correctly, is of a bunch of birds floating away over the blue mountains, while a female crowns <br /> <br /> "This life is like a dream, and only death will awaken us" br /> <br /> A story of advice in the movie, from one of Ohwon's teachers, is that "the painting lies between the lines." The film follows that attitude, as there is so much something between * what is spoken and described in the film. I've seen it twice and it was very rewarding at other viewing. A very thin film, with little in the way of creepy explanation, one could see how it is Im's 96th movie. It is an artistic masterpiece. As Ohwon's good friend and mentor tells him to describe one of his paintings: "Not a single blow is wasted." <br /> <br /> I compare it with Andrei Rubylev in quality, but in style it is very different. It is much easier and more enjoyable to see, but classic in form, where Andrei is Gothic. All in all, highly recommended for almost everyone except appetite junkies. Both times I left the film, I felt a wonderful spiritual renewal. One point of Ohwon's life that intruged me was that his crazy drinking and ravening began suddenly after visiting the noble who told him "good art can come only from great knowledge and learning." The next short scene Ohwon was very angry, and the next blew full, which he often remained for the rest of the movie. I am curious why the noble words made him so much and drove him to the drink that dominated the rest of his life. Or was it just a case?
