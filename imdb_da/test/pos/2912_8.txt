When this movie gets it right, it gets really right. And when it goes wrong ... I would say that a full 3/4s of the movie is amazing. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's all about romance. Everything you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes, but it draws on for about 30. I would recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a smaller plot point quickly highlighted. Fortunately, the period from approx. 0-30 and 1: 2-2: 19 (The End) excellent. <br /> <br /> There are a number of excellent performances in this movie and an equal number of terrible. Like everything else in this movie, the play is either perfect or terrible. Peter Ustinov as the slimy one-eyed slave Kaptah is perfect. It's one of his best performances up there with his role in Spartacus. Victor Matne as the ambitious Horemheb is also perfect. Again, one of his best roles. Jean Simmons is wasted as Merit, the perfect girl in love with our hero John Carradine provides a good supporting role as a philosophical digging robber; and Michael Wilding is excellent as Akhnaton, the idealistic pharaoh, trying to bring peace and monotheism to Egypt only to see it fall apart because of his unwillingness to fight. Now for the bad. Edmund Purdom as Sinuhe is unfortunately miscast. This is double unfortunate as he is the protagonist. The whole movie is about him. He actually does pretty well as the disillusioned exile and the wise old man. This is due to his very limited range. He does not seem to put a passion in his words. This is especially evident in the love scenes that are beyond awkward. He uses the last half of the film as an old man, a show where he is decent enough. He has the perfect voice for the character. The less said about Bella Darvi as Nefer, the treacherous Babylonian woman, the better. <br /> <br /> Costumes and sets are magnificent. It is the only film I know of trying to portray life in Egypt that is not exceeded by Jews or Romans. The film takes place in the 14th century B.C. which is before even Exodus. The only monotheists are Pharaoh Akhenaten and his followers. There is the same strong element of religious zeal that can be found in most epics, but it is done differently and it only appears at the end. An interesting note: by having the Akhenaten followed by Horemheb as Pharaoh, the film goes completely over the most famous pharaoh of all: Tutankhamen. It looks like a strange thing to do when using that name, you can raise awareness of the movie. Be warned: This is a 1950s epic movie. If you don't like those things, don't expect one to be different. It's different, but it's still an epic. I really appreciate this movie and I appreciate what it did and what it was trying to do. This is a movie that should be remembered better than it is.
