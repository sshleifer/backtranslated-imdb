Great film. I laughed all the time. Why? Well, I'm from Austria, I can come along with the German (Bavarian) kind of humor. So I suppose this movie makes sense only when you are a German mother tongue. Stefan and Erkan both speak in a new kind of Turkish-German accent, which became very popular in our countries (GER & AUT). But of course they are very stupid. As in any comedy, your personal humor determines whether thumbs up or down.
