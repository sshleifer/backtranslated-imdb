I watched this movie last night, and it was one of the best made for TV movies I've seen. It was very well aimed and the actor was fantastic, very convincing. The music was good and the filmmaker was beautifully shot. Take the hopelessness of Requiem for a dream and you'll be wasted. An excellent portrayal of the drug addicts' world and its consequences given in a very open way that anyone can relate to. cudos to mtv to give us a good flick for a change from! * $ *% as Crossroads.
