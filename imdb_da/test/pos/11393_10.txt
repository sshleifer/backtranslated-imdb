Everything you need to know about the late 1970s and early 80s pornography is all wrapped up in Paul Thomas Anderson's BOOGIE NIGHTS. Although the film is completely fictitious, it is actually based on the story of porn kingpin John Holmes. <br /> <br /> In Southern California in 1977, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) is working as a bus in a nightclub. One of the regular customers is porn artist Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and two of his starlets, Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham). Jack and Eddie meet, and Jack realizes that Eddie is good ... a little ... gifted. <br /> <br /> So Eddie stars in Jack's movie under the pseudonym "Dirk Diggler." He becomes a "big" porn star (no pun intended) and seems to be on top of everything. Then comes the 80s when the video replaces movies, and Jack's porn empire begins to coincide with Dirk Diggler and everyone else working in the field. BOOGIE NIGHTS is a really well-filmed drama. There is little violence, but P.T. Anderson makes it more stylized. And it is a kind of scary approach to the degradation of pornography, especially when VHS became the standard medium for making porn. Many bizarre and unique characters are introduced. William H. Macy has an interesting role as a person working on the movies whose wife continues to have sex with everyone. I particularly liked Don Cheadle's role as Buck Stereo seller. The best achievement is BOOGIE NIGHTS was absolutely Burt Reynolds. A 90's classic!
