I saw this movie by chance. It was shown very late or more correctly very early one morning on television. I was woken up and had trouble sleeping and this movie came on. It is about a topic covered many times elsewhere (it is certainly not as good as Education Rita, despite a few further phrases) and has a very predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Despite the very obvious shortcomings, I have enjoyed the movie and it was thanks to some of its actors acting rather than the story or piece as a whole. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Sam Neil and have seen him in a variety of movies including: Dead Calm; The piano; sirens; The children of revolution; Event Horizon; Bicentennial Man and the ubiquitous Jurassic Park. He was very good, but he could have played this part with his eyes closed. Some of the actors were, in my opinion, horrible Rose Byrne, for example, and some of the elusions were rather heavily handed over (all blanket women live all disguised in white). <br /> <br /> However, two actors (who I didn't or can't remember before) impressed Sin√©ad Cusackn as Frances (Frank) Kennedy, and especially Matthew Newton as her son David. He was especially convincing and I would like to see much more of him.
