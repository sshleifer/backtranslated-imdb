Totally amazing! Humor, up-beat music and an anti-war message make this the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love how smart this movie is, especially in the Vietnam part of reason. It is interesting how they make army officials enforce the draft look ridiculous. Follow it with the grave situation of the current war and then the conclusion (which leaves me to look in anger with the war); And yet there is absolutely no violence on the screen. Wow. <br /> <br /> The music is also really cool. But what is very unique in this musical (as opposed to Evita, or the Wizard of Oz, for example) is that the texts do not tell the story. The mood does (along with visuals and middle-song dialogue): "Donna" is an optimistic song that emphasizes the happy mood, while "Flesh Failures" has a struggling, intense battle in a small key. <br /> <br /> I also notice that the LSD scene is not very flattering. Now I definitely do not do drugs (not what I have ever thought of). All in all, this is a great movie. The only negative comment I could say is that sometimes it is difficult to hear the dialogue. But who cares? 10/10 stars!
