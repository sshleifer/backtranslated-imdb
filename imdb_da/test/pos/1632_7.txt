I read angels and demons about 3 years ago and I can honestly say that is one of the few books I could not put down while reading. However, the film was pretty much what I had expected, a lot of actions, with something of a mystery story. Tom Hanks, in my opinion, plays a much better role, Professor Langdon than in the Da Vinci Code. <br /> <br /> You don't have to worry that this is as bad as The Da Vinci Code, this is all it wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more excitement and less of the unnecessary controversy. If you haven't read the book, no worries, you'll still find it very interesting. And if you've read the book, you might say that you might be a little let down because I found many scenes missing, which I was looking forward to. <br /> <br /> All in all, Pretty impressive movie for every day movie movie. But maybe nothing too special for Dan Brown fans.
