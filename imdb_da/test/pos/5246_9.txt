John Wayne's first lead was blowing me straight away. TV letterbox style at AMC, I had to check and make sure I had the right date. Surely this 1930 film was made using a 55 mm wide screen process. Apart from that, it has some of the most gracious and most realistic pictures of the trek west I've seen. Trolleys, men and animals are really lowered down a mower with ropes. Trees are carved by burly men - and burly women - so the train can move another 10 feet. The Indians are not the "beautiful boy" city skitters who portrayed them later; They are the right deal. A river crossing in a cold rain is so realistic, it must be right (In fact, I understand that director Raoul Walsh almost lost all the throws in that order). I could smell the wet canvas. Every day is a pain. The various sub-options are forgettable, but the movie as a whole is not. I can't think of another title that can beat The Big Trail in evoking a sense of living history on the trail to Oregon. Bravo.
