I watched this movie on my local cable system under the title 'Beyond Redemption'. I was looking for new material to look at, as most of the reruns one Saturday morning did not interest me. I've always been a fan of Andrew McCarthy and Michael Ironside, so I chose this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. Personally, I enjoyed the movie. Rich Roesing, who wrote a comment that the film was spoiled for him by watching scenes from the movie behind a video rental box, is well-founded. I didn't have the disappointment of knowing beforehand about the movie. This led me to judge the film higher than the average score on the page. <br /> <br /> I like exciting movies and this was no exception. The movie kept me guessing until the end. I was surprised at the end! <br /> <br /> The moments of reflection and memory of past experiences of the main character of the film were only added to the excitement. His reactions to these memories gave the film a sense of the humanitarian but conflicting side of the police. Fighting with their faith is also a welcome addition. <br /> <br /> If you like excitement movies, but also movies that show the character's feel, personal bend side, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie on your local cable or satellite system guide, watch it! <br /> <br /> But if you're looking for a rental video, follow Rich Roesing's advice and get someone to get the video for you before you see it.
