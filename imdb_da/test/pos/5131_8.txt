Saw the movie today and thought it was a good bet, good news for kids. A little predictable. The book was better, gave more details about the plot, the ore about the environment and how the children uncovered the conspiracy. I think Hiasse's skewed humor comes across better in the book than the movie, but there were also many fun moments in the film. It is probably a little too slow for children under the age of 6. Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as a science teacher. And the baby owls were cute. I wonder how they managed to film them. The movie showed a lot of Florida as it was best, it made it very appealing. Do I imagine that, or has the author Carl Hiassen made a short look?
