When "Madame" decides to let her cats inherit her, it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar, who is next in line to inherit, decides to get rid of cats. Thus, history can begin and cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming but not entirely credible cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and fun situations until the inevitable happy end. <br /> <br /> The power of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply fun as the offended butler who is out to settle the score and of course he takes serious blows. One of the best scenes involves being chased by the two dogs Lafayette and Napoleon. The score is large and in "Jungle Book" you have scenes that are almost "musical" in the sense that the story does not progress and the focus is to let the protagonists express themselves through dance. And of course we like that the score is quite jazzy. <br /> <br /> And of course it's not just me but also my kids who love this one. <br /> <br /> Regards Simon
