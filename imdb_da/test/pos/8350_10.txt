Lady and tramp ii: scamp's adventure, I think is a good movie, but I think the first lady and the pedal movie are better because it is the original and I think the original movies in relation to The sequels are better. Lady and tramp ii go after the original, but this time it is the junior's trip, Lady and Tramp's youth (sham) always hates having been treated with the things to be done with him, according to the rules of the house, taking baths all the time and Take things well and easily, the scamp gets angry and runs away with a pack of dogs that are released. Scamp meets another dog named Angel, they both go together fine and do what the mum and dad did, with an Italian meal (Spagetthi and meatballs, etc.) Afterwards Scamp acknowledges that he is loved by his family, especially his companion who is the baby, scamp comes back and the angel is joined in the family. I give this movie 10 out of 10.
