We all enjoy the movie. It is a very charming family movie with many fun cameos. It was fun watching the Austin musicians, Charlie Robison, Joe Ely and Robert Earl Keen in the movie, as well as the famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is especially sweet in the movie, but all the kids are good. The western Texas landscape is amazing, as is the soundtrack full of Texas artists. The last half seemed a little far fetched to me, but my son was interested in the whole movie, which is not so often with him. Something in the story was captivating for children. After showing calves as a child, I really liked the end. It is certainly not the way it really works unless you have heifers.
