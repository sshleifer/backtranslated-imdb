The basic film of this film has already been described in several other comments, so I will not bother. I would like to first praise the producer, cast, directors and crew for creating a wonderful engaging movie on a small $ 1M budget, a small part of standard Hollywood fare that doesn't look cheap. These people have a drive to do something new and entertaining while not spending a fortune doing it. This is mainly art for the sake of art. I know that some of you will decide that this is not art but something less, and that's fine. I'm glad people like these will continue to put time and effort into our favor without expecting large multimillion dollar payouts. Now to the criticism. I feel that the scenario presented is credible to a point. It is wonderful when everything goes out and the hero / hero saves the day and everything is good that ends well. What gets me is the obvious manipulation of the events, so blind luck is more responsible than courage and strength. <br /> <br /> When the lee was attacked but not severely injured, she somehow rinsed on a mudflat right next to death guidance. Then, miraculously, his loaded revolver is still in his holster, and it actually works (after some cleaning and fiddling). Finally, when Lee is attacked on the mud bank and jumps into the water, the croc fails to kill her again. She ends up with her hand in her (her?) Mouth and repeatedly pulls the trigger, eventually blowing out the brains of the hook (literally). I came to the conclusion that if Lee hand in hand with croc was just a way to end the movie with man in triumph. Based on what I've seen, the hook's attack continues and continues to hold on until the prey stops fighting. Croc's will spin around and around to blow up and drown the prey. It happened with the first 3 victims, but not Lee. She had teeth marks, but they were not deep. I think the ending would have been better if the croc won, honestly and thus proved his dominance of mangroves, his territory for millions of years. But then how many of us would have been disturbed or disappointed that the beautiful girl didn't come out alive?
