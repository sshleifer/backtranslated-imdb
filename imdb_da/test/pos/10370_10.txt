Some less than inspired open string music in spite of that, we somehow know that from the word this goes straight to the "big fun" drawer. At the time we see Monica Dolan (in a true genius piece of casting), it looks good like Cora, we are already hooked, but it is only later when she reveals herself in her amazing screen creation, horrified, twilight , stupid queen of murder and fraud, in the shadow of the pristine Miss Gilchrist, that she not only effortlessly steals the whole telemovie to herself, but simply blows off the screen anyone coming near her, including the always well-measured David Suchet, whom he himself seems to be a bit bedazzled by her acting talents and, very gentlemanly, gives her the opportunity to take the center. Dolan is the true engine of the movie and her Miss Gilchrist is a truly well-rounded character in this Christie rendition, aided by a sharp manuscript and the sharp direction - and also by the rest of the cast led by Geraldine James and Dominic Jephcott, all of which show signs of sympathy for the given material and plays with taste accordingly. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are spot on as usual, and if there are weaker links, they may be placed in the relatively substandard music score for most later poirots, and perhaps also in the absence of a true Italian born actress for the role of Cora's husband. Apart from that, it is an hour and a half of pure far-sighted joy that is as self-reliant and entertaining as it is lovingly put together.
