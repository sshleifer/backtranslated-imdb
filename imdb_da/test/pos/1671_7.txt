As far as I am concerned, this film noir had two completely different things to it, unlike the movies noirs I am used to seeing: 1 - the setting is Paris, France; 2 - There is a 28-minute scene without dialogue. <br /> <br /> Both make this movie a bit unique, at least for English-speaking movie noir fans. In fact, an American, Jules Dussain, shot the film, so it's not quite a European movie. I was initially disappointed with this after I had seen the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I'm bored. But when the silent segment started - the actual heist (you already know what it's all about), the movie picked up considerably and got better and better. In fact, I thought the best part of the story was what happened after the hoist. The best aspect of the whole movie was cinematography. This makes the disk worth owning. It's great movie noir photography and a real travel suggestion for those of us who have never seen Paris ... and this is Paris in the mid-1950s. There are lots of gloomy-but-interesting rainy Paris streets and buildings I found fascinating to see. In fact, there were many more of the big shots than in London in the much better known movie, The Third Man. <br /> <br /> I think the leading actor in here, Jean Servais, is his name is also interesting to see. Someone described his face as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton, and it sums it up perfectly. A warning for those who do not expect snares or nudity in a classic movie. This is France, not the US, so there is a little bit of both in here. I appreciate the DVD, which offers the choice of subtitles or a dubbed version as well.
