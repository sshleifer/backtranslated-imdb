I watched a television movie about the devastation in Waco, Texas. Obviously, it was heavily skewed against the assertion that David Koresh was a murderous, childish rapist who led himself to killing as many police as he wanted and took his people to heaven on a blood-colored staircase. <br /> <br /> The film was a little more than propaganda, detailing what we had already read in the newspapers. I'm more and more sure about it since I saw the great documentary Waco: The Rules of Engagment. Not that all claims in this movie should be taken as the truth of God, but it tells the whole story rather than reviving only what law enforcement it decided to tell. <br /> <br /> For those who have forgotten, Koresh was the spiritual leader of the religious movement called The Branch Davidians. Taxes for drug abuse, kidnapping, illegal arms ownership and compulsory rape (among other things I am sure) raised the suspicions of the local police, then later the federal law enforcement. During the attempt to operate a search message, the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) and the clan participated in a shooting that left the deceased and wounded on both sides. It was then that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) became involved. The communication between the two was sprouted, but eventually turned down. The FBI was preparing for an invasion by attacking the building with flash-bang grenades and gas. When the building burned to the ground and killed many inside, including Koresh, the FBI refused to admit responsibility that says the "cult" inside should have set it on fire. This heard images of Jim Jones and other violent religious organizations. <br /> <br /> The image puts on many masks to tell its story. It begins with a sample of the congressional hearings, perhaps the "truth" of the post, anyway. What is eye opening is how the partisan politicians remained even in a difficult and serious situation like this. The Democrats were concerned about nothing more than defending every action taken by law enforcement. It was the Republicans who seemed open to the other side. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to relate all the new information and analysis from this documentary. In addition, a list would take away from the movie opening as it goes along. An example would be the heartbreaking fact that children died within the connection. The filmmakers are more likely to sit with Davidians in general, but remain relatively open to each side. In this case, the ancestors seem to be guilty of mistreating a situation involving innocent children. But on the other hand, parents have to bear some of the blame for letting their children get into this detrimental situation, as they could have released them to any number of local authorities. Probably the most amazing new information comes late in the movie and involves the FBI's claim that they didn't fire on the building. This is up for interpretation, and I will not reveal more than to say that it is disturbing and shocking, what can and cannot be told. <br /> <br /> The federal officers are not held in a critical or corrupt light any more than Koresh. The greatest condemnation seems to be leveled on the media, unwilling to tell both sides of a story. This element appears widespread in recent documentaries, duly so I think. It is time that the media return to tell news stories and leave this relentless pursuit of what will draw the greatest audience and ratings. It's hard to destroy a documentary. In most cases, a camera and editing turn on interesting pieces of life, and tell a great story. What few can do is throw such new light on a topic that the way you think is forever changed. Waco is that kind of movie. ***. 5 out of ****
