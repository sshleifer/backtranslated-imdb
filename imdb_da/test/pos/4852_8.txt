This is a film about a man that everyone believes is Jewish. This is a movie about Lawrence Newman living in Brooklyn in the 1940s at the time of World War II. One day, when he gets glasses, people start to think he's a Jew. And only because he looks like one. And he lives in a very anti-Semitic neighborhood. Then some begin to treat him as dirt. They make the judgment that is Jewish, by Larry's fresh wife, Gertrude Hart. It makes their lives unbearable. Teddy Slavin's Focus (2001) is a pretty good look at anti-Semitism. It's a problem that won't go away. The film is based on Athur Miller's novel, which I admit, I have not read. movies are really good so I'm sure the book would. the actors do good work. William H.macy is always good and his work as Larry Newman is brilliant. laura dern is done hart and she is magnificent.Meat Loaf is almost scary as a neighbor who wants to keep the Jews out with the necessary means.David Paymer's character as the Jewish shop owner Mr. Finkelstein is the most sympathetic in the movie.Paymer is the perfect choice for the role. One of the biggest scenes is ultimately when Mr.Finkelstein and Newman fight against the Nazi people with baseball bats. They go together to fight evil. The Christian and the Jew.
