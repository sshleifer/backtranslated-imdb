This covers virtually all areas of the creative process, and goes through the three phases chronologically, with the main focus placed on the production. There are documentaries that go into detail and better cover the other two groups. This consists of works of art, behind-the-scenes footage, movie clips and many interviews. With a running time coming in just over two hours, the audience is entitled to many information, as this is almost the same length as the film itself. It could be argued that much of the time is spent on the people, with the craftsmanship and the result of their cooperation efforts coming in the other. This is well done, with close editing. It comes into the technology some, and reveals how certain effects were achieved. This spends a lot of time on physical training, preparing for the fighting and so on. You get good, honest shots of both people, crew and actors. Ultimate Matrix 10 Disc This includes almost three hours of music in a simple system with individual track selection and a Play All feature, approx. 38 minutes worth of BTS material in addition to the actual title in various featurettes. The original release, however, has several very short extras, including clips of the creation of sequels, an example of The Animatrix and the Yuen Wo Ping Blocking Tapes (a complete passage of a few of the greatest martial arts sequences with stunt artists and almost the exact filmography, with the same shots and angles of these bits in the finished silver bet insert). The language is quite strong, but rather rare, almost non-existent. I recommend either a version of this to anyone who enjoys the concept and / or wants to know how they put the first together. 10.7
