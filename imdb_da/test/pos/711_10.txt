Peter Strauss, who obviously appears in mini-series and television films, often gets an unreasonably high proportion of bad reviews - usually from random observers who saw ten minutes of the movie and have channel-jumped into the halfway through. Now I just read all the other 20 reviews for this movie and am happy to see not a bad word about The Jericho Mile - It'll probably make you blow up to buy this movie !! <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss won an Emmy for his role in this movie and watched it, even once showing you why he deserved it so much .... <br /> <br /> For Being objective I tried to criticize this movie. Instead, I found myself arguing down every one of my possible nit-picks. This is what real, realistic filmmaking is all about. This is not your typical Hollywood sensationalism where everything is exaggerated - It is so realistic and true in life that people have believed it is based on a real event !!
