The film is about Paul (Páll) a young man sinking into the hard world of insanity and his stay at the mental hospital Kleppur and his friends. Victor (Viktor), who during his education in England began to believe he was Adolf Hitler. Peter (Peter), who took too much LSD and tried to fly off a roofing plate, left no broken bones or physical injuries, only insane, he's obbsesed with China. Oli Beatle (Óli Bítill) Oli has spent most of the time in the hospital, although Viktor is a bit older than he claims he wrote each Beatles song and sends it to them via telepathy <br /> <br /> The novel is better than the film and covers the whole of Paul's life from birth to his death, which is a long time since I saw the movie, but if I remember correctly, the film does not cover Paul's childhood. "Angels of the Universe" is fun, sad and powerful if you haven't seen it now! and read the story first, it makes the movie better
