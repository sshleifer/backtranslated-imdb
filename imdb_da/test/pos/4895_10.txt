I must admit, when I first heard about the Apocalypse movie, it was a concern. I mean, they have a lot to live up to, aren't they? When they first made a stage show, they won the Perrier Prize, and when they made radio, they won a Sony award. When they ventured on our telly, they won a Bafta prize, a Royal Television Society Award and the Golden Rose of Montreux. <br /> <br /> When the first series was broadcast in January 1999, it was fun! A real fresh air in the British comedy and when the second series aired a year later, it built on this foundation and sealed showing cult status around the world. Our web statistics show that we have received visitors from each country on the planet! The local show for local people showed Ghent's talent for live performance and opened doors for the gents to do more live performing like 'Art' at the western end. <br /> <br /> The favorite of the favorites has always been the Christmas special, less a sketch show and more a tribute to classic horror movies, but still wrapped in the delicious league style. <br /> <br /> And of course there was the "difficult" third series, still a hit with the loyal hardcore fans of course, but perhaps a little ahead of their time for a regular television audience. <br /> <br /> As I say, much to live up to. <br /> <br /> So now we have the movie and ... Well a movie is different isn't it? It is seen by much larger numbers than radio or TV shows and with the third series in mind I was worried. As you know, I was fortunate enough to see the movie yesterday at a print screening in London and all my doubts were blown away (literally) in the first few minutes! I will not give plot lines away as some reviewers have done, nor will I tell you the catch phrases (though there is only one), but I will try to tell you what they have achieved with this movie! To leave the cinema on Monday night I could only imagine writing 'Oh my God, it's brilliant, it's great, it's the best they've ever done, better than the first, second and specials everyone rolled into one!' Of course, I owe my visitors a much better explanation than that! So why is it brilliant? This is a movie for everyone, the casual fan, the obsessive fan, the occasional fan and even someone who's put in the wrong movie theater! You don't have to watch the series enjoy this movie; It works on so many levels. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of why I'm a league of gentlemen! You can tell that filming was also a true love work; The attention to detail is incredible. The sets for the TV show were always detailed, but I have to watch the movie again just to look at the background! The story goes at a fast pace, the action that takes us from Royston Vasey to the real world where we meet the "Creators", which of course is the League itself! Along the way we manage to encounter favorite characters from the show, but always within the central story as opposed to the TV show show. <br /> <br /> I was glad the movie was dark in places, a little scary and a bit strange ... just fitting to The Gentlemen League. The gents also managed to avenge the BBC censors, not so much slipping into the word 'Mongoloid' as screaming it from the roof tops! Some may think of Ghent's portrayal of himself a little indulgently, but it's a joke, and with that comes my only concern, those in jokes I mention below can puzzle some viewers and they can come across a little too clever ... but I shouldn't worry, there is always a poo joke waiting just around the corner and talking about jokes, they come thick and fast, and in a mix of clever references, wig jokes, bum jokes, visual jokes and cock gags! I haven't laughed aloud in a movie theater since ... well, I can't remember it! The fans who have been 'with' the league since the beginning are rewarded with lots of 'in' jokes, some working on two levels, an ordinary audience can laugh at a reference to a CD disc for some reason, while fans of the local show will laugh for another reason altogether! The cameos are genius! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg are the weirdest double action you've ever seen, Simon gets one of the movie's biggest laughs just by making a sound! I was a little worried about the 1690 aspect of the movie when I first heard about it, but as a story in a story I just got into it when ... but it would tell! All I have to say is that it fits in wonderfully and adds to the overall feel of the movie! I am not a professional film reviewer, so I find it hard to say how much I enjoyed this movie, but for now I just want to say that if the expected benchmark for British comedy films in recent years was excellent ' Shaun of the dead 'I'm sorry, but a new benchmark has just been put off by the ingenuity, fun and sometimes a bit scary ... The Gentlemen's Apocalypse League. <br /> <br /> Jason Kenny 2005
