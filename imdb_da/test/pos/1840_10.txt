Gracie (Minnie Driver), a woman at the end of the twenties, is on the waiting list for heart transplantation. Bob (David Duchovny) has just had the tragedy of losing his wife in a car accident. One can guess the outcome. Gracie receives Bob's wife's heart even though they don't know each other .... yet! A year later, Gracie feels like a new person, while Bob is just beginning to think of his social life. When a friend puts him on a blind date, he finds himself interested in the waitress, Gracie, in the restaurant where the date takes place. They start to see each other. How long will it be before the truth materializes and what will the consequences be? This lovely, fun and touching movie is one of the best romantic comedies ever built. The two stars are dazzling as the couple who only sky could gather, and it supports, Bonnie Hunt, Jim Belushi, and Carroll O'Connor, who also support. The location near Chicago is also charming and beautiful. Let's do it for costumes and scripts. If you know someone who goes through mirthful love stories, you will be in their good grace forever if you introduce him or her to this fine movie.
