This movie would be especially fun for anyone who has been in the movie industry, especially in some indie capacities ... those whose legacy includes a movie introduction should not appreciate it as much. I am hard to please in the documentary category. This document is different, but it is a pleasure that comes from an earthly realism of indie filmmaker punks that is a hoot to be around and see. Whether you've ever wondered what it's like to be in the movies, in front of or behind the camera, or if you've worked your way through the sometimes painful and tough but rewarding indie world, you'll definitely get a kick out of this movie.
