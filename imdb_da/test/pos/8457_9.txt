The first thing you see in this movie is a static angle (one that will be repeated later in the movie) and depicts the chaos (invisible to the audience) in a study flowing news. Soon after, Fonda's character character appears at the same angle. Don't let this mislead you; The film is not about a female journalist, a woman struggling to succeed in a male-dominated profession. It's just a lead-in, a way to start the movie (even if it's used later). The real point to this production is gradually being revealed, and the first thing we see is in a deliberately long scene early on. The whole movie has that pace; not slow or pronounced, but conscious. It is never really fast, even in the few sequences that you would normally expect to be. This pacing (especially because it seems to slow itself down as the plot is revealed, as the disturbing, disturbing nature of the film is unraveled) is strong, almost painful for the viewer. It inspires you, if possible, jump onto the screen, grab those in charge of the collar and shout at them to * do something about it to remedy the situation. Never once do I want to get up or even take my eyes off the screen for a moment. The subject is extremely important to be aware of, and it is handled perfectly here. No overdramation (well ... very small, anyway), just an accurate presentation of the problem. The direction is amazing. The empathy that felt for Lemmon's character is profound. The editing is masterful ... a scene near the end illustrates it perfectly. The editor who judges from his filmography is very undervalued. The script was excellent. The action was great, especially by Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas (who also produced it). The lack of a score is perfect; No music is needed to improve. The end is sublime and effective. The film has a few negative points ... among them, part of the dialogue is, of course, and undoubtedly, mainly exhibit, a particular part of the movie, while it is dramatic, not in line with anything that follows it. Not everyone will watch the movie because of two functions in what is commonly (and rightly) attributed to bad movies; pacing (which can be confused with being slow) and (missing) scores. One could argue for being a negative thing that everyone should consider the points it presents, but perhaps it is better in this way; handling the heavy subject with intelligence and respect (for the subject as well as the viewer) ... something like this, maybe it should not happen in the vagina. I was fascinated with the movie and was very surprised. I recommend it to anyone who believes they are strong enough to do it. 9.10
