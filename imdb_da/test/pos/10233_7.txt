If you're looking for an original horror flick, this could be for you. It is strange and sometimes lingers of stupidity, but it is just such a nice, fine sound and original film, it never fails, except perhaps during that long climax. "Nightbreed" is a must see for horror fans, or for fans of monster movie makeup. <br /> <br /> Boone (Craig Sheffer) has had dreams of a city called Midian full of mutant creatures. In therapy, his psychiatrist is Dr. Decker (frightening director David Cronenberg) came to the conclusion that Boone is a killer and gives him hallucinogenic pills and tells him to settle. After almost being killed, Boone ends up in the hospital where he runs into a mental patient who also knows Midian and tells Boone where to go. Midian, located in a cemetery, is inhabited by unforgettable mutant creatures who do not enter Boone. After deleting himself with only one unpleasant bite, Boone is shot dead by the police, which led to his placement by Dr. Decker. But Boone is not dead. The bit makes him live, and he goes out to Midian. Meanwhile, Boone's girlfriend Lori (Anne Bobby) is trying to find Boone and get to the bottom of this. When Dr. Decker also finds out this place, chaos arises. The plot seems long and complicated, but it's really not hard to understand. The reason is among other things. this movie really interesting. The makeup effects are amazing. The creatures look unique and amazing, and make this a very appealing movie. To add to more senses, we have a musical score of Danny Elfman, who is both lush and bouncing and fits the movie as a glove. The shoots in the film are also created beautifully. The cinematography is lovely and the film creates an atmosphere that never breaks. Even the play is good, with the greatest surprise being director David Cronenberg, who gives a great threatening performance as the man who for some reason wants to see Boone's death. It's strange that a horror movie is so well done. <br /> <br /> The problems with the movie ... and there are a few, but the positives outweigh the negatives. The script occasionally contains lama jokes to try to add some humor, but almost everyone falls flat. The mutant creatures look good and mostly it is well-acted, but sometimes it feels like they just make their amazing makeup for the camera. The worst part of the movie should be climax. It takes so long and is just constant chaos. It is the part of the movie that moves from individual characters and fine tight shots, to burning explosions from each direction and violence happening to signs we don't know or care about. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is great to watch. It's a well done horror movie, but even with that said, it has occasional failure in character lines, and a messy climax. Nevertheless, this is one to check out. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out of ****. 101 min. R for strong violence and language.
