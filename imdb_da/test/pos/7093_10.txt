It is not surprising that the majority of the higher ranked voices were submitted by women aged 45+. This is the time frame of women's lives when they become carers of elderly and sick parents. I lost my mother, from cancer complications in June, and went through most of the same emotions that Zellweger portrayed in this movie. Yes, it made me cry, but the tears were real, the signs were real, and plot development was extremely accurate. Kudos to the whole cast and crew for a wonderful portrayal of life and death and the promises of tomorrow.
