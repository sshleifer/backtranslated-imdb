"Children of Wax" also appear as "Killing grounds" an interesting mix of genres. Some may think that the purity of the genes can only be beneficial, but for me the eclectic symbiosis is very entertaining. It is also in its history the mixture of thriller and the popular action as well as the combination of the historical masterpiece and ethnic care for tolerance. This film is built with the star-clear presence of my favorite actor, the perfect Armand Assante, but it is also influenced by the actors' performance? Hal Ozan. We have recently seen him in the TV series on HBO called "Sex". "Children of Wax" is entertainment for the public, but at the same time it has an eternal morality for ethnic tolerance. This is a wise way to formulate welfare. Discussion about today's problems in our days can be made with attractive means. This is very positive side of the movie "Children of Wax".
