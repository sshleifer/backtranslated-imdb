It's a great movie for the whole family. I don't think many people have seen it because I ask people and they say they have never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister-in-law. My favorite scene is the whole movie, I can't even choose a favorite scene. My favorite character is Hubert, because he is a fun, yet smart dog. If anyone has not seen it, they miss a great adventure. I only saw it because my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy from her. If anyone reads this, I suggest buying the movie and I guaranteed it will not be a bad decision. I've seen this movie about five times, and each time it gives me the same message, dogs are as smart as people just give them a chance.
