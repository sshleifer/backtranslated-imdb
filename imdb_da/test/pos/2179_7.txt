Well, I just watched Buster Keaton's film debut in Fatty Arbuckle's Butcher's Boy and - despite the red way, everything just seems to happen for almost no logical reason - I found plenty to laugh at. Like Buster ordering molasses from slaughter child Fatty, Buster returns to pay, Buster says he puts it in the bucket that has molasses, Fatty dumps molasses in Buster's hat and takes money Buster takes hat back on his head as it gets stuck, fat trying to remove it while molasses falls to the floor, busters feet are now stuck to the floor and so on. It probably didn't read fun, but on the screen it was fun as if there was something more slapstick that involved flour that was thrown, and a later sequence that takes place in Fatty's boyfriend's boarding school with Fatty dressed in drag and Buster helps Fatty's rival also in a row. As I said, many scenes did not say anything, but visuals, especially those involving Arbuckle and Keaton, are causing themselves today. Recommended view for Keaton finishers.
