It's just stories, some we want, happen to us, some we never want to happen to us, all about unfulfilled desire. The location and the nude bodies are beautiful, but after the other story, all I could think was 'it takes more than just beauty to create a real movie'. Then of course the film unfolds. The stories are moving unless Sophie Marceau does not communicate her story in this movie. However, Malkovich plays the story for both of them. Voiceover fails to connect the stories, but helps Malkovich provoke something. <br /> <br /> I'd say it's worth seeing and the best of Antonioni I've seen. Considering his age - remarkable!
