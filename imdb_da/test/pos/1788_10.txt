After my name is BARBRA's success across the table, CBS TV gave Barbra the opportunity to create an even more detailed follow-up as its second special. Streisand knew wisely to keep up with MYND BARBRA's groundbreaking success that her second special would need to raise the bar even more in ingenuity and play. Not surprisingly, it succeeded again. Even more impressive Streisand succeeded in mounting this great production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of my name is barbra. <br /> <br /> Once again, the thesis is divided into three different actions. The movie at Bergdorf Goodman's department store was so successful in the first special, that Streisand and the company decided to film again at the site of the first law of this second special. The decided place this time was the Philadelphia Art Museum, which would allow endless chances of Barbra being able to "go in" various works of art that would correspond to the songs performed. In addition to the many artistic possibilities that this location enabled, the museum would offer the perfect opportunity to utilize color film shooting. After the recording of "Draw me a Circle" which is set against the opening, Barbra dashes then around the museum in a girl costume for the core of harb and harbach's "yesterdays." She stops to admire various paintings and statues, which often become the character that is depicted and sings a thematically appropriate song. Streisand performs a bittersweet representation of Hammerstein and Romberg's "One Kiss" as Thomas Eakins CONCERT SINGER, delivers a hilarious campy performance of Chopin's "Minute Waltz" as Marie Antoinette, embraces abstract art with the frantic rhythm of Peter Matz's "Gotta Move" and performs a scary reproduction of "Non C'est Rien" as a distraught Modigliani girl. The highest point in Act I, however, is when Streisand compares profiles with the bust sculpture of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti while singing a turn the force release of Rogers and Hart's "Where or When." Act II circus medley allows Streisand to interact with different farms and circus animals while singing different songs with farm / circus / animal themes. Some highlights include Barbra, who sings "was the special face" of a baby elephant who performed "I have grown to that face" as a serenade to a pig, the "Sam you made the trousers for long" song to a group. of baby penguins, and Barbra compares profiles with an anteater while crooning "We have so much in common." Streisand also swings on the trapeze and jumps from a trampoline to the "Spring Again" reflex and then lowers it by performing a ghost version of "I was too long for the fair" while I was sitting alone on the stage. Barbra also gets the chance to show her pet poodle Sadie in this segment and even speak a little French. The Act III concert is once again the highest point of the hour. Dressed in a slimming white wool dress, the concert segment is performed at a uniquely designed stage with a partial staircase leading nowhere. Streisand opens the law with a sultry surrender of Harold Arls 'Anyplace In Hang My Hat Is Home', before launching in hearty versions of the well-known standard "It Had To Be You" and it rarely heard "C'est Si Bon So Good" . " Streisand really impresses the audience with a breathtakingly powerful, octave-floating performance of the Sweet Charity ballad "Where am I going", of which Streisand delivers the final version of. Streisand also introduces the recently written Richard Maltby, Jr.-David Shire ballad "Starting Here, Starting Now", which contains a passionate vocal from Streisand, which is among the best vocal performances in his long career. <br /> More than anything, Color Me Barbra was a showcase for Streisand's ever-growing, mega-wattage power. Despite the presence of even more visual razzle glare, Streisand itself is always the main attraction. Her voice sounds as beautiful as ever, and this particular was the first to show how striking she was photographing in color. As with my name is BARBRA, COLOR ME BARBRA was another rating smash and created another top five, gold-selling soundtrack album. Simply put, COLOR ME BARBRA challenges tradition and appears as a sequel that is almost on par with a classic original.
