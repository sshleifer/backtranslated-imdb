Four stories of drug trafficking in Europe are being intertwined during these six sub-ministries. In Germany, a businessman is arrested on drug trafficking, and his wife is trying to save her family by continuing her husband's illegal trade. Meanwhile, the British home secretary travels to Pakistan to negotiate an aid package, which he hopes will stop the drug flow from that country. Even as he does this, his own daughter relies on heroin addiction and tears their family apart. These are the miniseries on which the American film and miniseries were based. The original is far better than its two decendants. The third world poverty and desperation are described very well. It is sharp, uncompromising and brutal.
