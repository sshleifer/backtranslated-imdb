I'm a big Gone With Wind nut, but I was disappointed that both the Gone With The Wind movie and the Scarlett mini series are so different from the books. Gone With The Wind left so many things in the movie, which was in the book, and they did the same with Scarlett. Both were great movies, but I really liked both books better. There were so many characters left by Scarlett, and some characters had no time to correspond to the book. The timelines do not match either. Scarlett realizes she is pregnant on the ship to Ireland in the book, but she understands it when she vomits in the Savannah. Also Sally is made to be an ugly monkey as a woman in the book and the movie threw Jean Smart to play her, who of course is not a nasty woman. All in all, Scarlett is a great movie, and it helps everyone who was disappointed with the way Gone With The Wind ended to see what might have happened if Margaret Mitchell had lived to write a sequel herself.
