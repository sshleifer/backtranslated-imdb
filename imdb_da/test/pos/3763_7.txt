I love this movie a lot. I'll get it on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so bad that you cannot read a written joke about the department. I am forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterwards. He did both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally trustworthy. <br /> <br /> The movie is plagued by the low budget. (An awful edit goes in the middle word and was described on "Siskel & Ebert".) But there are a thousand jokes, views for subtle references that more than compensate. I often find that I quote lines (or song "I have nothing to hide") and from time to time describe a scene that matches a conversation. There are at least six scenes that are among my favorite prayers of all time. Viewers who have no history of cocaine use can miss many gags. <br /> <br /> "Here, take it." * Visual driving while waving ass out the window. * "I said, 'Is this seat taken?'" "Nice Burn!" Visual of chaps, headgear, jockstrap, and swim fins. * "Yes, I have the right hand." * "Me! Me!" says the woman is trying to sell 'nads. * "Bernie will love these." * "It's my feet, Jack." say the black feet. * "Why should we tell you?" "She's at the supermarket!" * "Ivy!" at the supermarket PA. * Loads the entire shopping cart in ambulance. * etc.
