The jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie. The only sci-fi part is the wool mother that lives today. Elephants attack villages in a part of India, and these attacks also kill people. An expedition is sent to investigate, and one of its members, an American hunter, is because these elephants are frightened by wicked mammoths who are supposed to be extinct. No one believes in him first, but they do when the mammoth looks at the end. An earthquake ends them. <br /> <br /> The jungle was shot on the spot in India and has a lot of beautiful scenes and good Indian music, including some songs that keep the movie moving nicely together. Mammoths are actually genuine elephants with fur coats and long tusks are stuck. <br /> <br /> Casting includes Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero (The Lost Continent) and Marie Windsor (Cat-Women of the Moon). /> <br /> The jungle is worth seeing just for the landscape and music. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
