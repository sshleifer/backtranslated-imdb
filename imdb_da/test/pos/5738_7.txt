A group of teenagers decide to take their dormant party to an abandoned school where 27 years earlier an awful massacre took place. Unfortunately, the person responsible for the slaughter lurks the halls of the obsolete school, and he is not satisfied with their presence. <br /> <br /> This movie is not like the most modern teens we've seen. It is much darker, much more exciting, no wise crushing murderer, etc. And I liked it for these reasons. From a film production point of view, it's not amazing. The action is below average. The script was rather poor and full of clichÃ©s that contained randomly cast references to American horror films, some of which did not even make sense (like ... "Have you seen Scream 3?" Asks a girl. Yes, I have, and it had nothing to do with going through the doors of an old school, so it in no way concerns this movie). But hey, it's a slasher flick, they're part of the fun. The under-utilization of characters was also strongly exhibited in this film. There were six main characters (not including the security guard) and to be honest only three or four were really used. Two characters (the token black guy and another girl not important enough to get a label) barely spoke: Between them I would estimate about five or six lines in total. Also, the girls (apart from one) were not formed well enough to distinguish them from each other. They could have replaced each of the girls several times throughout the movie, and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. However, the pacing works well, as the horror begins right from the start and rarely ceases. The atmosphere is well utilized and the direction reveals some truly chilling moments. . . Although the overall look is a little inexpensive appearance because of what I assume is low quality camera equipment (and operation). The end, although I liked the idea they were supposed to, was pretty poorly done. It felt rushed and unexplained enough to do it effectively. With the time they spent around looking for nothing, they could have spent a little more time on the conclusion to make sure that a random event was thrown away without good reason (which is a mistake many modern horror movies have hit of). But ignoring some annoying issues and trying to focus on the first 98% of the film rather than the end, it's actually a pretty good modern slasher that should be checked out, especially if you're a fan of Spanish and / or Mandatory Slasher Elements: /> - Violence / Gore: There is a lot of blood and gore, realistically done, but not shoveling. Violence is extremely well done, not for excess but rather brutal at points. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: Just about the hottest girl in the movie. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer: Now security guards are hardly considered "cool," but this guy is pretty bad. His scary smile was chilling. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: The excitement is top class. . . very tense, very well done. There are also some very creepy moments, such as melted frills and the eerie atmosphere. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: No one really at all. <br /> <br /> - Creepy dance scene: Of course: between a couple of guys and a half unwilling woman in the backlink. <br /> <br /> - Classic quote of the movie: 'Another trophy.' <br /> <br /> Final judgment: 7/10. This can stretch it, but fans of Session 9 might just check it out for the same tone and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
