I can't say I've had it as much as "The Big Lebowski" or "Raising Arizona" and felt a little light, but "O Brother" is an enjoyable movie worthy of some good laughs and a taste of Coens 'lively, twisted sense of creativity. The DVD edition contains the featurette, and I was interested in finding out that Coensne is quite simple in their directorial techniques. That surprised me! Of course, this movie is not the best example (and I only say this in comparison) and it wasn't worth any Oscars (many feel it was robbed), but maybe it depends on the appeal. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoy Coens' past work, I've never been a fan of old westerns or "The Hinkards Dukes" or any of the things they show daily on TNN. That's why I didn't feel so excited to check out this movie when it came to southern folk music. For all those from the south who read this, I do not mean to offend any of your people! I'm sure you feel the same when you watch movies about urban areas like "A Bronx Speech." When you live in the city throughout your life, it's hard to get used to movies of this kind. But all the excuses aside I found the characters funny and quirky. I think John Turturro exactly accentuated the accent, and I see it amazing when he sees it, he speaks in real life. Tim Blake Nelson was also good. Of course, George Clooney - as I assume is not best at celebrating accents, judging by his decision to chuck the idea of ​​working with a dialogue coach and developing a New England accent for "The Perfect Storm" - obviously seems a little disgusted and constantly struggling with the accent. However, his performance was good. You can also see Coen regulars as Holly Hunter (in a short but sweet role) and John Goodman (also on the screen for a short while, but steal every minute). <br /> <br /> Although I don't do that, usually country music digs, I liked the title song "A constant mourning man". The DVD also contains the music video for that song. <br /> <br /> All in all, I found the movie entertaining and original, but it doesn't have it in your own face, as Coens has shown us before. It is a minor effort, but a good one. I still suggest you check it out. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
