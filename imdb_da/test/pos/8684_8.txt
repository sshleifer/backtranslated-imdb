I have recently seen a test screening of the veil, and I am surprised to say that it was actually pretty good! It's a movie about different groups of kids, your hillbillies, your rich snobs, your typical teenage couple plus two ghastly guys and a posthippy kid. Together, but as separate stories, each group travels to the Gold Coast for Schoolies Week. Australia has never had trouble writing comedy, and Australia is never short or actors who can play subtlety comedy and just the right amount of quirkiness. The cast is full of stellar Aussie actors with tremendous talent and lots of screen presence. Watch out for Craig Horner, a young candidate who is optimistic for a week long party lost in his friends shenanigans. Travis Cotten and Mark Priestly who successfully tackled some difficult physical comedies such as two bummed out bogans and Jessica Gower as a sweet but confused teen anxiety about love. Veronika Sywak makes her movie debut as every teen boy's dream girl, and keeps her own among a number of significantly more experienced artists. Watch for Matthew Newton, smoothly cast as a seedy limo driver. Fantastic Aussie
