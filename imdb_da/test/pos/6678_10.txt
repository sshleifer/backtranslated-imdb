Just seen this and it was amazing. Was in serious doubt about renting the DVD or not. So if you are ... and like to see other than brainless action movies ... don't hesitate anymore. Don't let that dull cover cover you. The script is one of the best ever. Intelligent, fun, original, touching and keeps you at the edge of the seat throughout the movie. I had already seen another movie just before this one and was really sleepy and I usually bored watching another movie for one night, but this really made me wake up and had no dull moments. It also made me rethink many things in life and gave me a really good feeling. Also the actor is fantastic (one of Kevin Spacey's best roles). The pictures are beautiful and the use of music is very well chosen. If I have to come up with something negative to say about it .... Well .... I really can't find anything ...... Enjoy! 10 out of 10
