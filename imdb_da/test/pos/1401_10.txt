Certainly, most people will designate the "Fisherman's Island" as silly and trashy hokum, but can you honestly mention another movie that brings out these many exciting themes? This Italian gem stands for pure entertainment and includes things like voodoo, volcanic eruptions, mutant fish creators, the mysterious continent of Atlantis, treasure hunting, a remote island full of death traps and utterly crazy scientists! All this and much more in a simple movie? Yes please! Close-minded opponents of Italian horror cinema can easily take this movie as an inexpensive version of "The Island of Dr. Moreau", but the truth is that this is so much more! "Fishmen's Island" delivers excitement and adventure from start to finish with surprisingly compelling special effects and amazingly stylish camera work. The story opens promising with a small group of prisoners, survivors of a shipwreck, washing inland a tropical island. They encounter the sadistic Edmond Rackham who rules over a native tribe ?? and a legion of genetically created amphibious monsters living in the island's swamps. There are so many phrases and more subplots in history that it is almost impossible to write a summary, but believe me, this gem is worth checking out. Sergio Martino once again shows that he is a brilliant film maker who has the talent to be commercially minded and creative at the same time. He makes great use of the beautiful island location and also the interior set looks very impressive. The amazing underwater shooting and imaginative scenes really lift this movie high above the normal standards of 70's exploitation. I don't quite understand why Roger Corman reworked the original so much and launched it on the US market under another title ("Screamers") because there are very few elements open to improvement. The cast members are all Sergio Martino regulars (with the exception of the great Joseph Cotton is a nice supportive rule) and provide amazing results. If you can get your hands on the newly restored German version, you will be treated to fifteen imperfect minutes of extra action. See it!
