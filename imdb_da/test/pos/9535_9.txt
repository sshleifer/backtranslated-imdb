This brings back so many childhood memories. (I'm not old, I'm 19) It's brilliant. The trains, the old house, the fallen runner, the really scary landslide (this is when you are 6), the drama if the kids can stop the train or will it crash? This is undoubtedly a children's movie, but it gives great harmless no blood / gut / weapons etc. For children. And it has Bernard Cribbins in it, who is cool. 8.10
