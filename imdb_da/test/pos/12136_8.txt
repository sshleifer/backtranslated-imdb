<br /> <br /> Very good 1970s movie about mob operations in New Jersey. When a "maverick" gangster does not play according to the rules of the neighborhood, sooner or later it is time for elimination. Joe Pesci was true to his character - smooth and fun. He only gets better with age. His face and today's fame should not have been used on the DVD cover to sell this "B" quality film, as he was only the third star. Dated 1970's printed wide flap shirts and less quality music make for distraction. Nice to see the 1970s big cars. <br /> <br /> But the play is good. <br /> <br /> Nakedness from Anne John's side was not necessary to make this mob story work. And she does not discover in the database, since all appear again in any movie other than this one. Too bad; she did a good job! <br /> <br /> Moral of the story: Don't get your "Don" upset. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something else when you wake up in the middle of the night, check out this DVD. It was part of a three-film-on-DVD DVD $ 5.88 special at the local discount store. <br /> <br />
