I bought my first Zep album in 1974 (17 o'clock) and have been hanging ever since. This DVD has now been proud of my music collection. It's not often that a band boasts 4 virtuosos in their lineup, but here we can. Each member made their own contribution to the band, but on the stage together, the electricity they generated was greater than the 4 people. This masterpiece covers the band's entire career from Led Zep 1 to Coda, and this is captured wonderfully on this DVD, as each concert shows how the band grew larger and larger over the years. Recently my copy disappeared, but I'm glad to say was found in my 17yo son's room when the new generation discovers how great these guys were. This is a must have for anyone who appreciates rock music. Led Zeppelin lived long.
