Spike Feresten is a comic genius. 'Talk show' demonstrates a fresh take on the kind of odd ball irreverence that has made shows like Letterman and The Daily Show successful. His likeness is palpable. He seems to find the unique angle of the joke, not the predictable sitcom path ... thank God. His comedy is reminiscent of the award-winning Arrested Development (crossing his fingers that 'Talk Show' has a longer life span). The topics he highlights tend to be the things that go unnoticed by everyone else, but when he creates a joke around them, you wonder how you missed it the first time. I especially enjoyed the sketches ... "Unfair Target" will be a cult classic in no time. Set your Tivos people ... this is a show not to be missed.
