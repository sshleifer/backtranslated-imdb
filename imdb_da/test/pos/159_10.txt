If you love Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect. His film is brutal, poetic, tragic and artistic, with the splash of very grim humor. Third is clearly Park's style and I loved every second of it, from cinematography (every shot is beautiful and creative) to the story that blends the Shakespeare tragedy, murderous love, gothic horror and layered character drama. The characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to walk around. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy. The direction is maintained and the notion is nuanced - like SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, there are too many subtleties to take on the first impression. Chan-wook Park is an intelligent, bold and consistently surprising filmmaker. It is unpredictable - scenes go from brutal and heartbreaking to laugh - incredibly hilarious in an instant. This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE and SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE to be over-the-top and comical. But like LADY VENGEANCE, it is incredibly rich, thoughtful and rewarding. <br /> <br /> If you like beautifully told vampire stories (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) or are a fan of Chan-wook Park, you see Third must be obvious. Easily one of the best movies in 2009.
