This is the third Three Stooges card that the team has ever made, and like many of their early ones, it is completely and completely hysterical! Now it owns on DVD as part of the Three Stooges Collection Vol. 1, when I feel like it, I see this! <br /> <br /> In this short film, Moe, Larry and Curly play these three doctors in a hospital trying to help everyone, but boy, they end up making a mess out of everything! <br /> <br /> This short is another of my all-time favorite Three Stooges shorts, I am also a very big fan of slapstick comedy, and Three Stooges are slapstick kings! <br /> <br /> When I heard it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Film, I was really curious about it when I heard it was lost, I was very disappointed with it! <br /> <br /> The short one is one of the three Stooges funniest by far, I highly recommend watching this hysterical riot! <br /> <br /> 10/10
