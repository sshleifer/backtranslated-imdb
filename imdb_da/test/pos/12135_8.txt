So you think you've seen all the Mafia movies ever made! Here is one that no one has ever heard of. It's a low-budget, quickie B movie - shot in the swamps in Jersey. For us mob movie fans, it had a bit of everything - sex, violence, curse and clever guys that act as "gafones". While the violence dominated the movie, I found myself living on some well-known scenes I have since seen on The Sopranos and Goodfellas. Look for a 1977 version of "Badabing Girls" at the start of the movie. <br /> <br /> All our favorite star stereotypes were presented here. And in terms of realism, "fugettaboutit"! Joe Pesci was fantastic and portrayed the classic clever character we saw him doing so many times over the years. This was probably his first shot and it was a gem. Pesci fans have to go to the video store to check this flick. You have to look carefully for it as it goes by different names. My copy is called "The Family Enforcer". Here it is known as "The Death Collector". But whatever name it goes under, it must be called - a winner.
