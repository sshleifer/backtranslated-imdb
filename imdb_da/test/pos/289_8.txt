I have to admit that I had low expectations for this movie. But I was surprised to find it entertaining, interesting and fun. It's an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror movie. There were moments that made my hair stand up! Even better were the very entertaining, occasionally hysterical, comic moments in the movie (you know who I'm talking about). There are also a few good special effects (and humor and special effects are not necessarily separate). The action as a whole is very good - far better than a typical low budget horror. The main role (Jackie) and many of the less-supporting roles (like the lawyer, the couple living next door, the pizza man) are well-acted. If they hadn't been, the movie would not have kept my interest and I would have lost my faith in the story. This is a good, interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth the rent!
