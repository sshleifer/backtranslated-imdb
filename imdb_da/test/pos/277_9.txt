So true and surreal, all in one. I remember feeling like Tessa. Heck, I remember being Tessa. This was a beautiful vignette of a relationship that ended. I especially liked protesting key. It's nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over it. If you get the chance to see this, take it. It's worth 30 minutes.
