So I switched on the TV today at. 13:00 on a Sunday, expecting to see crap and infomercials, and this amazing movie had just begun, did not know what it was, but pulled me in almost immediately. The movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> There were a couple of things that didn't make sense to one, I don't understand why the dead guy talked about doing things to get out of your bad situation, but then Jimmy doesn't do anything but the basic thing to survive that someone would do in their situation, in other words, it was not his initiative that got him out of his bad situation, it was just luck, else I do not get the girl's case to kill gangsters in the end, because the whole thing was partially cut off by the thief who steals Panda's money, and the other thief kills Panda at the end so that they steal their money twice and kill him how is it good
