This is a magnificent and in many ways impressive film. I saw it on television as a little boy, with my neck almost torn with tears, and again today on the wonderful restored Criterion DVD. Cranes are the very essence of War Weepie. Imagine umbrellas of Cherbourg without music and no color or Waterloo Bridge without class consciousness. Tatiana Samoilova, a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork, deeply affects a beautiful girl whose fianc√© listens and does not write or return. <br /> <br /> The fiance, Boris, dies on the front, and his death scene is indescribably romantic. Very bold too, because so close to "over the top". But that scene will stay with you. <br /> <br /> Although the Soviets were defined by World War II, the film is rather unspecific and powerful for it. The pre-war and post-war scenes have a very 1957 feeling. There is no attempt at period details. The whole movie is becoming more and more stylized until the Siberian scenes feel like a modern opera set (it's a compliment). The cathartic final scene is milked to its last drop - again, comparable to Cherbourg. The production feels like a big budget (the staircases must have cost a beautiful copy). <br /> <br /> Go to it. Don't expect a bitter socialist pill (though, of course, it's very sad). The cranes fly is an impressive piece of world cinema, quite advanced considering where and when it was made.
