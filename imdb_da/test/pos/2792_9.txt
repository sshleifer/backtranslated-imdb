My wife and I watched this amazing movie tonight because we want to see Russian dolls tomorrow and the first one is important to watch before the other. We both loved the Spaniah Apartment and will enjoy following some of the characters through the early years of their lives - now in St. Pertersburg, Russia. We both identified a little with the rough framework of the story because we were students, Florence Italy for us, so the script was not entirely foreign to our early life. Our lives were significantly different, but as with this movie, whenever you throw together young people who go through the same life-hoops as anyone developed the world's population, they experience very much the same life situations. <br /> <br /> The collection of people and the personal difficulties they faced were universals, and the beauty of this movie and probably its order, which I will see tomorrow. As I wrote, the characters as well as these situations are known to all of us and therefore we can enjoy the life of their lives for a while. This must be one of the film's great strengths - so the viewer can experience the emotional upheavals of the people involved and yet remain deposited. The viewer can celebrate himself and think, "I would not have done anything stupid" or "I would have avoided that trap". Maybe that's why we go to movies.
