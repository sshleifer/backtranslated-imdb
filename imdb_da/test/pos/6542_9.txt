This is a top car flick (It's a work of art / YER a work of art!) All classic cars, no plastic fantastic, I've seen it over and over I have worn two video tapes and worn much more. Many more car lovers, young or old, will love this movie and watch it more than once! so rent it or buy it (just see it) I wish they would make several (car) movies like this V8 force not gassed a little whipper snippers !!!! <br /> <br /> (shes a 351 right?) (motor magic) (pile carriage) <br /> <br /> (you have to learn to feel the power)
