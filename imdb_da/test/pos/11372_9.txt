I think it has been over 40 years since I saw this series, but recall it has not faded a little. This would be natural for DVD re-publishing, it seems to me. Many of the performing artists have gone to greater fame (Robert Hardy, Sean Connery, to name a few); Although it was a small role, I still remember Judy Dench, then in his 20s, as Katherine of France (Henry V). She was very nice as now. <br /> <br /> There is a hint on this site that the series was filmed in color - is that so? Which of us would know - almost no color television these days. Mores sin, no video recorder; In that case, some may have registered it. As a way to teach English history, this series has made it alive, in that few class teachers can cope. <br /> <br /> What a good reissue this would be!
