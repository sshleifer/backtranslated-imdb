What a crazy movie! It lasts 12 (!) Hours, and you do not understand who these people are and what they do! The main drawing is about a bunch of clueless actors trying to bring on stage "Prometheus", but there are lots of sub-plots that Thomas disappears and a crazy guy looking for Monsieur Warok .... what's the point of all this? ??
