I read the book before I watched the movie and it left me emotionally drained, but I felt it really transported me to Afghanistan, a culture I know very little about. I had great hopes for this movie and it didn't disappoint. I saw this with someone who didn't read the book and he also enjoyed it. They had to shorten some things in the movie, but it was a well-behaved and well-shot movie. It lets you think about the movie long after it's over. You feel about the characters and their interests. I highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience Afghan culture. There are some disturbing scenes that are not suitable for children to see. It is a heavy drama that portrays the horrors of life during a restrictive regime.
