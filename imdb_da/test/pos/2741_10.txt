If there is a cartoon that helped put the UPA on the card more than anyone else, it's Gerald McBoing-Boing.

Happy to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seus history for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed how amazing! Hope to see the following shorts made in the series, if not on YouTube, then maybe in a DVD collection. Now I think I'll see another UPA card there ...
