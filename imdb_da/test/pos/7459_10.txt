I saw the first movie by chance when I visited my uncle in Arizona about 3 and 1/2 years ago. The VHS print was a slightly faded look, but I was very haunted by what I had seen. Was it quite sensible? Well, honestly, no it didn't. But it is a movie that requires more than one view to understand all its aspects. The beautifully tragic score haunted me, and the bizarre pictures made a quiet impression. <br /> <br /> Now that I found out that Anchor Bay had released this oddity on DVD, I immediately picked it up. I was very pleased with the transfer even though I felt the extras were missing. Although the film relates to "O" and Sir Stephen characters, it really has nothing to do with Pauline Reage's original novel or 1974 film The Story of O. However, the film draws attention to artistic details and symbolism of an almost mystical kind. "O" decides to prostitute himself for Sir Stephen in the violent 1920s Hong Kong. Her mission is to prove her infinite devotion and love to her master by giving her body to other men. Of course, Sir Stephen enjoys watching her during her unpleasant sexual escapades and even finds herself a mistress. However, the tables are reversed when "O" actually finds some kind of love with a young male admirer. Suddenly, Sir Stephen feels the threat ... I feel that the deep meaning behind the movie (including the tragic score and artistic direction) really makes this movie a classic. The viewer is introduced not only to the lives and the past of "O" fellow citizens, but the troubles of the 1920s Hong Kong are also explored. Like the political situation, prostitutes all need to belong. No one loves the movie, even though they think they are. (But "O" finds a sense of happiness with his young admirer). A prostitute tears remember how her father used to act as a dog when she was drunk, which of course led to a fetish to have her customers like a dog. Another elderly prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress. She can't let that view go. She treats her clients as co-stars and even swears she hears a piano in the river. <br /> <br /> With regard to "O", she has a feedback that her father is leaving her in a chalk circle. When he leaves, she feels a sense of abandonment. Of course, Kinski suddenly becomes his father in the same flashback. I was very, very disturbed by this picture. I really felt like "O" at this point in the movie. She almost never smiles and this scene really explains why. Her fear of surrender is so great that she sees Sir Stephen as her father and addresses her every obscene demand in the hope of proving his love. <br /> <br /> Another curious aspect of the movie is the young child (the end of the age) selling fortune in a box. It is a very random character, but somehow it just adds to the feeling of loss and emptiness in the movie. At one point, the director even uses painted cardboard characters to represent people. Now, if it's not symbolic for you! (Laughter) <br /> <br /> All in all, I really love this movie. I feel it is a very deep and slightly moving experience. It has erotic scenes, but the scenes aren't really meant to awaken. Like the characters, the sex acts are empty. They are movements, but lack feeling and tenderness. (Once again, the only bud scene is between "O" and the young man). "O" thinks she is in love, and lowering herself is an honor, but ultimately she finds that she has choices. She can also be her own person and pursue her own happiness, but she also has the opportunity to remain in the circle drawn by her father. The director leaves many unanswered questions, but some things do not need answers. The viewer will make the judgment that works for them. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I would like a special edition of this DVD to be released that had director comments. I think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion about the film and its message years later. It's a shame that the soundtrack was never released. This movie has a really scary and heartbreaking score. There is something about the lingering vocal that sends a chill up on its back. I can really feel the feeling of loneliness in the movie just by listening to the music.
