"It's easy to kill a monster, but it's hard to kill a human." <br /> <br /> Set in St. The Thomas Housing Project and Angola Prison in New Orleans, "Dead Man Walking" is the true story of Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), a Louisiana sister who was friends with Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), a killer and a rape bound to a deadly injection machine to kill a teenage couple? Sister Helen is in favor of helping the prison and staying with him until the end? An action never before tried by a woman ?? <br /> <br /> At their first meeting, Poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both children and asked his help for a new trial to convince congratulations on the hearing of the table to save his life ?? <br /> <br /> The movie challenges the audience to actually think about the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives voice to anger, deprived of parents whose children were shot, broken, raped and left in the forest to die alone? <br /> <br /> As Poncelet's execution looms closer and closer, his character is deceptively complicated and has doubts about the accuracy of what they did to him? For a moment, we hear him sensitively and ask for a lie detector test to let his mother know he is innocent, in another we see him furious to live the victim, blame the government, drugs, blacks, kids to be there? Poncelet never understood that he has robbed Percys and Delacroixs so much, and gives them nothing but grief? They will never see their children again, will never keep them, love them, laugh with them ?? <br /> <br /> In the scenes leading up to his execution, the death father's enemies kill his horrible facade and reveal his identity ?? Fortunately, both Sarandon and Penn here are exceptional to successfully implement an exquisite, tangible harmony of souls ?? When Sarandon looked at Penn, did she project compassionate eyes with tears? She asks him to visualize her when he dies? '' I want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of love ''? In that moment, did we really believe that she would be the face of love for him?
