When his older mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her lodge Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and becomes a cannibalist monster, television news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) fights to keep dear old mother from satisfying her hunger. Although the above overview summarizes images of trashy, over-the-top, 80's horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mother actually shows herself to be a refreshing original, take werewolf / vampire / zombie mythos (exactly what Emily is never clearly, but it's no wonder!) and a touching study of the close bond between mother and son: Clay's devotion to his mother leads him to abandon all his other responsibilities, including his job and his relationship with the pregnant girlfriend Alice ( Mary Beth McDonough) while Emily's love for Clay ultimately drives her to self-destruction. Technically, the film could be sharper, with more stylish direction and better effects (the shots of the being kept very short, not to disappoint), and some more experienced members of the cast frustrated with horrible cheesy performances (Yes, Brion James and Stella Stevens, I refers to you); Fortunately, however, the strong emotional undercurrent of well-constructed history is enough to ensure that Mother is an effective, compelling, and occasionally shocking story that I do not hesitate to recommend to those looking for something a little different.
