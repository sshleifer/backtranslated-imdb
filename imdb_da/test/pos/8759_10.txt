I can only agree with many observers that Traffik is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television. I saw Traffic when it was on TV, and I just watched it again. I am especially moved by Tim Souster's haunting original music, and especially by the dolorous tribes of Dmitri Shostakovit's C minor chamber symphony (the music over the credits and in parts of the film). The music intensifies the characters' desperation as they pursue their sad destiny. The music is highly emotional. This event combines two of the movements from the symphony, but I recommend listening to the symphony as such.
