For me, "Anatomy" is definitely one of the better movies I've seen. I do not think "anatomy" was primarily intended to be a horror movie, but a film that questioned the ethics of science. If you see it in mind, it will be a really good movie. The only annoying bit was the horrible voice dubbing for the English version. How can you expect a non-German person to listen to these unbearable German accents for two hours? Let native English speakers speak or use subtitles instead !!
