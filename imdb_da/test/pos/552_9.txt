Being a freshman in college, this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mother. Of course, my situation does not match Natalie Portman's and Surandon's situation; But my mother and I have grown up with the typical mother and daughter fights. There is always mom telling you what to do or not being the kind of mother you want to be. I called my eyes at the end of this movie. Surandon's response from her daughter, going to the east coast, miles away, after all they've been through, reminded me of how I felt from being a small town on the west coast going to New York. <br /> <br /> The movie is intended for women who have children who are now all adults. It's very touching, I was moved by the movie. Any sense of the characters in this movie was real, you didn't get any false sentimentality. I sat through the credits for the screening of this movie, alone, where my mother sat next to me so I could hug her and thank her for everything. This film is a bit corny of course, but everything is trully important. It's about what a mother can learn from her child; and what a child learns from her mother. 8.10
