A film about the relationship between a man and a leopard, reminiscent of "The English Patient," even down to a scene that looks like when Ralph Fiennes character carries his body of love across a desert cliff. In "A Passion in the Desert" the protagonist carries the leopard's body over a desert rock cliff, but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically extended from a very short Balzac story, the movie is not perfect but a treat not less. Final shot will haunt me in weeks. (8 out of 10)
