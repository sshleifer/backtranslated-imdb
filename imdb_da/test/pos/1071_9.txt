First, I loved the documentary. It represents a new school history / theory where a topic can reflect a wide range of social and historical issues. <br /> <br /> I want to get the camera and the dogs out of the way first. I hate the Blair Witch quality of the camera, but I also understand the benefits of such a relaxed approach. In fact, I agree with the other reviewer that it gives us unprecedented access. Dogs: Warning, I have a PhD degree in literature that I do NOT use as a profession, so some of my training can trickle in: The dogs are a beautiful metaphor for the complex relationship between man's great efforts and our need to Find the work to reach them. The dogs may reflect their owners as a reviewer suggested. But they also serve as a stand-in for the workers we see in the movie. Although this may be hinting at the Marxist problem raised by a reviewer, I also think it shows how difficult it is to globalize work problems. No Mondovi is in Italy nor can it translate elsewhere. (Yikes! I am a Marxist at heart and hate to hear my cynical departure hold sway!) It is a remarkable bait and switch. The dogs are family, the workers are family. But in the end, the dogs are the workers (the last scene with the poor farmer). While you may disagree with politics, the artistry of analogy, combined with the more open-ended policy of the film, is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Only Faulkner (I'm from Alabama) had the power of the movies beyond the Hollywood market, which interesting stories would have been told.
