This may be the wine that speaks, but it could be the best movie I've seen for a very long time. Granted I spent much of the first half hour an hour and wondered what the hell was going on, but when I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles, I could enjoy the movie. Can you really hate a movie where a staff becomes a bunch of birds that defect the enemy? What does character development mean when faced with a lesbian foreign princess if people build the pyramids? Why Does Buddha Wear Seriously Blinging Diamond Earrings? Do some of this when faced with the sharp opulence of the visual and humorous humor of the image. Every fight for my heart was won when I saw the protagonist dressed as a spider-man - amazing! Many people will complain about a lack of historical cohesion, but for a fun movie laughing with a bunch of buddy you can't do better, especially if you are making an alcoholic shot every time someone says "I'll love you 10,000 years".
