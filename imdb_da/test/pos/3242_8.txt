I'm a fan of independent movies. Dialog-driven, character study pieces are where it is for me. Some of the other posts are right: "Wannabes" will not compete "The Godfather" for best mobiles ever. On the other hand, "Wannabes" is a well-written and well-run image that has surprisingly good performances from all actors / actors. My problem with one of the other reviews: Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irish in a cast of Italians <br /> <br /> - Dubin is a Jewish surname and as such has a dark color, not a traditional ruddy one of an ireland. He doesn't stand out at all, but delivers a good performance. <br /> <br /> This doesn't win many awards, but it deserves a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn. I found it for 7 bucks at Blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised to say the least! Highly recommended.
