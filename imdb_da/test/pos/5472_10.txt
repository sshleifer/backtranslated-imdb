For those of you who have previously commented on this movie and hoping to see it again, I hope you did. It was broadcast today (November 28, 04) on the Lifetime movie network. I subscribe to satellite dish. Karen Arthur instructed William Petersen and Barbara Hershey in this southwestern Gothic-like narrative, academically. The lighting, editing and dialogue contributed greatly to the movie, and Hershey and Peterson were perfectly cast into the roles that played both sensitive, bold and intuitive characters. The play was excellent as well as the offensive casting. <br /> <br /> Not having known before, I guess right story was based on truth, and now that I know I have to make the stay as Santa Fe is a hop, jump and a jump from Tucson. <br /> <br /> As an engineer, I was fascinated by the theme of the unique staircase and man design and construction (who was he? an angel?). But the story, and there are more plots about how it came to be, is what most fascinates you. You certainly get a strong feeling that God in His heaven was in every detail in the drama of history. For those of you who have seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about. For those of you who don't, I won't spoil a moment of it ... <br /> <br /> Bon holiday, Bob Shank Jr., Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ
