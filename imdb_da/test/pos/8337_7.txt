... Our grandfather's hour. More than the gangsters, it is a detailed account of an American family around the 1930s: the father, proud of his job, caring for his son who has given up in high school, the mother who everyone wants, the daughter who forgets the dinner in his clamp, and the twins who are absolutely lovable ("Don't sleep first!"). there is the grandfather, Yankee Doodle plays on his flute. Have you noticed that this song plays the same role as Doris Days "Que Sera Sera" in Hitchcock's "The Man Who Went Too Much" (1956)? And there is this grandfather who is finally the most courageous person in the family. So old, he does not even tell his age, but proud of his country and opposes the hateful extortion of the gangster. <br /> <br /> A good movie by Wellman.
