Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) engage in a battle of wits to control a Switz inventor's latest bombing creation. Holmes wants to protect it from the British while Moriarty does not hand over to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, many fans will be disappointed to see Holmes updated to the 1940s war-time setting. This movie shows a bright heart that does not jump into the war-time propaganda that it may have done. Dennis Hoeys Inspector Lestrade and Nigel Bruces Dr. Watson tends to steal the show as their characters bumbling methods consistently provide lovely comic relief. The sparrow between Holmes and Moriraty is colorful and well thought out to start. Atwill does it well enough as Moriarty, though he is not as memorable as some others who played the role. <br /> <br /> Though this does not add anything new or exciting to fans of the series, it is a wonderful escape from reality, somewhat appropriate for 1942 in my opinion, reflecting many movie series adventures in the 1930s and 1940s , but boasts a more compact, less repetitive plot. And all this is done, while still being true to Sherlock Holme's basic spirit.
