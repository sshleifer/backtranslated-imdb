One evening I listened to the radio and they had Leslie Nielsen on the program. He continued to explain why there were only 6 shows. '<br /> <br /> With TV shows like MASH you could go to the fridge to get a beer, and as long as you heard what was going on, you didn't miss anything. But with the Police Squad, you had to watch the show, with the sight gags you missed a lot if you didn't see them. Who could forget "... the part of the city known as" Little Italy "..." with the coliseum in the background. Even the movies were strong on the synagogues, but then again in the theater you were a caught audience. <br /> <br /> Leslie also said one reason why the show, movies, and other movies like Airplane were fun because they didn't try to tell what was fun. It was up to the viewer to get the jokes. It's just my 2 cents.
