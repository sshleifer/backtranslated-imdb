It can't be a 10 out of 10, but for me the jokes did not. I've seen it many times when I was younger and again on DVD, I think and I laughed each time. The mood is simple and fun, this movie was just one of many little flicks that Disney throws out at that time. I found the parts where the people out of the invisible loop saw people invisible. These expressions were invaluable Great movies, if the opportunity to see this arise, I recommend seeing it for a good oh fashion laugh. My favorite character in all the Dexter series must definitely be Dean Higgins, I love his voice and hear him being disturbed, especially because his expression at the end was just plain hysterical for me.
