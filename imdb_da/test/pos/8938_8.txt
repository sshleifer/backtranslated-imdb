See it here the second night on cable on request and thought, "This is the type of movie that could have starred Alec Guiness and Glynis Johns if it had been made in the late 50s". A farce in the English tradition. Alfred Molina and Brenda Blethyn are very sweet and sincere in their depictions. Naomi Watts simply sizzles into a ditzy Jayne Mansfield-ish (if she could have acted) way. The rest of the casting has some nice turns and bits. The Welsh landscape is lovely. An absurd premise, and certainly not credible, but it does not prevent enjoyment. Not a big movie, remember you, but a really fun watch. And Walken is at its best. A pleasure to see!
