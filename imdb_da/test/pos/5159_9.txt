This movie shouldn't be fun, but it made me laugh. <br /> <br /> It's not designed to be sad, but my heart felt heavy through a number of vignettes. <br /> It's not written as an action adventure, but my heart rate ran more than once. <br /> <br /> Like life, this movie doesn't manipulate your emotions and tells you how to feel. It is simply and you respond. <br /> <br /> If you don't find it fun or sad or move, I suppose there's more to you than the movie. It is amazing and refreshing to see a director so wholeheartedly celebrate that we are all human and embrace that we are all trapped here, doing this "life" thing, over and over as long as we are going. <br /> <br /> Tomorrow is another day.
