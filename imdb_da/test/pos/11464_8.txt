Night of the Demons is a great movie and an excellent example of how good the low budget can be. Sure, much of it is quite predictable, but somehow it is still much more comfortable than the bushel we see these days being rejected as "Horror". I give a solid 9, and Demon's one-liners are actually fun. I'm still scared of "Stop looking at me!" The soundtrack is well done, I was surprised to hear "Stigmata Martyr" from Bauhaus! There are also some very fine T&A on the screen, as well as some good-looking make-up effects. The second movie in the series is also pretty good, but avoid the subordinate third. The judges night can be dated, dark and low clean, but it still has a lot of potential. It is definitely worth renting at least. Give it a try tonight, just stay away from any old makeup! (you understand when you see it!)
