WOW, a masterpiece of a movie that must not be missed. <br /> <br /> I didn't know what this movie was when I started watching it late at night. I didn't find out it was a rock movie until after the movie when I went to IMDb. As I saw it, I was fascinated. The cast, especially Eric Bogosian is just amazing. One of the best scripts and camera work ever ... The movie penetrated me and kept me front until the end ... I didn't dare flash for fear of missing anything ... Great how a small budget movie can be so exciting and good Made while huge budget movies containing tons of action and computer-generated special effects can be so incredibly boring. Don't miss this movie ...
