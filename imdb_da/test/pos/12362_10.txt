This milestone film can now be seen in two different versions on Grapevine Video release, which also contains the English translation of Selma Lagerlof's novel, which she has based on a Swedish folk tale. The first version is the Swedish editing under the title of THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE. The second version is a reconstruction of the way it was shown in the United States under the title of MIDNIGHT STROKE as published by Metro (before it was M-G-M). The actual American release has long disappeared, but a detailed review of The New York Times lets us know how the scenes were reorganized into home publishing - and both are fascinating to see. Each version of this movie was presented at The Organ Loft in Salt Lake City with live theater body scores provided by the artist Blaine Gale. A live recording was made of these performances and is included on the Grapevine Video DVD along with the novel and notes on the two versions. While PHANTOM CARRIAGE follows the order of Lagerlof's novel, MIDSKLÃ†TET is in some ways easier to follow. Seeing the two different edits is a training in how quiet movies could be effectively changed for publishing in different countries. <br /> <br /> Some viewers watch this movie as a horror movie that it certainly isn't. This is a moral game with nuances of the supernatural used to turn home its strong message. The director and management of the great Victor Sjostrom was far ahead of their time. It's easy to see why M-G-M brought him to Hollywood to lead movies like Lillian Gish in THE SCARLET LETTER and THE WIND, as well as Lon Chaney in HE who's left off. In America, he was known as Victor Seastrom. He also wanted to star in the role of Ingmar Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES, which gives a masterful performance. Bergman was heavily influenced by KORKARLEN or PHANTOM CARRIAGE in his earlier days. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful movie worth taking some time to discover and study. Grapevine Video Release is an excellent way to do this.
