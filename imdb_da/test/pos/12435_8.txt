This movie is just plain, lovely. It's fun as hell and just as old as the hills. The action is amazing and it is fascinating to see the post-war era in Britain and how we used to behave these days. This seems to have been a great deal to St. The Trinians films (given Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford connection - there is also a very young George Cole in there who appeared in many St. Trinians films), but I don't understand myself the connection. It was shown on BBC4 recently after a biography of St. Trinians creator Ronald Searle, but I lacked enough of the biography to miss the connection with this movie. Anyway a great movie in itself and something that should be preserved at all times!
