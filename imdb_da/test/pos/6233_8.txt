After a group of young friends experience car problems while traveling off the beaten track, they accept an offer of help from a lonely local Mr. The Slause (Chuck Connors), owner of a nearby museum full of historic wax fashion. Once in the creepy road neighborhood, the friends are attracted to a masking lump that can bring the museum's dummies to life through the power of the mind. Tourist Trap's bad guy is a demented cross between The Texas Chain Saw Massacre's Leatherface and Anthony, the scary child from the classic Twilight Zone episode "It's a Good Life," while the plot is a mix of elements from the aforementioned TCM, Hitchcock's Psycho and House of Wax. The atmosphere and performance of the Tourist Trap, however, is so completely off-kilter that in that respect it is almost impossible to compare with other previous films. Director David Schmoeller is continuously inventive and unpredictable treatment of his own script gives the film a clear nightmare quality and with a brilliant left-hand performance from Connors, an impossible scary score from Pino Donaggio, a collection of truly disturbing mannequins with removable jaws and the presence of Super sexy Tanya Roberts, who spends the film in (and short of) little jeans pants and a figure hugging boob drill, Tourist Trap is a completely unforgettable and ultimately one-of-a-kind horror experience that deserves his cult feeling.
