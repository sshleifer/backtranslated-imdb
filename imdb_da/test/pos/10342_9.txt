Flipping through the channels I was fortunate enough to stumble upon the beginning of this movie. I must admit that it caught my attention almost immediately. I love older movies and it is or should be considered a classic! One of the most wonderful rarities in this movie is that the protagonist was not only a woman, but she was also a poor girl. I highly recommend this movie!
