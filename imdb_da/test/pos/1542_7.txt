Rachel and Chuck Yoman (Valerie Harper, Gerald McRaney) decided that the city was too busy and dangerous for their family so they packed their reluctant son (Gregory Togel) and daughter (Tammy Lauren) and moved back to a lake like one Rachel lived as a child. <br /> <br /> They say you can't go home again, but this is an ideal country house with what initially seems like a Mayberry feel. Later, the dwelling seems to be more like the people in liberation. Soon, organs begin to turn up and everyone sees suspects except for a few friendly faces. This does not prevent the family from driving around and crushing the forest. <br /> <br /> We find that they need to be super-ignorant about finding the secrets and not telling anyone before they are taken up as antagonists. <br /> <br /> Can ignored young Stevie save her parents or will their persecutor put their foot in it? <br /> <br /> This movie is more than most parodies as it was played with healthy faces. They couldn't have chosen better actors, and Daryl Anderson was exceptionally scary. An added plus is that they let us know what happens before the characters find out, instead of pulling a clue out of the hat after the fact. Anyway this made for television movies is good for a few laughs.
