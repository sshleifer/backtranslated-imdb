I'm sorry about series of young and clueless people talking about their "problems" all the time, self-centered, boring and totally annoying (Popular; Dawson's Creek; Beverly Hills; etc.). "Hack" is a fresh breath, with a fantastic actor (David Morse), a completely different plot, trustworthy people with real problems (thank goodness !!) and very, very good stories. I just love it !! I hope that "Hack" will continue for a long time because it is a great television series for adult people, for a change.
