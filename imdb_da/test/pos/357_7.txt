I would disagree with the previous lame comment. I saw this not expecting too much of it. The fact is, the molding was fantastic, especially the leading teenage woman. The dark sides of them all came through, all were destroyed in a not obvious way. There was an underlying stream running through the film of teenage anxiety and sexuality. The serial killer role was played well too, as you could feel that he had gone through what they had as children. What this movie is is a strong drama / thriller. Yes, I agree that they do not make it obvious, but you could relate to the shaken teenage heads they did what they did and it is credible. Also a decent dark end, instead of which could have been easy to choose a happy one. The attention to detail in the movie was fantastic too. I'm very good solid 7 out of 10. Slightly slow at times, but lets a thinking person see where the characters come from.
