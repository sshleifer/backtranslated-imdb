Some movies are designed to just entertain you, others to make you laugh or cry or cancel, others like this aim to provoke, make you think, and make you angry. I was angry with this movie, not in the movie, but on the fact that it was true, America empties, the free, the illogical view that makes it the greater good. Torture scenes in this movie were harrowing, the people's indifference was crushing, the film was convincing in its argument, and just showed how wrong it is to torture people. Of course, it now makes me a "bleeding liberal" brand pushed on people by others who are watching the facts that this is happening and should not. People who are not aware that, as in the movie, every person tortured, you get ten or hundreds of people up for revenge. You get an ever increasing violence cycle. This movie didn't make me hate America, though I can see how it could, but it made me hate the way America reacted in its 9/11 post. There is a big quote in the movie, just after we learned that 19 people have died and 75 have been injured in the bombing area, the quote is "an American is dead" - it makes the difference. You can't kill an American, America can kill thousands, but you can't kill a single American or they'll do anything, including torture to exercise justice. This is the American way apparently. Call me a liberal, call me naive (though I think the people who believe that torture is fine are naive) call me confused, call me what you want, but this movie is an excellent example of what is wrong in America and in the West today. I want this movie to be shown to all school students as a minimum. This movie will stay with me for a long time, part of me want me to forget it because I want this kind of thing never happened, but I know it, and the other part of me wants me to never would forget because we must remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again. Whatever happens to me, this movie will be with me for a long time, and I will tell everyone I know to see it, so as not to be entertained, but to be provoked, sometimes we must all be provoked.
