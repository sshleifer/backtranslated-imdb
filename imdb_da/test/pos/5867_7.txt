When I was very young, my mother had a series of four Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies shorts on tape, and I saw them all several times. A Coy Decoy was one of those shorts, and I was really shocked to read in another comment that it had been banned. When I was young, I probably didn't understand the Black Beauty gag at first. Still, that's probably why it was banned, but until I saw this on a video page, I didn't even remember the gag. After watching the video I remembered some shots - especially the shrinkage of Daffy's hat and Daffy's eyes became wise as the cover circled him in the lake. I was not bothered by the gag that was most likely the reason why gag was banned. Instead, I was flooded with childhood memories of seeing this card. Because of how much I liked the short as a child, I rate it 7 out of 10.
