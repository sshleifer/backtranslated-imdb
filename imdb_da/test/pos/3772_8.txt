So it's not an award winning, so what? Have you ever wanted to watch a movie that was just stupid? "The Villain" and this one could translate the list. My husband says "Jekyll and Hyde Together Again" is one of those films that if "you have been there and done it", you will believe in this spoof of 80 Their cocaine culture is a rebellion. I think the whole movie is just fun. Nothing is sacred; Hospitals, Plastic Surgery, Howard Hughes .... There are ongoing gags that you need to look to appreciate. To say that the film does not follow the book would be true, but then many really good films take freedoms with the published word too. I recommend this movie to all the old "stoners" among us. We can be smarter now, but we will still recognize and laugh at many people we knew (ourselves?) Back in the old days.
