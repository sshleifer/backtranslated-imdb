I had the privilege of being one of the Still photographers on the phrase "Grand Champion" and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days I was working on the movie. I have been in Photography business for 25 years and have been working on 16 movies and I cannot think of a time when I enjoyed giving my craft more. The kids were wonderful to work with and little Emma Roberts has so much energy she is a real trip. She even grabbed one of my camera during the stockshow scene rehearsal and started shooting. Some of her pictures were used for PR. I could have made more money to work for a larger budget production, but I doubt I would have had fun and been around so many amazing actors and the great people of West Texas as I was.
