Wow. First, I thought who wrote these things! How hard is the choice between a man who gives you and your children wealth, respect and security as opposed to a man who only gives you repression, abuse, degradation and poverty. But our choices are not always so clearly cut as you would think. The wealthy gentleman was actually a woman who could strive for and yet ... her husband's trait was her sexual desire for him almost overwhelming. What to do, what to do ?? As a viewer, you became as confused and misdirected as she was. Yet what I really came up with on this site to push over was my admiration for England's voice, I thought, even though it is actually the voice of an Irish singer in the movie. Looking up, I find he's Glen Hansard, whom I had never heard of before that day. What a find. I am so grateful. Wow, what a voice! What a day! Thanks BIFF!
