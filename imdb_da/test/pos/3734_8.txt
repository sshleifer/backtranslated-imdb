Hey see, you don't see this movie to change your life! But if you are a woman special and have always had little things for Richard Gere; This movie is right up your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have a long way to go chemistry. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not an Oscar winning film and it will probably be forgotten rather than later, but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED great people (they don't make your stomach trip and even when Gere is 'on top', he doesn't look too jowly) then this is the movie for you. I loved the theme of the story and it was very relevant in many ways. Of course, the whole thing was presented superficially, glossy and not really treated ..... I think I would like to know more about the father / son relationship between Gere and James Franco, but the story was really about the idea that a great love can change for the better; whether it is a lover, a child, a friend, etc. The theme of the film is about love and its mysterious ways. I was surprised that James Franco took such a small role in this movie, but he is always good even for a few minutes on the screen. I really liked this movie because it was moving and sweet.
