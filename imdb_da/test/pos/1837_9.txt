I love this movie. First, I don't expect much from this movie, since I didn't hear anyone talking about it, and it looked like it was video shortly after it just opened in the theaters. I also didn't think David and Minnie would make a good couple on the screen. (I expected a lot from the couple on the screen when I saw "You've Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.) Personally, I think Joely Richardson should have played Minnie's part and vice versa. I don't know, I just think Joely should have stayed longer in the movie with David. They seemed perfect to each other. But it just shows that in a movie, the girl next door always gets the guy. :) (As in "While you were sleeping".) However, I was very wrong. This movie was amazing !!! Everything was done brilliantly. Bonnie Hunt did a good job of managing. The lines were perfect with the clever cracks everywhere. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING: SPOILERS AWAY !!! *** <br /> <br /> I love how everything interweaves. For example, Elizabeth and Bob initially talked about going to Italy, and eventually Bob Grace meets in Italy. Sydney (the monkey) makes the hand with Grace as he had done with Elizabeth also an example. <br /> <br /> *** NOTE: SPOILERS END NOW !!! *** <br /> <br /> One thing I didn't like about the movie was that it was a little unrealistic. Well, I just don't think a man could come across his wife for a year when she was the only woman he'd ever been with all his life. You would think he would isolate himself from the world for years before even coming out of his house to talk to someone. Instead, he goes on a blind date a year later and falls * immediately * in love with a woman he has never seen in his life but feels connected with. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a great movie. It shot me crying two or three times and it made me laugh countless times (the scene in the restaurant with Bob's discerning date for bottled water was fun!). It is clearly up there with great romantic comedies like "You've got mail", "sliding doors" and "while you slept". HOW TO CLEAN IT TODAY!
