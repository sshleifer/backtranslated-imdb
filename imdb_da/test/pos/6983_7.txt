In the future, a different group of people sleeping on board a commercial spaceship is forced to improvise their survival when the spaceship collides on a distant, confronting planet. They already have a problem in that one of the passengers is intense criminal Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel, in his first topbilled role); However, they are quickly pursued by a strange kind of predator thriving in the dark - and a rare eclipse of the sun must soon take place. While the script for this movie is ultimately on the routine side, it is decently acted and it is especially suitable technically. Location work, photography and design (production as well as creativity design) are all very impressive. It's not the most original or stimulating science-fiction / horror image ever made far from it, but it still provides good entertainment. Diesel is particularly good at getting under the skin of his scary character. However, it is not entirely predictable and gets some points for <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> to have a more politically correct ending than most of its type. <br /> <br /> Filming in the deserted Coober Pedy area of ​​Queensland, Australia. <br /> <br /> A sequel of sorts is in the works. <br /> <br /> 7/10
