If Monte Hellman's legendary early 70's road movie star work "Two-Lane Blacktop" had been made more like a strong, tight, hard-hitched and straightforwardly thrilling piece of humor, adorned by the distinctly medieval, coarse, very crude and eerie macho Australian mentality and topped with a generous sprinkling of dour, despair, non-hope-at-all-of-the-road punk nihilism, it would undoubtedly be very similar to this giant gloomy and atmospheric knockout. The beautiful lighthouse maker Mike (an appealing scruffy Terry Serio) runs off grinning, shades that carry fascist car champion Fox (an all-powerful Richard Moir) when he steals Fox's fetch model girlfriend Julie (the lovely Deborah Conway) away from him. Mike and Fox are starting to compete in increasingly lethal races, with the stakes getting higher and higher with each successive battle and finally culminating in a special pulse-cushioning or no race with only one true winner allowed. Mike, assisted by his worried but loyal Italian mechanic chamber Tony (an excellent smooth ride of Vangelis Mourikis) and taught by the blind, super-high 50's style of government (wonderfully positioned with maximum cold by Max Cullen), puts his life on the line for his Reputable guilt, his old lady's devotion, money, and most importantly for the chance to overthrow the haughty Fox from his trembling, glowing cast. Directed with the utmost gravity and intensity of John Clark, written for the laconic perfect perfection of Barry Tomblim, with an appalling, crossbreeding synthesizer score by Peter Crosbie and the idle, unnoticed filmography of David Gribble, this authentic gnarly presents the early 80s object the concept of racing cars is Not only a funky alternative lifestyle but also a consuming occupation and reason to live (that's the only thing most movie characters are very passionate about) with a remarkably sparse and flashing eye. Complete with a harrowing downbeat ending and effortlessly ugly central note of the bitter price one pays to be top dog, this accurate depiction of a dead-dead existence rates as an extraordinary cinematic achievement.
