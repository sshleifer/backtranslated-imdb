Stooges is back and more fun than ever. "Bridal Groom" in my opinion was probably the best Shemp flick. <br /> <br /> Shemp has the ability to inherit $ 500,000 (which was probably more than a million dollars over today) from his dead uncle. BUT! There is a catch. He must marry someone that day at 6am. Shemp is a bachelor with not too many admirers, except for a loudly aggressive annoying song student of his. But he doesn't want her, he wants someone a little more on Victoria's Secret model type women. But of course he has no choice as he is not Collin Ferrel himself. But when it is printed in the papers that he must inherit all the money if he is married, his ex girlfriends are on "I want my husband back" attack! <br /> <br /> What a great stooge flick! This is up there with the winners of all stooge flicks! <br /> <br /> 9/10
