Following on from his comeback, John Travolta played a mildly twisted angel in "Michael". He may be God's messenger, but he is not the best guy that journalists Andie MacDowell and William Hurt discover. When I first watched this movie, it was before I started watching "All in the Family", so I don't recognize Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker. Now, when I recognize her like that, I try to imagine Archie snatching her to house an angel (which he probably would rank with blacks, Jews, etc.). <br /> <br /> I know it's not really related to the movie. But I just like to connect things that way. Anyway, it's a pretty interesting movie. Also contributing to Bob Hoskins, Teri Garr and Richard Schiff. <br /> <br /> What John and Paul said ...
