A quick glance at the premise of this movie seems to indicate another stupid 80's inbred / backwood slash party; The type where sex is equal to death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. But "JBD" delivers significantly more. <br /> <br /> Instead of focusing on just meat and gore (though there is a bit of neither sex), the girl focuses on delivering impending dread / mounting tension between a lovely scenic background. These feelings are further enhanced by a draft of realistically familiar signs and antagonists that are more amorous than carton definitions of evil. Oh yes, George Kennedy is also here and when isn't it good? <br /> <br /> If you liked "Wrong Turn", look at this to see how much of its methodology came from.
