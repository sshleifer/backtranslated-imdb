Night hunter is a sold B style action movie. Get a life and grow people up. Don "the Dragon" Wilson is a kick boxer, (celebrity) and not an actor. If you're looking for an Oscar, it's not here brother. Looking for kick ass action movies with lower so low budgets, that's it. The plot line may have been a bit thin, but which B movie is not. I understand that everyone is a critic and how a man's junk is another man's treasure. Few real people, judge each movie as if it is an Oscar contender, just stupid. Awesome fighting scenes, mixed with a new twist on vampire movements. See it if your a fan, rent something else if your hating.
