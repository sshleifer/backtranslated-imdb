It's the best movie on acting I've ever seen. All artists are ancient Turkish theater actors, they are magnificent in this movie. It is sometimes said that "They do not work, they live it", you can really see this in this movie. The director is also competent, you can't see many moving cameras around, but the cameras' positions are also good. But after the play, the most excellent part is the film's content. It gives happiness, enthusiasm, desire to live, the importance of real friends to people. We all started to live individually today, in this movie we see that there is someone other than us. And most importantly, you see that the most honorable feeling in the world is love, love your friends, love your treasure. All people should watch this movie ...
