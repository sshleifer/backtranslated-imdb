Universal Studios version of "Flipper" (1996) is a great heart-warming movie for the whole family with good values ​​and sentimentality. It's the story of Sandy Ricks, a teenager from Chicago who reluctantly spends his vacation with his uncle Porter Ricks in the Bahamas. This ultimately changes the lives of teenagers and he grows up in the process. He learns to appreciate nature and respect the environment. I grew up in the 1960s and NBC TV show "Flipper" was my favorite childhood show. Elijah Wood is perfectly cast as a 1990's Sandy Ricks and gives an outstanding performance. As much as I liked the NBC TV show and MGM theatrical feature film with Luke Halpin as Sandy in the 1960s, I liked this feature the best! I feel Elijah Wood is the best Sandy Ricks. As for Luke Halpin, I feel that Elijah Wood has more of a number of acting talent and feelings more like an actor, making his performance excellent and more credible. I think Elijah Wood is the best young actor working today in movies. Director Alan Shapiro also wrote the manuscript and has done an excellent job as both author and director of this film. Paul Hogan gives a comical and sympathetic performance as Sandy's Oncle Porter Ricks. Mr. Hogan's performance completely compensates Elia's role as Sandy. I'm a big fan of underwater movies. This movie was beautifully shot in the Bahamas as "Thunderball" (1965 UA) was. The director of photography was Bill Butler A.S.C. who lent the film "Jaws" in 1975. Butler is a very talented film photographer. The underwater director of photography was Pete Romano. He did a fantastic job with underwater filmography. I enjoyed the movie performance by Joel McNeely. This good movie show showed Crosby, Stills and Nash among other talented artists. This movie shot was shot in Panavision as "Thunderball" in the aspect ratio of 2.35: 1 If possible, try to watch this movie in a range originally framed and shown by Alan Shapiro and Bill Butler. Another very nice thing is that Mr. Shapiro gave the "original" Sandy Ricks (Luke Halpin) a small role in this remake. He portrayed Bounty Fisherman # 3 in this movie. This was a very kind gesture at Mr. Shapiro's part! As you can tell, I'm a real true fan of this movie. Unfortunately, this beautiful movie was met with harsh words by the majority of film critics. I originally watched this movie on my birthday on May 31, 1996 in a movie theater. That meant a lot to me. I have it on many video versions. The VHS versions are in "pan and scan". The Laserdisc version is "letterboxed" 2.35: 1! I even have a 2.35: 1 VCD from Hong Kong, which is "letterboxed". But my most valued possession is an "original" 16mm theatrical feature print that I will treasure for the rest of my life! Thanks Mr. Shapiro, Elijah Wood, Paul Hogan and everyone involved to make this a memorable movie so I can enjoy! <br /> <br /> P.S. I must add that the quality of Universal DVD is fantastic! It's the best DVD in terms of quality I've ever seen. The color and resolution are spectacular. The soundtrack is fantastic. I think Universal should have used the same transfer to the DVD as they did for the laserdisc version. The 35mm print is "mint" and Alan's movie really has a wonderful look at it. A great tribute to a wonderful movie! The DVD's resolution is even better than laser disk quality! It's just spectacular! Thanks Universal Home Video for the great quality control and transfer. Many thanks for doing a fantastic job on this wonderful family movie. Also many thank you Alan for all your utmost kindness to me !!! It is a real honor to know you !!!
