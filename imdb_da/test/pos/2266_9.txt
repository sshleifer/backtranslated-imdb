I really liked this movie ... but the ads I saw implied and a published review actually said that this movie "enjoys a light touch." That for me is very misleading. There is a lot of humor: eccentric, u-subtle, sometimes somewhat twisted humor: the kind of humor I generally find very appealing. But most of the humor is the kind that appears consciously at all times of things that are deeply serious, deeply sensitive, even deeply painful. The film interweaves themes from past and present, perception and truth, memory and activity, life and death. The whole film is suffused by the story of European anti-Semitism in general, and especially in the Holocaust. How can humor and horror be combined in the same movie? The review I saw suggested that humor is absurd. I don't think that's the case at all; at least not in common sense. Instead, I think this film is in the tradition of much Jewish / Yiddish literature and theater. I do not claim to be any expert in this field; but from what I have seen, humor is used in this cultural context both as a tool for the terrible tragic experiences of this people; and also humor is used as a means of "regaining the divine" for men and women who choose a path of faith rather than a path of either despair or absurdism. See "Fiddler on the Roof" for humor that is used in both ways in this rich tradition. Elijah Wood (Jonathon) Wood wears horned rhymes that really make him look good, comparing Sin City when he had the same kind of glasses with chilling effect. In this movie, it is easy to see how the glasses become a metaphor for both his search and for his struggle between perception and truth. Eugene Hutz (Young Alex) and Boris Lesking (Old Alex) are both just wonderful. Jonathon and Young Alex are from the same generation, but seem so much, very different; And then you find that they are not so different. And the way the apparent narrative voice changes gradually from Jonathon to that of Young Alex. As a journey with planned discovery for Jonathon becomes one of the discoveries of both Young Alex and Old Alex ... I am so much moving. <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful scenes and panoramas from (I told) Prague and the surrounding area that are in favor of Ukraine of history. Everyone feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful feel of the place; although I have never been myself to Ukraine and can hardly witness this from first hand experience. All in all, if you're looking for easy comedy, I wouldn't recommend this movie at all. On the other hand, if you are interested in a wonderful, lovely and in-depth movie, please check out this wonderful movie.
