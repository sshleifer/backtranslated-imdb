slowly moving but smart. pass you as if you lived it. filled with thoughtful art race ideas and being cool. The one thing hit me hard was the ideas of rock n 'roll lifestyle. <br /> <br /> All the performances were improvised, I'll say it again. ALL PERFORMANCES WERE IMPROVED, sounds like a gimmick, but it does not mean that these characters are right and like someone you wanted to hang out with. This is also a great thing when you think about how strong the character is in this movie. right from the beginning in the title sequence, it instantly establishes Ben as an ejected path as he moves though the crowd <br /> <br /> Okay it breaks down like this if your person who lives jazz / rocker lifestyle of cool you will like it if your wise and understands great cinema from total crap you will love it and if your both then it may be you fav <br /> <br /> but if your none of these you will probably believe the boring And say it doesn't follow "a line" and write a crap review like Ben_Cheshire
