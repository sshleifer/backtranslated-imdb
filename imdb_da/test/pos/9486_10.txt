What can I say about this band, I was hooked in 68, I was a 10-year-old child, I grew up on Blues even though my father, then these guys from Midlands came together, a merger of Country rock, Heavy Rock and Blues, I wanted wish I could see them live in the early years, I was lucky enough to be there in 79 (Knebworth), it was the best concert I have seen to date, I hope a full version of the hot August night will be the one the best soon. This CD gave me a chance to see the boys over and over again, the song remains the same is amazing, but this CD comes down to the nitty gritty. <br /> <br /> Long live Zepp.
