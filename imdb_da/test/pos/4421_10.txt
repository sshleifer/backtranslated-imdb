OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now I give her up! How innovative. I love that she has a cooking section- I admit that occasionally I skip that part just because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. I love that she has regular helpers and that she has made some of her viewers become her fast. I love how personal she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her Mystery Guests. She just seems so much more genuine than so many other talk show hosts. She still gets a little star-fast occasionally, and I love it. I love her talking about her personal life there and reminding people of how happy she is. She even mentioned tabloids before, and it's so much fun! She also has the most fun stories! Anyway, I'm a fan of life. Even my 2 year old knows who Rachael Ray is and he also loves her!
