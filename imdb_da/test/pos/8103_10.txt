"The Great Dictator" is probably one of Charlie Chaplin's most famous films. It is notorious for it is the blatant satire of Adolf Hitler and Nazism. Until I saw it, I only knew it was fame. Now I know how much the movie deserves. The film basically shows the exploitation of the somewhat clumsy, ambitious, short-fused and impressive dictator of Tomania, Adenoid Hynkel; and with him, his closest and dear staff: Field-Marshall Herring and Mr. Garbitsch. It also involves the exploitation of an amusing, emotional and often clumsy Jewish barber, a World War I veteran. <br /> <br /> Stopped with the plot, I would like to say that this film has different qualities that make it both unique and wonderful. While the comedy is certainly both verbal and slapstick and random, the whole movie shows how serious it is about Nazism or aggressive nationalism as a theme with different interludes. Chaplin's impeccable acting skills far and wide in the film, he revving it up until he just explodes. Paulette Goddard's attitude as an ambitious Jewish would be rebellion, and Henry Danji's delivery of a nasal, quiet-as-death-serious-as-a-heart attack line makes it a wonderful show. <br /> <br /> Further, one aspect of the movie is what makes it so special: it does not pull. It's not "hidden", it has no business to be hidden. It is an "overt", overtly, in your face, obvious lampooning of both Hitler and Nazism. <br /> <br /> To sum up, see it. Just see what you want to see.
