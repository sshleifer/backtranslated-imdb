I saw the first card when I bought a random DVD of short movies some time ago. this is the only card on dvd i liked, but i just don't like what i love it ... if you spend some time with me, you will see it. it's beautiful, simple and passionate, no bells, no whistles - it could have been done with a sharpie (but don't make me wrong, the animation is elegant and insightful - this person spent time with cats - but it's simply black and white ) and then there is writing and the music ... it's simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> I eat chocolate, drink wine, and watch it over and over ... <br /> <br /> Nothing else matters to Pedro Serrazina to come up with something else.
