I have commented once on this Chucky store, but I had to do it again to say some things about the movie as I first saw it in a large balcony in a large theater. The movie was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky movie ever in a theater, and it was a special moment for me because I appreciate Chucky. The other horror villains are referred to with great coolness !!! And gore was shockingly good! The scene where the gay child is nailed by the truck was incredibly cheerful! It was a big gore scene !!!!! And the end was so bizarre and shocking it made me s *% @ my pants. The idea of ​​having the Chucky seed was very, very bizarre and shocking! When I left the theater, I just loved it, and I couldn't believe it was right. The bizarre and different qualities of this Child's Play installment for some reason made me mark it as Jason Goes To Hell in the Child's Play series. It had the intensely shocking, bizarre and other quality that reminded me of Jason Goes To Hell. A safe ***** out of *****. How to classify the series: 1,4,2,3. I loved it, but not quite as much as Tom Holland's original Child's Play classic. I can't wait for Seed of Chucky! Came with it!
