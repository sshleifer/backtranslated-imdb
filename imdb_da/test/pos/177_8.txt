In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed their face with animation with the release of the very first part of their "Silly Symphonies" series, "The Skeleton Dance". Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating since the early 20s in Disney's "Laugh-O-Gram" comic book series; But their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer from a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. It was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued to develop his style and technique (and where he created Flip the Frog's character). While his work was of the same high quality, it was not really popular, and in 1936 the studio was closed. Later that year, Iwerks was employed by Columbia Pictures, and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance, this time in color. The 1937 "Skeleton Frolics" is essentially a remake of the 1929 classic "The Skeleton Dance", the film that offers him fame and fortune. Like the short film, it is set on an abandoned cemetery, where in the middle of the night the creatures come alive and begin to play. The dead rise from their coffins, ready for the show to begin when a group of skeletons have formed an orchestra and begin to play a happy melody. Now it's not easy to be a musician made of bare bones, as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts, but they manage to tie a good show and another group of skeletons begins to dance. A lovely couple of them face the same problems that disturbed the orchestra: it is difficult to dance with loose body parts. Everything ends at dawn, and just as the sun is rising again, the skeletons run towards their graves. Straightened and animated by Ub Iwerks himself follows the "Skeleton Frolics" faithfully the pattern set by "The Skeleton Dance" years before, but with a crucial difference: Iwerks made the whole movie in Technicolor. The bright tonalities made it possible for Iwerks to create a more visually pleasing film and also to use the many new techniques he had practiced since leaving Disney, which created even better effects of depth and dynamics than those he had previously thought of. It's definitely a more experimental movie than "The Skeleton Dance", though unfortunately it doesn't mean it's necessarily a better movie. Initially, the movie is virtually identical to what he did with Disney, with the only differences being the music (more about that later) and the color effects. It seems to be beautiful, no doubt about it, but it certainly feels something unoriginal. <br /> <br /> It is not, however, the unoriginal concept of what really hurts the movie (in fact, the Iwerks do it a wonderful way), but the fact that the musical tune created by Joe DeNat for the movie, is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one made by Carl W. Stalling for "The Skeleton Dance". In other words, while DeNat's voice is effective and appropriate to the theme, it is easy to forget it quickly, while Stalling's song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. Being a musical film is of great importance, and thus the mediocre of the music brings down Iwerk's flawless animation work. Personally, I think "Skeleton Frolics" with a better musical accompaniment will be remembered as boring as "Skeleton Dance despite not being groundbreaking, as it is still a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> is kind of sad that most of the work that Iwerks did after leaving Disney is now forgotten because of his poor success, but if Iwerks lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer (Disney's biggest rival), he did not lack the quality of these companies' films. It was probably just a case of bad luck, what did the man who gave life to Disney's mouse for the first time to face being out of Disney. Skeleton Frolics "a very fun and visually breathtaking movie that, while not the most original and fresh movie (you just can't think of" The Skeleton Dance "while watching it), reminds us that Iwerks skeletons still is here to haunt us and inspire o s. <br /> <br /> 8/10
