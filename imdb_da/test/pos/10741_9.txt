This excellent movie has the best play you will ever see and that alone makes this a must-see. The whole cast is excellent, but it was again necessary to follow Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. It didn't take me long to be rooted in this movie, and apart from a courtroom scene that's just good, this is top notch entertainment. This is a rare movie that actually deserved all the Oscar recognition it received. See it for yourself and you will certainly not be disappointed.
