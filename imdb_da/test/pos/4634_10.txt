If you are a "child of the eighties" like me, you probably remember this Disney Disney movie in 1981 - one of Disney's first PG rated movies and Michael J. Fox's screen debut. I remember watching this movie over and over on HBO when I was in middle school, and I recently found only a very old copy of it when Disney stopped producing the movie several years ago. Needless to say, this is a really fun movie to watch. Five college teams decipher tracks in an evening drive around Los Angeles, trying to reach the finish line first. Look for the coma from Paul Reubens. From the cheesy music to the disco scene with the cool twins, this is a rare 1980s movie that you will love.
