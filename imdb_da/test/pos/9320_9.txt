One of the better musical bios. Dennis Morgan is great as a singer / composer Chauncey Olcutt. The molding is very good, especially Andrea King as the glamorous Lillian Russell. The atmosphere of the turn of the century is the perfect setting. Technicolor is excellent. A simple plot, but the movie just makes you good. Morgan was always undervalued as an actor and singer.
