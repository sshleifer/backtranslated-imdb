Wow! I picked this out of the shelf because I loved Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller in 'Trainspotting'. This is a phenomenal film; it has action, romance, excitement, intrigue and humor. When I didn't laugh, I was at the edge of my seat. This is definitely a movie I would recommend to people with an understanding of intelligent dialogue and a new perspective of the 18th century. This movie has everything to keep me happy!
