This is from much of the same creative team behind "Better Off Dead", but is not as good as the fantastic teenage comedy. It's very fun, but it's everywhere and just not that fun. Curtis Armstrong is used to less effect (he was incredibly fun in "Better off Dead", Bobcat Goldthwaite is fun, Cusack is good, Demi Moore is Demi Moore (only with better hair here.) All in all, it's fun and like a person from Cape Cod, it captures the feel of an 80's Cape Cod summer very effectively. For some reason, this movie feels more "mainstream" than "Better off Dead." There is not as much left field absurdity going on If you are a fan of John Cusack and Savage Steve Holland, it is definitely recommended.
