Do-It-Yourself indie horror author Todd Sheets returns with another entertaining horrible nickel-dime shot-on-video clunker that is basically just a weak excuse to sway around very aqueous blood and shiny gut so often as possible. A vicious demonic scarecrow revives the dead as ravens of roots fronts so they can attach to the living. A bunch of bickering college kids, a trio of dangerous escaped prisons led by the evil Slade (Byron Nichodemus hamming it up to a scandalous degree), two equally wild sleazeball hoodlums and a trio of hottie sisters all have to do their best to Survive this harrowing ordeal. It is for the unnecessarily confused and enveloped plot, but fortunately, what this hilariously horrible hoot lacks in narrative context (masses) it more than compensates with a joyful abundance of glorious rough graphics. Scary highlights include a woman who has her fingers cut off, a lethal shot on a young gall's groin, attempted necrophilic rape, procurement and, of course, more repulsive capture that eats than you can shake a pile of moist gut on. In addition, we also have coarse, grainy filmography that constantly changes between leached colors and ugly black and white, inappropriate staged combat scenes, rough acting from a uniformly pathetically unnamed name (Jerry Angell specifically polishes the top crummy thespic dishonestly for his ridiculously scary histrionics as slimy no-count psycho-criminal Joe Bob), a lattice-head-banging thrash metal soundtrack and a generic shivery'n'ominous synthesizer score. Let's not forget the ridiculous ending where several of our survivors stumble across a few vials of meat-eating bacteria for use on the shopping undead hordes. Of course, this flick is a sheer boy, but it has some very disgusting quality to the one who again makes it a great deal of such a terrible thing - it's great Grade Z fun for hardcore aficionados of bad fear price.
