There is hell to pay when you cross Nami Matsushima (Meiko Kaji), Woman Scorpion and a dangerous group of thugs (.. including their sadistic head pimp and his just resilient lady), driving a prostitution ring with an iron fist, just do it . Hell has no rage like Scorpion, and a certain detective, Gondo (Mikio Narita), seeks revenge for beheading his arm after the handcuff will do whatever it takes (... and that includes scaring anyone who might know her whereabouts ) to catch Nami. Nami finds an ally in hooker Yuki (Yayoi Watanabe) who gives her a temporary shelter. Yuki has a delayed brother who has suffered brain damage during a job and needs to look after him (in a disturbing revelation, about incest, she also gives her sexual needs!) .. she really keeps him locked up in a room while working on the streets! Meanwhile, Nami is targeted by a wild neighbor when she finds her own place (she works as a sewer) and he threatens to turn her into the authorities. Nami was a fugitive sentenced to flee a police subway if she did not give him sexual favors. His wife dumps a tea kettle of boiling water all over his face and body, resulting in death, and the prostitution clan is looking for Nami to pay the debt to lose a very important member of their organization. That's when Katsu (Reisen Lee), the pimp's girlfriend and confidant, realizes that the person responsible for the loss of their loyal member is a past effort for her, Scorpion. Subduing her with an injected liquid drug, placing her in a bird cage (!), Katsu decorates in her prison. What is eventually burned by Nami's anger sees a prostitute out of his cell, a victim of a forced abortion at the end of life, soft to death. Finding a scalpel that clapped in her hand (.. from the operating room), Nami will break free from the cage and swap every member of the clan responsible for hooker's death. The series of scalpel killings gives Gondo the opportunity to catch Nami, and he will trap her in the underground sewers underneath the city, but can he catch or kill her? Especially if Yuki comes to her? <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say that there was no shackle binding instructor Shunya Ito or his film-making team because FEMALE PRISONES SCORPION: BEAST STABLE is yet another perverted, horrified and ultra-violent entry into the very entertaining series. Equipped with fine production values ​​and a visual stylistic talent to capture all the crazy in imaginative ways, Ito draws you right (... or he made me) into the twisted drama that always exists when Nami Matsushima is on display. When you have a long-lasting opening circle sequence where your anti-heroine escapes through the crowded city streets with a man's cut arm handcuffs to her, the viewer should know what they are in! The incestuous sub-plot is simply bizarre (and it is shot in a soft-core way with the delayed brother humping his numb, cold, dead-eyed sister staring forward!), And the whole abortion sequence is pretty hard to sit through. But the abortion angle, as disturbing as that, gives motivation for Nami's revenge. Although Nami is imperfect ways and her criminal nature, you'd rather see her take those cretins out than the other way around. Interesting angle with Detective Gondo. Gondo is willing to break the rules and he becomes a force-of-nature to anyone standing in the way of catching his mortal enemy. His fate at the end, visiting another enemy of Nami's, in an isolated cell as she watches, perfectly encapsulates what makes these movies so ridiculous yet so entertaining. The scalpel murders are a mounting of dormant scumbags, in various places, the knives protruding from meat, with Nami leaving crime scenes very driven to wipe the whole clan in memory of a fallen victim of unfortunate circumstances. While the movie is essentially a cartoon adventure, there is a sadness that permeates and few characters get away without errors. I imagine that many will walk away from this scoffing on how unrealistic FEMALE PRISON SCORPION: BEAST STABLE is (... specifically how Nami is able to escape catch time and time again, performing her vengeance goals, repaying them all who has wronged her), but I watched it as a violent action cartoon, like the later 80's movies, and enjoyed it for what it was. As always, this movie has some beautiful Asian actresses and some colorful weights. Meiko Kaji, almost always reserved / quiet, yet cold staring down on her enemies with intentional intent, is in good shape (... in more ways than one) and Reisen Lee, as her crossed, opposing opponent runs away with the picture as a perfectly realized voluntary abusive enemy who appreciates psychological plague (.. when both are in prison, Nami's ways of torturing her are sweet). My favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot, but is so wonderfully wrong, and has a dog that discovers Gondo's rotten cut arm, goes through a street and finds a resting place to chew it!
