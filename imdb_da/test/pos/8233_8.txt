This one is a very solid Randolph Scott Western. He plays Bat Masterson and goes to Liberal, Kansas to clean up the city. He becomes good friends with Robert Ryan, who played a very straightforward lead. Only after that did Robert Ryan start playing much darker roles. In fact, in 1947, Randolph Scott made another film that was not a western and never made anything but western side until he retired in 1962. This film has good pacing and is building on the climax. I can't say more because it would give away the plot. Be sure to see this. 8.10
