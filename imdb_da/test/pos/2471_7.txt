The strong points of the film were clear for the beginning and the middle of the film. It showed how a very violent, reactive authority can respond to resistance. Filmed in the fashion of a documentary, the director records what would have happened if the United States introduced a law of war. Volunteering for the "penalty park", a police training site where you are bullied and harassed, will give you one out of this gloomy scenario. It shifts between court attempts for those facing accusations, those in the park, escaping police attention, training officials preparing to handle those prisoners, the referees in their spare time among many other things. It was a very strong, in-depth film. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I had with this was its realism. Officers are often seen holding their pistols as if they were seven years old with plastic toys (ie a 90 degree bent elbow when pointing to a gun in someone's face or the way a cop does, it looks like it's hard to kick someone when they're down, etc., etc.). It starts out as an honest and interesting attempt to capture a very critical state of affairs. At the end of the film, the viewer remembers slowly and again over the prejudices of the directors and the producers. The antagonistic signs in history begin as genuine, real people and eventually develop into "stereotypical, objectifiable forces of evil" in the end. The mistakes they make are stupid, the force they demonstrate is unreal and, contrary to the way in which genuine police act, the judges during this trial show stupid and unreal errors among many other things. The reality of the movie began to fall apart as it became apparent that this was just another blank-check attempt to make the government look bad. And it comes from an anarchist. The scenes at the end began to get hokey, unreal and a thousand times over dramatically. Nevertheless, for the former part, it promises the very moving story.
