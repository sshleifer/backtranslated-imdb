Like those who listened to radio reports on the attack on Pearl Harbor, anyone who has ever seen PINK FLAMINGOS can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw it - and some thirty years later the movie is still one of the most indescribable, unpleasant, unpleasant, repulsive and hilarious movie ever set for celluloid, guaranteed to test the strongest stomachs and the toughest fun bones. <br /> <br /> Filmed with a close budget and some of the shakiest movie pictures RINK FLAMINGOS tells the story of two families competing for the tabloid title "The Filthiest People Alive." How bad can they be? Lots: The movie contains everything from sex with chicks to what I can only describe as a remarkable display of rectal control for a heaping helper with doggie doo, and I guarantee you won't eat an egg for at least several weeks after seeing it. <br /> <br /> Depending on how you look, the molding is wonderful, horrible or terribly wonderful. The star, of course, is divine ... and to describe divine as the greatest dragon queen on the planet would be the understatement of the year. She is a mammoth creature given to BIG eye makeup, BIG orange hair and BIG expression - she is Charleton Heston's move, and whether she is almost running down a jogger, pausing to use the bathroom on one's front grass or scary real shoppers by taking one walk along a pavement in Baltimore she is both invisible and indescribable fun. Others in the cast are Mary Vivian Pearce, Danny Mills, and the always horrible Edith Massey as members of the Divine Family; and Mink Chairs and David Lochary as the white slavery, baby-selling couple challenging Divine's status. It should be quite obvious that PINK FLAMINGOS is not exactly a movie that will appeal to everybody, and viewers who know director John Waters only through such later films as HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY will be a big shot. But if you want to see something so completely different that even Monty Python couldn't imagine it, it's the movie for you. Just make sure you eat before you see it, because you probably won't eat afterwards - and you might want to keep a barf bag handy if that's the case. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
