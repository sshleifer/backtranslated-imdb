This is one of several annual waterside yarns in its era, which has the added difference (though not unique) of a female buccaneer in the center. First, both leaders - Jean Peters and Louis Jourdan - may seem to be overlooked, but they grow nicely in their roles in the end, thanks to the talented players (Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice) who support them. Velvety Marshall is uncharacteristically cast as the ship's mandatory philosophical lush by a doctor, and Gomez is suitably larger than life as Blackbeard The Pirate. The cast is completed by Debra Paget as Jourdan's wife, who incurs the jealous rage of the tomboy titular character in which Jourdan recovers the first pangs of love (which, however, does not save him occasional rejection or sword wound); In return, the film was the second exotic collection of Jourdan and Paget in a year after Delmer Daves' BIRD OF PARADISE. The direct result of this unexpected softening of Anne's character is that she falls out with Blackbeard's crew and her unlikely climates to save the lives of the stranded Jourdan, Paget and Marshall. <br /> <br /> While the film is not a particularly outstanding example of its type, Jacques Tourneur's energetic direction and Franz Waxman's grandiose score ensure an above average effort moving along at a fast pace; In return, Tourneur had already served the genre with the superior Burt Lancaster vehicle, THE FLAME AND THE PIL (1950). As usual with vintage Technicolor productions, the cinematography gives the film an abundance that is refreshing. By the way, different running times are given for this movie (81 or 87 minutes), and for the record was the version I saw the shorter, the right one.
