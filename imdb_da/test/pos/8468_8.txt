This is a pretty interesting experiment to see. It is the first ever existing attempt to unite vision with sound. It has two men dancing to a violet piano (possibly William KL Dickson himself) standing next to an Edison shooting cylinder that captures the sound. <br /> <br /> The sound and images were not linked together as yet. And it was only recently that the sound and the picture have been added technically together. That's probably why people hesitate to call this movie the first ever sound. <br /> <br /> The film is made by William K.L. Dickson, an assistant to Thomas Edison himself, ordered him to come up with a way to unite images and sound. The answer he gave was Kinetophone, a Kinetoscope (basically a large wooden box with a keglehole in it so people could see the moving images) with a cylinder phonograph inside it for the sound. This is the first thing we know about, surviving movie experiments that include this technique. All the later films with the same technique were shot as silent films and sound effects were recorded later and separately. So Kinephone was not an attempt to sync audio and images, but more an attempt to get pictures accompanied by sound. In some cases, people could even choose from three audio cylinders with 3 different orchestral performances accompanying the pictures. Only 45 Kinetophones were ever made so you could hardly call Kinephone a success. Also after this experiment, focus was on other cinema techniques, especially with regard to film projectors. <br /> <br /> Of course, the experiment itself was not successful, even since it took over 30 years before the first soundtracks were released and commercially released. They just couldn't technically synchronize and put the sound and pictures together at that time, and although they could and techniques would have been available, doing so would have been a very expensive job. It is therefore not the most influential or historically important movie out of movie history, but it is very interesting to see how people constantly tried to improve the quality and techniques of early cinema and filmmaking. <br /> <br /> 8/10
