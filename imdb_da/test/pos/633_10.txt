Man, I never laugh so much this year, and it's pretty hard to make me laugh. While I was expecting some Hostel-style movies, the smile came to my face right from the beginning. This film-in movie shows a female "victim" who breaks the whole set until she finally "dies". Her overactive drives the director's nuts and his fun reaction tells us viewers that Mute Witness is not a typical horror movie. <br /> <br /> The main character, the dumb American makeup artist Billy Hughes, is played by the beautiful but talented Russian actress Marina Zudina. Her performance is top notch; her character cannot speak, so the body language and emotions on her face must compensate. And, oh boy, she did a wonderful job. Her sister (Fay Ripley) is a boyfriend or fianc√© or wife of "in-movie director" (Evan Richards). They were both very fun most of the time. I don't want to spoil any more, but the scenes after the bath's moment, along with the two, the fake police officers and later the evil neighbor, were plain brilliant black comedy. <br /> <br /> The reason gets twisted at the end, possibly misleading at a certain time. But calm. Such a delicious movie can be seen in family or with your boy / girl / friend.
