Almost four years after the war in Iraq began and we are in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all the flags that were so sure of the right and powerful of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't it? You bet it is. This movie said it from the beginning. It's a little freaky, how much the movie, or should I say, the filmmaker, knew what was coming. It's almost like going to a fortune counting and hearing what would happen in the future. There was a point when I felt the hairs standing up on the back of my neck when GW announced that "big fighting is over" on top of a visual about a crashed RV pulled away by the American flag waving in the rearview mirror.You must see it to understand what I mean.But even if you are apolitical or even if you are pro-war, this movie will have some influence on you because it is so embedded in history.
