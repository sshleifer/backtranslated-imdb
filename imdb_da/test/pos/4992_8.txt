Things I like. Steve Zahn, like Gus, nails that part, replicates Robert Duvall's manicures, making him feel good to Gus fans. (Some of the other actors also copy their predecessor style in this series). Karl Urban, looks grumpy and tough, but can crack a joke and smile as well, as T.L.Jones did in original series. The gear, guns, clothes, all accurate or very close to the period precise. I will never forgive Costner and Duvall for having a nylon lariat in their chuckwagon in the Open Range. The Comanans, they actually run bareback, rather than saving a modern saddle under a Navajo rug. And they are not painted as politically correct peace-loving pastoralists, but as a proud warrior. There are some stupid scenes, but it beats the slings out of yet another variation to do something stupid for not winning a million-dollar reality show shows.
