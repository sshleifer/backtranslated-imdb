Race Against Fear must be one of the most moving television movies I've seen for a long time. All performances from the main actors were excellent, especially Ariana Richards (Mickey Carlyle), William Bullimer (Coach Kurt Ansom) and Susan Blakely (Margaret Carlyle). Ariana has especially performed an extremely emotional performance, with facial expressions to match. She portrayed the feelings that Mickey felt perfect, and you could easily believe she had really been raped, so realistic was her performance. RAF is an incredibly realistic movie because of the moving notions of cast. Bullimer came over as a rape incredibly good, and you hated him more and more as the film went on. Blakely also made an emotional performance as the mother of the raped girl (Mickey Carlyle), and you felt increasingly upset by the Carlyle family because no one believed them rape. All in all, the RAF is a great movie. It is both moving and full of excitement, as you are constantly uncertain whether Ansom would be prosecuted for rape due to lack of witnesses, evidence and belief in the claim. I thoroughly recommend watching this movie.
