This bittersweet piece of magic realism had a checkered production history (instructor / writer replaced) and thought of the ticket office, but it is a helluva movie. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are pre-teen brothers whose flaky mother (Lorraine Bracco) throws up with a medieval alcoholic (Adam Baldwin). During his drinking rush, Baldwin physically takes over Mazzello and manipulates him to remain silent about his situation. But when Wood cottons does what happens, the boys put their heads together and smell a great solution to Mazzello's devastating dilemma. <br /> <br /> I love movies that blend imagination and dark reality. They are rarely successful financially ("Lawn Dogs" is a similar example), but they are usually original and exciting. <br /> <br /> The drunk Baldwin is shot from a low child's perspective and his head is deliberately under the top of the frame. This unity allows us to judge him purely by his actions and as a completely physically-made animal. Both Wood and Mazzello are excellent and they draw us effortlessly into their dark, frightening world. <br /> <br /> The "radio flyer" of the title is a small red wagon children carrying their belongings in. Here a dream is transported. <br /> <br /> Very interesting things.
