If you read the book by Carl Hiaasen, the film follows virtually true form, with a few minor changes for Hollywood. In my opinion, this is a great family movie. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) well steals the show from an all-star cast that includes Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffet. The children in the film do a good job led by Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley. <br /> <br /> Brie Larson may be a bit too petit to play Beatrice. I pictured a bigger girl, maybe 6 feet, 175 pounds, in the role of Beatrice. This could have made her more credible in her role of looking up Dana. They should have developed their "hard girl" character more and had their bite through a tire or kick a football through a person. She is very pretty and I understand why she was thrown, she is a box office attraction. <br /> <br /> It's about as PG as a movie getting these days, no sex and very little violence. This film is a parent's dream that is true, a movie with a strong environmental message, with children who have a deep understanding of the beauty of Florida and its wildlife. It shows how adults have been short in our planet's control and that our children can demand better. One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Mullet Fingers says, "Florida could use some mountains like Montana. Florida is so flat that there's nothing to stop developers from clearing it from shore to shore". Also photography of Florida wildlife spoke volumes without dialogue. As a family movie with children aged 5-15, this is a great movie! As a bonus, parents will be entertained, especially if they are "parrotheads".
