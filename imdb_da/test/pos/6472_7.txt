Knute Rockne led to an extraordinary life, and his story is told quite well in Knute Rockne All American. We follow Rockne's fantastic journey from young Norwegian boy to iconic American football legend. Produced in 1940, the film can sometimes seem like a touch dated and sometimes even hokey. And the filmmakers put it a little thick at times, as Rockne glowingly and lovingly depicts. You have to get away and think that Rockne should have been nominated for the weekend when he was actually a football coach. But it is undeniable that he had a great influence on the football game and has a tremendous influence on the lives of so many of the young men he trained. This film shows the great influence he had and gives you an insight into why he is so honored to this day. <br /> <br /> Playing Rockne, Pat O'Brien, gives an impressive performance. It is undoubtedly O'Brien's film to wear, and he makes the movie and character his own. The real life Rockne was known as a great inspirational figure and O'Brien's performance will enable you to understand why. The only drawback comes early in the film when O'Brien in his early eighties plays researcher Rockne in his early twenties. All makeup in the world would not make it credible, and the effect is quite tough. But when the Rockne character begins and begins his legendary coaching career, O'Brien fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, a name jumps out, and of course Ronald Reagan plays the young, charismatic, but ultimately judged football star George Gipp. In the movie's big schedule, it's not really a big deal, with Reagan showing up in no more than 10-15 minutes. But the show has become legendary thanks to Reagan's famed "Win one for the Gipper" death fatality. It's an excellent game full of emotions. Reagan may not have been on the screen for a very long time in this movie, but he has certainly had a very positive impact on winning performance. The rest of the film hits a balance between football and life in general, with Rockne having good lessons for her young men in both areas. For football fans (and history buffs) there is a rare treat as the actual file movie from Notre Dame games from the Rockne era is bursting throughout the movie. It's a rare opportunity to see how much the game has evolved over the last six plus decades, and an opportunity to see Rockne's legendary strategic innovations in practice. If you're a Notre Dame fan, you'll probably enjoy the fact that Notre Dame Victory March gives a seemingly constant soundtrack to the movie. If you're a Notre Dame hater ... Well, you probably won't see the movie. Knut Rockne All American is an inspiring, uplifting, emotional movie. Maybe a little too sentimental, but that's not such a bad thing. It's a very entertaining movie, a worth taking time to watch.
