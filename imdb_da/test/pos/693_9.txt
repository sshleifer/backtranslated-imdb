Any other World War II movie made during World War II by a British manufacturing company has no respect for the day in my opinion. The confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart is in At Dawn We Dive: As a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspects of World War II and especially naval warriors, I favor depictions of subs and action in the Nordic Atlantic and especially those that include the German side of things. For those who are unfamiliar with target priorities, an attack on a hostile warship is the biggest event that a submarine can hope to encounter, and such a rare opportunity will develop surprisingly similar to what we see here. Pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of Ealing, Rank and British-Gaumont studios back in the day: Frankly, I prefer its quieter and more cerebral approach to its humanity and realism, which engages far better than any overproduced Hollywood movie ever could. This reminds me of Powell and Pressburger's 49th Parallel thanks to the highly convincing Eric Portman, a favorite of mine. John Mills receives another billing and a smaller font in the titles, so this is clearly meant to be Mr. Portman's movie, but the whole cast shines. As for the title sequence, am I the only one who is completely charmed by Gainsborough Production's lovely pre-CGI Gainsborough Girl?
