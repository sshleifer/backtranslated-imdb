This movie is just amazing ... It starts really slow and boring, but as the film progresses ..... it's fun that keeps coming. The power of the movie is perhaps in its subtle references to much (and I mean a lot) of other films. For me, the best part was maybe Bruce Lee / Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon scene. How the two actors change from French to Chinese or whatever Asian language it was, it was amazing. So the jokes with the names they are funny, but maybe you don't understand them all when your American (no offense). All in all, a good movie
