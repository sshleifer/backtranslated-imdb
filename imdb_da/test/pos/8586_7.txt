It's always great to see a movie that teaches us about the history of Africa, as they are definitely too few. However, the film shows Lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist. I felt it difficult to sympathize with this kind of management, but the film is a bit like a tribute to the man. There was too little content and explained how the man should rise in the first place and the whole context in Belgium "let them go". So it is definitely worth seeing as acting and photography are excellent, especially Mobutu himself. I just wanted a better political analysis.
