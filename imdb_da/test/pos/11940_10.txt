A stolen shipment of Vigoroso, the Mexican Viagra; a beautiful girl trying to rebuild her life and leave her husband, a head of the Italian mafia; a young sheriff who falls in love with his old girlfriend. This is the plot of "The Shipment", a country comedy located in the small town of Paradise, Arizona. Despite its simple and classic story, the movie (directed by Alex Wright) has its fun moments: when Elizabeth Berkley (like Candy Porter) looks at a Vigoroso green pill, says, "What is this? A mint candy?" Or when the girl comes in. in the sheriff's house and finds him completely naked. Or when the Vigoroso shipment ends up in this lake, in the last order ... The cast gives some fine performances: by Matthew Modine as the sheriff of Paradise Valley who still loves his old girlfriend; and by Elizabeth Berkley, whose personality still loves his old boyfriend ... The support model, including Nicholas Turturro, Paul Rodriguez (as the Mexican Jos√®) and G Michael Gray (which teeth ...) make it work comfortably as well. Not an Oscar material, but not that bad. A fun comedy without feeling.
