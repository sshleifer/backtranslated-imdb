A group of young travelers who just went out of gas go into a strange wax museum called "The Lost Oasis of the Salue", owned by a strange man named Slausen (Chuck Conners), as the dummies are controlled by a mysterious force and a madman. with special forces they want to die. <br /> <br /> One of the most understated horror movies of the late 70s! This Charles Band (producer of "Re-Animator") production has become one of the most frightening and most unique low-budget scare productions of the day combining some psychological themes without having to result in anything like the usual slasher film. The film keeps the viewer on the edge of their squares with tensions and some scares. The movie has become a cult diamond in the rough for the genre since then, and it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: "Pin", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)", "The Hills has Eyes (1977)", "Maniac (1980)", "Magic" (1978), " Dolls "," May "," Just Before Dawn "," The Devil's Rejects "," Sleepaway Camp "," Mother's Day "," A Nightmare on Elm Street "," Friday The 13th "," Halloween 1 & 2 ", "Puppet Master", "Waxwork", "Nothing But Trouble" and "Psycho (1960)", "House of Wax" (1953 and 2005), "Jeepers Creepers", "High Voltage", "Evil Dead II".
