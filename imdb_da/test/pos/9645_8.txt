You can tell that this is the first offer from the director (who also wrote it), but you can also see the potential that this guy has. This is a naturally low budget movie in the spirit of Boondock Saints. Of course, Boondock Saints came out a few years after this, so you could look at this as a diamond that needs some polish. The action was good - remember they are young boys and play young guys trying to be criminals. If you're looking for DeNiro or Michael Madsen in a criminal drama. They will not be "super cool" (tm) like some of the veterans. I would have loved to have seen Justin Pagel (Joe - the protagonist) continue to make more films - he was fantastic in this. Good movie - 3 stars out of 5.
