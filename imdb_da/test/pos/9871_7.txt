I bought this in the budget department last week. I already had halloween and halloween II, and since I was aiming to collect all horror movies ever, I chose this one. after all, the first two were good. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite intelligent to tell the truth. It seems to create the right atmosphere and has a nice "Michael Myers story". it uses the old places from the original, and the protagonist is the child that laurie ran the babysat the fateful halloween in 1978 ... the climax is also quite satisfactory. Anyways, it's much better than H20, which is honestly absolutely crap.
