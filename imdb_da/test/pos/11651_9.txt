This movie is about a very sensitive argument, and if you're looking for something that makes you think here, you're right. Tim Robbins has done a wonderful job and the result is a kind of docu-drama to appear in schools (for the strong themes dealt with). What about the actors? Now they are simply big; Susan Sarandon is truly 'the face of love' and Sean Penn is incredible as almost always. An absolute must-see!
