I'm not from the United States, I'm from Central Europe, and I think the show is incredibly good. It can easily be compared to married to. Children. My title says it is not exhibited for conservative public. I think I'm not so liberal, but it can be a slight difference between European conservatism and us disadvantages. Anyway, the show has started to be very popular in our area and it is very bad that it only contains two seasons. Last episode opens many continuous and fun moments. Still, many people and I would be happy if it would continue to play. The last thing I am excited about here is a lot of moral education, very well packed into humorous scenes. I think I have seen many comedies having over two and even more minutes of sadness in tragic scenes that do not fit into comedy. War does not contain anything like this and is made to laugh. It's like The Simpsons and Married, if also have no sad or even unfunny moments. I apologize for my terrible knowledge of English, but I still hope that you will understand what I meant.
