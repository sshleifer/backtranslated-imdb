Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Barbet Schroeder. If you like Hitchcock `Rope 'then you will like this movie. `Murder of Numbers' stars Sandra Bullock as psychologically distressed yet brilliant police officer Cassie Mayweather. Her partner is Sam Kennedy, a non-discriminatory detective played by Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Teenage killers are high school students Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). These young psychotics are out to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it, but the proximity of the catch is exciting and exciting for at least one of the killings. The supporting figures include a police chief, a lawyer and the high school caretaker that the killers strike the murder. The film reminds me of various `Hitchcock 'films crossed with the TV show` Law and Order'. We see quite a bit of police work, and it is really interesting to see which tracks the followers follow and which ones they do not. <br /> <br /> The second plot in the film relates to Cassie Mayweather's past and imprisoned ex-husband. Most viewers found this aspect of the movie unnecessary and slowly moving, but I found this to be the most exciting part of the story. <br /> <br /> "Murder by Numbers" is a nicely crafted movie if you're looking for safe, or should I say dangerous, murder mystery. For more excitement and excitement, try `Se7en 'or Hitchcock's' Dial M for Murder'.
