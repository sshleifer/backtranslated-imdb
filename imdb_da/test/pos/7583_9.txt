In the history of the cinema, all major filmmakers had to make a first film. Many times, when seen after they have been successful, a bulb continues in our heads. The connection is made and we see the solid foundation from where they started. So it's with HORSES ON MARS. It is the subtle humor woven around a seemingly straightforward story that tells a great story, but allows you to enjoy the images at once. In the picture, I found great attention to detail and a production polish that is rare in any student film. <br /> <br /> A young film producer always has improvements. But if Mr. Anderson continues on this path I think one day we will look back on this movie as the beginning of a good career. You should definitely watch this movie. Nothing beats the storm on the big screen.
