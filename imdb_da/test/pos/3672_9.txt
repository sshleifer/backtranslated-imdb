My partner and I had never heard of this movie and decided to give it a shot that picked the title from a list of movies on cable without knowing anything about it. When it opened and revealed the cast, did we think how good it can be? - Kathy Bates, Jonathan Pryce, Rupert Everett, Lynn Redgrave, Dan Akroyd and more. As the story unfolded, we became more and more tickled with our choice, and the movie soon we laughed. This is not a "big" movie, but it is one of those rare movies that has such a great combination of memorable characters taken through "the truth is alien to fiction", kind of surreal events that I could not help with but love it. I had no problem "suspending my disbelief" on some of the elements of Wackier history, because the film makers are so warm-hearted while still managing to make fun of everyone involved. As others at IMDb said, this is a comfort movie, and I wouldn't be surprised if it became a cult classic.
