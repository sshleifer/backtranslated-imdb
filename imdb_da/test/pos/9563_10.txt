I recently watched this movie for the first time. I enjoyed it so much that I went straight out and bought the DVD. This movie is pure genius and just gets more fun with every view. Anyone can write jokes or a fun dialogue and have actors remember them, but the basis of this movie is better !! How do they do that? Thanks, Christopher Guest!
