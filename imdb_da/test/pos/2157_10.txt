Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting, but it has a very good vampire plot! For those people who say they do not shoot em ups and fight movies they use. Well, this is really the hardcore! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie. Nicholas Guest was also very good and he probably steals the show! He really does like a great villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think this very nice looking actress is very undervalued. Michael Cavanaugh was good. It was really cool to see Vince Murdocco in this movie! With regard to the action, it is truly amazing with all the gunfights and the super-cold fighting situations. The fighting in this picture is really some of the greatest I've seen! There is so much going on for 86 minutes. For action fans you will be blown away by all the firepower and amazing battles that this movie has to offer! Night Hunter is a movie that is not easy to find and if you are in a video store and you see it for sale, buy it because this movie is great keeper and plus that box is cool! There are a multitude of actions to be seen to be believed! See and see if you can find some great deals on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com's Z-Shops and Market Place Sellers! In my opinion, Night Hunter is one of the greatest fighting films I've ever seen and the characters are so nice. If you like Don 'The Dragon' Wilson and want to see Nicholas Guest in a great performance, then I highly recommend any action movie fan who loves to shoot em ups, giant movies and vampire movies and has been disappointed with other movies that have look of a true non stop action flick but fail to deliver it to get and buy Night Hunter today!
