By far one of the best sci-fi movies out there. However, it takes several views to understand the film's concept and to be able to appreciate not only the special effect, but the film's main picture. It's my own feelings that this movie got such bad reviews because no one took the time to watch the movie as it was supposed to be seen. It has some moments you want to hurry up and pass, but they are few and far between. Hooper, who controlled TCM 1 and 2 along with a remake of INVADERS FROM MARS, and FUNHOUSE do their best work here. Great score, good acting and great effects make this a movie that can be added to your collection. If you get the chance, see the widescreen version on DVD, it is recommended for anyone who is a fan of sci-fi.
