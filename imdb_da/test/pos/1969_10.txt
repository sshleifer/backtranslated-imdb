This was a movie I accidentally came across. I went through and saw it at Showtime, so I saw it. Now I see it at least once a month. This is a movie filled with symbols that can make some people separate. Don't listen to people who hate this movie if they want an action movie with expensive f / x, they should have hired a movie that promises them. If you are in the mood for a good sci-fi, I highly recommend. If I buy on DVD, I recommend the Alliance Atlantic edition of the film, it contains many more extras than Dimension Film's edition.
