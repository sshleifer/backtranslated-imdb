When young Frances 'Baby' Houseman goes to summer camp with her family, she never expected to have such fun! One night, after walking away from a resort activity, she stumbles on an all night dance party with Johnny Castle and others with dancers. Quickly excited by the healthy dance moves, 'Baby' is eager to learn when to fill Penny, so she and Johnny do not lose their jobs on the resort. But young 'Baby' soon finds himself in a sticky situation; she is in love with a man she knows the father will never approve. But when Johnny is accused of stealing wallets, it's up to 'Baby' to confirm his alibi by admitting she was with him the night they were taken. Johnny is at least dismissed for getting involved with a visitor, but quickly recognizes what a mistake it left 'Baby'. He comes back with the famous line "No one puts Baby in a corner" and they show the resort exactly what they are made of. <br /> <br /> A great movie, perfect for a girly night in. With groovy tunes, inspirational dances and a story that makes you feel warm, it must be the best movie ever! **********
