A good story, well traded with unexpected distortions, for example. malicious murderous gangster Bryan Brown teaches his son macrame. Although it succeeds as an action drama where you hope the good guy (Ledger) and his gilrfriend succeed, it also has some hilarious ironic black humor, for example. bank robbers who become radio competition "winners" and their reaction, the revenge of the bushes, etc. Worth to see.
