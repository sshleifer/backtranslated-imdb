This is a fantastic show with total freshness and innovation. The usual chair (sofa for a woman) host, the mandatory band playing monotonous tunes, the same old jokes, the same pattern copied from the Nebuchadnezzar's days .... probably the pattern of Johnny Carson, copied by one and all, Latterman, Leno , Conan ... Daly, this show doesn't seem to have any of these. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and I will stick to it. While it's too early to say, this show seems to have no intellectual pretension, most talk shows are trying so hard to project, and I hope that's what would make this show different from the rest. I hope this show will last a long time! <br /> <br /> Back after months, I still love this show, and I love his self-loathing humor (eg, his confirmation that only pothead loners would be at home to watch his show on Saturday midnight and so are the jokes fun only for the stoned boys), who do not, however, involve the usual monkeying of Conan O'Brien, for example (I know it is a cardinal sin to be rejected by O'Brien's antics, but I really do not like his style and repetition) . <br /> <br /> I saw again the second night with Tom Arnold in it. The ferry's spoof of Merchant (and Nanny 911 in an earlier episode) is fun. The idiot paparazzi is fun, especially when a security guard warns them to take people's pictures, and if I am not mistaken, they start taking the pictures "Shary Coleman". <br /> <br /> Added on April 16, 2007: Coming back again, I'm confused by the neighbor and her dog. I can't decide if it's a joke or a real thing. In some way it was fun as hell. I don't expect Spike Feresten to read these pages, but maybe he does. He is brighter than a bunch of monkeys, and then I would better write down my suggestion here for him: I want him to make a complete 30 minute show with Crazy Gideon, the star of television advertising at the end of the night. I would like Crazy Gideon to have an interview in Spike's talk show, sing a song (and play guitar), make a shit in the SNL line and also answer questions from the audience about his potential mayor of Los Angeles (I know, Crazy Gideon may not be aware of this, but there are sites describing why he would be the perfect candidate for the position of mayor of LA). <br /> <br /> God willing! <br /> <br /> Back on July 14, 2007: Someone wrote here that the people who praised Spike's talk show must be reprimanded by Spike. I admit that Spike really bothered me, but I must also admit that Rockefeller is calling me his will, and last night I had sex with Cindy Crowford.
