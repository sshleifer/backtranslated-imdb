This is one of the rare comedies where you can try, as you might, you can't help but giggle, chortle, guffaw and even laugh aloud. The main player's performance as Hyde is pure manic genius. See if you can hold a straight face when he does his transformation. Good luck. :) On the downside there are times when the film makes the bog down. It seemed longer than its 90 minutes.
