I had never read much about (or even seen still images of) the six-man British comedy group The Crazy Gang, but my positive experiences with their contemporaries Will Hay and Arthur Askey - and especially Graham Greene's high praise by the FROZEN LIMITS themselves ("The Funniest English image that is still produced ... it can compare with SAFETY LATEST AND THE GENERAL ") - made me take the plunge with the just bones R2 DVDs from Network of this and their subsequent movie GASBAGS (1941; see below ), both released earlier this year with almost no fanfare. A British-made vest is rarity, but a British western spoof is rarer (CARRY ON COWBOY [1965] was still about 25 years away). Incidentally, I seem to be more evident to The Golden Rush (1925) and the WAY OUT WEST (1937), dating back to the classy classics mentioned by Greene. In addition, it also plays a variation on the "Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs" adventure (which was just immortalized on the screen via Walt Disney's animated masterpiece) and where the seventh member is played by ancient comic and frequent Will Hay foil Moore Marriott; The hallway actually calls beautiful heroine Eileen Bell with that name all the time, and there is even an entertaining sequence of the six who are preparing to go to bed and whistle the dwarf's song from the Disney movie! <br /> <br /> Six comedians (three sets of comedy duos: Flanagan & Allen, Nervo & Knox and Naughton & Gold) may be the greatest such grouping on film - although not all of their personalities come up here: my favorites were great Bud Flanagan (similar to Jim Backus), straight man Chesney Allen and moustached, squeaky Teddy Knox; but bald Charlie Naughton often took the limelight - as he is the one the others always seemed to choose. Still, it is Marriott who steals the movie from her very first scene - where he commits to imitating any official in a ghost town's dilapidated theater! a very young Bernard Lee is also remarkable as the villain of the play. In fact, the routine between Flanagan and Allen expects Abbott and Costello's famous "Who's On First?" (The film is actually hinged on a lot of puns for its humor - which doesn't necessarily travel, especially at this time). Nevertheless, there are several hilarious sequences all the way through - some of them even have tears in their eyes: the opening scene, where the hallway is devastated by a band of angry creditors; their dressing up as Indians when beating yukon; The hallway's ruse to make everyone rich with the same gold piece; they unfold all sleep migrating Marriott to confuse the villain (a gag that may be due to its origin in Marx Bro's hilarious mirror sequence in the DUCK SOUP [1933]); Spot-on theater sketch that pokes fun on hoary melodramas; the surrealistic moment when the persecution of the villains climbs one by one a staircase that is part of the painted landscape of the theater; and especially towards the end, when a group of song-mounted police gallop ever so slowly to the gang's rescue (despite becoming the egg of the still impatient Ranger hero). The thin soundtrack and the hectic nature of Gagsne itself made it difficult for me to get all the jokes at times - subtitles would certainly have been welcome in this case. Crazy Gang made only five films - the first two were also well-founded, OKAY FOR SOUND (1937) and ALF'S BUTTON AFLOAT (1938) and a much later reunion (although Allen at that time had bowed out due to ill health and was replaced by Eddie Gray) called LIFE IS A CIRCUS (1960, directed by Val Guest, who incidentally included both Gang movies I bought as well as some of the aforementioned Hay and Askey vehicles!).
