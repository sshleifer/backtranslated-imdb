I like Tom Hanks and he is one of the few actors who will pull me into the theater regardless of any concerns I may have about the movie. I'm worried that Mr. Hanks returns to "light comedy" as this is the arena where he passed the transition from television to film - remember "Big"? Well, "Charlie Wilson's war" is not easy comedy. It is political satire and very well written political satire on it. The script is the star of this movie, and Aaron Sorkin's word message is some of the best deals this year. <br /> <br /> Mike Nicols holds the entire escapade together and delivers a movie that zips together for a very fast 90 minutes (timing is all in comedy and nothing is ever fun if it pulls). Nicol's choice in sets and lighting also reminds a lot about the '70s and' 80s television, a step that has intentionally used to rotate the piece during the period. Returning to the use of modeling and stock photography over digital special effects also enhances retro look and credibility. Note for the production designers in your choice of storage recordings: I know the difference between an F-16 and a MiG, and a Bell and a Hind. But it may also have been part of the joke. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in Philadelphia. It was interesting to see and hear the audience NOT get the historical references to their own story. History tends to repeat because the returnees have forgotten what happened for the first time. <br /> <br /> Kudos to both Mr. Hanks and the Chameleon Phillip Seymore Hoffman. Sorkin's script is brought to life by these actors, and the whole production team is at the top of their game. <br /> <br /> Warmly recommended.
