The only pure life is one that ends with a signature in the blood. <br /> <br /> So says Mishima, a young protected boy who becomes a celebrity writer. Life of one of Japan's most famous literary voices is told from three perspectives, his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a Japanese military base and commit ritual suicide (shown in color), flashbacks (shown in black and white) , and scenes from his novels (shown in a kind of dreamy Technicolor put design somewhere between the traditional Noh Theater and "The Wizard Of Oz." These stories are often told at the same time, but are edited to enhance the slow fusion of Mishima's life with his fictions until the end (or the beginning) when, as the old samurai he so admires, he will be in balance between pen and sword (when his words and actions are the same, and he is full and "clean" Paul Schrader wrote the play for "Taxi Driver" and instructed "Cat People" (a bizarre erotic horror movie that left strange impressions on me as a boy), and in Mishima he comes closest to making a really great fi lm What is the interest? ng is to see the poet, the gay, the shy and awkward man with a low body image exceeding his tuberculosis to get out of WW2 (which he seems always ashamed of), becomes a bodybuilding, samurai obsessed, a-sexual, Media phenomena, constantly writing sharp volumes of novels, plays and short stories. A short and sweet version is to say that Mishima has no father and is obsessed with masculinity, beauty, sex and self-destruction, in some tragic attempt to feel associated with something greater than himself that he always lacked. Seeing him with his suicide cuts, you see him happy, delivering his great fathers speech, giving orders and loving control ... until the speech itself, the point where pen and sword meet? Of course, this ignores the subtlety of the story telling craftsmanship here, making this transformation so natural and remarkable. <br /> <br /> Although the story, fascinating at times, really isn't this movie's greatest success. Cinematography, performances, editing, music (by Philip Glass) and set design is really what makes it worth seeing and more than a traditional bio image. <br /> <br /> One day I want to download a Mishima book, he seems to have an ear for prose and ideas for scenarios, but for now I'm happy with the movie. Those interested in Japanese literature and post-war culture should check out. Fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions should also enjoy.
