This is one of Stan Laurel's best solo comedies before 1927 along with Oliver Hardy. Laurel is a very good actor in the film and gives good comedy. The best scene in the movie is when Stan dances with Mae Laurel (his spouse's common law wife) at Cafe Espanol. Stan does stupid dances that are fun without hearing the music. I would recommend this to any Stan Laurel fan.
