These critics have to find a new job !!! This film is based on a true story that has made history. It illustrates beautifully how love can prevail all in the fog of war and tragedy. The breathtaking kphallonia in Greece has caught my heart and soul as though I was there. Blue eyed cage & the lovely Cruz were amazing! Together, they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only get closer in time of war. This movie will touch your heart as it did my, you have to go see it !!!!
