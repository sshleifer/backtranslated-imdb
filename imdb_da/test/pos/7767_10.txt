This movie had reminded me to watch the old black and white movies with my dad. More true to life figures who seek love are in love and lose it. Old story fresh view. Larenz Tate was then Cary Grant in style as the character might have been in a clumsey situation, but the actor kept him looking silly and like a cardboard cut out. Nia Long has always been a favorite of mine, she is sweet even when she's hard, almost like a Kathrine Hepburn. This is one of his best works and shows that he is better than always playing an angry black man. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic, super-working, well-written, a real love story in Chicago, what more can you ask for? <br /> <br /> SuperB Black Love Story
