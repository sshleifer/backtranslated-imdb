It's fun because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love for it or hate it. You will probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best movies are those who share people because of course they have some influence. I'm in the five star camp because this movie made a real number on me and made me go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned, as all that was going on. Especially Afghanistan, and I'm guilty of it. The music through the movie was beautiful. I kept getting lost in it especially during some of the historical flashbacks. Personally I thought the sound was great. I thought the soundtrack with speech, music and radio was put together so you feel like you're in the RV with Jim, the protagonist or in the head. Everything not on the radio was very clear, and everything on the radio sounded like it was really on the radio. Anyway, this is a great DVD that made me cry.
