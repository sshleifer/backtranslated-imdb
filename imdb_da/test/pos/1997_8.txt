I have seen the movie actually several times. And what I want to say about that is the only thing that made this movie high rank was Burak Altay's incredible performance, absolutely nothing but that. Not even the stupid model named Deniz Akkaya and some of these popular names sometimes in the movie. Burak is certainly very talented, I've seen a few jobs he made and gone through. Although this is a kind of horror movie, he does really good work in comedy movies and also in dramas. I think most of you all saw the Asmali Konak movie and TV series, the two would go for an example ... All I have to say is you pay more attention to the new works coming out of Burak, then you will see. Keep the good work bridge, much love ..
