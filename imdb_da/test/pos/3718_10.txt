This is an example of which film school teachers would call a good debut film. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, inexpensive to shoot, guerilla filmmaking, no sets (just unused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Even the black-and-white movie file was a brilliant blow, probably chosen more for its low cost rather than film effect, but it worked. <br /> <br /> Reno was great as Brute. All trades were brilliant. The plot was simple and efficient, and there were no blurry bits to distract you. A tight, well-made, cost-effective budget film. <br /> <br /> Released in 1983, this would have been done just before the concept of large budget action optimization was refined by the Hollywood movie making machine, and film making was more exclusive and therefore more difficult and more needed for the right people in the right places than Today's internet-enabled world, so Luc Besson would have had to do a lot of negotiations and promise to achieve this result, making the end product even more remarkable. <br /> <br /> But then, the French film industry has always had a good reputation (yes, I know Luc Besson is Belgian, but the film is a French production) and has been the source of many Hollywood remakes. <br /> <br /> If I have a criticism, the cover image on the DVD (and possibly the original sales record) bears no resemblance to the movie at all and seems to be a rather bizarre picture rather than representative of any of the The movi e's themes - at first glance it seems to be a man in post-apocalyptic armor on turns, but on second inspection a man in armor reveals with a lance on an office chair with the legs of a desk in a reclining, safe attitude. It never happens in the movie once. It's monochrome movie, zero dialogue, physical acting, tight scenes and brilliant actors make this movie a worthwhile addition to your private movie collection. A great movie.
