Man, is it just good to see Young and The Restless Star Melody Thomas Scott as anything but flying Nikki Newman! A doctor with a brain no less! And super nice to see her as the beautiful Lorenzo Lamas instead of Victor Newman! <br /> <br /> Mel plays a university professor of microbiology who goes to the islands with her son for spring break, only to find a prisoner of the island infected with a rapidly spreading virus. Handy for here is the hunky character played by Lorenzo who has a daughter just her son's age. Mel shines, like Lorenzo with a bit overactive from the younger couple. Interesting premise in these times of chemical and biological terrorism speaks. Worth to see, especially for Y&R fans.
