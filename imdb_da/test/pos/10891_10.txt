GoldenEye 007 is not only the best movie-tie-in game all the time, but it is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter ever to hit the gaming console market. If you are not aware of the plot of this game, it is no problem because it is important that it is the same as the popular James Bond movie, GoldenEye, which was released in 1995 - two years prior to this game's release . <br /> <br /> This is a game filled with techniques and styles that would be imitated in many future games that come, giving the player a wide range of goals and difficult challenges. A. I. is smart (especially at higher difficulty) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment as well as difficulties for any player. <br /> <br /> The introduction of logical hitpoints on your enemies is a great feature. Even managers in this game can be taken down with a well-targeted shot to the head. It is this kind of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond, and that you can sneak in, sneak out, hide out henchmen as you go, or skip alarms and have to go through massive shootouts. Because of this, there are many ways to beat the game and unlimited possibilities for performing your tasks. AKA: You can take easy ways or quick ways to beat levels ... and if you don't have a strategy guide, you'll have to find out these paths by yourself (which I might add is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away). <br /> <br /> This is one of those games, the more you play it, the more you can appreciate its contribution to the gaming industry. Every time I play it, I notice aspects that have been repeated in many following FPS games. So if you have a Nintendo 64 go ahead and dust sucking and ordering a used copy of GoldenEye 007 because you trust me as a Bond fan and a casual player I can say that this game is highly recommended to all of them who wants to step in James Bond's shoes or just have a great and intense gaming experience. <br /> <br /> (Also be sure to look out for his sister game, Perfect Dark, which is also on the N64 same controls and very similar weaponry.)
