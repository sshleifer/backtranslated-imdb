I have often heard people express disappointment that Mazursky's "Tempest" has a bit to do with Shakespeare's original. It is, in my opinion, both true and false, but most of all it is a bad starting point for offering criticism. A work of art should never be criticized for what it is, but for what it is. The movie "Tempest" is nothing like a faithful reproduction of the play, but in my opinion it is true to Shakespeare's work in the spirit. Which "Tempest" is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films all the time. No, not experimental as in handheld camera and muttered dialogue, but experimentally as by exploring the history of a story without taking into account the box's earnings. Mazursky's storm is epic, sad, realistic, joyful, full of life, but most of all it is imaginative. Cassavete's depiction of Philip / Prospero is in itself worth 10/10 rating, and when you add Gena Rowlands, Susan Sarandon, a wonderful deep Molly Ringwald, Raul Julia, the dialogue, the music and the exquisitely suggestive little tables scattered throughout the picture. .. I rest on my case. One of the best films from the 80s. Do not miss it.
