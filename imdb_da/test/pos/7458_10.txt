I've always had animated ducks for some reason: Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck. Although none of them are as scared as Duckman. Originally sent between 1994 and 1997, Duckman was a total of 70 episodes, but could easily move on forever without becoming obsolete. The titular character is a discombobulated, unapologetic slob and virtually the worst living person in the world. He is a private detective, a widower, a peeping tom, an alcoholic, a sex maniac, a killer, one (fill in the blank). You name it, Duckman has done it. But who can blame him for being such a slim ball when the world he / she lives in is so insane, monstrous and just plain incongruous? Eric Tiberius Duckman (pronounced by maniacal Jason Alexander) could carry the whole show by himself, but when he is surrounded by a bunch of eccentric supporting characters, you just know that trouble is just waiting to explode at every opportunity. My favorite is to be Willibald Feivel Cornfed (or just Cornfed Pig), Duckman's incredibly bad sidekick, which is apparently talented and highly educated on everything and is persistently ignorant of his partner's endless vices and incompetence. <br /> <br /> Typical plot will involve some bizarre cases, he inevitably blurs through or will turn around his extremely dysfunctional household, even though duckman's beer bird King Chicken (Tim Curry), a kind of professor Moriarty in chicken form, closes some diabolic the scheme of revenge for being bullied in high school. When I was a teenager, this has been my absolute favorite animated show, better than The Simpsons, Family Guy and even King of the Hill. Nothing will surpass it. There was never, or will be, anything quite like Duckman ever again. The level of satire, observatory humor and writing is so sharp that it is mortal and the animation is made in the unique Klasky / Csupo style (everyone who has seen Rugrats will understand). It is a wonderful, very imaginative and wild world and all with a noirish, 1940s feel. You can never have too much of this particular bird.
