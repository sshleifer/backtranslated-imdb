My top 2 actors happen to be in this movie - Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchum. <br /> <br /> Ryan could play everything from Shakespeare to Arthur Miller and play it splendidly. In this movie, when he starts his speech "... people with names like Samuels and others with names that are hard to say" - it's chilling to see him. <br /> <br /> Robert Young plays the policeman who is called upon to investigate the murder of Samuels (Sam Levine), a citizen chatting with several soldiers in a bar. Mitchell is the desired soldier associated with it - his wallet is found in the apartment. But Mitchell is a gentle soldier who only lacks his wife. The story is told from different perspectives. Mitchell and Samuels discover a friendship and return to Samuel's apartment. Samuels seems to know the loneliness that Mitchell feels. "For years, you've been concentrating on a peanut, and now it's gone, you don't know what to feel," he says about the war. Ryan is great as the psychotic racist Monty. <Br /> <br /> Robert Young (along with Dick Powell) was an actor whose career was rejuvenated by film noir. "Crossfire", "They Don't Believe Me" and "The Other Woman" are good examples. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is his usual laid back self as the philosophical keeley. <br /> <br /> Gloria Graham and Paul Kelly as "odd couples" are also excellent in their short but telling roles. This is probably the best movie about racism ever made.
