I'm not sure what I can add, it hasn't already been said in any of these other fine, and quite hilarious, comments, but I'm trying. <br /> <br /> So you know the plot: there is a bed occupied by a demon who "absorbs" and selectively disintegrates the body of whoever (or anything) lies on it with his orange soda body. We have the man, in some scenes looks scary like Robert Smith of The Cure, hanging out in the wall and commenting on the hallway, and we have our various victims who just can't resist the comfort of this mysterious bed. <br /> <br /> This is no ordinary bed. No sirree Bob! It not only eats people, but it cleans up after itself, pulls back the covers, and it does itself. Who wouldn't have a bed like that? It can even use its plates as a rudimentary "lasso" to wake the robbed victims back in (especially if they take up half of the movie to try to escape). <br /> <br /> Our "main" story (if you can call it that) is about these three girls going out to this remote area to house (??). I can't remember exactly, but it's not really something, but there are lots of things that speak for the convention that you just have to give in and accept. The dialogue in the movie is like no other; The signs seem to speak to each other by telepathy, as their mouths never seem to move, and there is a constant echo. One of our girls thinks she doesn't like the rest of the "gang" and makes sure to tell us all her feelings in this case through an echo-voice-over, but we don't care about character development being thrown out of the window a long time before in this movie so why start now? There are scenes when the bed laughs, cords, crunches and makes various other sounds that we suppose to judge by our cast's failure to respond to the said sounds, cannot be heard. This and telepathy make the question of diegesis very difficult to determine ... but that's OK .... it's Death Bed: The bed that eats and it can tolerate all logic so it's OK. It gives a lush dreamy quality to this most bizarre film. If you buy (hehe buy ... I said "buy"?) This DVD, be sure to check the introduction of the director. He explains that the movie of this "flick" started in 1972, not wrapped up until 1977, he shopped it for some years without success and so fast forward 26 years to 2003 it is released on DVD. Probably someone somewhere had a printout of this in another country and made bootleg after bootleg of it, and it was quite accidental, on a notice board, no less that our director found signs that people knew and gasp! worried about his little known movie. From there he decided to give it a shot and release it. I'm glad he did. When you have as much as heard the title of this movie, watch it. I for one is going to buy this and I will preach his gospel around the world ... starting with this comment
