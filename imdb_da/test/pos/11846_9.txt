I loved this movie. It is very laughing. The action is good and the writing is really sharp. I'd rather see a hundred movies like this than the three ring gentlemen who repeat and repeat. <br /> <br /> It is a low budget affair and seems to be shot at DV but looks great and Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson are big together. Why do you have a minimum of ten lines? I'm not a critic, just a protector. I very much doubt that Quentin Tarantino could write a picture, fun without filling it with masturbation-free violence. This movie has to be seen on more screens than just one. I laughed from the beginning to the end. >
