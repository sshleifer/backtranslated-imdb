Hilarious, clean, light-hearted and quote-worthy. What more could you ask for in a movie? This is my all-time, number one favorite movie. Ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of owning a blue van with a flame and an observation bubble. The clich√©s in ridiculous situations are what make this movie fun. The wonderful comic chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) makes up most of my favorite parts of the movie. And who didn't love Flynch's hopeless discomfort? Don't forget the airport's antics by Leon's cronies, dressed up as Hari Krishna's: dance, chanting and playing the tambourine - unsurpassed! The apartment is genius, the locations are classic, and the plot is timeless. <br /> <br /> A word to the wise, if you didn't see the movie movie when you were little, it probably won't win a place in your heart today. But still it gives a chance, you might find out that "It doesn't matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do, you have to play."
