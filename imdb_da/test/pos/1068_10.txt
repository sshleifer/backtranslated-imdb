From the hectic, modern world where we live, the so-called good old days always seem so much more peaceful and innocent; an idyllic era, of which we only have memories and shadows resting on the silver screen, as with `Christmas in Connecticut ', a warm and loving film directed by Peter Godfrey. Barbara Stanwyck stars as Elizabeth Lane, a popular "Martha Stewart" type magazine columnist, writing about the life of her beloved farm in Connecticut, always with the latest recipe in the center of history. One of her biggest fans is Alexander Yardley, played by Sidney Greenstreet, the publisher of the magazine she writes. Yardley has never visited her farm, and in response to an idea expressed to him in a letter from a nurse, Mary (Joyce Compton), he decides to spend an old-fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth, her husband and child and as a special guest, one particular Mr. Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor, just came from spending fifteen days at sea on a fleet when his ship was the killer whip. Of course, Elizabeth cannot deny her boss, but there are problems; Not least is the fact that she has no farm and writes her column from the comfort of an apartment building in the city. It creates an uncertain situation for her as well as her editor, Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne), as the only thing Mr. Yardley demands of his staff is total honesty. What follows is a charming and lovely romantic comedy that transports the audience back to a seemingly simpler time and place to share a Christmas gift with a warm fire, good food and kindness. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck absolutely glitters like Elizabeth, with a smile and presence warmer than anything the greatest heath could provide, and quite convincing as a city girl completely out of her element in the yard. Morgan also feels good as the somewhat naive sailor whose confidence in his fellow man is admirable. Even with the scams played around him, he is the kind of guy you know somehow lands on his feet, and ultimately it's Elizabeth you really feel like. One of the glorious delights in this movie, however, is Sidney Greenstreet. Hans Yardley has a gruff outside, but underneath you undoubtedly know this is a man with a heart as big as Texas. It is a fair, honest portrayal and it is a joy to see him work; The most memorable scenes in the film belong to him. <br /> <br /> The support model includes Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), the amazing Una O'Connor (Norah), Frank Jenks (Sinkewicz) and Dick Elliott (Judge Crothers). A great movie that plays especially well in the Christmas season (though it would work at any time of the year), 'Christmas In Connecticut' is a memorable movie that never takes itself too seriously, is thoroughly uplifting and will leave you warm in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be. It's a true classic, and one you don't want to miss. I rate this 10/10. <br /> <br />
