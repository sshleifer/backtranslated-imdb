This film is one of the only historical documents showing talents of so many black singers, actors, actresses and dancers. Many who are no longer with us. Those who we are blessed to enjoy today in 1999 let us through this movie recognize the talents that existed then. That is why those who still live today, even those who are deceased, are superstars. Due to the history of education in music, drama, film, design, song, etc., this film belongs to the people of this country alone. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie recently. The sound was excellent! The movie seemed to be complete, color and clarity were fare, but good considering how old this movie is without repairs on frames. I agree with all previous positive reviews. I have no negative views. <br /> <br /> I just want to make a query. Please, to whom it is my concern, please make this movie available so that everyone can have this historic experience.
