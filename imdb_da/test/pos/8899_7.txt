Asterix and Vikings are the first animated asterix movie for over 12 years since 1994 "Asterix conquers America". It also has the honor of being the first digitally colored asterix animation, which makes the virtually entertaining story much more breathtaking to see. <br /> <br /> Each scene in this movie is vividly reproduced in bright cheerful hues The color schemes in the comics were based on. The comics also hold relatively close to the comic, better or worse, retaining the simple but unique look of the characters. Being simple in character design allows more time and effort to be spent on the actual animation, which, by the way, surpasses many other big screen theatrical animated films. Character movements are very fluid and have a quality that looks far beyond what a modest budget will normally produce; There is always something moving in each scene and no evidence of the usual cost of cutting animation short cuts. 3D computer images are seamlessly built into the traditionally animated 2D art. If so, the style of the 3D elements shades more like traditional comics paintings than CGI models. The story takes much of its elements from the "Asterix and the Norman" comic book, and this is where its main error lies. As an adaptation of the comic, "Asterix and Vikings" take too many freedoms with their source material. Long-term fans of the comic will undoubtedly find much to dislike about the history of the film and the failure to comply with the source. On the other hand, one can see this story as a real fun if taken on its own without comparing its source material. Very comedic, well-written jokes pepper the optimistic script. The funniest parts were the many pop culture references and jibes in today's 21st century life. Mobile communications, the shopping channel, the commercial airlines and even sports cars are spoofed to great effect. Excellent chemistry and performance of the cast (I saw this in English by the way), although a few voices like Cacofonix found me really annoying (but I think it's quite a part of his character). <br /> <br /> If there's something to criticize about the story, it's the lack of "asterix". This story seems to be more like Justforkix's story of teenage romance and "coming of age" with Asterix and Obelix playing only supporting roles. This gives a rather large sense of steel unit, as many of the elements of history are the usual staples of such teenagers. Derivatives and clich√©s at times only manage the witty comedy and the traditional Astrix elements (Romans, pirates, etc.) To save this movie from falling to ordinary mediocrity. Although it's not the best rate in Asterix's animated movie library, it's definitely one of the funniest, best scripted and the most beautiful animated. DVD seems a little hard to come by although ????????
