Ernst Lubitsch gave us great movies like Design for Living, Ninotchka, The Shop around the corner, Being or not being, and other great movies. But People usually put Bluebeard's eighth wife as one of Lubitsch's weakest films. <br /> <br /> But I consider this movie an important movie. This film began the collaboration between Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder. Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder and Walter Reisch wrote the manuscript of Ernst Lubitsch's Ninotchka. Of course, Lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process. Then Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder worked together. Together they wrote the manuscript for famous films like The Lost Weekend and Sunset Blvd. <br /> <br /> There are many fun moments in the movie. I thought "The Taming of the Shrew" was a lot of fun. There is a famous term called "Movies are slices of life." And here's a good example from Bluebeard's eighth wife (1938). <br /> <br /> In the first session of the scripting process, Lubitsch asked this question: How does the boy and the girl meet? Billy Wilder immediately suggested that the opening scene should be the store store of a department store. "The boy is trying to buy a pajamas," he managed to gleam. "But he only sleeps on tops. He is frugal, so he insists on buying only tops. The clerk says he must also buy the pants. It looks like a disaster. Then the girl enters the store and buys the pants because she only sleeps. in the pants. "Ernst Lubitsch and Charles Brackett were enchanted. It was only months later that they discovered that Billy Wilder himself was a top-of-the-line sleeper and that he had been caring for the idea for months and was waiting for a chance to use it. <br /> <br /> I got this information from a book. I think this movie can be considered as the return of Ernst Lubitsch. Right after this film, he made amazing movies like Ninotchka, The Shop around the Corner and being or not to be. <br /> <br /> I thought Gary Cooper's performance was good. I think Lubitsch probably threw Gary Cooper probably because Gary Cooper played Long Fellow Deeds, who inherited fortune in Frank Capras. Deeds, go to town. But that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> For me, I was very happy with the movie. I rate this movie 9 out of 10. Lubitsch movies are different because his movie is sliced ​​of life.
