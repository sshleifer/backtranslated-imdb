I must admit I was surprised at how good this movie was when I first looked at it. I had planned to see it in theaters during the summer, but found out that it was unpleasant that it was already and was gone. Therefore, I expected to have been removed from theaters because it was bad. So today I rented it and saw it and really enjoyed it. The speed that events arose was questionable, it could have been a little longer. I found it very right in the book, but it did give out some important parts: Mullet Finger's real name, etc. I felt that if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't really understand what was going on. The action was pretty good, another thing I expected to be poor, but the policeman, sorry I can't remember the actor's name, could have done a little better. All in all, I found this to be a very entertaining movie and would recommend it to any audience!
