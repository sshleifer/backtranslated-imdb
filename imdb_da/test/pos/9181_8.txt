Okay, OK, I have to say I was impressed. It's hard to say what I'm more impressed with: my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch, so I don't understand my eyes or the movie itself. Either way, "Hitch" was pretty darn good. Hi, it was good enough for me to see twice. Will Smith was fun and good. Kevin James was just fun and absolutely crucial to the movie. As much as this movie is centered around Hitch (Will Smith), without Kevin James, it's just not the same. The story is: Hitch is a match maker who helps the guy to venture the girl. His job is to create the chance that the girl can see the guy when she would not otherwise. After the meeting, the rest is up to the guy to make or break the relationship. He only works on referral and remains largely unnoticed during the process. Albert (Kevin James) is Hitch's project this time, and Albert has eyes on Allegra Cole (Amber Valleta) a Paris Hilton type character. While this plot unfolds, Hitch has eyes on Sara (Eva Mendes), a sharp, independent, captive gossip collector who has nothing to do with a relationship. <br /> <br /> The two stories make some fun moments and they tie together a bit of a twig. Of course, no love story is complete without the mandatory misunderstanding, misunderstanding or accident to send the guy hunt for the girl. Fortunately, they make it short and dissatisfied. Hitch was a fun and fun movie that floated very well and rolled together without hitch.
