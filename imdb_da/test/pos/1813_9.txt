One of the better teenage competences to be filmed during the 80s, Valley Girl has a young Nicolas Cage starring. Deborah Foreman is fun as the object of the cage's desire (and what happened to her?). Look for veteran actors Colleen Camp and Frederic Forrest as Julie's hippie parents - they are very fun!
