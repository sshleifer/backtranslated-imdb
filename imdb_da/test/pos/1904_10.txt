Citizen Kane .... The Godfather Part II .... D'Urville Martin's Dolemite. This is the only major part of celluloid ever created and released on humanity. Rudy Ray Moore, in a role that transcends Academy Awards stars like Dolemite, the most horrifying cat in the universe. He obviously takes no jive from any turkey (of course I'm a turkey) and proves it with his rappers, pimping and karate chopping. This is blaxploitation at its absolute finest, a shining example of the genre with its low budget, continuity errors and hatred of rat soup that eats honkey expletive expletive. The True Godfather Rap (not this new Ali nonsense) Moore is something of a compilation of acting technique; Somehow manages to be the most charismatic horrible actor of the 1970s, and that says something. This is highly recommended people, if not for single-liners alone.
