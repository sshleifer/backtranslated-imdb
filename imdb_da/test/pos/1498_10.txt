Hearing back to the "good old days" of 1971, we can revoke live when we were treated to a full season by Charles Chaplin at the cinema. That's what the promotional guy called it when we saw him on someone's old talk show. (We can't remember who it was, either MERV GRIFFIN or WOODY WOODBURY, one or the other!) The guest spoke about Sir Charles's career and how his films were out of circulation since 1952 the exclusion of the former "Little Tramp 'from Los Estados Unidos because he is an "unwanted stranger." (No Schultz, he is NOT from another planet!) CHARLIE had been considered a "subversive" because of his interest and open approach For various political and economic systems, everything from the anarchist movement of the 20s (and before) killing the technology to socialism in its various forms was a fair game for discussion at Chaplin's Hollywood parties, which of course meant the inclusion of the Soviet style as we commonly call communism. <br /> <br /> CONNECTION OF Mr Chaplin's difficulties was both confused by a small detail, he had never become an American citizen. <br /> <br /> ANYHOW, enough of this bagg round already! <br /> <br /> SEEK it to say that it has become "Persona Non Free" in the United States. . It was time to get the old movies out of the mothballs and back to Movie Houses. It would certainly be a good gesture by us who easily forget and quickly forget Americanos. It would be a good gesture for the great filmmaker; In addition, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences had plans to honor Chaplin with a special tribute to the Oscar Show in 1972. This would surely be a tearful, but happy packaging of patos a lot to have America invite Charlie back and get him to receive a special Academy Lifetime Achievement Award in front of a Worldwide Television Audience numbering in millions. <br /> <br /> BESIDES, it would be natural to promote Chaplin Season at the Theater! (Remember, Little Tramp was as sparse as a Bu $ ine $$ Man when he was like a movie maker!) The program consisted of showings of modern times, CITY LIGHTS, the great poet, monseur verdoux, a king of New York and finally CHAPLIN REVUE. We remember being very excited in anticipation of multi date movie party. <br /> <br /> In our fair city of Chicago, it was reserved for the Carnegie Theater on Rush Street. The festivities lead out with MODERN TIMES, and all the others will be shown one at a time, each staying regardless of the time needed to satisfy the public's desire to see each image. As we recall, the very first was on the CHAPLIN REVUE form. In RETROSPECT we look back and want them to start running with REVUE; as there were undoubtedly legions of movie guests (like ourselves) who knew very little about his achievements in movies, except for the Keystone, Essanay and Mutual Silent Shorts, which appeared as regular feature on so many Kiddy Shows across the country . Oh yes, once again nobody advised me! <br /> <br /> Concentrating on today's honorable guest film, THE CHAPLIN REVUE, we found that it was actually three separate images; Carefully tied together using the story of Chaplin (Himself), some lively themes and random music (once again written by Chaplin) and some good speeches and serious stories (Ditto, of Chaplin.) He opens the talks by taking advantage of some movies from the home movie depicting the construction of the Chaplin Studio in Hollywood, as well as a film taken by some probation, and showing director Chaplin demonstrating whatever he wants for a group of actors. <br /> <br /> This segment was well done and well received by the public. Both the building's humor and the repetition were enhanced by making them seem accelerated. (The rehearsal is of course the building by speeding up the camera's photographic process. The old trick seems to make the buildings almost built. <br /> <br /> This shorts amalgam incorporated three of Chaplin's short comedies from his stint with first national images "It was about 1917-1923. The election was well thought out and gave us a wide range of topics and moods. FIRST up was SHOULDER ARMS (Charles Chaplin Productions / First National Pictures, 1918). As the title suggests, it is a story of 1. Released in October 1918 with about a month to precede the ceasefire day on November 11, it was a comedy of comic Army gags and a romance between Private Chaplin and a French girl (Miss Edna Purviance). and in the great old tradition of ridicule of Enemy, the German army. <br /> <br /> DISPLAYS an excellent example of old adage about children and dogs bringing people together, the next movie A DOG LIVING (C haplin Productions / First National, 1918) tracks parallel lives in Chaplin's Tramp and a recently adopted cover, Scraps. Movie history involves families, two of them. A Homo Sapiens, a Canine and both provide us with some great surprises. As the final, we have PILGRIM (Chaplin / First National, 1923) a good choice to have as the final. It was bright, light and tight. It was an excursion in the area of ​​the Western Spoof, Comedies of this type have been made since each comedian and team. "Pilgrim" in history is not of your standard Thanksgiving Variety; but rather a "guy" or "Tenderfoot" who ventured out west. The tramp is not just the guy; but his character is an escaped Convict, mistakenly thought to be the new priest in a Western town's church! <br /> <br /> Our rating (it's Schultz and Me) is ****. (There are four Derbies) <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
