Supercarrier was my favorite movie in the late 80's when it came out. My dad taped it for me and I saw it all the time until my step-mom lost Oprah over it and my heart was torn. I want to know if or where I can get it from. I've been looking for it. I think they even came out with a Supercarrier 2. It wasn't as big as the 1st, but I'd like them all if I could find them. I don't think @ everything that was a bad movie. It was a very interesting movie with a lot of action, but it had some of a love story plot for it. The actors / actors in the film were great. It also helped me understand that this is not just a man's world, but it is also a woman's world, and many women can do the same thing, if not more than what a man can do, and women also deserve great respect for their duties.
