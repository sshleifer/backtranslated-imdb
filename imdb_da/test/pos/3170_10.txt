A great movie, I just saw it, and I will see it again. I had never heard of Derek Jarman before I saw this movie, but now I am, I can't wait to see his others. The film takes a whole new perspective of Shakespeare's The Tempest, I am sure he would have appreciated it for Jarman's use of drama's themes of love, magic, darkness and atmospheric excitement. Okay, OK, there might have been some nudity in the movie that I didn't expect, but it didn't offend me, it just surprised me and made the movie more unpredictable. One Spoiler (for the nervous: Accelerate flashback scene with Sycorax & Caliban and Ariel as their slave, it's quite a graphic. Generally, if you start to find Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare performances, slack and monotonous, then you should watch this movie. Great and surreal, it will blow you away, but only if you let it, have an open mind - and let the movie work, it's magical on you.
