ROMEO AND JULY had been interpreted in so many ways, but very few of the versions captured the essence of the play. The ony I can think of, really eat the Roman spirit was the WEST SIDE STORY and believe it or not, Troma Film's TROMEO AND JULIET. At first glance, this is another splatter party, and many believe it scares the Shakespeare classic. However, the film has an honest sense of it. Updated to appeal to today's sickly youth, of course, but not without profit. Yes, the frequent dismemberments, body piercings, car crashes, lesbian sex scenes, masturbation and incest are in bad taste, but what is bad when you have such a sweet love story as the foundation? As bad as most of the play in this movie is (I think it's after all Troma), the two leaders have a real chemistry, more than in the big budget monstrosities TITANIC and STAR WARS EPISODE TWO. There is a lot of modernization, but much of the original text is in line, especially when Tromeo and Juliet are together. There is a big scene where Juliet propagates the famous, "Parting is such sweet grief", and the tromeo follows quickly in the mid-nineties grunge fashion "Yes, it sucks completely." I think it's really unfortunate that this movie isn't going to get the recognition or the broad release it deserves. I hope people who see this on the video store shelves will not be turned off by the gross trade show in the movie because they would miss out on quite a subversive expereience.
