Alfred Hitchcock has made many amazing thrillers, and many of them have been greeted as some of the greatest films all the time. A movie that tends to get lost during Vertigo and Psycho is this movie; Strangers on a train, the most compelling movie that Hitchcock has ever made. The story follows Guy Haines, a tennis player and a man who is soon married to the senator's daughter if he can get divorce from his current wife. One day on the road to see his wife, he meets the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and is soon drawn into a murder plot that he cannot stop or stop; and one that could eventually cost him his life. The conversation onboard the train between Bruno and Guy is one of the cinema's most exciting and thought-provoking time. What if two people "swapped" murders and thus solved all suspicions of the crime and made their motives irrelevant? Could this really be the perfect murder? What makes this movie more frightening is that the events that Guy has brought into could happen to any normal everyday person. Everyone has someone they want to get rid of, so what if you met a crazy man aboard a train that makes your murder for you and forces you to do his? The chances of this happening are unlikely, but it is the idea that anyone could be a killer who is central to the message of strangers on a train; and in this situation anyone could. <br /> <br /> Is there any actor on earth who could have portrayed Bruno Anthony's character better than Robert Walker? The man was simply born for that matter. He manages to capture the right mood for his character and commands absolutely all the scenes he is in. Bruno's character is a madman, but he is not madman; He is a calculation, conniving man and Robert Walker makes the sign credible. His performance is extremely vicious, yet understated enough to hold the character in reality. Unfortunately, Robert Walker died only a year after the release of Strangers on a Train, and I think this is a major loss to the cinema. No one in the cast shines as much as Walker does, but worth mentioning is his co-star Farley Granger. Granger never impresses so much, but his performance is good enough and he keeps himself against Walker. Also remarkable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person; And so it must be. Ruth Roman is Guy's wife to be. She is not really in the film enough to make a lasting impression, but she does the best of what she has. Alfred Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, takes the final role as the four key roles of Barbara, the sister of Guy's fianc√©. She is suitably nice in this role and she tends to steal many of the scenes she is in. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is always sublime, and it is very much in this movie. In particular, there is one shot that sees the murder of the film committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses. This is an absolutely brilliant shot and one that creates a good mood for the stage. Hitchcock's direction is moody all the time and largely adheres to the film noir style. The climate of the film is both spectacular and exciting, and I do not think anyone other than Hitchcock could have drawn it to the great effect it was shown in this movie. It's really overblown, and out of luck from the rest of the movie; but it works. There is a reason why Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest instructor of all time, and the reason is that he not only uses the script to tell the story of the movie, but he also uses the camera to do so as well. Strangers on a train are one of the greatest thrillers ever made. Its history is both exciting and thought-provoking, and is sure to delight any fan of cinema. A masterpiece.
