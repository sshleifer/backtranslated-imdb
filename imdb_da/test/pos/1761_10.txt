"Hoppity Goes to Town" was the second and last full-length animated feature created by Max and Dave Fleischer, who created a parallel universe for Disney. While Disney's movies are well-remembered today, both Fleischer films are "Gulliver's Travels" and this one is forgotten. "Hoppity" is a spell binding original, not an adaptation as the first image. It's a big plus you'd think. No, the critics, rarely on Fleischers' pages to begin with, tore them in for this. Yes, the story is not as tight as "Gulliver", but how can you hate a movie that is so gratifying? <br /> <br /> It's full of great music tracks and a very involved story that would be a crime to reveal. The characters are lovable and charming, and there is heart in this movie. The Fleischers really pampered here and never did it again. Most of their time would be devoted to one-reelers after this thought at the box office. It is a pity that they did not continue to perform functions. Who knows? Their next attempt may have been masterpiece, they were aimed at. <br /> <br /> **** out of 4 stars
