I can't say how many times one line has made me laugh or how often I've described the scene for people who aren't familiar with this movie. I saw the year it was released, I was 19. I don't think there were a dozen people in East Village theater that night. For years, I thought we were the only ones who saw it. Nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as I had, and see it lasting value despite the time gone by. Rent it, buy it or steal it .... one should see.
