I'm usually wary of movies floating around 6/10 on IMDb. I like to think people know what they are talking about and know what they like. I think the trick of reviewing is to take an approach to "Hey, if I liked types of movies like these - I'd give it a higher score than I'm about to give it now because I can't Like these types of movies "Then people judge differently and base more value on acting, or perhaps history or direction. Anyway, landing the plane here - I had rented this movie out before and hadn't had time to watch it, this morning I did it. <br /> <br /> Wow! Watch this movie. I am personally interested in paranormal / have read a little about near death experiences, so I was automatically connected. I am unsure of some of the comments here and say that a quality cast here was wasted - I disagree - the action here was fantastic from everyone - I think it's the only time I don't mind Julia Roberts, it was good to see 24 Kiefer Sutherland (Currently at the time of this review serving a prison sentence for DUI), and Kevin Bacon has an interesting hair style. <br /> <br /> All in all - I liked the direction, the atmosphere, the actor and the story are most of all - especially the idea of ​​karma, and quoting Nelson Wright "All we do about" So true. <br /> <br /> 10/10!
