In Nordestina, a village in the middle of heaven in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of her mother, who cried continuously for five years. When he is young, he falls in love with Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen-year-old teenager who dreams of seeing the world and becoming an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro he participates in a sensational TV show and promises to travel for the fifty years to come in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented. 50 years later, Antônio (Paulo Autran) tries to correct what was wrong in his journey. "A Máquina" is one of the best Brazilian movies I've seen recently. The refreshing and original story is a poetic and magical fable of love that will surely excite the most skeptical and tough viewer in a unique romance. The direction is excellent; the manuscript is amazing; The kinematics and colors are magnificent; The cast led by Gustavo Falcão, the icon of Paulo Autran and Mariana Ximenes is fantastic, with amazing lines; The soundtrack has some beautiful Brazilian songs that highlight Geraldo Azevedo and Rento Rocha's "Dia Branco". If this movie is distributed abroad, you must hit me and rent it or buy the DVD because I bet you will love the story that will bring you into tears. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Máquina ?? O Combustível é o Amor" ("The Machine? The fuel is love")
