It does not end to me that now and then I have to identify this movie (which I consider a masterpiece and I do not use that word easily) with the qualification "Not Michael Douglas Movies!" Not only are the titles the same, but they refer to the same thing - the radioactive fallout that counted on the survivors of the first atomic bomb treatments. In Imamura's film, it is not cheap metaphor; The whole movie is about fallout, physical and emotional, from Hiroshima and the war itself. As the deterioration of a couple and their adult niece becomes more ugly, the ironic image becomes more powerful, from the old clock that is reset every night to the stone walls that gradually pile up outside the hero's door. (These are again carved by a shellshocked veteran who, in a series of tragicomic episodes, is forced to attack something with a motor approaching the city.) The bombing itself is shown in small flashbacks that are coolly awful. Yet "Black Rain" ("NtMDm!") Itself can be seen several times because of Imamura's compassion for his characters. I repeat: a masterpiece.
