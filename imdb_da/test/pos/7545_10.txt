This bright, hilarious English comedy about schoolgirl antics is a neglected gem. The main question is where is the audience? The film is rated 10 by most voters, but how many voters are there? They do not make comedies like this anymore because the movies are not distributed or viewed. I will never miss a chance to see this old art house classic again. But where are art houses?
