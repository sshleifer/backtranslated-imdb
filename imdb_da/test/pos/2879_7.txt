This, ladies and gentlemen, is really a modern B movie. The dialogue is set and delivered with stiffness, the assumption is predictable (there are some decent turns) and characters remain 2D for the most part. And yet there is a certain ... charm. WWE wrestler Kane brings the life of the sick, twisted monster of a man with many pathos (although it is a bit like his character that he has played about ten years) and then I find it very funny when people say it is "not much of a reach for him," but Glen Jacobs is apparently quite a good guy, so in fact it is. In any case, he is thrown perfectly as the hulking brute and the deaths are appropriate over the top (Jason would be proud), but I heard at least four applause breaks for four different killing scenes. Honestly go into this movie and believe that you want to have fun and a gore party, oh that is QUITE the gorefest. The R-class is really deserved, and I actually got a bit of nausea during some of the more graphical times. In any case, a very, very funny but rather poor movie.
