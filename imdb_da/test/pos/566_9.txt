Right away, the same dark weaknesses that we all unfortunately have: lies, deception, laziness, the list goes on. But as an American, I was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist in today's police force, which is reflected by the Duval County Sheriff Department's terrible detective and police work on the murder of a white female tourist and a 15-year-old accused black youth. I shook my head in shame that detectives were protected from their violent work, while a young man's life hung in the crooked justice. <br /> <br /> But there is also a story of hope with our legal system and how poorly paid public defenders stuck to their weapons (irony calculated) and forced the truth from the detectives. I wanted to fly down to Florida and tell someone influencing what a large public defense team they have in Duval County; These lawyers care about the "little" man and most importantly for justice. <br /> <br /> The second story line is about faith and family. Praise the family of the accused and their strong Christians (submit to any dedicated religion) beliefs and wonderful family values. I hope they win their lawsuit against the Duval County Sheriff's Department. <br /> <br /> Bravo for justice !!! Bravo to the little guy !!!
