Being a self-proclaimed slasher addict means that it is very rare that I get the chance to review many major budgeted movies with credible casts. Apart from James Mangold's successful cashier office, Identity draws; There have been no big names since the Scream trilogy again put Wes Craven's name back on the Hollywood card. That's why Mark Malone's last stop ?? a mystery thriller with blatant slasher overtones, immediately fascinated me. With a decent line-up, including Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow and an exciting soundtrack that even accommodates Lynn Anderson's Rose Garden, I have to admit that the first characters were very positive for this claustrophobic feature. As far as I know, there have only been three other snow-slashes, unless of course you consider Demon Possessed to fit in the category. The first slice and cube on the ice was the bone-dry Satans Blade, then Lisa Loring came the cheese party, which was Blizzard of Blood, and the cozy shredder followed about fourteen years later. <br /> <br /> During an extreme snowstorm, state trooper Jason (Adam Beach) is fighting through the snow to reach a remote lodge in the Colorado Mountains. His task is to inform the guests that the road is closed and they must remain for at least one night until a road can be cleared through the dangerous conditions. This news does not work with the suspicious pile of two troublemaking brothers (Callum Keith Rennie and Peter Flemming), a truck driver who really doesn't want to hang around (William S. Taylor), a randy couple of lovers (Winston Rekert and Amy Adamson) and Jason's ex-girlfriend Nancy (Rose McGowan). Motel owners (Jurgen Prochnow and P. Lynn Johnson) are also not happy with the news, but they offer rooms to the stranded guests and try to calm the tense situation. Things make a trip worse when Jason finds a mutilated body and a bag full of stolen cash lying in the snow behind the cafe. Like a chapter out of an Agatha Christie mystery, the lodgers begin to die in the hands of a masked attacker who seems to intend to resume the money. With so many risky characters to choose from and no way to leave the crime scene, Jason must try to stop maniac before he kills again ?? <br /> <br /> A good mystery needs at least a handful of shady suspects, each with a credible motive, a remote location that no one can escape and a clever protagonist that helps solve the traces. Fortunately, The Last Stops each of these essential ingredients in a thriller that has its equal moments of shine and sheer stupidity. The movie starts out excellently, as the dubious personalities collide in a claustrophobic environment that manages to keep the excitement going high throughout. Malone holds up the level of interest as each character reveals their own reasons for attracting some of the suspicion, and to be fair, the decisive twist is not one that you guess easily. In fact, I found myself watching the movie again to see if I could get any advice I missed the first time. Unfortunately, when the maniacet is revealed to be one of the top psychics that wisecracks as a comic book bad man, The Last Stop lapses with a great deal of credibility. Fortunately, everything is not lost when an unexpected and excellent orchestrated plot twist saves the movie's finale. <br /> <br /> Similarities can be drawn with the excellent identity, as the two plots are almost interchangeable. James Mangold's efforts must be the better of the two mainly due to star billing John Cusack and the always reliable Ray Liotta. That being said, though Adam Beach does a good job at the forefront, while Jurgen Prochnow, Amy Adamson and the brilliant Callum Keith Rennie add some credible support. Rose McGowan seems to be careful in this role, as she probably does from day to day, and Winston Rekert started out terribly before going overboard with the movie's climax. If you are a die-hard slasher fan who sees it here for some bloody killings, then you will be disappointed. The balaclava-worn psychopath comes only once and the rest of the murders are committed off-screen. But as I said earlier, Malone's leading talent means that the excitement is never too far away and you can forgive the few mistakes, because the positives are only to be won. <br /> <br /> The last stop is well worth looking for slasher addicts and movie fans alike. Yes, there are a handful of negatives, but in general this is a solid example of new Hollywood talents. If you liked Identity, give it a try?
