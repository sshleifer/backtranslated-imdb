I watched this movie the second night and I have to admit it was probably the best movie in this generation. Turns out I was not born before 1988, but I can relate to this movie as Cary Grant may relate to having an STD or Burt Reynolds to be a burnout. Marky Mark did not fall into the awesomeness after his short stint in New Kids on the Block, which I would describe as "the best band in the world (aka BBW). I love everything and continue to support Marky Msrk because he needs us now more than ever, he is the only boyee who survived the de-sharted.
