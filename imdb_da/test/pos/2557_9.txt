Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), called Ale for Short, works at an auto-body workshop in what has become known as the Iron Triangle, a deteriorated 20 block series of auto junk yards and sleazy car repair dealers near the Shea Stadium in Queens. , New York. Here, customers are not asking whether parts come from stolen cars or why they are able to receive such large discounts, they simply put their money and hope everything is up and down. Slinging edges like these are not highlighted in the travel guides, but Iranian-American director Ramin Bahrani puts them on the screen in the Chop Shop, a strong indie film that received much love last year in Cannes, Berlin and Toronto. A follow-up to his acclaimed "Man Push Cart", Bahrani spent a year and a half at the location described by F. Scott Fitzgerald as in the Great Gatsby as the "Valley of the Ashes". <br /> <br /> For all its gloom, Chop Shop is not a work of social criticism, but like Hector Babenco's Pixote, a poignant character study, where a young boy's survival is bought for the price of his innocence. Shot on the spot at Willets Point in Queens, Bahrani makes you feel like you're there, sweat in a hot and humid New York summer with all its noise and chaos. The film focuses on the charming street-chic 12-year-old Ale who lives on the edge without any other adult support or guidance than his boss (Rob Sowulski), the actual proprietor of the Iron Triangle garage. Polanco's performance is raw and slightly ragged, but he has fully earned the standing ovation he received at the film's premiere in Cannes along with a hug from the great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami. <br /> <br /> Intruded into a small space above the garage together With its 16-year-old sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales), who works to dispense food from a lunch cart, Ale is one of the interchangeable spare parts he deals with. While dreaming of owning his own food cart, in the city that never sleeps, he knows that the only thing that can make the "top of the pile" is another bent fender. In this environment, Ale and Isi use any means necessary to keep their heads above water, while their love for each other remains constant, and they still laugh and perform childhood, which was never theirs. As Barack Obama says in his book "Dreams of My Father", the change can come later when their eyes stop laughing and they have closed something inside. Meanwhile, Ale complements his earnings by selling candy bars in the crowded New York subways with his friend Carlos (Carlos Zapata) and pushing bootleg DVDs on the street corners, while Isi tricks to truck drivers to save enough money to buy ready-made $ 4500 van where they hope to start their own business. <br /> <br /> Although Ale is a "good boy", he is not over stealing bags and hubcaps in the Shea Stadium parking lot, events that Bahrani's camera observes without judgment. In Chop Shop, Bahrani has presented a convincing antidote to the underdog success stories that ran out of Hollywood Dream Factory, and has given us a movie of great naturalism and respect for its characters, which in many ways resemble the great Italian neo-realistic films and the recent Iranian works by Kiarostami, Panahi and others. While the outcome of the characters is far from certain, Bahrani ensures that we see a huge billboard at the Shea Stadium, which reads: "Low Dreams Happened" and let's have the hint that in Rumi's phrase "the drum in the realization of that promise is beating, "
