Okay, so that wasn't what I expected. I rented this movie just to see how it would be, since I'd like to see the first one anyway. But this movie had B-movies all over. But when I saw it, I realized it was a lot of fun. In the first 30 minutes it was only how the snow was kiiling people and a man lost his beauty. But the first few minutes had some fun a liners in it. When he throws up the first of his little minions, I knew it would be very much fun. They all act as gremlins in the ninety-nine four-eyed gremlinines that made it look like it was spoofing it and made me forget that it was a B movie. So if you like to laugh rent this one.
