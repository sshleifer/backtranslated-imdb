It was very refreshing to see this beautiful movie. The director maintained focus on the main subject without venturing into side posts (doctors' families or stories from other hospital patients) that are so typical of Bollywood assembly line products. He kept the story simple to understand and made sure all the actors are true to the characters they were supposed to imagine. The grandfather's rustic ways in the clinic, the surgeon's cold and unemotional behavior, the worker's zeal gave the film a sense of authenticity. I am also pleased that the director did not fall for the temptation to add songs or special effects and reduce it to the level of Anand or Safar. A couple of scenes at the end of the movie, such as the boy visiting other blind children and a blind worker's workplace and also the final scene where the boy is clapping the sound of splashes and birdwatching is sure to make your eyes misty . /> <br /> Many Bollywood players do not understand that the Oscar committee members appreciate simplicity of the subject and the authenticity and conciseness of the film more than glitter and glamor. Shwaas is certainly a better nomination than Lagaan, who dealt with a topic that has already been killed. No MPAA member would like to pass through 4 hours of jingoist drama and a lot of singing and dancing. <br /> <br /> I look forward to more films from the director Sandeep Sawant in the future.
