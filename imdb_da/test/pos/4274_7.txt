This show is really Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British guy, a guy who is sometimes nice and a super-pretty woman. Of course it is different because there is a sing-off and there are dances and some appear (we just don't see anything from the actor). <br /> <br /> I gave this show a 7 because there are a few tweaks that I know many people (including me) would do if they worked for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges who decide who goes home. I know they will find the right Danny and Sandy, but America must have the power to decide who at home. There really is no point in the single. The person with the lowest number of votes usually leaves home. Another thing I wanted to change is to see them actually act on the show. What is Broadway without acting? The last thing to change is the song, the eliminated people are singing at the end. The eliminated Danny always sings the same song and the eliminated Sandy always sings the same song as they leave. As they sing it every week, these songs eventually become annoying. <br /> <br /> I don't admit being a fan of the movie, Grease, but for some reason I'm hooked. This show is very undervalued. It has so many memorable performances and moments.
