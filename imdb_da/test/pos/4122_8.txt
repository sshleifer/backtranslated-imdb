Even after almost 20 years apart, the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost anything. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their feast (1970-1978), including "NIB", "War Pigs" and "Paranoid". <br /> <br /> Also included are invaluable backstage footage with interviews and retrospects in their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. Comments from Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward are just as interesting and exciting to see as the amazing onstage performances. A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans.
