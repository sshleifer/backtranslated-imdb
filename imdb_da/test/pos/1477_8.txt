From the start you will like Sam Elliot's character (Falon): a trustworthy policeman who is especially loyal to his partner. But too loyal and overbearing when he sees his partner dead in an alley because he kills then who he believed to be the attacker before giving a chance to explain. Falon is an alcoholic, and it tends to hover him from self-control, though he manages to focus his attention on finding who really is behind his partner's death. He carries along with a beginner as his new partner (who seems to be too often in movies), but Esai Morales does well in accompanying Sam Elliot, though marvelous pieces begin to fit in, where Morales begins a self-confessed study against Falon; He will primarily find the answers, as Fallon does not give him the whole story and does not like what he finds. There is no last minute to show who the bad detectives are, which is okay; And they are not able to swing Falon into joining them, leading to a dramatic end. Finishes all around, with a touch of humor from Paul Sorvino, the detective's captain. It's a good movie that makes you see it several times; so it qualifies as a - a must see - and a good addition to a movie collection! (Filmed in San Francisco)
