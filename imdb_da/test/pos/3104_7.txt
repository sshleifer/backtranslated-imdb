I have this movie on a collection of cheap B movies. It's not restored, in fact, the sound was hard to distinguish in the first few minutes. <br /> <br /> Initially it was like a typical haunted house movie and feels very much like the predecessor of Clue, Murder of Death, house on haunted hill, etc. About half an hour in the movie, the story takes a really interesting twist - and it goes from being a clich√© melodrama to something completely different and much more entertaining than I had originally thought. <br /> <br /> Check it out, it's very fun, though the long clips and wider shots (and almost missing music score) make it a bit bursting with today's standards.
