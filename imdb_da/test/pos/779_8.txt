Driving Lessons From the author of the critically acclaimed films, Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray, Jeremy Brock brings a touching heartfelt drama with star-played Oscar nominees Julie Walters and Laura Linney and the Harry Potter series, Rupert Grint. The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall, (Rupert Grint), a seventeen-year-old boy held captive in the heart of his religiously neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linney). After his school year, he ends up taking a job with a nice, open-minded and "heavy on the bottle" retired actress Evie Walton (Julie Walters). The couple embark on wonderful adventures from camping to walk around the block for the simple conversations about life. Challenging the dominant mother as well as each other along the way, they develop a beautiful bond that revolutionizes both their lives. The comic elements are flawless and precise, especially from British veteran Julie Walters. Brock uses his unique style to create a notorious and loving nature that first-time directors could only dream. Management comes naturally to Brock as he builds amazing images that break the surfaces and depress the viewer into an abundance of worship and creation. Even the subtle scores of unknown composers Clive Carroll and John Renbourn highlight the tone and the way Brock had no trouble generating. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney always makes her mark in movies as she does as "Laura". The overwhelming and indulgent mother is sometimes unbearable, and with Linney at the helm of it we are excited about that persona. The complexity of her character could not have been more flawlessly portrayed by someone else. Rupert Grint breaks away from "Ron Weasley" and tries someone new. His performance is more responsive than loquacious, but Grint gives us something new to a child's performance and the viewer gets to enjoy it. But standout comes from Oscar nominated actor Julie Walters, who gives "Evie" a life of its own. Despite the fact that the role is clearly a leader, Walters meets better in the supportive category, where I think she can just take home the prize. "Evie" is a mix of "Clementine Kruczynski" and "Mrs. Laura Henderson" with her free spirit and lovable persona. Hopefully, her role will not be unnoticed for this pricing. Driving Lessons is not an "out of this world" experience, but a great fun that every viewer could just kick and learn a little about life, love and friendship comes in the most beautiful colors and sizes. <br /> <br /> Degree: *** / ****
