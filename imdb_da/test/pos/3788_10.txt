In one of Charlie Chaplin's longest short films, he places the little guy in the steps of WWI, bringing his tireless courtesy and endless patience to the life of green life, where troops lived for several months at a time before finally crossing the top to overcome the enemy and usually to their deaths. It takes some of Chaplin's skills as a comedian to do something as boring as trench warfare into such a brilliant comedy, but the irony he uses in the film makes even the most unpleasant conditions very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Like all the best of Chaplin's movies, short films, and otherwise, it is packed with brilliant and memorable scenes, such as the scene where he marks, kills with a piece of chalk on a table in the shooting range and deletes one when he gets his helmet shot off, the scene where he and his fellow soldiers sleep under the water, the opening of the beer bottle and the cigarette lighting and of course the enemy overhalning. All of these scenes are show stoppers reminiscent of the most wonderful Chaplin scenes. This should not be missed!
