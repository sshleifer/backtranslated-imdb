Being announced as the most expensive movie ever made in the Czech Republic, it automatically means that you think it will be glorified and clich√©d (out of fear of the budget). But with a budget of 8 million and half of the film in English, it was not exactly a big budget, high-risk film. <br /> <br /> What we have a great epic narrative centered around the friendship of two people, the younger Karel and the older Frantisek. As pilots in the Czech Air Force, when the Germans invade before the beginning of 2. World War II, they escape the country to England to become a member of the RAF. Their friendship is strained through love for the same woman. But there is a band of friendship that goes beyond being friendly. Their friendship is an elegant metaphor for the attitude of the Czech people and their country. Remember they were not the winners, they defeated the Germans only to be invaded by the Russians. <br /> <br /> Quiet, exciting, exciting, beautiful, sad and luminous this movie is one of my favorite war movies. Most of all, I like the way they goggle on the British in a way that is incredibly loving and gives a great insight into the way the British military fought World War II. Forget the latest US action (Peal Harbor, Spare Private Ryan), this is the best WWII movie for a long time.
