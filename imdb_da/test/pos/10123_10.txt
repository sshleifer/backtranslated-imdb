Cuba Gooding, Jr. will win the Oscar for BEST ACTOR in 2003. And Ed Harris will win for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR. What a beautiful and sharp film it is, but take it with a box of tissue, because if this film doesn't come to you then you have ice water in your veins. It was 1976. The setting was in South Carolina, and the Civil Rights Act was about ten years old. We have a white high school football coach and teacher, Ed Harris. Then there is a black, retarded, frightened but cozy guy, Cuba Gooding, whose greatest possessions, including a radio, are piled into a shopping cart that is also used as his bike. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris has a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained much later in the movie. He gives Cuba the nickname "Radio", and what follows is an absoutely narrative, exciting, exciting exploration of the human soul. <br /> <br /> The movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.
