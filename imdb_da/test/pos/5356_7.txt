What-ho! This one is jolly good. I say jolly well, ol 'chap. Or should I say "ol" bean? My mastery of British terminology is a little dusty. Anyway, my biker boots and I went into this screening without prior viewing experience of Wallace and Gromit. I'm glad to say that my boots and I went out to have made their acquaintance. <br /> <br /> Although not available to adults as Toy Story, W & G still manages to be smart enough to deliver adults with a little humor that will surely hover over the kids' heads without being Too busy to marry on the Were rabbit's belches to have any idea that something is wrong. I strongly suggest that you pay close attention when you see books or words on the screen because there are quick glimpses of sayings that you will miss if you are not aware. My favorite is a book of monsters that refers to Loch Ness Monster as a "tourist trappus." If you've ever been known to say, "I can really refer to Kevin Federline" or if you're just illiterate, you won't just miss these jokes, but you should spend your time learning to read instead. go to movies. Consider this a public service announcement. <br /> <br /> The most impressive aspect of W & G is its clay animation. Thanks to the tedious process, it took five years to finish the movie! According to the press releases, there were some days when the optimal goal was to only do 10 seconds of finished film. People, I sometimes have trouble finding the motivation to stop responding to a handful of emails or adding captions to pictures to my reviews (a point proven by missing images in this review); so I can't even imagine having the necessary patience for it. <br /> <br /> I really like the rough, clear quality of claymation characters. The fact that you can see fingerprints in clay is a nice, personal touch. How can you not be impressed by clay characters that show more expressions and feelings than Paul Walker and Keanu Reeves combined? The Cursed Curse is, as director Nick Park calls it, the world's first vegetarian horror movie that should entertain both children and adults. Rely on (and like a man who trusts in his hackneyed, cool bearded masculinity, I hesitate to use this word) sweet and (oh, I'm not going to use that word either) beloved characters rather than outdated M.C. Hammer references, W & G is evidence that DreamWorks can create entertaining animation when choosing wisdom over the cheap joke.
