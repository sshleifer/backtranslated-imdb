Very touching movies, a great surprise to come up from Brazil, a country that normally exports features on social themes, violence, sex ... Magic realism is a very difficult task and I think João Falcão has done it wonderful. It looks like he's really not going to make a realistic movie far from it. Although many people believe that the movie was adapted from the drama, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to believe that Falcão has been influenced by the series "Hoje é Dia De Maria". The TV series produced by Globo was made after the movie, but aired before ... Unfortunately. The negative point is the photograph, by Walter Carvalho. It seems he doesn't catch or understand what Falcão's concept has created. The story is captivating and universal, despite being in a small, small town in Brazil. It could take place anywhere in the world. A great movie, I highly recommend.
