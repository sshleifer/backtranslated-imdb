This silent and unpretentious Danish film is perfectly executed, written, performed and filmed. It is at best an example of a cinema, and if a person exists who can see BABETTE's FEAST without being touched at a very basic level, they are a person I do not care to know. The story is quite simple. In the 19th century, two older virgins (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) reside in remote Jutland, where they have sacrificed their lives, romantic opportunities and personal happiness to continue their long-term father's religious service to the small flock he served. One of the women's youthful admirers sends them a French woman, Babette (St√©phane Audran), whose husband and son have been killed in France and who have fled their homeland so as not to face the same fate. Although they do not really require her services, the sisters involve her as the girl and the chef - and as the years pass by her wisdom and tireless efforts on their behalf, the aging congregation allows to remain together and the sisters must live in more comfort than they had imagined; Yes, the whole village admires and depends on her. <br /> <br /> One day Babette receives a letter: she has won a lottery and is now a wealthy woman at village standards. Knowing that her new wealth will mean she is returning to France, her sisters want her to be allowed to prepare a genuine French meal for them and the members of their small congregation. The meal and evening it is served is actually an evening to remember - but not for reasons that can be expected, for Babette's feast turns out to be food for both body and soul and is ultimately her gift of love for the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her. <br /> <br /> The movie is extraordinary in every way, meticulously detailed, but not overwhelming in its presentation of them. As the film progresses, we will love the characters in their simple devotion to God and their all-to-human fragility, and the scenes where Babette prepares her feast and where the meal is spent are powerful, beautiful, and incredibly memorable. There have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love, but no one is approaching the simple art and beauty of BABETTE'S FEAST, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity, and which shows food for both body and soul. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
