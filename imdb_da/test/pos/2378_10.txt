Four unhappy women leave bold London to spend an EASY APRIL in a castle on the Italian coast. Elizabeth von Arnim's novel comes alive in this charming little film that beautifully demonstrates the virtues of a literary script and ensemble acting. All the elements come together to produce a film that, although almost forgotten now, still produces a sense of appreciation in the appropriate decision of history. The actresses each release themselves brilliantly. Ann Harding is the free sprouted wife longing for 'wisteria & tranquility' far from the fog of London. Katharine Alexander plays the silent housewife who wants the elegant responsibility of acting as a hostess in the castle. Jane Baxter is the beautiful young noblewoman who temporarily escaped from her throng of male admirers. Jessie Ralph steals every scene she is in as an old lady who only wants to be alone with her memories of the past. <br /> <br /> The men of history are also well-cast. As Miss Harding's husband, Frank Morgan has a rather complicated role as a mousy researcher who has a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer. Reginald Owen, as Miss Alexander's spouse, is wonderfully pompous as a man well-equipped to drill for England (his hilarious attempt to take an English bath in an Italian bathtub is made even more fun with the help of Charles Judels & Rafaela Ottiano who the castle harret servants). Finally, Ralph Forbes, one of the finest forgotten actors of the millennium, is pleasantly eccentric as the ladies, the noisy owner. <br /> <br /> Movie Mavens recognizes an unredited Ethel Griffies who plays the Hampstead Housewives Club holder.
