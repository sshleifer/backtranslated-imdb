This movie gives golf a high mark, it was well-acted and well-aimed. Gives you a view of the story that some non-sports fans will enjoy. The historic factor alone gives it a high rating, the Brookline golf course was really well done. I am in the Northeast and have seen Brookline as a fan and like someone who loves the game. The film was well done at all levels. One should see 5 stars. The action was amazing, Disney has another winner in his big movie bag. If for no other reason does the film look at giving hope and encouragement to young people who may not be able to see the hope in their lives. I will tell you that the setting, while in the late 1800s and early 1900s, is very realistic. Costumes and dialect were also on the mark. In addition to the call of duty for a golf movie. One should watch for fans and non-fans.
