The happiest days of your life show some of Britain's greatest comedy talents of its time in a traditionally farcical and upper-class twit similar way. Generally it is a flute-stop tour of exciting English behavior with girls-only school providing a good setting for the dotty goings-on. Margaret Rutherford, Alastair Sim and - especially! - Joyce Grenfell is great, gives us a lot of laughs as they express their complete horror over what to handle. As the film moves, things become more sillier and sillier with the tour around the school, because the parents are an appropriate peer-to-peer point. <br /> <br /> At this point, I will specifically mention Joyce Grenfell and her wonderful character Miss Gossage. She is so unusually innocent, silly, apologetic and ineffective that she seems to steal the whole movie. She makes the biggest laugh of the movie when she flirts with a male teacher ("Call me sausage!"). While some of the movie is slow or dated, and not always very involved, it still maintains most of its sparkling and scanty romance. Good for a silly, harmless giggle. <br /> <br /> 7/10
