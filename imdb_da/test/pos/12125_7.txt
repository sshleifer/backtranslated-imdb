Out of all the Mafia movies I've ever seen, this is one of the best for many reasons. The plot from Pesci, Cortese and Vincent. The story is one of the best ever (in the mafia genre) as it is realistic. The characters are people that many other people can relate to. This movie is also fantastic, as the dialogue is good. It also has very realistic fights and action scenes. This film also launched a career from Pesci and Vincent. If it wasn't for the success of this movie, the Casino and Goodfellas might not have been as good as they were. <br /> <br /> History 10/10 Trades 9/10 Realism 10/10 <br /> <br /> 10/10 10/10 10/10 <br /> My fave Mafia movie is <br /> <br> 1: Goodfellas 2: Casino 3: The Godfather Trilogy 4: Family Enforcer (The Death Collector) 5: The Sopranoes (I Know It's Not a Movie)
