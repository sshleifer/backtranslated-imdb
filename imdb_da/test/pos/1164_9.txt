It was my late wife's favorite movie. I'm sorry she didn't live long enough to get the video, since I'm sure she would have worn it out. What can we say? A great romantic story and push off of two great men, Raisuli and Teddy Rex. Sean Connery and Brian Keith are good at these roles. But while Connery is his usual sexy sex, it's late Brian Keith who gives us a solid performance like Mercurial Teddy Roosevelt. Back up is provided with Candy Bergen, beautiful in her early 30s, as the kidnapped American widow. Big back-up also comes from the great John Huston as Teddy's besieged SecState, John Hay; Geoffrey Lewis, from the Clint Eastwood movies is great as the hesitant American ambassador, Gummers; The late Vladek Sheybal with his demonic evil star is great as Beshaw and more are given by Steve Kanaly and Roy Jensen whose faces we have seen in several backgrounds. All in all, this is a movie filled with wonderful romance, paying attention to an era far away. Mindless history? Not at all. The issue of great nations pushing less about their own hegemonic interests is as true today as it was then. Too romantic? Not really - certainly not maudlin to any extent. Fun to see? You can believe that. I own the video and will see it again and again. I suggest you do the same.
