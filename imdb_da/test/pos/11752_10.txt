I first saw this movie in the mid 60's when I was a teenager, and it moves me so much, in fact, the closing scene where Han Suyin hears about Mark's death, and then rushes to the hill in disbelief where you then hear Mark's voice says "Give me your hand," and then the image of him disappears, the butterfly with its superstitious meaning, the music, the shattered feelings of love for Han Suyin, just left me to extinguish my heart. I wept bitterly out, my mother and sister looked up and were shocked at my reaction. I just left the room to be alone. Fortunately, I do not respond so much, but I always cry at the end. I love everything about the movie, the music mostly, the costumes of Han Suyin and the location. The beauty of Jennifer Jones and the beautiful William Holden, they were both at their best. I have VHS and DVD of this wonderful movie. I also have two versions of Music & Lyrics by Arthur Newman and Sammy Fain. I also have the book A Many Splendored Thing by Han Suyin. I recommend this movie 100%
