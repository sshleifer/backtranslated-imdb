This is a movie I watched as I was a young girl and never forgot. It is certainly not the best movie ever made, but there is something very special about it that I cannot put my finger on completely. I love it. I am the kind of person who likes everything explained to me and therefore alone makes this movie crazy. <br /> <br /> What exactly is the mysterious witchcraft and what is her relationship with Tom? Why and how did he become a water baby ... why was he raised on the ground? These are issues like these that just eat at me! I thought if I read the book I would get answers, but I just read an article that the book on which this story is based is very different. So I think I never know what the author was thinking! <br /> <br /> I still love this movie and I've recently seen it with my two-year niece. She also loves it, even though she insists on calling it "Baby Water" for reasons unknown to me. She loves the part where he jumps in the water and then declares "I'm clean." (You must understand that my niece is the cleanest 2 year old in the world!) We saw that scene over and over again. <br /> <br /> I'm so happy we can enjoy this movie together! There should be more movies like this one. (But what's with gay seahorse ?? !!)
