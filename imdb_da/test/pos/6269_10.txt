Blademaster is definitely a memorable entry in the Sword and Sorcery category. I found Blademaster with Quest for The Mighty Sword at a store that was attended by mentally handicapped and was very happy to pay 2.00 each for them. Trustworthy sets and costumes, good sword fighting and a beautiful female warrior, Mila make this a comfortable watch. A few problems, however, were many details in the plot that did not fit perfectly, like cave men for one. I didn't understand their purpose. Also this movie could really have benefited from some more monsters. The snake was cool, but I think it's borrowing a bit from Conan. Any primitive kind of movie where someone wins with a hangover is OK by me (see Yor and Battle for Endor). I think Ator is cool! Oh, and was anyone else reminded of Gallagus of the villain, or is it just me? I give Blademaster a 7/10
