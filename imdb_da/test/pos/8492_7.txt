The year 2004 was the year of life with no less than four images that deal with real events, real people, with varying degrees of critical praise. Of the four photos to make it to the Academy Awards at the beginning of 2005 (KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA and RAY), RAY became the big winner of the night when the award went to Jamie Foxx for his portrayal of R & B genius Ray Charles. <br /> <br /> And it was well-deserved even though Leonardo diCaprio came close and Liam Neeson was not even nominated. What made Foxx the winner was that the other two played relatively unclear excentrics, Ray Charles was still making music right up to his death in 2004, and then there was not a soul who did not know at least one song Charles had written . It helped that Jamie Foxx climbed well over the movie - in itself as a weakness and often looks like it would not be out of the way of a television biopic - and his depiction is detailed as it is wild. He has the delicate task of embodying a person down to shades, and when the crisis of Ray's addiction to heroin hits a head, Foxx pulls out of all stops, and it is not hard to imagine that the real Ray actually goes through such a painful trial. <br /> <br /> The low point of the movie is how it consumes a little too much time in detail Ray's relationship with women. Taylor Hackford, like AVIATOR, wants to find out that Ray had this turbulent life, a product of his own demons and his success at a time when he was black and successful, resulting in a large amount of luggage. Of the women, the only thing that succeeds in bringing real life, Sharen Warren as Ray's mother, is. Hers is a difficult role as she is alone on the screen while the child's actor plays young Ray, but her facial and body language is gut-loving, especially at the moment she must give up her maternity leave to get Ray to find her way around the house. Such an intensity of emotion, standing there and watching your blind son crawling through a room and forcing him to have this rude awakening in independence. A beautiful performance and one that should have been recognized. <br /> <br /> A great counterpoint to RAY is the featured music. Anyone who knows R&B enjoys the early recordings of Ray's radio hits as much as his later, who would bring him to the forefront of popular music, and Jamie Foxx almost steals the show as he performs the songs as Ray. It alone will continue, even though the film itself is a little more than a stiff biopic. However, I would have loved it if they would have used their last Adult Contemporary hit from 1993, "Sing my Song for You" in closing credits. After all, it is Ray Charles, a performer who had a hard dedication to his art.
