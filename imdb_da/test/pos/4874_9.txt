The first movie at the Fangoria Festival in Vegas and the most challenging. It's not a movie for everyone. A number of the movies used predictable classic horror formulas to tell predictable stories. This image seemed determined to do its own thing. <br /> <br /> Tom Savini showed some comics as the top villain. He dominated every scene he was in, turning his cape on as if Leslie Neilson plays Dracula. It was great to hear his explanation after the movie. He had such a good sense of humor about the role. <br /> <br /> I was glad I didn't have too many predictions because the movie offered many surprises. The story was fun and profane and unusual. There was much love lavishly on the look. Most importantly, it had a weird edge to it. Unlike many of the films that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror style, it was a movie that used its appearance for a purpose. There were many movies at the Fangoria Festival with bigger budgets, but no one dared to be this different.
