The "Quai des Orfevres", directed by the glorious Henri-Georges Clouzot, is a treasure for treasure because it is one of the best exponents of French film-making in the post-war period. M. Clouzot, who adapts Steeman's novel, "Longtime Defense", shows his genius in the way he puts the story on and in the way he connects all the characters in this deeply satisfying movie that DBDumonteil has pointed out in this forum demonstrates how influential Cluzot was, and how much the next generation of French filmmakers are guilty of the master, especially Claude Chabrol. <br /> <br /> The sharp black and white filmography of Armand Thirard has been superbly transferred to the Criterion DVD we've seen recently. Thirard works with Clouzot and gets the most out of the dark tones and shadows in most key scenes. The music by Francis Lopez, a man who created light music and operetta in France, works well in conjunction with the film, as the action takes place in the world of music halls and night clubs. <br /> <br /> Louis Jouvet, seen as a police engineer, is perfect in that part. This was one of his best screenshots for an actor who was a pillar of French theater. Jouvet well understood the mechanics of the creation of his police visit, who are wiser and can look deeply into the souls of his suspects and ultimately steal the show from the others. In an unreasonable comment from a person on this page, Jouvet's inspector is compared to Peter Falk's Columbo, TV detective. Frankly, and no respect for Mr. Falk intended, it is like comparing a large champagne to a good house wine. Bernard Blier is perfect as the jealous man. Leaves had that kind of face that one could relate to the man who was consumed with the passion his wife Jenny Lamour had in him. Martineau is vulnerable and does not seem rational; He is an easy suspect because he has done everything wrong when he finds himself in the midst of a crime he did not commit, but all proves pointing in the opposite. The other great character in the movie is Dora, the photographer. It is evident from the way she interacts with Jenny where her real interest lies. Simone Renant is tragically appealing as this troubled woman and makes a huge contribution to the movie. Suzy Delair, who plays Jenny, is appealing as a singer who suddenly jumps from blur to celebrity and attracts the kind of men like Brignon, the old laugh. <br /> <br /> The movie is one of the best Clouzot directors during his prominent career and one who will live forever, because the way he brought all elements together.
