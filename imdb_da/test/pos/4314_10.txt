For me, this is a good series. I'm a little disappointed that Ana Lucia and Libby died, but more concerned that Micheal lied to everyone about who killed them. And if anyone can answer this, what are the names of those who apparently were "Henry Gale", he was the leader of the others (or was it Mrs. Clue?) Anyway, if you know his name coolly. Now try to think about what might happen next time they finally do not press the button. Does it hurt the entire DARMA project, and I personally thought it was cool how they had the key thing underground that Desmond used to close the magnet's stuff, yes, and what was the whole meaning of it? I'm just glad they didn't press the button finally, but what happens to the people in the hatch? As Mr. Echo, died John, Charlie and Well Desmond, but what about the others? I think they survived, I forget? Well, it's just my little thing about what I was thinking of this season final !!!
