I must say that this movie was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci movie! I enjoyed it .. it's a sci movie if you want a thriller watch another channel. That's what the scifi lovers want. Excellent produced by one of Sci's best producers Scot Vandiver! OK the special effects were not excellent but what a great cast! Something more money could have been used for effects, but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like this type of movie. Movies like Mission Impossible and Braveheart are good, but it's not Sci movie. Sci fi produces excellent movies like Sabretooth, Alien Hunters etc. Well done .. keep them cuddling out!
