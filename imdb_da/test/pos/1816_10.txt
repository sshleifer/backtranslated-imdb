set aside "I'm so sure" and "completely gnarly" this is one of the sweetest and lively romances portrayed on film. deborah foreman (where is she now?) like julie and nicola's cage that randy is as classic as romeo and juliet, tony and maria, jake and samantha ... you can't help falling in love with them. Plus, the soundtrack - plimsouls, sparks, furs, flirts and of course modern English - is also excellent. For fans of film about young love, I would just recommend the latest movie all the right girls by David Gordon Green.
