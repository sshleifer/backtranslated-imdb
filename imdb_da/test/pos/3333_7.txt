"The Saint Takes Over" stars George Sanders as Simon Templar, also "The Saint" in this 1940's entry into the series. There are also stars Wendy Barrie, Jonathan Hale and Paul Guilfoyle. On board a ship on the way to the US, The Saint meets and tries to make time with a woman (Wendy Barrie) who gives him the brush. Simon arrives in New York to assist Inspector Fernack, who is now thoroughly discredited due to a gangster framework; $ 50,000 was found in his home. The gangster, Rocky (Roland Drew), was obviously not found guilty during the trial and he and his fellows paid the bill for the frame and the lawyer's representation - $ 90,000 in total. Today you need it to defend yourself against a parking ticket. This was a murder rap. Rocky sends his bodyguard, Pearly Gates (Guilfoyle) to the lawyer's house to steal $ 90,000 from the safe. The lawyer catches him with red hand and sends him back to his boss with a message. Seconds later, he is dead. Rocky meets a similar fate. And over and over again - who kills this group of gangsters? Saint must get one of them to talk, so Fernack can be cleared - can he come to anyone before they are murdered? The woman he met aboard the ship appears again and appears prominent in the case. <br /> <br /> Few actors have a way with a line like George Sanders, and his dry look, good looks, smooth voice and depth as an actor perfectly match Simon Templar. Paul Guilfoyle gives some humor like the nervous, milky Pearly Gates, and Jonathan Hale is great as the sometimes enchanted but worried sick inspector Fernack. Wendy Barrie, who appeared in many Saint episodes, is very good as the woman who catches Simon's heart. <br /> <br /> Very fun.
