Critics claim that this movie is one of the worst movies ever. Guards also claim the same. But there is a flip side for that coin. They are wrong, very wrong. It's the most clever movie I've seen in ages ... From the beginning to the end you see a story that is unrealistic. A story that reflects the real world. This movie is like a mirror. You see yourself in a different way that people see you. To really understand the instructor's point of view, you have to see it again. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie ... Try to understand the story (and see the background) ... Listen to the music lyrics ... and smell industrial complexes ... <br /> <br /> This movie is one of a kind. You will hate it (most people do) or you will love it (and fully understand it). <br /> <br /> Ernest Hemmingway once said, "The world is a fine place and worth fighting for". I agree with the second part.
