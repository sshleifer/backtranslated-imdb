It's not often that a TV series grabs me from bats a new chance to download the pilot to Surface had glued me to my seat for the whole episode, after which I immediately went on a fevered search to learn everything I could about this wonderful series. For my chagrin, I found out that it had been canceled after just 15 episodes, despite its strong reviews and extremely favorable reviews. Such a shame. Since then, I've acquired the remaining episodes and found the first 5 or 6 to be among the best TVs I've ever seen. Just fantastic from start to finish, and as another reviewer commented, I LOVED how they ended every episode with a huge finish. I can imagine seeing it every week I would have screamed with excitement and just jailed, desperately waiting for the next episode to be released. I grew up, I always heard it was how early serial movies are used to do that, ending with a huge cliffhanger to get the crowds back into the theater for the next episode. It seems for some reason or another decided the suits to kill this, and apparently the people behind the show have seen the writing on the wall, because after episode 6 things are definitely going to be done. I don't want to say that the episodes are actually BORING, but many of the album elements become a bit more clich√© and I have to say that the final episode really left me cheated. I just wish the show's creators got a fair chance. The * ONLY * second show that left me feeling it was the first season of Stargate SG-1, which just resonated tremendously and felt very "true", soulful and made of the heart. The surface was a great series, and maybe one day a well-preserved TV lover will see all the releases of emotion about the show's cancellation and bring this show back. You can at least hope. :)
