I have loved this movie since I was a young child. I remember the night my mother brought this movie home to me. I loved it and I still do. I think it is very fun and original. There are also some very catchy tunes in this movie. Lou is also a surprisingly good singer. The actors depicting Prince Arthur and Princess Eloise are also fine, but Abbott and Costello are the best. Former heavyweight boxing sensation Buddy Baer, ​​also brother of former heavyweight champion Max Baer is good in this movie as policeman and The giant. He is a better actor than boxer. He had a natural talent. The beginning of this movie is fun, how Lou Costello stays with the car and how he gets into trouble with Buddy Baer. Slapsticket in the house is also good. I especially like the comedy in the Giant's castle. My favorite parts are; the part where Lou climbs the prayer parlor and they all sang as goodbye. Jack sings back to them that he is coming back. Lou Costello is very good at singing. My other favorite part is the part when Jack fights with the Giant. I like Jack to make exploding eggs and when he tries to make the maiden an omelet, they continue to explode. Abbott and Costello are hilarious and the greatest comedians from all the time. This is just one of their amazing movies that I will love and appreciate. The reviews for this movie are not very good and I can't understand why. This is a very good Abbott and Costello movie. I also love how Lou Costello comes back to reality in the end and thinks he's back in the dream when Bud hits him. He starts singing his song and magazines with an attitude that no one will push me around. Very good movie.
