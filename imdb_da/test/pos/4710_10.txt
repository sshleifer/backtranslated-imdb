Lush filmography, beautifully written and edited, John Boorman's Beyond Rangoon is a must-see for anyone interested in world politics and the bow of personal transformation. It blends a personal and political narrative that continues to haunt me and pop up in my eye with frequency. The storyline is poignant, and the inner and outer journeys are carefully and delicately parallel both cinematically and in history. I've watched this movie at least six times, and it's really up to study. It is particularly relevant today, given world events. Check it out, you won't regret it! BTW, NetFlix does not yet carry it, but you can request that they do so.
