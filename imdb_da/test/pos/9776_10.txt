As soon as I saw the "Changi" ad on the History Channel, I knew I would love it. It caught the ANZAC spirit wonderfully - you would die if you didn't have friends in you. The characters in "Changi" were strong and each brought something different in history, and the Japanese soldiers were not criticized, but were depicted as normal soldiers doing what they thought was right, just as the Australians did. Direction, manuscript, acting and attitude were all made wonderful with a clear easy to follow plot. Humor was the soldier's key to survival, and it was great to see a mini-series about war that actually has some kind of humor in it, which is usually hard to do without offending people. From what I have read about soldiers in the Changi PoW camp, this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years that Australian, British, New Zealand, American and Dutch men used. I would recommend this series to anyone, whether you are interested in war or not. 10/10.
