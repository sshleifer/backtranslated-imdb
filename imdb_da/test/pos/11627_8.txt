I have to keep Barney drilled my head every day; Well .. I think it should be reasons. First, I am convinced that our children are not stupid, they are just children, but they know it (my 1 and a half year old son "chooses" what to see) what is lovely or disgusting. Did you see the news? Do you think your kids should know the reality as it is? Maybe .. or maybe not; we (the adults) are responsible for what we want for our children and what they should teach them. A movie of drug dealers? News about massacres in the Middle East? Of course, the kids should know that there is a real life, but ... they are children; Let us give them mercy. What do you want for them? If you want children trained on weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor, impose deadly weapons on them, kill the bill, anime of any manga, tell them santa is a depraved who steps through the chimney directly to offend them. I want illusions for my son (don't confuse me, I'm not saying that Barney and Friends are the best; in fact, the show has many errors, I read other comments, and I agree with most); Perhaps happiness is made by dreams or illusions. At least I will teach him to grow WITHOUT FEAR BUT CAUTIOUS, who learns to think and believe that everything is not serial killers or hijackers, as they are reasons to be worthy of worship. That at least he can be a little happy with his own dreams. So, parents, do not underestimate your children; They know what they want.
