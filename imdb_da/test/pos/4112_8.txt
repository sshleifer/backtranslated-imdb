I was 19 or 20 years old at that time and lived in Salt Lake City, Utah, and I still remember the new dome theater, called the 21st Century Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, big screen and large open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview of a movie. I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and cymbals crash. I loved the interplay between the characters and the filmed outlook. I know Peter Finch and Luv, and Sally had some problems with the loading sponge, but hey, it was a good feeling, feel better about things movies! What I regret is how they cut the meaningful heart out of it, showed the cut version and then called it a flop. I saw the carved version, and I can see that it lost its view on the vision it had in the preview edition. Yes, I win a little on Peter's effort to love through music, but you know I didn't see it that way when I left the theater. when they examined us when we left, I regret any comment I made that might have changed the original. I liked it so and still see it while listening to the music on my LP. Most of my family have heard me sing a lot from the soundtrack and I can use the movie monologues in our game with "which movie is this". I wish a director wound on DVD was available. It's available on VHS, but it's not quite the same. I especially want a full serious master of the ringtone's comments on its origin, struggle and victory. Picky people should leave things well enough alone. Bring it back !!!!
