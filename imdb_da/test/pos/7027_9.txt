Dirty Dancing follows the story of Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Gray) and her family as they spend the summer at Kellerman's Family Summer Camp. We'll see her discover her when she falls in love with the dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with wonderful dancing (hence the title!) some great music and amazing scenery. It handles some tough problems with dignity and grace, and of course (shocking spoiler here!) Has a happy, wonderful, good feeling! You know how it will end from the beginning, but it's really not the meaning here. The point is the journey, a journey that affects every family member. <br /> <br /> It's one of the movies I need to watch when it comes to TV ... remember the fact that I already remember it!
