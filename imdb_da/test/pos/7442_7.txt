This movie was definitely written with FF VII fans only in mind. I am a person who has never played the original game and looked at it with a friend who was a cartoonist. From a visual and technical point of view, this movie is as good as "The Spirits Within", if not better, but from a historical point of view I was pretty lost. A great plot of weakness that stood out for me was the scene where "all" of the children who died of geostigma were brought to the healing "reunion" of the three jenovites. All told that there were about 15 children in total ... Hmmmm ... I thought this Geostigma was a disease of pandemic proportions ... I understand why they did it that way (time, budget, CPU) but it just seemed cheesy after all the explanation on how the bad guys needed to assemble all those who had Jenova cells so Jenova could be reincarnated. The subtitle version we had (some fan sub from the internet) was a beautiful direct translation and therefore surely added to my confusion. <br /> <br /> That made my interest in FF VII, and I spent a few hours on FF VII wiki reading about the main characters and the plot. When I read the advent child's wiki, things made a lot more sense. If you are a video game or a Sci-Fi fan, this movie is a good flick, but as a previous review said, it comes out as a 90 minute battle scene. You never learn any of the characters, and the story just seems to jump from scene to scene without much explanation, although some explanations may just be needed. Thank goodness for wikpedia.
