What you bring to the movie affects your view of it. I brought 30 years in the Air Force to this, and every time I see it, I am moved by the end. Would a 15-year-old who used their lives in jets feel the same way? Yet I can only have consequences for me. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart gives a wonderful tour as - Jimmy Stewart. Considering he was a pilot and an air force reserve general, he probably comes as close to being an expert on how a pilot would act as any living man. One cannot fault his delivery or his action.

Lindbergh has flown without radio communication and has no idea if anyone even expects him. When flying into Paris airport, the uncertainty of the landing area pulls you. What is it below? The changing circles that look like cobblestones or a corn field must make you wonder, is he in the right place? They go over and over and flow past his eyesight until he gets low enough to see that in the Paris night he saw what the city was, reflecting the thousands of people waiting for him to land.
