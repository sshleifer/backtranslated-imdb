Sleeper Cell tries to swim both sides of the pool (terrorism / patriotic Muslim Americans), and it doesn't really do that either. <br /> <br /> I had turned off watching this show for a very long time because I had one that would be too predictable, but after a year in my netflix queue I finally moved it to the front. <br /> <br /> The show is about an undercover Muslim man working for the FBI in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the United States. The undercover agent in the show is actually a Muslim, so we see his conflict / solution between his patriotism and his religious beliefs. Personally, I'd rather have seen a drama about a muslin American family living in the United States, but it is doubtful that an American television channel (cable or network) will ever produce something that shows Muslims in a flattering light. <br /> <I'm not a Muslim, but I have many Muslim American friends, and I can honestly say that none of them are terrorists, and they all love America. <br /> <br /> Sleeper Cell comes close to busting stereotypes of Muslims, but it also focuses on the worse Muslim stereotypes. In the first episode, we see a "gentleman" who is a very poor portrayal of Islam, but in the third episode we see a highly respected moderate Muslim teacher who teaches the viewer that the real jihad is actually a personal struggle. there is no intention of encouraging violence against others. <br /> <br /> If only the moderate Muslim teacher had been the protagonist of the show. <br /> <br /> Americans need to learn a lot more about Islam, Sleeper Cell helps a little, but it comes a long way from giving the American audience what it really needs to know. <br /> <br /> It is said that the show in this show is amazing and the drama is very exciting. If they had only made this show about Islam in America without terrorism, it would have been the first rate.
