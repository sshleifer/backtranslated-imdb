A more classic performance by Maniratnam and his team. They can be proud to show this movie at all film festivals, for it has everything to be called an "all time classic". The war and its impact in Sri Lanka through the eyes of a ten-year-old girl are all about the movie, but the scenes and circumstances will certainly not be what you expect. Madhavan is no wonder that he is one of the best actors in the country who can always add beauty and unique identity to the role he plays and needs real boldness to act as a father of three children, When he is considered a boy's child with a glamorous personality in the industry. Music by AR Rahman makes the film a special for those who love tunes. Above all, the story and the way you tell it is the best movie in recent times.
