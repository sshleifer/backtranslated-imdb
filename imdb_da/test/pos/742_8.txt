I'm not sure what fascinates me about this movie. It is grainy, poorly written, bleached, often ridiculous and in many respects rarely dull (the person I was watching, falling asleep twice.) And yet there is something in this movie that fascinates me, even though I'm not sure what ; maybe the character of Sam, an enormous former patient who was loboted by the former chief physician and who permanently sucks on an ice pope or the wonderfully played physician (I forget her name). <br /> <br /> Anyway, see it and make your own opinion; It has one of the biggest conclusions I've seen in movies.
