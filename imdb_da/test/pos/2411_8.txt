OK, so this is a complete rip off of the first Karate Kid. But I think there can never be too many movies as the first karate kid. There is something about this type of story that seems to apply especially to people like me. You get a general sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself. In this film, Hillary Swank is a special gem as Next Karate Kid. You can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of her. <br /> <br /> Not to say that this movie is not without problems. Unlike the first, Mr Miyagi seems to be a little too eager to get Julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in the fighting. It almost seems like he forgot what his values ​​were from the first movie. One must also have a suspended misunderstanding when examining the monks. The film makes the monks seem to have an overly simplified outlook and does not really explain why they do what they do in the plot line. The bad guys are also a bit dubious, even though they really are haters. I also have a suspicion of martial arts films ending in prom night. So maybe this is not a perfect movie. So maybe it wouldn't be the best movie to rent on a Friday night. But in more ways than one, it is a guilty pleasure. Hillary Swank is just as lovable, and the story, though unoriginal, works. In a genre of movies that seem to be based on nothing but action and violence, this is a fresh breath. Unlike all those Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van-Damme, this is a movie about the spirit and the heart. There are some people who need movies like this, and we take everything we can get. My rating: 8/10
