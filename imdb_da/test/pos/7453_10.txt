Graphics: brilliant, of course. The most amazing things were certainly not given away in trailers. Fighting sequences move extremely fast, but after seeing a few of them, your eyes must be used to it and it doesn't seem so confusing. Cloud has a wide range of swords, and I wish things were moving a little slower so we could only see them because they were each incredibly detailed. Oh, and we'll finally see how to equip Materia ... <br /> <br /> Music: Brilliant too. I was a little nervous about it, since (from what I have seen) Nobuo is not best to write music to go along with action (remember Steal the Tiny Bronco sequence?), But it is brilliant and it fits perfectly. I'm glad I pre-ordered cheese. They changed the lyrics to One Winged Angel themselves, so you won't be able to sing along if you know Carmina Burana Lyrics. <br /> <br /> Plot: The first half of the movie creates things and introduces everyone into a rather complex tapestry, but the other half is almost entirely fighting sequences when all players are in place. I wouldn't call it a weak plot, but it's not as close as obsolete as the game's plot was. I think it's an attempt to avoid trying to overshadow the game, and I think it's a good thing ... the movie is its own device and shouldn't try to translate the original into pure plot. <Br /> <br /> I admit I hoped this movie would bring FF7 to a wider selection of people, but it's NOT a mainstream movie. I would give it only nine stars just because it doesn't even really try to explain something to beginners ... Marlene (at least I think it was Marlene ... sounded like her) gives a little background at the beginning, but it's more of a refreshment than a crash course. But then I realized that this movie is a 10/10, so why should I take out points just because other people might not like it too ... if you've played the game or at least passively familiar with it, You watch this movie. But you don't have to tell me. If you are not familiar with it, go out and buy it, sit there for twenty hours and beat it and then watch the movie ... even if it is without any background, it is still amazingly beautiful. You just don't get any of the inside references ... which make up 50% of the movie (that is, everything that is NOT a fighting sequence).
