This is a movie about passion. The passion it portrays is largely misdirected, even to the leading man. But there is the incredible power in this movie: It shows us that what we believe can be contaminated by nonsense, and even lead us to do things that are destructive - to ourselves or others. In addition, those who attempt to escape from the risk of risk (see the druggy visiting the studio) also run the risk of self-destruction. <br /> <br /> The world needs to hear the announcement of this movie more often.
