I managed to record THE DION BROTHERS, off broadcast TV (with the advertisements) back in the early 80s. I have lent it to many friends, who all agree that it is one of the best B "bandit" movies ever made. One day, while I was going to my NYC apartment, I saw Stacy Keach shooting a scene for her television series, Mickey Spilane. We had a moment to chat, and I told him how much I enjoyed THE DION BROS and considered it a pure classic. He thanked me and said it was one of the best and most memorable movie experiences of his career. He was very kind and sincere, and I was grateful for the few moments he took to chat with a fan. This is a classic to be on DVD.
