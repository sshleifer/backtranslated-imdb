Eddie Monroe's Hooooot. He is a great actor and I could always be his girl. He's so good. I was so sad at the end. I'm not going to ruin the end, but wow. Girls are so bad. His girl was wrong. If Eddie was my husband, I would never respect. The mobsters were scary. The Morality of History is Confidentiality No One. Your friends will hurt you if they can. Oh and Eddie tell your girlfriend that you are mine, she has to move eggs! I would suggest seeing the movie. Why? Becasur, I said so. It kept my eyes on the screen. My sister loved it too, so I'll see it again, because now my friends will see it and it's worth seeing twice. Peace, Happy New Year!
