I first saw this docudrama in the UK in the 1980s and found myself fascinated and so amazed at how such good intentions could go so wrong. Former commentators (who are Australian) have explained the details of the plotted plot better than I could ever have, but I would like to make a note of what lies behind the governor general's British sovereignty. All modern laws that I understand them need an ethical or philosophical root to exist in the first place and to become a law at all. If so, and if it is said that the Conner's / Khemlani clutter had been created (where many businessmen / millionaires had been served by Khemlani, presumably without complaint), then the labor government could have been victims of "capture" as a whole surely should have been investigated by the governor general as or until he could see that the budget stopped was a genuine result of Whitlam's fecklessness, and NOT deepened the capture, sponsored by 'person or person's unknown'! If that is the case, Kerr really did not have to refer to the law because fiscal matters override everything, royal power borders on unfairness; The implications of any Commonwealth country are that "fiscal policy" literally speaks and that any person or organization has Carte Blanche to break any other rule, physical or mental, as long as they have control over purse strings in the end!
