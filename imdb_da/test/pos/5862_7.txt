Barbet Schroeder's "Murder by Numbers" with Sandra Bullock is solid work, but not very convincing. I am a great Sandra Bullock fan and she is effective here as a judicial investigator Cassie Mayweather who is not very sympathetic and also a broken person. However, there is a sense of secession inherent in the history structure. It's about the perfect murder done by two spoiled sociopath teenagers, Richard (Ryan Gusling), who is the cool, and Justin (Michael Pitt) who is the sympathetic geek. Basically, Richard and Justin kill a young woman because they have nothing better to do on a school night. They are very clever and very arrogant, which is usually not a bad thing, but it just doesn't work here. Tony Gayton's script does a good job of explaining the investigation of a creepy murder, and that's really the numbers. We have these two punk children flaunting their superiority and we just want them to fall. <br /> <br /> This is not a major exploration on the dark side, such as Schroeder's "Reversal of Fortune" on Claus von Bulow. There are interesting turns in "Numbers". The film is not so much a thriller, but rather a character study by Cassie. Sandra Bullock balances Cassie's bravado, her fear of letting people get into her and her secret past. Bullock brings courage and strength to a suffering character. Her partner and kind of love interest, Sam (played by Ben Chaplin), is more of a plot unconcealing than a real character. Although Chaplin makes it confusing, very admirable. The other nice touch is having Richard and Justin involved a strange sexual attraction. The most interesting thing about "Numbers" is Pitt and Gusling. <br /> <br /> There are many entertaining twists throughout the movie. Everything is done very competently. I watched the movie a week ago, and in retrospect I like it a little more than I did when I saw it. But it's just not inspired work. Sandra Bullock and Barbet Schroeder deserve much better, and so do we.
