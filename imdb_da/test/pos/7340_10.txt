Gymnast (2006) was written and directed by Ned Farr. Dreya Weber portrays Jane Hawkins, a former world-class gymnast who was severely injured and now serves her as a certified massage therapist. <br /> <br /> The promotional material makes you think that plotted hinges around Jane's unfortunate reunion with a former teammate. Although this meeting is taking place, this plot line is secondary to the main plot involving Jane, her husband and a professional dancer named Serena (Addie Yungmee). The two women develop an action of the type performed by Cirque de Soleil. The two complement each other - Jane is more experienced with heights and has a tremendous upper body strength. The Serena is more elegant and artistic, although of course it is also capable of incredible physical performance. The film works because we can understand how Jane would turn to Addie, who is caring and compassionate, while Jane's husband has taken her for granted in their long-standing marriage. <br /> <br /> Both women are incredibly fit and athletic, and Dreya has the lean body and well-defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts. They really do their job, and the results are so great that we can really believe they would be a success in Las Vegas or anywhere they traveled. <br /> <br /> The sexual tension between women is obvious and the situation becomes even more complex when the action requires them to kiss while they are suspended in the air. A woman with a negligent husband and an attractive woman partner creates an explosive situation that is not solved in a neat and tidy manner. Of the six films we saw at Rochester NY Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival, we thought this was the best. It will work on DVD and it is definitely worth searching out on large or small screen. NOTE: Stick to the credits!
