I also saw this at the cinema in the 80's and have never forgotten it, even though I've never seen it again anywhere. <br /> <br /> I don't know if I saw it now, it seems to be dated, but remember the story and compare it to some of the horrible modern movies I've seen on Zone Horror I should think of It would be very good. <br /> <br /> I still remember his coffin sliding out and opening up and all the dead bodies being revived and the blue lightning. Having seen hundreds of horror movies and still remembering this, it must be good.
