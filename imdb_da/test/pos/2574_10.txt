If you want to watch a movie of nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively precise revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw feeling going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music, a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech that transforms the film. Look for a final scene that is an unexpected proof of a wounded person healing. Perhaps we, who wonder why we are leaping into the abundant profane, will learn that love can be placed above the loins of the heart. Follow the rhythm of the pumping pounding to where love is sacred.
