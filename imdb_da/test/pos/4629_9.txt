Well ... what to say. <br /> <br /> I think I'll start with an announcement. I've been crying 4 times in my life. sometime when my father died, twice because of a girlfriend in high school and at the end of this movie. This film deals with the real confrontational issues of 6 schoolchildren, forcing them quite uncomfortably into the open world view. I have never seen a movie dealing with the human emotional state as well as this. Everything from incest to incontinence is covered here, and I doubt many people are safe from the chain of familiarity with at least a few scenes. It starts with a suicide. at 14:37. So without telling who it was that died, the story begins to be told from the beginning of the day. It follows the life of 6 schoolchildren until noon. 14:37. It is exchanged and edited with personal interviews by the 6 teenagers, letting you know all about their lives. their love, hate, dreams, desires, secrets, shame, false trust, self-suffering, corruption and arrogance. The overall result is a kind of "whodunnit" that attempts to detect the suicide identity before it is revealed at the end of the movie. without spoiling anything I must let you know. Don't feel cheated by the end. It contains a very important lesson. <br /> <br /> And now a warning. This movie is certainly not for the faint hearted. Many people actually went out of the cinema halfway through when I saw it. Offended by some of that content. Or maybe it is sometimes difficult to meet the cold, hard truth of reality. This is what high school is like for many people. I'm sure most would agree.
