I honestly want to give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to compensate for the 5 pages of imbecile, unjustified 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all the plays are good to very good (even Mrs Diaz, who is completely out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, but plays well.) The sets are perfect and cinematography is consistently scary. It is a good moral game and there is * no * reason to explain the origin of god / supernatural being / alien / whatever is "running the show" so I'm glad the movie isn't trying. It is really irrelevant to the story, which is relatively long but quite convincing and summed up quite satisfactorily at the end. <br /> <br /> Before you decide on this movie is horrible (or really something under a ~ 7.5) read some of dozens of 1-star "hated it" reviews, there are abundance of spelling mistakes, lack of punctuation and capitalization, and youth criticism. Maybe the trailer was misleading or something - I didn't see it - but some of these reviewers apparently expected Terminator 4 or Saw 5 (a reviewer actually compared this movie to Saw! How totally inappropriate and independent!) <Br /> <br /> They most of these reviews are read as you-tube comments - according to these "critics", this movie is confusing yet for predictable, not enough action, but there is too much to go on, for smart yet too stupid, explains too much, but leaves too much inexplicable ... oh - and that's apparently a "waist (sic)". Consider the quality and source of reviews before taking them to heart. I fear that these 1-star children failed to understand the phrase "altruism coefficient" and were therefore totally incapable of understanding the premise of the film (despite claiming to "get it" just before they explain how confusing It was!) If you know what these two words mean, you will have no trouble understanding (and enjoying) this movie. <br /> <br /> I really wish there was a reviewer reputation system here so I could be sure to ignore the rating of anyone who gave this movie 1 star forever. See it yourself and enjoy the good presentation of an interesting couple who take an interesting moral "test" and face the consequences. It's a good time, in my opinion.
