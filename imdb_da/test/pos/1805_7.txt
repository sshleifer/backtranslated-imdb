I've seen this movie quite a few times, and every time I see it, it gets more fun and fun. Perhaps the lack of research into Nicolas Cage's character is 'punk' persona or just the cheesiness factor, because it was such a typical eighty-four movie ... but it's a sweet love story with extremely fun and unique characters. I think it's right up there with "Fast Times" and "Weird Science" (quintessential eighties flicks!)
