good job. That's how I would describe this animated Scooby-Doo adventure. It's so far the best of the animated Scooby movies I've seen. I liked the story. I thought it had a depth to it. The movie is also well paced.it won't be boring for a moment. It also has an interesting group of characters (besides Scooby and Shaggy and the band, of course) plus, the movie was a real blast.I have fun watching it. I also liked the great Scottish music. It was very catchy and contagious. Of course, we know that Scooby and Gamg will solve the mystery, but it's still fun to get to that point. The animation is also pretty good for this movie. love it if they did a 3D animation Scooby adventure, but we just have to wait and see. For me, the Scooby-Doo and the Loch Ness monster is a 7/10
