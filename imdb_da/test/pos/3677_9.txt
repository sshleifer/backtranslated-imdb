I quote under the words of my favorite proprietor, Paulo Coelho, to comment on this film. <br /> <br /> "When you really want something, the whole universe gathers to help you achieve it" <br /> It's too easy to forget who we really are, and what we want to do in life. Because there are always too many comments and advice about us to tell security. I had almost forgotten what passion wanted. Despite the adventure taking me out of the security zone, I really think the fear is just the price I have to pay for the upcoming brand new journey in life. Thanks for inspiring me with this wonderful story. It is the blessing for me to realize what unconditional love is. It is the most treasured love from the light of the soul.
