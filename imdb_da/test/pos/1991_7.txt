"We both stumble together in this unformed world, whose rules and goals are largely unknown, seemingly indelible or even possibly non-existent, always on the verge of being killed by forces that we do not understand." Then Ted Pikul says in the movie. As for some people, life sums up, and 'eXistenZ' is another movie about existence. What is real and what is unreal and how to tell the difference. Or not. The film's last line is amazingly ambiguous. <br /> <br /> The movie seems like a shaggy dog ​​story (it has a really shaggy dog ​​in it), but it takes you on an interesting trip full of provocative Cronenberg touches that make you look at amphibians game pods, fish, spines and bones in a new light. Some bits are pretty icky. It takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called 'GASSTATION' and a Chinese restaurant called 'CHINESE RESTAURANT' 'film has an exciting texture that is leagues away from your usual big budget science fiction movie. You can read many things in the movie and it pays to see more than once. <br /> <br /> The main actors are Jude Law, which is ok and Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is fantastic. Some roles do not fit this very talented actor, but when she has a good role like this, she is unmatched. Her unconventional beauty and fascinating voice fit the part of Allegras. (Looks good in a short black skirt as well.) There are other well-known actors, but they don't get much to do. It looks good, sounds good, and a Howard Shore score complements the movie very well. Cronenberg may be Alfred Hitchcock from the sci-fi / horror genre. No matter what movie he is making, he is always worth watching.
