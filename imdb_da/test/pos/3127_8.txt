A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross the land on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford because it lacks big stars. Johnson gets top billing, but his is basically a supportive role, though he and Carey work well together. Dru has had a little to do other than give the interest of love. The best performance is given by Ford's favorite Bond, who plays the Mormon leader. In fact, this role helped him play a leading role in the long-standing TV-Western "Wagon Train" before his relentless death at the age of 57. Because it was beautiful movie, Ford considered this one of his favorite movies.
