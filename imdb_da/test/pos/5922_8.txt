Billy Wilder continues his strong run of film in the 1950s with a biopic by Charles Lindbergh, the young American pilot who became the first man to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1927. Jimmy Stewart plays Lindbergh and while he may be a little too old for that, he still brings the sincere warmth and confidence required, as well as his trademark down-to-earth goodness, which makes him an iconic movie star. Wilder sticks firmly and balances the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what Lindbergh was against when he decided to take this challenge. It's certainly not his or Stewart's best work, but it's a gem of a movie. It lifts your spirits with the plane and makes you proud to be American. Overall, it's just plain good.
