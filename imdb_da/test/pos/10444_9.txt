As I said in the other comment, this is one of the best teenagers from all the time and one of my personal favorites. For me, this movie is the second best teen movie ever. second only to the breakfast club. The last American virgin is also perhaps the most honest teenager movie all the time. It is undervalued, and virtually an unknown film for many people. It comes on TBS maybe once a year, but sometimes longer. The first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a couple of honest scenes. then the other half is honest and most of it is serious. with only a few comic scenes. It is in my opinion the best soundtrack of all time. I've never heard these many good songs in a movie before. There are 4 love songs in this movie, which I think are some of the best love songs in history. the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is virgin. HES in high school who has a few best friends. his two friends are sex-sarved teens. The first half of the movie is largely sexually misadventures. it is very fun. Gary is in love with the new girl in school. He later finds out that his best friend goes out with her. he also cheats on the page. you can feel love gary has for this girl very much. You can feel it even more in the second half. gary's friend turns out to be a crib. but his other friend is pretty cool. the movie shows how many people there can be. You can relate to a lot of this movie. The plot sounds like your typical teen sex comedy. But it's so much more than that. It's a very honest movie. It is also very 80ish that I love. If you love the 80s or grow up in the 80s, rent this movie. but there may be some people who do not like the 80s, but still like this movie. I first saw this movie back in 1987, I think. it is very entertaining and very fun. It combines very touching moments with very fun moments. it is an undervalued gem! I have the movie. I love it! I give the last American virgin *** 1/2 out of ****
