A short time history. The cosmological content of this documentary is fascinating, the mind evokes and the man ... brilliant. But I had a hard time enjoying this documentary. <br /> <br /> The way family members and professors are interviewed feels so unnatural. These members were interviewed on specifically built sets and were instructed uncomfortably. For the most part, their accounts came across as being very traded and sharply directed. The (deliberate) lack of questioning manipulates the given information into a very hard and impersonal format. <br /> <br /> I don't know who is responsible for the interview, but they did a terrible job and took away from the viewing experience. All in all, it is still a fascinating documentary industry worth seeing if only for the interesting concepts presented.
