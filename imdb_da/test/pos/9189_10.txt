I was not sure to get this movie on DVD because I really do mind people making black and white movies in the 21st century, but I ended up buying it anyway. I still don't understand why it was black and white, but that's the only negativity I can see about the movie, and it's certainly a perfect example to see the final rise of the Brazilian cinema. Not everyone can understand a movie like this, but it is quite rewarding for those who do. Unlike O Homem Que Copiava, surrealism fits well into this movie, and the play is at least as good as one or other successful Brazilian films such as Bicho de Sete CabeÃ§as, Cidade De Deus, Brava Gente Brasileira, etc. br /> <br /> My only hope is that this gem will not be offended and raped by a crappy Hollywood remake. It's great to see how these guys use zillions of dollars and still can't make a movie that is 1% as good as this may be cheap cheap. <br /> <br /> Bravo to the whole crew! 10.10
