This was a very energetic and well-played show. I saw it back in 98 and my friends and I still joke about it. Every time I see it, it's always as fun as the first. I also love the way everyone can relate to it in their own particular ways. I look forward to seeing more of John's own scripts and productions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can't find it anywhere for sale, and I've done a lot of looks. If anyone knows a website or store to refer me to, I really appreciate it as I also see his other live performances. Send me a message if any of you have information on the subject. Thank you.
