This is a somewhat anti-war movie that has been ignored for too long. The time is Thanksgiving in 1972. The place is a typical suburban home somewhere in Texas. The oldest son has just returned from Vietnam and he has a hell of time to adapt to the life he had left behind. And the family doesn't know how to deal with the problem. I honestly don't think I'm exaggerating when I say this is one of the most heartbreaking war movies I've seen. The funny thing is that there are only a handful of fighting sequences throughout the movie. Most of the story takes place in a house within a few days. But the kind of war that takes place in this home is as intense as any real battlefield action. The film does something that is hard to achieve; Estevez and his team have somehow created a movie that highlights the entire Vietnam experience. And considering the similarities between Vietnam and the current invasion of Iraq, the movie is surprisingly relevant. Estevez does a magnificent work with material. He gets a lot of help from a hand-picked throw. Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates in particular are amazing as parents. A really moving movie. Highly recommended
