I had fun looking at Femina Ridens a few mornings back, a little hungover. For the most part of the movie, it is basically a two-handed driver who shows games and strange relationships by the crazy doctor Philipe Leroy and amazing Dagmar Lassander. I had seen her before in a couple of Fulci movies that died cruel deaths, but here she is young hip and pretty. The movie is pretty predictable and certainly mild on the exploit front, but entertaining the whole is also due to its wonderful colorful kitsch feel. The set design, music, lighting and movies are all classic late sixty Italian style, a surrealistic feast for the eyes and ears, and although the general thread of the plot is not too difficult to predict, there are more than enough unusual events and observable bizarre sights and sounds to keep things interesting throughout. Both leaders are pretty good, and it shows that Dagmar Lassander really is really good. The music, by Stelvo Cipriani, is also very suitable for the pictures. Director Pierro Schivazappa has come up with quite a cracker here, but it's not perfect. Although it is very appealing, there is little substance here and the utilization elements are about as mild as possible. I think it gives it a kind of charm and innocence, but I can't help thinking that the subject could have done with more sleaze, more threat, that kind of thing, especially since it's pretty easy to find out what will happen. This I suspect is a bit pointless for stronger exploitation fans and certainly not for people who want sex or much nudity. It's more of an easy, fun pop art affair, lovable but insignificant, like a whirlpool. Recommended mainly for those who are happy for the 60s, Dagmar Lassander, or cute set designs.
