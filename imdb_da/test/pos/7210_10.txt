If you've never been "Tromatized", this is the Troma movie to see first. Fantastic plays, supercharged soundtracks and bust-a-gut humor fit perfectly with Troma's unique storytelling and specialty. Despite deviating from a word to the word story of Romeo and Juliet, it is unique that it is closer to Shakespeare than the overdone music video with DiCaprio and the Danes. I assumed I had seen the ultimate Shakespearian comedy when Moonlight Casting re-reviewed Shrew's Taming, but nothing comes close to Tromeo and Juliet. I highly recommend the DVD version, which includes another audio track with director Lloyd Kaufman, who is as entertaining as the main track.
