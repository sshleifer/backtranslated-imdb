This movie was very different from the previous movies and I had to wonder, "Where's Ralph Macchio?" he could have been involved in the plot somewhere like Myiagi's old friend, who teaches Julie what he already knows, so Myiagi can come together and add something more! Macchio could have been the love interest for Julie in this movie! Never mind! <br /> <br /> On a serious level, I enjoyed this movie because it involved teaching a teenage girl to do karate, and her feelings are very different from what Daniel was. Julie is much more wild than Daniel was and needs taming, something Myiagi finds very challenging; she is a pretty troubled girl and a rude, unpleasant guy! It was very satisfying to see the transformation in Julie as she warms up to Myiagi and gets to understand more about Karate and her life in general. We can all learn a thing or two from Myiagi's witticisms!
