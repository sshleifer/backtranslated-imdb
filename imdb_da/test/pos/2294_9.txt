I agree with BigAlC - this film actually prepared me for many of the cultural differences and practices before I went to Japan for a year in 1993. Tom Selleck does a great job here as always, and the movie is very humorous and educational. I am a big fan of Tom Selleck, and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part, so the movie becomes alive in a way I can't imagine another actor pulling out. <br /> <br /> This movie featured some first-rate Japanese actors and it was very entertaining to watch them as they interact with Selleck - I can imagine the fun he had during the movie's actual movie - Japan's great place to Go, whether you want to party, watch or just try to take it all.
