It's bad for Ya really shows more of George Carlin's talents. He is really still as sharp as a tack. It's a shame that we lost him in the past year, but his comedy will continue forever. This stand-up special is literally one of the funniest I have ever heard a comedian perform. Even though he makes fun of little children, it just makes you laugh the way he says some things. It is true that Carlin can literally do something that seems unfunny and make it one of the funniest things you've ever had and will ever hear. I really enjoyed this stand-up especially from Carlin and recommend that those who liked this check out more of the George Carlin's stand-up.
