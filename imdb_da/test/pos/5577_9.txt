I think FARSCAPE is the best scifi since Babylon 5 and is one of the best sci-fi TV series from all the time (ranking up there with Dr. Who, Blake's 7, Red Dwarf, MST3K and the aforementioned B5). I find the characters and races in Farscape are much more interesting and imaginative than the typical "people-with-birthmarks" found in many series. The effects are quite good and the stories engage. Despite the lack of the majority of season 2 and some of season 1, I find the character development very well done.
