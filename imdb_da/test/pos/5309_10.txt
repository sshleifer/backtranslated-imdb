This confuses me with critics and their opinion. I usually take in what the critics say about a movie, on most occasions, before I see a movie. <br /> <br /> But I saw this without knowing about it. mainly because of the casting. Kevin Spacey and Don Cheadle are two of the most recognized and in my opinion the best actors are alive. And Ryan Gosling is also on a fast rising journey up there. His reality and humanity, which he radiates in most of his depictions, really makes the audience believe in the character and what happens to him. It's really my favorite actress in my generation. I have always found jena malone pretty cute, ever since donnie darko, and if she chooses to continue to make similar roles, then hi i don't complain. <br /> <br /> Back to my point. this movie really moved me. I thought so. the actor was top class. as one would expect. the actual movie left the audience with the ultimate purpose of a good movie; reflection and reflection following the final credits roll. I think I'll have to see it again to decipher how this movie was criticized. I know their reviews need to be taken with a pinch of salt. at least I know now.
