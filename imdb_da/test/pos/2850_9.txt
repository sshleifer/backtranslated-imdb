I was greatly impressed with Betty's nurse all the way through. It has a large ensemble of characters, an original plot, and an end I should have seen, but not and draws on your heart cords. If there is any thing about this movie that made me most, it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are big and it warms my heart to see that Rock is not going to make crappy Big Hollywood ticket like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is always the man, really there should be no need to criticize his work anymore. Hell, kiss the girls were observant with him in it. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellwegger does the best she can with her role, and Kinnear is good as her occupation. Cute movie with a nice touch of free violence in it to satisfy the blood flow of the cock. 9 outa 10 <br /> <br />
