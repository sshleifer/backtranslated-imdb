Small Spoilers will follow. <br /> <br /> This movie is even more strange and unconventional than "second-floor songs". There is no main character we follow around. There is no "plot" in the conventional way. There is no emphasis on a happy end. There is no crowdpleasing. In other words, Roy Andersson is back with revenge. Instead of falling back on the convention and fixed formula, Roy Andersson concentrates his film on an idea. I don't want to go into what that idea is, but even if you don't "get it", I promise you will see the greatest visual depth ever set for film. The majestic scenes from "songs" bleach in comparison here. A work with visual splendor. <br /> <br /> Please be kind to your fellow man, because "we are the living" and only you and I have the power to change our lives. It was certainly what I thought when I saw the last scene in the movie, with the inhumane bombers flying over the city in the movie to take our lives away. <br /> <br /> And of course don't forget to watch this movie when it gets a limited release near you. This is one of the movies that actually has the power to make you a better person, like the Sica's "Bicycle Thieves". A very warm and humanistic film.
