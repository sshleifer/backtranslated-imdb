Kirk and the crew visit a federal colony on a remote planet rich in mineral resources. The devil in the dark is Horta, a very unusual silicon-based way of life that tunnels through solid rock. Horta has killed miners and it has been decided to be destroyed. But how? <br /> <br /> It is difficult to continue this review without writing a spoiler, so instead I concentrate on the technical aspects of the episode and touch on the themes. The special effects are ok, but many of the scenes with Horta look a bit absurd. The action is pretty average for TOS. Some of the miners are a little awkward. Nimoy has the most difficult role in everything in Devil in the Dark, and he pulls it well. <br /> <br /> Why is this still a favorite of mine? <br /> <br /> Devil in the Dark is truly an anthropological and ecological moral game disguised as an adventure. More than many episodes of this great television series, it brings home the importance of maintaining an open mind and at least some degree of empathy towards others. Plus, it involves one of the most interesting, if not likely, plot phrases in the original series. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
