Ruthless's evil warlord Samanosuke (extremely played for the hateful hilt of Yutaro Gomi) violently abuses the peaceful residents of a small village. The giant stone statue Majin eventually destroys Samanosuke and his evil minions. Director Kimiyoshi Yasudo and scriptwriter Tetsuro Yoshida give the compelling story all the power and simplicity of an old, old legendary folklore: there is a very strong sense of an ancient time and distant place (it is specifically set in feudal Japan), the good guys are noble and appealing, while the bad guys are really unpleasant and abominable, occasionally appalling swordsmen staged with great skill and gusto, the special effects are fine and impressive, the serious tone and the steady pace never falls in a moment, and Majin's last wheel ramp of wild Destruction is extremely lively, exciting and more than a little scary. In addition, the amazing elements of the story are given great credibility by being solidly grounded in a permeable, dark, hard and greedy world. This movie serves bonus points to portray Majin as more of a brutal and frightening force of angry revenge rather than a pure spirit of absolute good. Veteran composer Akira Ifukube delivers a typically rich, robust and exciting score. Fujio Morita's sharp, moody cinematography also affects the bull's eye. The talented cast gives all admirable sound and sincere performance, with particularly commendable work by Jun Fujimaki as the bold, protective Cogenta and Tatsuo Endo as mediocre henchman Gunjuro. Highly recommended.
