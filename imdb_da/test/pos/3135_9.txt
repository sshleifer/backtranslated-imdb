One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No big stars, but Ben Johnson shines mostly everything he sees, and here he gets a rare lead as a title character. Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon eldest leading his people west. John Ford's actor actor, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provides ample support, as well as annoyed silence James Arness, a member of the forbidden Clegg clan, who joins the lorry. The Mormon track in Utah was one of the most demanding and demanding companies ever to be implemented. We can't really feel it, but we see trials that have to overcome by pioneers on the west road; river crossings, long stretches of dry, waterless desert, meetings with Indians and the like, all set to glorious song by the pioneer sons. The Mormons actually dug parts of the track with picks and shovels as depicted in the film. My biggest regret is that it was not made in color, but I think there is a colored version. Incidentally, the scabies mentioned in various scenes are called Fisher Towers, located near Moab. Recommended view.
