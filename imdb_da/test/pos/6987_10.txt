I saw "In Pitch Black" on t.v. and then I had to see this. I have to say I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> Not only has David Twoy's style improved since he wrote "Critters 2", this film underscored Vin Diesel. Well, he was in "In Pitch Black", but here he was horrible, scary and intense. I haven't seen charisma like that since Schwarzenegger in the 80s. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough, but it's the characters that make this movie interesting. Then there was what happened to the woman leader. Unexpected. The dark humor helps the movie move together, the effects are not great, but when Riddick fights the alien ... all my complaints blew out. <br /> <br /> Diesel has not done a lot since this movie, which I would like to break, but I look forward to the sequel.
