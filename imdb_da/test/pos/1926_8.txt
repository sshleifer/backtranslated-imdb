"Ideas are dangerous." Comment from an interview. <br /> <br /> DVD Rating: B + / 4 out of 5/8 out of 10 / Worth having time. <br /> <br /> A great story for adults / teenagers, but not for kids. None of the stupid violent crime stuff so often confused by Hollywood these days as "quality work." And it can be used as a trainer movie about what the actual vessel's preparation is about, or not about, before "sailing the seven seas". The movie starts a little slower to develop the story that most documentaries do, but when it pulls the viewer into the saga, the emotions begin to percolate in the head! Emotions include anger, sadness, and disbelief. Honor: late 1960s. <br /> <br /> Being solo around the globe is dangerous, is not surprising. Surprisingly, all the terms that viewers would not expect. It's not your average group of guys in a sailing race! Each boat was different as permitted by the rules of the race. Each solo sailor had different levels of ability as permitted by the rules. There were well-known sailors among them and a few not so well-known. One was considered a mysterious man as no one seemed to have any knowledge of his ability at all. Each boat was allowed to depart at will as long as everyone was on a particular date. And of course it was before modern electronics that allowed sailors to communicate with the shore about evil storms, etc. <br /> <br /> Actual video and audio recordings are distinguished between interviews with family members and others involved. The interviewers' mood is always gloomy despite the years gone by. The main character Don, is the attention and how his journey relates to those whom he not only wanted to beat, but, due to the circumstances of his own creation, had to strike. He had to win. The story was about what that circumstance did for his life when he moved south west across the Atlantic over a year's time alone on the water. <br /> <br /> Do not see the "Special Features" section of the DVD when the movie is finished. The whole thing is not fully understood without seeing 'bonus' things. <br /> <br /> Finally, once you've seen everything on the DVD, you'll probably just shake your head and spread, "wow." And remember why history has been alive for the past 40 years. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: Do not see the "Special Features" section of the DVD when the movie is finished. A sailor who was returning to England after bypassing the globe decided on the run that no, he was going to another spin, and the movie counts his spouse's views on that decision. The opposite story unfolds like another sailor who wants the race to allow two on board so that he could take his wife together and their images show a very warm union between them. The interview with a burley ex paratrooper who actually had ROWED a boat across the Atlantic with a friend before the solo sailboat was incredibly fun when he described, not even knowing how to sail and who thought the bad things were with him was normal. 'For many people, setting sail in the open sea may be a romantic adventure without accident. Aren't you one!
