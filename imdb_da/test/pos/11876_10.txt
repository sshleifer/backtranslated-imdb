Bringing Philip Larkin to life in a way worthy of the greatest beliefs all the time, and not just those measured by popularity. It shows a strong portrayal of Larkin's life as the greatest unrecognized poetry in his era - which is exactly how he would have liked it, such was his contempt for cankers and medals. It dramatically exposes the red beauty of Philips' observations of our relationship to our own mortality and puts it in a way that apparently has missed the great philosophers. For anyone interested in deep observations of our relationship with life, love and death, this is a must.
