I didn't know much about this movie that went into my roommate who penetrated me into it. I was so pleasantly surprised! The ground really grabbed my attention and kept it, and the characters are generous and realistic. The play is very wise and fun, and the cast does good things with it. And the best part is that they managed to be entertaining without explicit sex or violence! If this movie comes anywhere in your area, you really have to see it - stand up for this little movie, it's worth it!
