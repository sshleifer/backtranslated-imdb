As with FOOTPRINTS (1975) I became aware of this one by accident: it was mentioned in a review by THE LIBERTINE (1969), which I examined when the film came up on Italian TV at the end of the night as being in a similar vein; Incidentally, I missed the screening of THE LIBERTINE (although I bought it via the same channel later), but managed to watch the movie using a rental of the English-run R1 DVD during my stay in Hollywood at the end of 2005 / early 2006 Considering the enthusiastic reviews for that, I was struck by THE LIBERTINE - too luminous in nature for what was essentially a serious theme (the sado-masochistic relationship between a young couple)! To be honest too much of the time, I was afraid that the FATHER WOMAN would go exactly the same way ... but was subsequently abundantly redeemed by a wicked (if not exactly unpredictable) last twist. <br /> <br /> Films relate to the free influence of social attitudes and dazzling creative art widely used in this era: a prominent philanthropist (Philippe Leroy) invites a female journalist (Dagmar Lassander) to his fashionable home for the weekend; It turns out, however, that he is a misogynist, who distrust all members of the opposite sex and would rather dominate (or even kill) them! Therefore, in the first half of the story, we see the heroine enduring pain and humiliation in Leroy's hands (including being forced to love a dummy in his own image!) ... until the tables are subtle, but surprisingly she turned: she did not release only himself from his control, but teaches him that man and woman can exist harmoniously - except that Lassander also follows his own personal agenda !! <br /> <br /> The wires are completely cast, and the film itself is often dark comic to them in the mood; In addition, it is strongly supported by a typically breaking "Euro-Cult" score (from the ever-reliable Stelvio Cipriani) and the imaginative - equal look (the giant structure depicting the lower part of female form with a steel trap where its sexual organ should Be it seems to be from Freud: On the other hand, this plug was prominent in still images I had seen earlier from THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN ... but it hardly records in the real movie!). Other bizarre touches include the preposterous radio program "Sexual Aberrations And the Stars" and an idyll of a Leroy's family castle complete with secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarfish man. One of the highlights is so easily Lassander's erotic dance almost in the key - an episode that actually spies on Leroy's 'humanization'; In the end, the two characters have a "showdown" in the latter's pool - entertaining set for a spaghetti western-type theme! <br /> <br /> In the long run, the film will appear as subordinate to the similar but much more extreme contemporary Japanese masterpiece of Yasuzo Masumura BLIND BEAST (1969). Finally, it is worth noting that THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN was distributed in the United States by filmmaker Radley Metzger's company Audubon Films; He even wanted to use his production designer (Enrico Sabbatini) for his own CAMILLE 2000 (1969)! To get to the edition I watched: In addition to the usual shortcomings in the English-dubbing department, the presentation here was further ruined by a fairly split look and short cases of distracting foreign noise on the soundtrack! By the way, there seems to be some confusion in relation to the movie's maturity: its length given on different sources ranges from 84 to 108 minutes everywhere - all I can say is that the copy I own ran for 87 minutes!
