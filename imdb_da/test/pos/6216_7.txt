This educational show focused on emotions, interactions and relationships. It was produced at Detroit's ABC affiliate and syndicated in 90 markets nationwide. In the last week, Detroit Public TV had a 1-1 / 2-hour clip show as part of their promise. Wow, the less resurrected! While I remembered the show, there were segments that I had forgotten, but immediately remembered as soon as they started ("Hot Fudge HOLY MOLEY!", Detective Tomato and pies in his face). <br /> <br /> For more on Public Television Special, make a search for "Hot Fudge Comin 'Atcha Concert"
