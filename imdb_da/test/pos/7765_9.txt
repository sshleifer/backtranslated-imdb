This is my favorite movie depicting African Americans in completely different light. because it shows another side of African Americans that it does not appear in the movies. It is not the band bang, urban ghetto attitude or having to deal with deep racial issues, it captures the whole essence of being young and trying to be successful and having trouble letting your guard down and letting someone in your life, And the whole bohemian atmosphere gives the big touch that does everything as well, it is a great script dialogue that fascinates you and you just get involved in the character. perfect casting with a lot of chemistry and very good acting, and I still haven't seen any other movie with black characters portrayed in this format, the only one coming close is "Sprung", but since it's a comedy it loses it very fast I give this movie 9 out of 10 and I wish they would continue to make movies with this kind of attitude towards African Americans
