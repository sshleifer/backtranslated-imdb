This is one of my favorite movies, ever. The story is just so amazing, and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney movies, this movie never drills the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. This is fun, creative and always on target. This movie has just one extra thing that you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated movie ever made. This title belongs to BRILLIANT Toy Story. But this is a respectable second, immediately followed by The Lady and Tramp. Just watch it and enjoy one of the cinema's greatest achievements. And besides, I'm not a young child, it's for the older audience who wants to resume their childhood. An absolute must!
