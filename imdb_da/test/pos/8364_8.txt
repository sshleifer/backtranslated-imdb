Shazam was okay, but Hero High was my favorite when I was a kid, I mean before there was Sky High (2005) and Zoom (2006), who were Hero High, a superhero training school, teenagers with superpowers would help police catch evil, and other times they will come in embarrassing situations like The Greatest American Hero (1981). It was a fun cartoon to see what was also fun, was live-action stage show called The Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam. The actors, who voted with the characters, also dressed, have signs of the show. Rex Ruthless (John Berwick), Misty Magic (Jere Fields), WeatherMan (Jim Greenleaf), Captain California (Chris Hensel, who also sang the theme song), Dirty Trixie (Maylo Mccaslin), Glorious Gal (Becky Pearl, similar to Superman and Wonder Woman's love child) and Punk Rock (Johnny Venocour). The whole cast just went with something when it came to the jokes. The comic was a fun superhero comedy, I shore up it will come back in live action like Fat Albert (2004)
