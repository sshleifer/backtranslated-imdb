a compact criminal drama with a good act. The unique NYC location shot adds to this tough little movie. Technically well done with good direction and acting. It will, of course, say that the wild car crash that seems to begin in the center extends through the upper west side, Washington Heights, across the George Washington Bridge and into NJ must be one of the best ever on film. Everything about a nice flick that for me gets better with the time.8 out of 10 ... easy
