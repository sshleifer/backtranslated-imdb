Aside from being a smart and well-developed variant of today's very popular horror genre and a great formula for attracting potential new fans in general, I always considered something "supernatural" as a massive giant tribute to the genre over the decades. Although not always visible to younger viewers and / or people only interested in recent horror movies, each episode contains a few clear and subtle references to classical and influential titles. From that point of view, it was only a matter of time before the authors would pay tribute to the "creepy vehicle without a car's" type of film and, more specifically, the milestones of the 70's "Duel" (Steven Spielberg's acclaimed debut) and "The Car". Being an avid fan of these two movies, I enjoyed "Route 666" a lot even though its flaws and shortcomings. The section opens tense and atmospheric on a distant Missourian road, where a black man is chased down and eventually killed by a threatening monster car with apparently no driver behind the wheel. The victim's daughter, Cassie, has become dean's ex-girlfriend and she calls Winchester Brothers to help. The brothers cannot prevent two similar accidents before they discover the ghost car. Sudden presence is back to a racist dispute in the 60s, where both Cassie's parents and several prominent residents of the small town are involved. Some of my peer reviews around here tend to feel "Route 666" as one of the weaker entrances in season 1, primarily because the manuscript is too predictive of racial issues and shows another and more emotional side of the dean's character. . He is usually the strong quiet type whereas he is confronted with unfinished romantic affairs from the past here. To a certain level, I agree with the racism debate, but it did not disturb me so much, really. The writers eventually gave an explanation of the presence of the ghost car, and racial conflict is an acceptable, as far as I'm concerned. As for the dean's emotional vulnerability, I can only say that it is admirable to see how the authors constantly try to give depth and detail to the protagonists. The dean's behavior against cassie actually throws a whole new light on him. In addition, what really counts in this episode is the wonderfully eerie truck and its virulent attack. It is an impressive and overwhelming vehicle that produces dazzling lights and pigs' engine sounds. If you worship the glorious aforementioned "Duel", you will surely find some entertainment in the compelling hunting sequences depicted in "Route 666".
