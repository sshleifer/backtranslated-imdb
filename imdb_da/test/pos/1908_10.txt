Yes ... I read David Lee Roth's autobiography, "Crazy From the Heat" (which, by the way, is a great read), and DLR says this was his favorite movie for blacksploitation as a child. In fact, he says he has always imagined himself as a black guy in Southern Cal. Sir. Roth is quoted as saying: <br /> <br /> "We saw every blacksploitation image and these movies were a great influence on me. Trouble man, superfly, foxy brown, axle, cleopatra jones, blacula, rudy ray moore Doin "his Dolemite vibe - I saw all of them ..." He continues to say: <br /> <br /> "Dolemite - Rudy Ray Moore - was one of the originals. He was a blue comic with blue humor As Redd Foxx did on early party tracks, he was the most perfect player to play a new secret agent. His answers were not "Bonds. James Bond. "His answer was" Dolemite, motherf *****! "We would wait for that line in all his films." Get Whitey "would show up in every movie at least once and we'd wait. It was too, they had the cars, they had the shoes, they had the guns, the haircuts, the snakes and the scams. And we all knew that they all beatiful fixes at the end of the movie were white bulls *** *. He tries to feed hungry kids but he is actually a pimp ... bull ****. It was designed to make it tasty for our mothers and dads so they would let us see the picture. "<br /> <br /> Spoken as a true genius. So by reading about Dolemite in Mr. Roth's book I immediately bought into DVD, and I really like it. Yes, it's super low budget, and yes ... I hate rap ... but as a fan of Tarantino movies I can see many similarities, especially some of the 70's fusion / funk ala-jaco pastorius music throughout the film. I also love the scene where the two police "break" him for cola and saw one of them snot a whole lot of it as if he had done it a thousand times before and say something like "Aww yeah .... it is the right mccoy! "... and then he continues to talk and has a little coke still on his lip. CLASSIC! Part of the violence is a bit over the edge, but shocking, which I consider to be a positive quality. Not as predictable as I assumed it would be. Definitely going to download "The Human Tornado" very soon. 10 out of 10
