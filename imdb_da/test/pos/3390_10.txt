Shelley. <br /> <br /> Based on John Jake's successful paperback novels "North and South", "Love and War" and "Heaven and Hell", this was a mini-series on television from 1985 to 1987. The success was due to More for the success of "Roots" a similar civil war era / slavery soap opera twist about a decade earlier in the 70s. Patrick Swayze, at the beginning of his career and at that time, made many films like Dirty Dancing that would make him famous, stars like Orry Main, a plantation-born young man from South Carolina, going out to West Point. Here he meets George Hazard (James Read), who was supposed to be the hated enemy, Yankee North, but with whom he ties closely together. Soon the flow from the south and the dangers from the north to friends despite the turbulent era leading to civil war. The theme of family, friendship and doing the right thing, even when the nation was falling apart, is at the heart of this otherwise soap opera full of action and romance. Clariss and Ashton (Jean Simmons and Teri Garber) depict sisters who become enemies when one of them marries Yankee Billy Hazard (John Stockwell. Garber's bitchy, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and evil Ashton is fun to watch on the screen Although the series doesn't cover everything in Jake's novels, what we see is a condensed version of it, and they changed a few things to make it a kind of historical romance with related story-readings. The characters are found in all major civil war scenes - Harper's Ferry where abolitionist and feminist Virgilia Hazard (Kirstie Alley) loses the love of his life, ex-slave Grady, Fort Sumter, Vicksburg, Antietam, Gettysburg, Appomatox and we are privileged to the White House where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Halbrook) fight out of the war in his conscience, we meet all the prominent players, including Lee, Grant, Sherman, Jackson and Davis. Several veteran Hollywood actors from the Golden Age - Robert Mitch um, Elizabeth Taylor and Olivia De Ha villand have cameos and it is interesting to see them. This is not historical fact, it is historical fiction and purely dramatic entertainment. But it has cliffhanger endings and beautiful movies, costumes and places. It's like watching an epic movie that goes beyond Gone With The Wind with war scenes in it! Scripture can sometimes be bad, and the play may not be the best, despite the good casting. Swayze hams it up as Terri Garber, but some performances like Kirstie Alley, James Read (like George Hazard) and Leslie Anne Downes as the beautiful and strong Madeline are really good performances. They shot in sets and in southern places. The music is enchanting and it is a good movie where we rotate for the good guys and see the villains' scheme and ultimately get their coming. All fans of civil war films and Jake's novels should see this. It is available on DVD and VHS.
