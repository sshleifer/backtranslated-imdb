This movie sat in a dusty stack of videos in my house for years before we saw it. We knew it was there - every time someone wanted to watch a movie, it was suggested. It almost became a joke ... "I know let's see Throw Momma off the train" ... I don't know why it was always knocked down, it was just. Little did we know what we were missing out on. It still survives me why it took us so long ... I mean it's the stars Danny DeVito, Billy Crystal and Ann Ramsy (who we referred to as "The Lady from the Goonies"), an all star cast that should have appealed to everyone in my household. But there it was for almost ten years. Until one day it was suggested and we couldn't knock it down again. <br /> <br /> It was like finding King Tuts tomb ... <br /> <br /> No movie has ever made me laugh so hard and I doubt any movie ever will. I had to rewind for almost every line because I was still laughing at the line that came before it and lost the ability to hear or pay attention. Not just simple laugh, either ... the kind of laughter that spreads more energy than driving ten kilometers in the cold. The kind of laughter that you can't control that causes scrolling and spasms, and tears and laces run down your face because it's just freakin fun. When I first read the movie of the heart, I would say that this effect is less, but I do not think I get tired of seeing it and finding new quirks in it to appreciate. I think that's all I can say. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you don't enjoy it, don't let me know I will be offended.
