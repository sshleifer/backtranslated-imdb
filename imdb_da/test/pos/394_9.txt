I enjoyed this movie featuring a number of interesting subplots and complex love hate relationships, along with interspersed action scenes and some bright moments where the mountaineers oppose fierce army discipline. All the protagonists are well thrown. True, John Wayne or Robert Mitchum might as well have played the main role as well, but Victor Mature certainly surpasses Tarzan as a major battle. Reminds me of his film role as Samson, another difficult but not impossible to tame. The mountaineers in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism, as the era of pure stairwells men very much ended 20 years before, with the collapse of the Western beaver populations and the fashion market for beaver garments. This story probably takes place in Oregon just before the end of the civil war. Judging by the volcano in the background of the opening scene (presumably Mt. Lassen), the fictional fort was located somewhere in a remote part of Cascades, as we never see other civilians. But there is plenty of conflicting evidence that it is actually going on in the Wyoming or Montana mountains! Red Cloud, the war chief who threatens the stairs and soldiers of the fort, is the namesake of a very famous Sioux war chief who led a very successful campaign in 1865-66 to eradicate the newly built army forces in Wyoming and Montana. Fort Laramie (eastern Wyoming) is mentioned as not too distant from the fictional fort. Assiniboines erases tribal mentor as joining the Red Cloud. This aspect of history then has a general resemblance to historical fact. It may be interesting to note some similarities between plot of this story and John Ford's "Fort Apache". In both cases, we have a commanding officer who was recently awarded his first border post with Indian problems. He underestimates his opponents' military skill and then gives them a little more than gunfire to advance his career. In both films, he pays dearly for his lack of experience in dealing with the enemy. Also in common, Greenhorn commander repeats a subordinate who has long experience with local Indians and will tell him what is wise to do and not to do. In both films, we have a budding romantic relaionship between a woman very close to the commander's heart and a subordinate that the commander does everything to scare. Obviously, the commandant must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to completion. <br /> <br /> I also see some similarities with "The Misfits". The soldiers as a whole, including the command, are misfits of some sort (as one of them admits): mostly they have "problems" or are raw recruits without experience of fighting Indians. The commander's wife is apparently the only woman in or anywhere near this fort, is thus inherently a misfit with a man who is very uncertain about his future in the army. The stairs are again also misfits, which will not really accept army or civil discipline, but are cut off from their previous free spirits living on the recent army-generated contrast from the Red Cloud. Finally, we can also compare this story with Anthony Mann's later movie "The Far Country" with the star Jimmy Stewart. In Stewart's case, he may choose to return to being a loner cowboy at the end. But mother's character does not come up with an appetizing new way of being her own boss. Red Cloud has made life outside the army in this region too dangerous to consider. In addition, he has an occupation with the commandant's wife.
