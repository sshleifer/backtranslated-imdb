This movie was talked about in Fangoria, where I heard about this, it was interesting to me, mostly because it was direct to video and I recognized two of the stars on the cover, James Marsden of Disturbing Behavior and Christine Taylor of The Craft. And to my surprise on Valentine's Day when I searched through the horrorgang to find it on the shelf! I had to deal with it immediately. Me and my brother and our girlfriends looked at it, and to my surprise it was pretty good, the stories were interesting and for once they were SCARY, unlike many other horror movies that were made recently. Some of the plot I do not understand, but when I see it again, I know I get it. And even more of my surprise, there were other stars I recognized, including one of the girls from the TV show My So-Called Life and Jacinda from The Real World, I'm not sure why this movie was only direct For video, with little advertising, this movie could at least have made up for how much money was spent on making it. The only problem I have is that since it was not released in theaters, I never assume I can see it on widescreen. You should definitely take a chance and rent it. <br /> <br />
