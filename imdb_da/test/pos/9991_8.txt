By 20 years old, Francis Ouimet (Shia Lebouf) as his whole life in front of him - in a way. The son of an immigrant family who lived in the late 19th century in the 20th century was a very restrictive class. If one is born poor, one remains poor; if you are born in the bourgeoisie, you have a little bit of opportunity; If you are born in the wealthy class, they have essentially done so in the shadow. The British gold master Harry Vardon and Francis' golf idol (played by the criminally underrated Stephen Dillane) is the exception that proves the rule. Born and raised in a poor British family, his profound golf skills enabled him to rise from the filthy clutter of the poorest slums to the lush greens of the English country clubs. He has not forgotten this life education. Francis wants to follow in Vardon's footsteps and also uses his great golf skills to enter the 1913 US Open at the age of 20. But a hard course and formidable opponents (including Francis' idol Harry Vardon) are not all that Francis has to deal with as a less-than-understanding father, and cruel social frameworks stand in his way of living his own dream. I know what you are thinking - I thought too - a Walt Disney produced 1913 movie USA Open with the irritable Shia LaBeouf has the ability to be entertaining, but it can't be a good movie. Well, I'm here to encourage you to think again. Despite what it may look like on paper, the biggest game ever played is one of the best sports movies in creation. As with all major sports films, The Greatest Game Ever contains many exciting sports scenes but it's not a * golf * movie - it's a character-centered movie about using its talents, one's dreams and breaking out of classic barriers. Where the greatest game ever played seems excellent as a theme movie, it also works as well as a period movie - the movie's selected costumes and sets are the second best thing for the actual time trial. The movie is also simply a great and almost unknown music composer Brian Tyler putting the film into a wonderful piece of music. Cast is also great with a subtle but powerful Stephen Dillane as British golf champion Harry Vardon, a hilarious Stephen Marcus as the man's golfer Ted Ray, a hammy Josh Flitter as Francis's pre-teenaged caddy Eddie and a surprisingly good Shia LaBeouf starring Francis . Actor Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, Titanic) will be the director here for the second time (leading a full length) in The Greatest Game ever game. He produces a fine product - which contains lots of heart, ingenuity and attention to detail in the film's production.
