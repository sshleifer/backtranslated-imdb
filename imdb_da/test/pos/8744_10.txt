I remember seeing it here when it was made and thought it was brilliant at the time. When I see it for the second time nearly 20 years later, I still believe that Traffic is brilliant and much better than the American film based on this drama. It should also be seen by all our coming today tomorrow morning politicians who believe they can win the war on drugs, as the issues raised in this movie are just as relevant today as they were back then in the end of the 80s, and unless they change their policies, it will happen in another 20 years. <br /> <br /> Well-written, well-made, beautifully acted and beautifully recorded. A thought-provoking drama that both entertaines and brings forth some of the harsh realities of the criminal drug trade.
