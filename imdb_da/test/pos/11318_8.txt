This movie was really interesting ... it's also pretty shocking when the same events in the movie happened just 10 months after the movie was premiered. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see the problems that could arise and realistically show, no matter how prepared you think you are - you are not. if this was made for an American audience - it would be different because they would have used this as a full propaganda movie and not as a wake-up call the BBC did! It's still propaganda, to some extent - no movie today with these themes cannot be - but it was about the problem of success. <br /> <br /> A movie to be featured in all terror / terrorist courses, but not because it shows errors that must not be recognized! A big movie where the BBC took some risks, and unfortunately London does not need a fictitious story more because of reality on July 7, 2005.
