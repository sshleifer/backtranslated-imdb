I didn't read the book. And I don't care about it. The movie was a beautiful romance and I think women will enjoy it. No, it wasn't a "10" movie, but it was fun. Women, if your husband is bored as mine, look it yourself. evil is wonderful as the philosophical physician who delivers a thought-provoking monologue to "in love" and "loving." <br /> <br /> Also, if you like nick cage, he was awesome and fun. I enjoyed seeing the evolving romance. <br /> <br /> Also, if you like Christian bale - see him in equilibrium. this is a "10" sci fi movie. <br /> <br /> watch this movie. ignore the previous user's comments. <br /> <br /> One - especially the ladies !!
