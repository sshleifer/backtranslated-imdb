I wasn't sure what to expect from the box. I'm a big fan of Darko, but also saw the mess that became Southland Tales, whether it was a studio that was engulfed, who knows. With the box I was pleasantly surprised. It was a return to classic sci-fi paranoia movies, suggesting much larger incredible events, but centered on an intimate character base. The slow construction and the crazy tension were very effective for the tone and theme of the whole movie. Any change in such pacing would have led to the typical Hollywood or MTV style that just wouldn't have properly served the purpose of that story. Everything from the weird look / play extras spread through, to the low-end score, to the minimal explanation of what had just happened, added a fully focused thread of underlying fear and the shrinking sense of hope for our greedy but good , lead signs. This was something well thought out and implemented by Richard Kelly, from the first action to the end. Richard Matheson's novel, on which this was based, not the Twilight Zone ep, which was another, took the story, was one of morals and greed that was still the key elements of the BOX. Being only 8 pgs long, expanding it into a fabric feature would not have been an easy task, but was done so with style, originality and leaving the viewer with long-standing thoughts about the movie. Many have and will compare this with DARKO for whether it is so profound, but I found it to be a completely different movie, thematically and emotionally. It's tone is quite different, like the messages and intentions of this movie. Where Darko left us with questions internally, the box leaves the viewer with several external issues involving the world around us. Knowing the nature of man, will the test of the box ever end? Decent plays, great scary visuals and threatening atmosphere add to the slow chilling trip. It's not for everyone, but for those who come where it comes from, it's a treat.
