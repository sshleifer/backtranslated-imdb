Now let's devote the cultural aspects of this movie, even though it is a very important aspect of it, and let's look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story. Two people find themselves in a difficult situation caused by two selfish men. They must live through their sad days without any hope. If each of these two women had been alone, imagine what kind of life each one might have accepted. They found each other and they fell in love. That this love was against all the social, religious and cultural laws in their surroundings is almost irrelevant. They loved each other, found relief in each other, it was sufficient. The reaction of the people around them is only a small fact that they must accept, suffer themselves, and then they can continue with their lives, their lives. Very fine.
