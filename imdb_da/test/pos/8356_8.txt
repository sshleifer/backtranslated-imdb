Where do I start? Walt Disney's happiest movie "Lady and the Tramp" is one of if possibly my favorite in the Disney animation theater gun. However, the sequel is ... to say a lot of fun. I enjoyed the whole movie. It was (flame-shield up!) Sweet! The Broadway style of the songs and the movie kind of worked, and I lobster the songs for the rest of the night. I can, if you asked me, still sing all the songs. <br /> <br /> But where the movie was really good for me, it was bad at many other places. The animation was a little scary at times. Every time there was a close upset of someone else's face, I don't know ... it just seemed scary to me. Where was hell lady? She becomes like two lines of dialogue and only doggy hugs Scamp at the end. She gets 0% interaction with the plot and her only son! <br /> <br /> All in all, though, I liked it. Compared to the original, does it hold up? No. The songs are not so good (still insane), the plot was much less involved, Lady had almost nothing to do with it, and it's not as sweet as the first. But if you go in with an open mind, you will have fun and maybe "gasp!" Like it?
