I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be entertained. The management, the play and the story are brilliant. Definitely up there with movies like scarface and godfather. This movie makes your heart race. Damian Chapa as well as all the cast was amazing. I would definitely rent this movie. Damian Chapa deserves an academic award for his acting and for the way he portrayed the life of a gangster. This movie is a soon to be classic and a whole spectacular piece of film-making. I loved it and I give it 10 stars. In a sentence, the only way to describe it is on a movie without error. Watch this movie and you'll see what I mean. 2 thumbs up !!!!!!!
