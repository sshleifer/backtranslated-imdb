The "good news" is that the circus is in town. The "bad news" is that it is just above Bugs Bunny's underground home. He wakes up as his place shakes like an earthquake hit it when workers pound stakes into the ground and elephants blunt off, etc. To be more specific, lion cage space is just above Bugs' hole. The lion sniffs food, and by the elimination process it appears that it is a rabbit. Bugs, curious about what the whole racket is about, wind their way through the tunnel and win in lion's mouth. <br /> <br /> I say to BB: He's totally fearless, at least in this cartoon and for at least 30 seconds. When he comes to his senses, he runs like crazy, and we get a lion-to-a-rabbit fight the rest of the way. Once again, bugs face stupid opponents, one he calls "Nero", but the lion is tough, and Bugs must use all their habits and some false bravado to ward off this animal. </p> <p> <p> stupid and the other half fun, but always fast moving, colorful and good enough to recommend. I mean, it's not every day you can see a lion on a trapeze or make a hula dance!
