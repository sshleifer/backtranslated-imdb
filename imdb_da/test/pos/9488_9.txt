The only recording of Zeppelin I've seen before this DVD is 'The Song Remains the Same' movie from 1976. We used to spend hours around a friend's house watching this, but I never really liked it and hated the fantasy sequences .. .. <br /> So what of this DVD? I didn't know it existed until you looked at the Physical Graffiti CD. "When did it come out?" I thought <br /> <br /> For some reason I thought Page was not a good live guitarist, but to say seeing this DVD has changed my mind is a massive understatement. <br /> <br /> There is 'White Summer' from 1970 - 10 minutes of guitar wizardry. There is an acoustic set from 1975 - 'Bron-y-aur Stomp' has a brilliant finger- Choice of improv section. <br /> <br /> The 'In my time to die' and 'Tramped Underfoot' performances (also from '75) are breathtaking - with Page and Bonham tearing things down like no one else ever has. Demonish possessions of Rawk! <br /> <br /> The magic continues into the Knebworth 1979 section. The release of 'Achillies Last Stand', considering their various drug-abused states, just begs faith! A song of complex guitar overdubs, Page arranged it in a way that just lets him "punk it out" live - the effect is absolutely fascinating. 'In the evening' - I've never seen this on disk, but it sings together here. 'Sick Again' - amazing sleaze rock piece. The footage from Knebworth is very interesting, cut between big screen, various rostrums and bootleg footage for great effect. The plant is fantastic through all the performances. Page, despite being painfully thin, resembles a six-year-old child having the most fun of her life at the Knebworth concert - and doing infectious viewing. One thing that confused me - The 'Black Dog' performance from 1973 sounds very 'camped up' !! Robert Plant always loved a little "minced meat" and these jeans are absolutely ridiculous - and would justify an arrest today. Everything very different from the muscle-bound kick-a $ $ studio version. <br /> <br /> I love this DVD. It reminded me how good Zeppelin was and remained.
