Ray lives on <br /> <br /> Ray-Taylor Hackford Cast-Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Regina King, Clifton Powell, Curtis Armstrong and Sharon Warren. Posted by- Taylor Hackford and James L. White. Rating- *** <br /> "Hit the road Jack and don't come back ?? no more, no more, no more, no more!" Who would have thought that this immortal line, which has almost become a remedial mantra of broken relationships in popular culture, was perceived by a lover! Ray Charles was a genius. And if there was one thing he knew, breathed and lived for; It was music. So in a life involving acute poverty, a desperate struggle with darkness, guilt, drugs and painful affairs; Ray still found moments when inspiration struck him out of nothing and words and notes took their own form to form an instant eternal classic! <br /> <br /> There are some lives that deserve to be transformed into the silver screen. Ray Charles's life was one of them. It almost comes as a shock to hear that this project had no study affiliation before it was completed! And this backing probably came after the first screenings where Jamie Foxx's performance boasted and predicted as a surefire-Oscar winner in hushed voices. Jamie Foxx as Ray almost convinces us that it really is Ray Charles who performs on the screen and not an actor who publishes himself! From the quirky all-knowing smile to the bent gait not so much handicapped, but a man dancing through his demons, Foxx captures all the essences of the actual Ray Charles. Ray was a complicated man. He never demanded sympathy and rarely showed it himself. A smart businessman secured his success at all costs, sometimes for the price of losing his loved ones. He never apologizes for his philandering ways and always maintained that he loved his family as we are convinced he did. He liked sex; it was as simple as that! But during all, there was also a beam that was afraid of darkness. Imagine the horrors of a blind that are afraid of darkness! His fear was due to his guilt. Ray was convinced that he was the cause of his brother's death, and his entire life was spent trying to resolve himself. Ray was a maverick who melted the gospel with jazz, an unprecedented blasphemous practice in the 50s. But his intentions were not to encourage. He simply practiced the only way he knew about getting close to God! <br /> <br /> It is difficult to capture such an eventful life as Ray, and that is perhaps where the movie fails. We are never allowed to get close to Ray as a person. We know him only as much as we see him. His relationships, especially with Margie Hendricks (Regina King), have not been explored in detail. And the manuscript hardly goes over Della Bea (Kerry Washington), Ray's wife, everyone knows, was a stone by his side. And the biggest blunder of all is the hasty, almost steep climax. It's as if the director suddenly realized that he was out of stock and called for a package! Nevertheless, "Ray" is definitely recommended for a flawless performance from Jamie Foxx and a stand-star ensemble. The songs and age create a sense of nostalgia, and we get a real sense that the film is made with sincerity. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Band Character <br /> <br /> Note - "Ray" has been nominated in six categories for this year's Oscar Oscar, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (Jamie Foxx). <br /> Rating- *** <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> February 19, 2005
