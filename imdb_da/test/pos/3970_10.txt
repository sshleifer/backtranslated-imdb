Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I've seen in a long time. It has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure incomparable fun. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby "B" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied for to avoid his parents' disappointment creating he is a fictional collage. In an attempt to completely fool his parents, he creates a false website and transforms an old psychiatric hospital into a school. Everything goes smoothly until many other "accepted" students turn up for his door. Now he and his friend find out that collage things are not just for themselves but also for the others. Justin Long as lead man is absolutely brilliant, his character is as natural as he can be and the supportive actions are excellent - Jonah Hill like Sherman Schrader, Columbus Short as Hands, Maria Thayer as Rory, Adam Herschman as Glen and Lewis Black as Uncle Leg. <br /> <br /> The humor is fresh and simple and most importantly fun, right from the start to the credit. The reason develops so easily that when you stop laughing at the last joke, you start giggling at the next one. Along with all the fun, the film brings a very common subject to our attention, ie. collage education. If the students in the film are usually united with the school administration, in this case they are united by the common desire to go to school and learn. <br /> <br /> But the film doesn't notice all other schools as wrong, it just shows there's another way. You, what they say "If there is a will, there is a way. And sometimes the kids know better what they need than their parents. <br /> <br /> This movie is an inevitable little story about The great possibilities in Life wrapped in the best format possible.
