This movie has it all! It has a good story, good acting, fantastic scenery, adventure and some amazing gags! Chris Farley plays Tommy Callaghanhe may be successful company 'Callaghan Auto Parts' on the road to stop the business that goes down after Big Tom dies. The problem is that Tommy knows nothing about break pads and needs the help of Callaghan Auto Parts worker Richard (David Spade). From the moment the two villages hit the road, the movie is just so fun. If you love slapstick with a great story, you will love this because gags still come thick and fast, and the movie will just make you laugh aloud! It was so sad Farley's relentless death in 1997, but his genius is "Tommy Boy". Get it, chill out and enjoy this brilliant slapstick!
