I'm a horror movie freak, and it must be one of the most phenomenal horror flicks I've ever seen. The Plot Line is completely original (who would otherwise think of a city that is completely obsessed with a particular symbol of the death and insanity?), The special effects are amazing, and cinematography could not be better. Some may find it disruptive, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It also makes a good point. The spiral symbol is slightly ubiquitous. The spiral notebook, spiral shells, spirals on cakes. Of all the shapes they could have used (square, triangle, trapezoidal, rectangle), this was one of the best choices. If you can find this movie, definitely watch it. It is definitely unique and totally unforgettable.
