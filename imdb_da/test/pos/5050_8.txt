This is a charming movie to say the least. The protagonist, Fanda, is an old man who refuses to be among the living dead as he is surrounded. He and his accomplices walk around and pull drag and come into trouble throughout the city. Meanwhile, his family is in arms about what to do with him. Then you see Fanda's relationship with his wife, best friend and son develop. It finally leads to one of the best movie changes I've ever seen. The characters in this movie are rich and deep. They develop well through the course of the film. The film has a number of moods. It goes from light and fun to cloudy and dark. Any slow parts to you in this movie will be made eventually. <br /> <br /> Autumn spring carries a similar message as a lot of other European movies do - not lose the little pleasures of life. If you have enjoyed Amelie, the eighth day or life is beautiful (all amazing movies BTW), you will probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
