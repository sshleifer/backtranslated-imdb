My mother is like going with the wind as you can be. She has the collector's plates, Rhett and Scarlett Madame Alexander dolls, GWTW Christmas ornaments, even a GWTW cookbook! My sister and I only saw bits and pieces of GWTW, but we knew the whole plot of heart. On an impression, my sister bought these miniseries that thought my mother would like it, and we were interested in it after reviewing a novel. <br /> <br /> Yesterday we decided to see both Gone With The Wind and Scarlett. We started GWTW at 2:30 in the afternoon and ended it at 6:30. We started Scarlett right after. My mother usually goes to bed at 10am, she settles staying until 10am. 30 with us to finish it! We were ridden! I like how the movie starts at Melanie's funeral, where Scarlett said, "I'm thinking about it tomorrow." Scarlett no longer stays in Georgia, she runs out to Charleston in her attempt to win him back. Rhett is not happy when he finds Scarlett in his home, so he leaves the family plantation. Scarlett, who is Scarlett, follows him, and they finally agree to set aside their quarrels for a time to break the gossip. Rhett starts enjoying her company again and takes her out on her boat. A storm comes up and they sink. He helps her swim to the shore of an island. Frightened that she's dead, Rhett is worried until she watches. When she does, they are both swept up and loved. Scarlett wakes up the next day in Charleston, but Rhett has gone and writes that he thinks it best if they never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Scarlett is a heartbeat and when she is, she does some stupid things, in this case she is seen by Anne Hampton going up in a hotel room alone with Ashley. Nothing happens, but her reputation is colored so Scarlett goes to Savannah with her two spinster aunts. She soon discovers that she is pregnant and decides to wait for the right time to tell Rhett. In Savannah, she meets many of her O'Hara relatives and grows to look like a cousin, especially a high school. She soon gets her divorce from Rhett and then decides she will never tell him about his baby just to defy him. Typical Scarlett. <br /> <br /> She decides to go to Ireland to ensure that Rhett can never detect her condition. She meets many more relatives and buys a beautiful ancestor home Ballyhara. Through this time, Rhett rides Anne. It's on Halloween when Scarlett gets notified that Rhett's getting married again, she goes to work that night. <br /> <br /> The film jumps to a year later, and Scarlett is very pleased with his beautiful daughter Kat. She is pursued by Lord Richard Fenton, who is truly a vicious man who forces a young girl named Mary Boyle to sleep with him. Scarlett meets Rhett and Anne again at a horse fair. After a riding accident, Scarlett has an interview with Anne and learns that she and Rhett must have a baby. Heartbroken again, Scarlett leaves and goes to Dublin with Fenton. There she cultivates a relationship with him, as I said, she does stupid things when she is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Mary Boyle has discovered she is pregnant and goes to Colum for help. The priest urges Fenton to help the girl and Fenton murderes him after Colum threatens to tell Scarlett. Fenton convinces Scarlett to come to London with him to escape his grief over Colum's death. Mary asks to go with her. Back in Charleston, Anne died of yellow fever. It is clear that she never lives Rhett a child. <br /> <br /> In London, Scarlett Fenton sees true colors after he hurts her when she is not in the mood, he sleeps with him. Fenton rapes her after telling him she will never see him again. She falls unconsciously and when she wakes up Fenton has been stabbed to death. Scarlett is accused of his murder. <br /> <br /> Rhett hears about it and rushes out to England with Sally in tow. Fear of the gallows, Scarlett has no choice but to tell Rhett about their daughter. Rhett is furious with her for keeping such a secret, but remains to help her. Mary Boyle, the real killer, cannot be found. Scarlett is found guilty, but Mary finally comes to declare her innocence. After promising to help Mary, Scarlett leaves with Rhett for Ireland, as he says, "It's time I got to know my daughter." The scene where he sees Kat for the first time is absolutely beautiful. In Ireland, Rhett sees how much Scarlett has changed, and the two completely and completely endorse and admit that they still love each other deeply. <br /> <br /> Having seen GWTW, I'd say yes, Vivian Leigh was a better Scarlett, but I liked Scarlett's character in this movie than in the first. The reason is that in GWTW you don't know why you like Scarlett. She is so cruel to Rhett and haughty and spoiled, but you like her lively spirit. In Scarlett you see how much she has changed. Oh, she's still in the lap of luxury, but she's no more haughty. You see how she becomes a true mother of Kat and a generous person to the poor in Ireland. Joanne Whalley does and great job at playing this new side of Scarlett. Timothy Dalton is not Clark Gable, but sometimes you swear you can see the original Rhett in him. <br /> <br /> If you just sit back and don't compare Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton with Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable, you will definitely enjoy this movie. It's a chance to compare Scarlett yesterday, the one she'll be after "tomorrow".
