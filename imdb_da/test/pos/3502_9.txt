Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen didn't lose him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a fun forest-another fun party - just like on the small screen. He hasn't lost any of his character or stupidity at all, and behind it all - none of the movies is not brain drain either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film. The idea of ​​Ali G running to PM is a brilliant, fresh and fun one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines gangster man is blended well with the rigorous, harsh, politics world. The film is also full of brilliant new characters - and instead of just interviewing for interviews, we get a real comedy film that never gets repeated or boring. So why didn't I give it ten stars? Well, the end was fun, but also botched and failed - none of it made sense. And in parts, the film was offensive to trying to be fun - but it is Ali G for you - if it is not offensive, it is not itself and it is completely and completely destroyed. Ali G's big screen debut was a success in my belief, and should have come into the average of 6-7 on IMDb. But it could also have been worse, and people are bound to have mixed opinions, especially on a movie like this. On the whole, Ali G Indahouse is hilarious British comedy at best - and the funniest and most clever. A good piece of work! 9.10
