Sarah Plain and Tall's Winters End was the best movie I've ever seen. The person in the story that I liked best was the Cassie played by Emily Osment. Just because of her energy and how she speaks her thoughts. For example, when Anna calls from the city, Cassie would like to answer, and she says, "Hello? Anna guesses what. The great father was lost, but hes back now and he's not a good man!" I loved all Sarah Plain and high movies for my review I think Sarah Plain and numbers were # 3. Skylark was # 2. Winters end was # 1! If I could live in any family of the past, it should be the Witting family. I think there are so many good parts in this movie, I can't mention them all. I think they chose the best and perfect actors to play all these people in the movie, so if you ever want to see a movie from the past, I highly recommend Sarah Plain and Tall's Winters end.
