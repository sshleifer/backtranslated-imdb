In 1956, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party and Soviet President Krushchev made a speech that dismissed Stalin and the Stalinist purges and the gulag work systems, revealed information previously banned, publicly revealing terrible new truths that opened the door of a new Soviet cinema led by Mikhail Kalatozov, once Stalin's film producer. This movie has a red army that is not victorious, they are actually surrounded, in retreat mode, where many people die, including the hero, in a movie set after 06-02-41, the German invasion of Russia when Germany introduced the Barbarossa plan, a blitzkrieg invasion, aimed at creating a quick victory and the slaves' ultimate slavery, and almost succeeded in coming within 20 miles of Moscow in what a red army exterminates, a destruction of human loss, 15 to 20 million Russians died, or 20% of the entire population. Historically, this was a moment of great trauma and suffering, a psychological shock to the Russian people, but the Red Army held and prolonged the war 4 years more until eventually they were victorious. <br /> <br /> During the war, Stalin used the war genre in film for apparent moral enhancement, introduced female heroines who were ultra-patriotic and strong and idealistic, suggesting that if women could be so successful and patriotic, then Russia could be expected at least as much from their soldiers. Stalin eliminated the holiness of the proletariat and replaced it with an individual, bold leader who succeeded in killing many of the enemy, a clear reference to Stalin himself, who was always portrayed in films as a bold, clever and victorious leader. But Kalatozov changed this portrayal when the CRANES FLYING was made after Stalin's death, creating a political thaw and creating a worldwide feeling of winning the Cannes Film Festival Palm D'Or, as well as the best director and best actress (Tatyana Samoilova), revival from the West to Soviet cinema for the first time since Eisenstones IVAN THE TERRIBLE in the 40s. <br /> <br /> This movie included brilliant, breathtaking, and extremely mobile camera work from its extraordinary cinematographer Sergei Uresevsky, using spectacular crane and track recordings, wartime images, battlefields, Moscow and crowded streets that are extremely vibrant and real. . Another brilliant scene has the main heart Veronica, who has not heard from his girlfriend Boris, for the 4 years of war, so he is supposed to be dead, but she continues to love him, expressed in a scene where she is driving towards a bridge with one took her, a moment when the viewer wondered if she might throw herself in front of it, instead she saved a 3-year-old boy named Boris, who was hit by a car. Another scene captures Boris dead on the battlefield, which dies a meaningless death, and his thoughts spring and swirl in a beautiful montage of trees, skies, magazines, all jumping into a kaleidoscope of his own thoughts and dreams, including an imaginary wedding with Veronica. This movie has the famous line: "You can dream when the war is over." In the final order, when the war is over, the soldiers return to a mass scene on the streets, Veronica teaches Boris died, all are excited and excited with the soldier's return, but Veronica is in despair, giving flowers to soldiers and strangers in the streets in an extreme gestures of generosity and selflessness revealing "cranes white and gray floating in the sky." <br /> <br /> The film was released in 1957 in Russia, and according to some reviews, the silence in the theater was deep, the wall between art and living life had fallen ... and the tears unlocked the doors.
