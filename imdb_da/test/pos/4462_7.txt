In a small, picturesque Sicilian village, someone brutally kills young, sexually curious boys. The local police force is busy trying to track down the killer and salute the list down to five or so head abusers, including the voyeuristic village of Retard Giuseppe (Vito Passeri) and a spooky grungy, voodoo pecking backwoods witch named Maciara (Florinda Bolkan). There is also Don Alberto (Marc Popel), a beautiful young priest who runs the local boy's school, Andrea (Tomas Milian), a journalist who helps the police and the beautiful patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a beautiful but seriously screwed up drug addict that seems to have one thing too much (I mean, very) young boys. As is typical with giallo subgenre, the plot will not be completely revealed until the last few frames, but if you can hang in there long enough, pay this movie. The script (written by Fulci, Gianfranco Clerici and Roberto Gianviti) keeps red herring to a minimum and will keep you interested, and the story is supported by excellent work, filmography (by Sergio D'Offizi) and musical score (by Riz Ortolani). The action, especially Bolkan, is also very good. Fulci fans weaned on their 80s big queries like THE BEYOND and ZOMBIE will find more art and less doings on the screen than they might foresee, but they will still enjoy a particularly unpleasant chain crossing scene in a cemetery (bizarre yet effective, set to singer Ornella Vanoni's ballad "Quei giorni insieme a te") and a long tulle down a rocky embankment that Fulci liked so much that he reused it in his movie THE PSYCHIC (1977). Scenes of the children being killed are mainly kept off screen (except for a short strangulation), but the camera does not hesitate to sit on their bodies. The film was not released theatrically in America, and presumably because of some anti-Catholic elements in history, only received a limited theater release in Europe.
