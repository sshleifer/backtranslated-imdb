On the advice of a friend I got myself this movie. I am very fond of computers in general - therefore why a 1995 movie about identity theft on the internet could not be left invisible. I had some bad echoes about it, but in the end I was not so disappointed: the story, although classic, is interesting and must have been really new in the days when it was released in theaters. I was surprised surprised when I figured out that, unlike what we usually see, computer-performed actions are somehow realistic, using Windows 3.x and normal computers. The storytelling is median and does not interfere with the viewer. The end is typically American. Actors' performance is global OK, Sandra Bullock usually annoys me with "Oh my God why I" way to behave, but this time she seems to have controlled herself. I would recommend the movie.
