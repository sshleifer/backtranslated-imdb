Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photograph. There she is met by a couple and other swinging couples. They all stay at this huge, very touristy hotel with a gigantic swimming pool. One night they have a pool party complete with "real living" native dancers. It is very unpolitical correct and very kitschy. Later on, Emanuelle finally has her photography, which turns out to be in one of the through-going safaris (although the photography is beautiful). Throughout the film, Emanuelle goes after every man she meets. The photography is very well done in this movie. There are scenes with cascading waterfalls, galloping giraffes and ancient ruins. The film is worth watching for the soundtrack of Nico Fidenco alone.
