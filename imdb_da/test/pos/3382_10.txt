This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has the whole tragedy and happiness of love and hate. And a deep friendship that cannot even destroy war. <br /> <br /> The most amazing casting I've ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top class in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you see part 1, you want to see everything. Some of my friends saw part of the movie at my home and went out and bought the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a civil war movie, but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can make children learn history is amazing. I have books I, II & III, and when the girls come up from Florida every year, they want to see north and south.
