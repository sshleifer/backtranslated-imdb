I finally saw LAURE and I have to say I just had it and was horrified by it. What is good about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful casting. The story is undeniable, but with these movies it is not really something. The pace is dull and the settings are exotic. The movie has a lot to do for it. Unfortunately, it also has a few things against it. The first thing is that the beautiful Annie Belle and the beautiful Al Cliver have no chemistry at all. Because the two play a pair and are on the screen for almost the entire length of the movie, the lack of chemistry between the two is a particular responsibility. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. They made sure that their attraction to each other did not appear on the screen. The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous. There is a sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest I've ever seen in a soft porn flick: our young blonde couple is picked up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross-dresser! The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) And they have an orgy of the kind in the helicopter, in the middle of the air. And Al Cliver films all this with his 16mm camera! I'm not asking you. Ridiculous. We later see that 16mm recordings are edited on a moviola. While the recordings roll, Al and Annie begin to make out. This scene is actually good, but the recordings on the screen behind them were sometimes too much. By looking at the pictures of the cross tube, he got it with his bimbo while he piloted the helicopter, I had almost rolled on the floor and laughed loudly. Is it supposed to be erotic or credible in any way? The last thing I want to see is a woman who looks forward to a man in a row, certainly when the man in a row does such a nasty woman while piloting a helicopter, no less. Al and Annie got it on, it was cool, as was the music throughout the scene. I just want the recordings on the editing screen not to be so stupid. <br /> <br /> Speaking of moves, another dull plot in LAURE that really draws the movie into a creep, are all the moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and his two wives. A married triangle is an interesting idea, but it almost doesn't register here as hot or even interesting. The two women are sorta boring, and we rarely see the three who have sex. In fact, Orso puts on his clothes for almost the entire movie, even when he is with Annie Belle. This is another minor complaint about LAURE: there is nudity, but it's not as much as other movies in the same era. It just needed more skin to look it up. <br /> <br /> Apart from the minor complaints and drag queen moments, LAURE is actually very visible. I love these kind of softcore movies from the 1970s when attention was paid to the mood and atmosphere, not the raw stuff we see today. <br /> <br /> ps: Be sure to see Emanuelle in Egypt, which stars Annie & Al but also another famous screen saver, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music in that movie is also fantastic.
