This was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound. It was based on a silent movie called "Steamboat Bill, Jr." starring Buster Keaton. Back in this early Mickey card, Mickey didn't even talk he had gloves. He could just flute and play music. The song he played was "Turkey in the straw" by using several barnyard animals as musical instruments. He plays a cow's teeth like a xylophone and he plays a nurse's spear like an accordion keyboard. However, Captain Pete is very sour and makes Mickey peel potatoes in the neighborhood. Pete's parrot flies to the window and orders him to peel the potatoes. Mickey throws a half-peeled potato at the parrot and laughs and thus closes the comic. I could get this cartoon on tape and I like it. I think Disney shorts are much better than the film's long film.
