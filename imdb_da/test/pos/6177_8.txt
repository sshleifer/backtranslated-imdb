I am Czech and soldiers (not just pilots) who fled the Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion of 1939 and fought against them abroad, are true heroes and boldest men in our history for me. This film from the director of the Academy Award winner "Kolya" (1996) is a tribute to these men. It is the first big screen film about Czechoslovak soldiers in World War II since "Nebesti jezdci" (1968). I think "Dark Blue World" is a good movie - good acting, good special effects, good music etc. Movies are half in English, and some actors are British. But the biggest thing about this movie is that it is pure existence. It is a great chance to show people around the world (and too many people in the Czech Republic too) that Czechoslovakian role in World War II was not only as an obsessed country but as an active member of an Allied campaign. <br /> <br /> Leading characters are older and wiser Frantisek and young Karel. They fled together from Czechoslovakia, they fly in the same squadron, and they fell in love with the same woman ... Maybe it's a clich√©, but fortunately this story is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes (including big hundefighter) . I don't want to compare "Dark Blue World" with "Pearl Harbor", someone will like PH more and someone will like DBW. But if you like happy ending, DBW is not for you. So I think it's a very good movie for anyone who likes this kind of story and very good movie that wants to learn about this chapter in Czechoslovak history. <br /> <br /> BTW, the main theme "Dark Blue World" is from Czech 30 and 40's composer Jaroslav Jezek. He wrote this theme when he lost his eyes ...
