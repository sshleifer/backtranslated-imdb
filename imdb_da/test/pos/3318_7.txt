The Best of Everything is a high-gloss big-screen soap opera that follows the career of four career women, Hope Lange, Suzy Parker, Diane Baker and Martha Hyer at a New York publisher. What is best for some women is not necessarily the best for everyone. <br /> <br /> Prior to this group of young fillers, clever old mare Joan Crawford, who has been around the field a few times on the screen and in real life, is up. She looks really at home as a boss lady, and she must have at this time. About the time she did the best of all, Jo Crawford became a widow when her fourth husband, Alfred Steele, died. It was a particularly traumatic event for her, she woke up one morning and found him dead in bed next to her. She inherited his entire warehouse in Pepsi Cola, where he was chairman of the board and during the same period as The Best of Everything was made, she settled on the Queen's Pepsi Cola. Life sometimes imitates art. So the authority that she bows dictation and coffee orders that Hope Lange rings really true. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the women here except Lange have come in for some rough sleds. It is uncertain for Lange too, but she literally does the best of everything. <br /> <br /> Which collection stinks the men in this movie. The best of them, Stephen Boyd, is a heavy drinker. The other Louis Jourdan, Robert Evans and Brett Halsey are just as slim a collection of rodents that have ever gathered for a movie. <br /> <br /> I also can't forget Brian Aherne who is the fine-tuning manager of this publishing company. Half of the office would have sexual harassment suits today. <br /> <br /> Some great New York pictures in the 50s make the movie a great experience. Catch it by all means.
