This is a movie that I hold back to for various reasons. As a testament to the usual soldier's suffering on the eastern front of World War II, it is a strong one. There are a number of very powerful scenes in the movie that help capture the war, such as Tank battle. Moreover, I can see what the experiences documented in the film pretty much 'true' - if you read A. Beevor's book 'Stalingrad', you will know what I mean. The movie is also successful in the sense that it does not allow characters or plot to dominate it - it is simply a story of survival that attempts to portray the battle mainly from the point of view of the (German) soldier. I have read a place where the original manuscript should have been toned down, which does not surprise me at all - if they were really trying to show how the battle was, it would be almost impossible to do it for sure. Still, there are some moments that are hard to see - this was made before Private Ryan, but may even be harder in places. Just a word of caution - don't buy the dubbed 'English' version, it's pretty awful and destroys the movie - try to get a copy in the original (German) version with English subtitles, it's far more powerful. You may have to buy a region 1 DVD of the movie in this case, as I did.
