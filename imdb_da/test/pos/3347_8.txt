I remember watching this movie for the first time with a friend while on holiday in Anaheim, California in October 1976. As we drove the tourist-laden city streets, we saw a movie marking advertising "ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX." So before we even check out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic half a mile away, our curiosity won out and we went into this movie boundary. I remember, even before the movie began to be surprised, that I saw this movie appearing in the past, ultra-conservative Orange County. Thirty-two years later I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store. I wondered if it was the same movie until I looked at the back of the jacket and saw a picture of lovely Kristine DeBell starring and decided to rebuild some good memories. Subversive Video, for their credit, has released two versions, X and XXX in the same package. As it turns out, the version my friend and I saw in Anaheim was rated X despite the original XXX advertisement there. By seeing it the second time, I realize what a lovely residential director Bud Townsend brought to the screen. As an example of this man's reach behind the camera, he directed two episodes of television's DEAD VALLEY DAYS in his salads days. <br /> <br /> Miss DeBell, appearing in the April 1976 Playboy cover, is ideal as Alice. She brings a fresh American innocence to the role of librarian in her early twenties, longing for a better life. When her boyfriend is rejected from taking their relationship to the next level, Alice reaches its turning point. This is a "musical comedy", but the melodies are quite captivating with appropriate strings and brass to compensate for the generally suggestive lyrics. Miss DeBell has a comfortable song voice that she tricks about wanting to be free. That's when the magic begins. The pacing of this movie is surprisingly fluid as the genre and the supporting cast of Wonderland are there to enable Alice when she blooms in the woman. Special mention goes to TV veteran Larry Gelman as the white rabbit who seems to be the only person who is not obsessed with sex as he always runs late for an appointment. Or something. Special features include comments from the noted feminist lawyer Lena Ramone, who expresses how to watch this movie while attending college, influenced her in choosing a career as an adult film actress after graduation. <br /> <br /> What makes ALICE IN WONDERLAND such a lovely hunting dog is its garden like setting. Partly admired in the lush, natural beauty of Vancouver B.C.'s Stanley Park, the movie resembles its pornographic roots. You don't get away because you've seen a blurred skin girl. In this font I haven't seen the triple XXX version. The extra sex feeding that is turned on afterwards will probably interfere with the overall flow and remove the bright, airy atmosphere all the time. Of course, the Lewis Carroll version is the best way to curl up and explore Alice Adventure in Wonderland. However, ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a time capsule that represents the 1970s adult movie filings, worth following the white rabbit for a scratched ride full of happy chaos.
