Gilles Mamouni plays with the audience with the story of Max (Vincent Cassel) in search of his greatest lost love (Monica Bellucci) just before being engaged to another woman. Mamouni uses many flashbacks without notice, so the best way to know where we are in the story is to look at the actress's hairdresser. Oherwise may be very confusing ... Still a strong movie debut for Mamouni, beautifully photographed by Thierry Arbogast (the fifth element, Messenger) and Monica Bellucci is a treasure to see ... I felt a little disappointed at the end of the end so I gave it 9 out of 10.
