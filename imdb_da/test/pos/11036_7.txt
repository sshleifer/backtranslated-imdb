The consequence of the need to get someone to play the role of arbitrator of public taste and political correctness always manages to come under our skin. It appears that these self-appointed, superior, pseudo-intellectual types occur everywhere; Be it in your family, church or bowling league. <br /> <br /> These are the guys who wanted the community to completely ignore and ignore everything that preceded us; Unless of course it is not, it does not fly in the light of today's "acceptable" languages, mores and general "standards" of "correct" behavior. <br /> <br /> So, this last day, high-tech book burners have targeted much of what was Hollywood's greatest achievement; namely, their participation in our own allied propaganda through their selfless message and theme film. <br /> <br /> COLD BREAKDOWN in its generation, the forbidden code and the list of now unacceptable stretches into war-time comics that do not meet with the new touch, feely socially constructed 'official' attitudes; as these "thought police" have put on us. <br /> <br /> We were really surprised to see that there are lots of such animated short topics. Most people we are aware of are from Warner Brothers' LONEY TUNES and MERRIE MELODIES; featuring Bugs, Daffy, Elmer & Porky, all in conflict with Hitler, Goerring, 'Il Duce', Tojo and the like. Surprisingly, we found a plentiful supply of cartoons from MGM, Walt Disney, Lantz, Paramount-Famous Studios and Brothers Fleischer. <br /> <br /> You are a SAP MR. JAP (Famous Studios / Paramount Pictures, 1942) is an excellent example of what we are talking about. <br /> <br /> Be pretty much unfit from the drawings that were output from the Studios of Max and Dave Fleischer before the 1941 business coup de-tat who moved them out, bringing the new name "Famous" Studios to you is a SAP MR. The JAP did not carry any of the intense plate elements that would reduce the last day's Popeye Cartoons down to the level of the ultimate formal short film. We all remember how we had Popeye and Olive Oyl together. Enter Bluto, usually the wolf braid exponent and an acceptable screen version of a Male response to feminine pulchritude. The olive falls to Bluto is less than honorable attention; until he gets a little too physically and unintentionally blurred out: "Hey Babe, how are you kissing?" At this point we hear "Help! Help, Popeye and the little sailor show up to save the day, filled with the mandatory can of spinach! Let's take over, Schultz? Again, this JAP SAP cartoon is nothing like that. Follows the story of having Popeye in the US Navy The Brothers Fleischer put the little guy in the service in 1941 to adapt to the mood of the country and as an open gesture for support to the men who were now blamed in the first peacetime concept in US history Max and Dave even service Popeye aboard the mythical battleship, USS Pensyltucky. <br /> <br /> Our point is precisely this. program at all in the right sense, but rather, they are a sort of grouping of editorial comics that resemble those of any metropolitan city, these animated shorts, like those of another panel of illustrations, have charac there is highly symbolic and representative of nations, ideas, and ideals, such as a just and lasting peace. In most cases, the hero (Popeye, Bugs Bunny or the one) is alone with the symbol of Enemy. Both are highly exaggerated visual metaphors for abstract concept and thought; Although they are dressed in humorous staircases for wider tasting. Our liberal stupidgencia (antithesis of intelligencia) cannot see itself this way; but for this kind of behavior they are no more than Neo Nazi Book burners. <br /> <br /> Allow future generations to see and appreciate an overview of past events that are both historic and humorous. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
