My husband got the DVD of OBWAT for Christmas and it was the best gift we received! We see it every time we have to laugh and so far we have seen it 12 times! The scenery of this movie is beautiful and the music is excellent! We also bought the audio track and we play it in our vehicles and at home when we ever pick you up and it is also daily! If anyone needs a proposal for a good gift for movie lovers, this movie is it! The characters are fun, charming, and their facial expressions are too fun to describe! I've always been a fan of George Clooney but now I'm also a fan of Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete) and are now looking for them in other movies! You have to watch this movie !!!
