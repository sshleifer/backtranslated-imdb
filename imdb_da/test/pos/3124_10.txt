This movie should be so close to perfecting a movie that John Ford made. The movie is magical, a masterpiece, the reason Ford was, well Ford. If you want to know why Ford was amazing, explain it. <br /> <br /> The photograph is of course fantastic, black and white as black and white should be wonderful shots, not over the shoulder conversation in it, pure Ford, great moments, big and small. The famous ripped pants by Ward Bond. Apparently, two dogs continued to invade the set and fought so Ford wanted to use them in the fighting situation, but instead of fighting, a dog ran away and the other attacked Ward Bond and tore his pants, making Ford not the end joy. A whole scene around braiding a rope. The way Ben Johnson burns, then sniffs his rope, wonderful foreshadowing and expectation of the final. Harry Carey's naive courting of Prudence. The usual downline of being scared and not showing it. The farmer's horse accidentally falls into him and it is back in the movie. Johnson and Bond are amazing in that scene. The gentleman helps any Ford actor who doesn't stay in character while the camera rolls even when a horse falls on you. <br /> <br /> A couple of very cute romances that don't need the whole focus, two very equal leaders, not to mention for the girls, how many times the cameras focus on Ben Johnson's pretty nice back. Many old stuntmen get lines and roles, Cliff Lyons, Frank McGrath. Some wonderful character studies for the most part of faces are staring, all crooks and star stars. A set of villains competing with any group in any western. Many many Fordian shots of faces, groups, children, women, little things happen, foals in the background (Ford seems to love pictures of foals), women in aprons that allow the moment as wagons over rivers and camera lanes. <br /> <br /> This is probably not a western one as much as an artist's image that happens in the west. <br /> <br /> The Lucky movie was made in 1950 because it is impossible to imagine that such a film could ever be made again, but then it is such a work of art that it would be a sacrilege to try it
