As far as I know, I have seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones popping on DVD now, and I have to say that this was his best "prezombie" offer. In fact, it strikes its later movie in hand. This is a story of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town in the middle of nowhere where young boys die mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died, it's more that does it. Is it a woman that cities have always considered a witch? Is it a young woman living in a fancy modern house on the outskirts of the city that used to make a lot of drugs? Is it the idiot of the village, who gets nabbed early because of being in the wrong place at the wrong time? You only know if you see and look at you, because it is a top-notch mystery thriller, or should I say a "giallo". I've seen this before, but it's been a long time, and by another view it was still as powerful as the first time. For those of you who only know Lucio Fulci for his zombie flicks, take your mind on this because it is worth seeing, and while the "monsters" in this are human, they are just as unpleasant as something behind in his later movies. 9 out of 10 stars, see it! Please....
