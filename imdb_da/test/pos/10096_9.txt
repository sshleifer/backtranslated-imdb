If there is such a thing as a beautiful horror, this movie is one of the best in this genre. It is a horror movie which, despite not being void of good scenes, depends more on psychology and masterful build-up of excitement for excitement. And it is one of the films so beautifully filmed, where each scene is a whole world of symbols and details that all serve the scale and genre that it can be called but beautiful. It's not easy history, with two sisters returning to their father and stepmother mansion after spending time in a psychiatric institution. They hardly cope with the death of their mother and they are trying to protect a world from theirs and defend them from the adult world. So the movie seems to be on its outer layer. In fact, the film slowly develops into something very different, with slow pace, but no frame is lost to convey the feeling of exciting beauty, so I won't say much more. See, it is one of the best in the genre of Far Eastern horror movies that recently won the world cinema, and it really shows that they managed to do it for good reason.
