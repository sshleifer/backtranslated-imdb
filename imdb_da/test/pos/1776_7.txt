Directed by Jacques Tourneur (Kat People, Out of the Past, Demon's Night) and written by Phillip Dunne (How Green was My Valley) Anne of the Indies is a quite interesting adventure pirate movie. The main character of Captain Anne Providence is based on a genuine female pirate Anne Boney who actually lived and sailed through the 18th century Atlantic Ocean. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the ocean battle, where Anne's pirate ship (Jean Peters) is attacking a merchant ship heading for Europe from South America. As a result, a treasure of great value is captured with a captivated French officer Pierre La Rochelle (Louis Jourdan). Anne ends up falling in love with him and apparently her feelings are reciprocated, but it is not until she releases herself when she discovers that he has a beautiful young wife, Molly (Debra Paget), whom he is almost in love with. Anne begins To plan revenge on both of them, but in an unexpected fate end up making a big sacrifice to save them instead. The pirate movie clip character of `Black Beard 'also makes its appearance here, this time played by Thomas Gomez. <br /> <br /> Although Anne of the Indies probably seems to be no more or less than a review of pirate movie clich√©s, it still has its classic moments in beautiful visuals and sailing sequences filmed in Technicolor as well as in some aspects of the story and most of all in personal touches that govern all that by Jacques Tourneur. 10.7
