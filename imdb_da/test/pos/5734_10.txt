I can't believe anyone gave this movie a 1 rating !!! and that's just a 3rd average ... What's not to love about this movie? It's original, it has many scare scenes that have actually made me jump out of my seat and it has some amazing special effects. The story is fresh, there is some nudity and it is very campy. The killer was scary in his own demented manner and the end is very unexpected. I must admit that I really love this movie, one of Spain's best horror movies ever. If you consider yourself a true horror fan, come out and try to find this movie. You will be pleasantly surprised to do so.
