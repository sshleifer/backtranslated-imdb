I was a kid when I saw this series, a little after seeing Buck Rogers one, both characters performed by the same Buster Crabbe, and I have to admit that these movies have always been part of the best entertainment I've ever had. The fight against Emperor Ming was one thing, but I was more interested in knowing about the final fate of the love triangle of Flash with Dale and Aura. Barin came and persuaded Aura to forget Flash, a very innocent termination of her obsession for great Flash. The series has no offensive and truly violent scenes and can be seen by all audiences. Another thing is that I learned to float in water and see the way Crabbe did it when they fought against shark men. The soundtrack was also nice, although it was previously used in another movie by Boris Karloff's Frankenstein. It would be nice to have the DVD of this series, provided it comes with subtitles in Spanish (not yet available).
