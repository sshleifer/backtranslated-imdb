North and South is a miniseries from the television ministers' "golden age" in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values ​​and lots of star comos. It is mostly excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the smaller soap opera as elements of history and the overall sense of history. <br /> <br /> James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver outstanding performances - especially Read, if George Hazard serves as a kind of emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic history. The series also includes top-notch work by Kirstie Alley, Wendy Kilbourne, Hal Holbrook, Lewis Smith, Genie Francis, Georg Stanford Brown and others. Costumes, movie recordings, sets and music are also top notch. <br /> <br /> Do not take it as a history lesson, but take it what it is - a well-made, sweeping epic from a bygone era. Book 2, which followed a year later, is also excellent, but I would recommend viewers to skip Book 3, which came out 8 years after Book 2 and was almost not as good as the first two parts. Books 1 and 2 are classics, even with their soapier items, and they are worth seeing.
