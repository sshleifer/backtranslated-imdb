I saw two very different Holmes adventures this morning, but you would be amazed at the similarities. It was probably the first collaboration between Basil Rathbone (if I was king, Romeo and Juliet) and Nigel Bruce, and director Roy William Neill. It wasn't their first Sherlock Holmes adventure, as they did a few years before this. <br /> <br /> They made an excellent team, but I prefer the hammer version, which I will talk about later. /> <br /> Holmes relies on many disguises to perform his work, and I am constantly entertained by the way that appears when they find out. They always seem to strike when they find a new track. <br /> <br /> The story of keeping a bombing from the Germans in World War II was interesting and kept you focused on the mystery.
