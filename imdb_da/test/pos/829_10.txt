Well ... it's time! Van Damme is back and kicking in this action thriller, his best movie in recent years. The reason is not too inventive, but the whole border patrol theme is interesting, and ex-marines like drug smugglers twist are cool. But what makes this movie awesome is that Van Damme is back to martial arts again. His latest movie has been more action-oriented, but in "The Shepard", JCVD ​​is back to drop the bad guys and seems to be in great shape. There are some impressive combat scenes, and Van Damme shows he can still draw the old famous 360-spinning kick park. To be a low-budget action movie, it has good sets and big stunts. Van Damme says some humorous lines and shows that he improves as an actor. I'm glad he's back to fix some Van Damage ... I've been let down by the lack of battle in his latest films. Scott Adkins is amazing in his role and Van Damme, and he has a 1 in 1 showdown at the end. Overall, it is one of Van Damme's better films, and it will keep you entertained. A must hire for JCVD ​​fans. I just keep my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic like "Bloodsport" or "Kickboxer". Enough Su Kow!
