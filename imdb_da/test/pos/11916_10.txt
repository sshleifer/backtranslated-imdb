This movie is a perfect example of great escapism! I loved this movie and was sucked in right from the beginning. Sure it's just an action girl, but it's not fun what watching movies are about. <br /> <br /> The cast of this movie is very strong with similar characters. The friendship between the boys is so realistic and appealing, it is warm warming and fun watching a group of teenage girls interact - especially this group of boys !! Sean Astin makes a big rebellion, successfully avoiding being a distinguished teenager. <br /> <br /> If you want to have fun, watch this movie! I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I saw it on a very dirty and old VHS that was terrible quality (go DVD's!)
