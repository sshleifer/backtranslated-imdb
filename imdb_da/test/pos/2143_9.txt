I first saw this movie when it was released in 1980. From other sources I learned that the only release of the 219-minute clip was in New York City, after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes. So I suppose I saw the shorter version first, which at that time thought I was a very interesting anti-western, if a little bit confusing ... Then it was with even more interest that I finally got a DVD in full length version. I am glad I did, because this second view has confirmed to me that the movie is a true classic, and the critical vitriol poured on Michael Cimino was unjustified, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a long movie, but there have also been many others. For example: Once in America (1984) in 227 minutes; Cleopatra (1963) at 320 minutes; The Ten Commandments (1956) of 220 minutes; Spartacus {restored version} (1960) at 198 minutes; Gone with the wind (1939) in 222 minutes and others. So it may not be to run time that left so many foam on the mouth when Heaven's gate came on stage. <br /> <br /> But note this: all those over the movies have everything to do with enhancing myths about history and heroes. Not so the sky's gate: In this story, the American West is shown in all its grim and relentless hardness, injustice and poverty. And that's probably the first reason why so many didn't like this movie: It changed the circumstances of the Johnson County War of 1892 in Wyoming and showed how the Wyoming Stock Growers Association hired 50 assassins to hunt and murder a large group of European immigrants accused of predators and all with assistance and assembly of authorities right up to the US president. For an essay on the war, with the background and what happened, there is a link on Wikipedia during Johnson County War. <br /> <br /> Very few are reminiscent of being reminded of the very dirty periods of their country's history and flying in the light of what the country is supposed to be. Had it been a documentary, it would hardly be tasty for most; As an entertainment, it was almost bound to fail commercially and be torn to the shakes of the shriveled and infamous. <br /> <br /> Leave the socio-political diatribe, a moment that Cimino launched here, what about the story ?? the story of the three main characters? Well, it was probably not unusual for men at that time to fall to a local prostitute, just as it is not unusual now. It is a fairly standard love triangle, where Ella has to choose between the two men and ultimately the younger man, Nathan, who, although not considering cold-blooded murder when it suits him, shows more spirit and commitment than the elderly James (or Jim, as most people in the movie say). For some, that part of the story is too slow, perhaps; In the context of the wider narrative of the war, however, I think it is perfectly appropriate. <br /> <br /> And that war is depicted graphically, viciously and cruel with scenarios of carnage that are exquisitely tailored and edited flawlessly? Although in the final massacre between the association and the immigrants, I am sure that some scenes of wagons blowing apart are repeated. A minor point and perhaps caused when the 219-minute clip was restored? Any way you look at it but it hits you in the face with noise, dust, chaos and confusion of war ... It brings me another criticism from others: noise and dust are such that it is often difficult to hear the dialogue And even see clearly what happens. I admit that I found it to be a little bit annoying at first, even backtracking to play parts to try to capture the picture or words ?? Until I realized that it was really not necessary to accept the director's intention: Life is chaotic, it's hard to hear and see in crowded situations, and in war it's not this mise-one scene. In short, it's like you're really in and within the scenes ... <br /> <br /> And what about the title? From Shakespeare it refers to a figurative closeness to God and then, if you equate God with the natural world, the amazing nature that permeates the film ?? And it's amazing, eagerly similar to David Lee's doctor Zhivago (1965)? is a useful metaphor. However, I think Cimino had something more to say, namely the idea that the brave immigrants ?? Earth's godly salt? was denied access to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for himself in the country that presupposes being the master of freedom. Was it Cimino's intention? to gut myths about the American West? To show how only the rich in America get rich while the poor are massacred somehow throughout history? Is there anything new? Not really as we all know. However, where it really hurts is to show how America was not and implicitly not the free country and the home of the brave. Instead of absorbing this narrative, we are left with the impression that the subsoil in America has more to do with a land of slave slaves and a home of knots.
