STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Mr Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is in this world but not of this world. His mind simply does not seem to understand things that an average person would and his life is a long disaster because of this, that he remains in constant mishaps and far out, many situations that he is left to settle as such does not seem to interfere with anyone and he rarely speaks. But he never gives up, and despite the simplest tasks that are a constant struggle for him, he uses his own zany methods to solve the problem, always paying him to the end. <br /> <br /> To look at the excuse state of modern British humor with all the focus on sex and general vulgarity, you would be forgiven for forgetting that a show like Mr Bean was made at once. There is nothing unsuitable here, just good, pure U-classified humor of the type Tommy Cooper and the like made in the 50s. And I just find it laughing loudly now in my early 20s as I did when I was a young boy in the early 90s. Although I can look a little more deeply now and see there must be more to this character than than meets the eye. There must be a reason why he does things like he does, and it seems to him wrong. As others have noticed, he seems to have some type of autism. In fact, I am so convinced that I really believe was a professional psychologist to analyze him. I think Bean could be the first famous, fictional character to be diagnosed with something like Asperger's syndrome. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some really hilarious British humor at the very best before everything was filled with sex and vulgarity, then it would be highly recommended. Performances like Little Britain do work because it's well-realized, but it's really as vulgar as the rest. Showing like this show we were more detained and civilized once, and hopefully we can start equipping this type of humor once again soon. *****
