Michael Radford has done an excellent job bringing this tricky game to the screen. He has taken a body with a reputation for anti-Semitism, and showed us that Shakespeare knew quite well the Jewish humanity. Radford said after the screening, and I agree that Shylock is his first tragic hero, the first of his characters to be undone by a run, forced revenge. He also rightly points out that a man who was anti-Semitic could not have written Shylock's talk about "If you stick me, I don't bleed?" Radford himself is of Jewish descent, and he has chosen the good and bad of all characters with delicacy and honesty. no signs are free of errors; no sign is evil. Radford has laid the game in the 16th century, providing a lush backdrop of Venetian politics and decadence in which Shakespeare's words can be promoted. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to hear Radford talk about the movie, recommend taking it as he gives details of life in the 16th century Venice that highlights many of the choices he made and provides significant additional depth for viewing. I hope the DVD comes out with extensive comments. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons makes a beautiful portrayal of Antonio, a man who resigns to bear the burden of his past crimes. Lynn Collins, a relatively unknown, gives us a completely flawless, stunning and detailed job like Portia. Not only is Ms. Collins beautiful - she also gives Portia layers of intelligence and humor ahead of the trial scene I have rarely seen in any production of this game. The rest of the cast also does a fantastic job, with a remarkable performance by Kris Marshall like Gratiano, and a beautifully subtle work by Allan Corduner like Tubal and playing the foil for Shylock. Finally, while Al Pacino extracts his usual strong (and high) performance, his best moments are when the camera focuses on him, and he says no words, but you can see all the emotions and insults that flow into and out of him as he perceives his fortunes change. <br /> <br /> If you like period movies, I can't recommend this movie enough.
