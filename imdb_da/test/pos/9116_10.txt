I managed to see the MTV premiere in this movie last night and I had to tell everyone that this movie brought the thunder. Of course, this movie will mostly be enjoyed by fans of D as it has lots of fun for those who have seen the HBO series and has more than enough D for newer fans and the mass of short-to-convert. The music really shines with the new songs "Kickapoo" (which is much better than it sounds), "Master Exploder" (possibly the 3rd best song in the world) and "Dude (I miss you completely"). There are a lot of excellent scenes (the billiards, the rock-off, the meeting) and the cameos (including Dave Grohl as Satan!). I could really go for hours, but I won't give the movie away. Go see it. You will not be disappointed.
