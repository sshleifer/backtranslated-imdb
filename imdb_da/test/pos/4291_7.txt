Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett they round off the leading roles to foursome of lies and intrigue. But in the center of it all, each person holds a line of decency - the moral conscience is maintained despite obvious contradictions. "Opposites are the source of all movement and of all life." How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the heart of this intrigue - she is the central conscience of the other three. She is decency undeveloped. <br /> <br /> The circumstances of the bulb are separate: one to defend its professional name; one to hold back because of family / partner press; one simply does not want to see the consequence; An ironic cannot believe the truth and lies to save friendship. These are all unsafe situations. There lies the plot - fascinating to see how each handles truth and lies. Opposites, yes. Despite the apparent dishonesty, decency and heart remain strong. <br /> <br /> The treatment of the subject and how each character behaves is masterfully delivered with clarity. It's not sensational or complex like another movie "Where the Truth Lies" 2005. Credits due to Fellowes writing and the nuanced notions of both Watson and Wilkinson. There is heat somehow coming through the apparently brave or frustrating hidden lies. Under the whole, the human weaknesses did not mean they were good. And followed by the story, the event gave satisfaction and smile to how the two men apparently grew and matured in their relationship. <br /> <br /> You can say that there is no obvious action drama or exciting scenes in "Separate Lies" but the plot is there and it will keep your attention. The meritorious production effort includes filmography by Tony Pierce-Roberts (a veteran of Merchant-Ivory films) and music by Stanislas Syrewicz, with mood and tone reminiscent of the composer Zbignew Priesner (by filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski's Trois Couleurs, especially: Bleu 1993. ) This is a British movie, you just can't miss. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson (Anne, wife): Breaking the Waves 1996 debut; Hilary and Jackie 1998; Luzhin Defense 2000; Gosford Park 2001; Punch-Drunk Love, Red Dragon, Equilibrium in 2002. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson (James, man): The Full Monty 1997; Governess, Rush Hour (like villain) in 1998; In the Bedroom 2001, Normal (HBO cable film) 2003, Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind 2004, recently as Father Moore in: The Exorcism of Emily Rose 2005 opposite Laura Linney. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett (Bill): He is simply delightful in "My Best Friend's Wedding" in 1997, opposite Julia Roberts and amazing in "An Ideal Husband" 1999 d: Oliver Parker, an Oscar Wilde game. Recently as Sherlock Holmes with Ian Hart as Dr. Watson, in PBS Mystery: Sherlock Holmes and Case of the Silk Stockings 2004 TV. <br /> <br /> Linda Bassett (Maggie): She was very effective as Ella Khan faced with Om Puri in "East is East" in 1999.
