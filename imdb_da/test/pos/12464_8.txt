This is both an entertaining and touching version of the classic story, also quite intelligent, not by 'Me Tarzan, You Jane' school at all. <br /> <br /> It is the famous story of a child raised to crew in the jungle of monkeys. A named British couple (wife pregnant) is stranded in the African wilderness after a shipwreck. After the parents' death, the child is raised in the jungle of monkeys. Twenty years later, this young man (that is, Tarzan) rescues a wounded Belgian explorer and cares for him back to health. The Belgian discovers evidence that his rescuer is the young Lord Greystoke and returns him to his rightful property in Scotland, where he must adapt to civilized society. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts. In the first half, we see Tarzan in his jungle environment. Not being an expert, I am unaware of the realism of its portrayal of monkey community life, but it is certainly entertaining. For me, the more moving section is the second half when Tarzan is meeting his real family, developing language skills and adapting to the aristocratic British society that is constantly waiting for Jane (Andie MacDowell). He is portrayed as a "noble savage", either wildly or in elegant Edwardian parlors. In contrast, the upper crust is depicted as often far more barbaric than the jungle Tarzan left. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert is amazing in his sympathetic depiction of Tarzan in both the jungle and civilized environments. He conveys a real sense of his confusion and conflict, beaten as he is between the two very different worlds, his original monkey family and his new human. Sir Ralph Richardson, one of the old British legends, is brilliant as always in the role of Tarzan's grandfather, Greystoke's sixth tomb. <br /> <br /> The film focuses more on Tarzan's struggle to adapt to civilization and his inner conflict than to his jungle exploitation. This unusual take on the old classic makes it both the typical dramatic adventure, but above all a moving personal story. I was not surprised to note here that its director is the same person, Hugh Hudson, who also directed the Chariots of Fire, another brilliant movie.
