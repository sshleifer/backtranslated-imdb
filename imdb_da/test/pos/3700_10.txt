This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see. The values, writing and production values ​​are first-rate. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo, as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. However, the best part of this movie was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse rather than going to the usual happy ending. It showed that abuse can occur in good families; involves good people; and wreck life. It is thoughtful and entertaining. Congratulations to everyone interested in this amazing movie. <br /> <br />
