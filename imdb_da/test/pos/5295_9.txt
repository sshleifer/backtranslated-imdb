It has been widely agreed that Hayao Miyazaki is a master of his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thought-provoking story lines and similar imaginative characters. His films, from NAUSICAA, TOTORO, KIKI, LAPUTA and MONONOKE to the recent HOWL'S FLYING CASTLE are not only gorgeously rendered in the form of art but also in film making. Can this man not do anything wrong? Not really, but it is impossible to expect that all his films are always five star marvels. His latest movie, PONYO, an immensely family-friendly story of a "goldfish out of water", is so richly animated and vibrant with interesting characters as you would expect ... and yet it's his first movie that goes into "lesser" area. Don't forget me, PONYO is not a bad movie in any way. As mentioned, it is an eye for the eyes and is as charming and sweet as TOTORO and KIKI. The problem is that history does not remain abandoned to satisfy anyone eager for another immersive, profound plot. <br /> <br /> For its opening, the PONYO Miyazaki storytelling is at its finest, where a robust and overcome young goldfish (later named Ponyo) makes a forbidden trip to the human world, whereupon she is adopted by a boy there is own age named Sosuke (modeled, interesting by the instructor's own son). This does not need Ponyo's father, a mysterious guide named Fujimoto, who is very angry with man for their destruction of the sea (this environmental science theme is not very different from Miyazaki's other films) ... a problem he would like to correct by creating jellyfish from his submarine prow. He separates the couple and tries to talk Ponyo to stay underwater with him. However, goldfish have already tasted both Sosuke blood (healing a cut on their finger) and some of the human food (ham, which she becomes inexplicably dependent on) and of course steals in her father's forbidden potions and transforms into a hyperactive young girl (who is the saliva image of Mei from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO). This triggers a dangerous tsunami that threatens to swallow the whole world with water. Conspiring with his wife, Gran Mamare, a diaphanous sea goddess, alternating from super-sized titanium to human size, Fujimoto decides to test the love of the two youngsters. They do this by raising the sea to the level of Sosuke's house, whereby the youths set themselves over their now-harbor-infected world in an excessive toy boat (made possible by Ponyo's own magic powers). <br /> It is at this time that PONYO starts to run out of steam. Although Ponyo and Sosuke are cute and scenes involving them are fun and cute, they lower the movie. Unfortunately, where the film really takes on water, Sosuke is to prove his love for Ponyo, presented in a way that is strangely anticlimatic and hurried, bringing an otherwise charming story to a halt. This is likely to happen to other viewers expecting another instant masterpiece from the man who has delivered far more interesting finals for many of his other films. Remember the destruction of Laputa? Satsukis looking for little Mei? Kiki rescues Tombo? Porco Rosso's fight with Curtis? Rescue the head of the forest man? Or even the test between Chihiro and Yubaba? All these decisions were far more satisfying and felt more complete than this. <br /> <br /> At technical level, PONYO cannot be interrupted. The animation is absolutely beautiful to look at, produced without a single shot of computer generated images, and of course Joe Hisaishi gives us another great musical score; The best moments are the waking sequences underwater, accompanied by a choir and a soprano voice. And the backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed as other Ghibli films. <br /> <br /> Having proven to translate and copy Ghibli's former English-quality film with top-quality results, Disney Studios and Pixar once again provide an English dub complete with a most successful cast of actors. Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good as Sosuke, who leaves very natural and trustworthy. However, Noah Cyrus like Ponyo sometimes goes overboard in shouting her lines before finally going down towards the end. Leaving aside, the rest of the casting includes Liam Neeson as the over-protective Fujimoto (who manages surprisingly well in the character), Cate Blanchett as Gran Mamare (in an omnipresent tone that is not very different from her Galadriel in RING RING), Matt Damon as Sosuke's constant seafaring father Koichi (who is good but nothing to write home about), and Tina Fey as Lisa. Of them, Fey is the best voice throughout the casting, imbubing the character with just the right amount of spirit and personality. Her scenes with Sosuke show true chemistry. On the other hand, Cloris Leachman, who was spectacular as Dola in CASTLE IN THE SKY, was disappointed as one of three disabled elderly women (she has hardly any lines!), Which is also spoken by Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Of them, only Tomlin's character, a cantankerous woman named Toki, shows some real personality, but if I caster the movie, I'll change Tomlin with Leachman. Probably the only really devastating disadvantage of the dub is a tasty techno remix of the movie's catchy (but ridiculously repetitive) title song, which fortunately does not occur halfway through the final credits. <br /> <br /> On the whole, PONYO is a good movie; a fine piece of animated work that is perfect for young and family audiences. However, due to the loss of momentum towards the end, it falls far from classical status. However, since Miyazaki is at least still better than the majority of other animated films, I will be generous and give PONYO a full-star recommendation because any feature of him is still very worth seeing, especially on the big screen. (Be sure to catch it in the theaters while you can.)
