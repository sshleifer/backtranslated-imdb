Never having read or seen Bart's original work, I cannot begin to compare this work with his story. So I won't. Instead, I just want to say that this was a very entertaining story with some very fine special effects (and some so slightly lower in the budget, but still decent enough to enjoy). I thought all the primary actors did a good job. The style of magic seemed more black than white and is almost certain to offend anyone who is easily disturbed by such things, but I thought it was well done.
