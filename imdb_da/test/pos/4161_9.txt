Enhanced by the expressive filmography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately profound experience. Interweaving dreamy and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro) is like an Impressionist painting - a cinematic artist's representation of what the immigration process might have been like for our parents and grandparents. Crialese's "magic mystery tour" came as a result of his visit to the museum at Ellis Island, the appearance of the faces of the immigrants depicted in photographs he saw, and his study of the harsh policies and procedures used during the admission of immigrants. <br /> <br /> Oriented with letters he read by immigrants sent to family members who remained at home, Crialese identifies with the poor immigrants who could see the positive side of things beyond their trials. To Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his older son Angelo (Francesco Casisa) America is a distant dream that they do not know about. After climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the Saints for a sign, they are rewarded when they are shown postcards of Salvatores youngest son, Pietro (Filippo Pucillo), a deaf mute depicting the New World as a land where they can swim in rivers of milk, sit under a money tree or harvest giant onions and carrots. After disposing of their animals in exchange for shoes and suits, Salvatore, his two sons and his older mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) put on their adventures with more hope than scared, but the equation soon changes inversely. As they steer the boat and settle into their overcrowded third-class control room, the most talked-about scene takes place in the movie. Using an overhead camera that shows lots of people standing when the ship withdraws, the frame is divided into them aboard the ship, and they wave goodbye from the quay and the way they are separated from them implies that they being torn down by everything known. br /> <br /> On board, the ship is a mysterious English woman named Lucy (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Crialese does not reveal her past or the reason she travels to America, but she seems to be in the forefront of the modern world they are entering. Although they are watching each other carefully, Lucy becomes interested in Salvatore and asks him to marry her to let her enter the country. The journey is treacherous with a violent storm that buffets the ship. Shots in almost complete darkness, throwing passengers in control of the boat's side, and then lying bodies flat and twisted on the floor as in a macabre Totentanz. Rites of passage through immigration processing on Ellis Island do not become easier and Crialese attacks, like illiterate peasants, in the name of preserving "civilized" communities, are forced to put together puzzles, perform mathematical tasks and undergo humiliating medical examinations to prove that they are " fit ". <br /> <br /> A marriage mediation ceremony feels like an auction block and the young women look despondent when they are matched with overweight middle-aged men. This is the only way they can enter the "Golden Door" as single women are rejected unless they have partners, apparently to prevent the threat of prostitution. Through the fog, the immigrant can hardly see the land with milk and honey, and there is no freedom service that asks for the tired and the poor, the humble masses long to breathe free. However, in their imagination, the river is still flowing and waiting for them to jump in. Although the end is ambiguous and a door opens up to an empty wall, another door symbolizes a rebirth of the soul and the passage we all must take from the old world to the new.
