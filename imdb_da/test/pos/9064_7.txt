This movie was original in an unoriginal way. Although many films have addressed the suicide and mental institutions, it was always about treating the patients and making them better because of the doctor's help. In this movie, however, we follow a depressed guy who falls in love with a suicide girl and will stop at nothing to make her happy, even if she is not happy at all, she will just die. This was a very interesting sweet romance comedy that in no less than pleasant. This is fun to check out if you ever get the chance, just be open to the material. Overall I give it a 6.4, I just voted 9 to get the rating higher :)
