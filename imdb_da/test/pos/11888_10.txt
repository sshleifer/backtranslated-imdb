Some martial arts purists believe that comedy was the worst thing that could have happened to old-school kung-fu flick; and it is true that the introduction of comedy in the genre signaled the end of the "chop-socky" period in Hong Kong film. But the fact is, you can only carry out a primary physical exhibition of skill as long as everyone gets bored. And that's why chop-socky died and how Hong Kong's "New Wave" action movie was born: the producers, the actors, the directors were just saddened by hitting people in nineteen straight. <br /> <br /> As Liu Chia Liang is a professional director with a significant list of movies in his resume, this film should be seen as something other than just another Kung Fu comedy. It is rather a comic film within the martial arts genre and actually one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> What Liu has done with this movie is really a pleasant surprise: he has taken a martial arts plot and re-engineered it with a Hollywood style musical! Complete with episodes of song and dance! It was at the time of the film's presentation that some filmmakers and film fans began to recognize that the cinematic notion of martial arts (really derived from the acrobatics of the Chinese opera) has more in common with dance than with the fighting. (I will continue to point to this connection until most Americans are aware of what they should actually look for when they see a martial arts movie - well-choreographed body movements using an action movie plot as an excuse for their performance.) It is quite clear that Liu Chia Liang made this connection and decided that he would explore it close to his borders. The result is an incredibly charming entertainment, filled with wonderful human characters who try miraculous kung-fu (and stumble over their own shoes as often as not when they do). and the film is set to the 1900s and 1800s, Liu allows to explore the nature of westernization and modernization of China, which has contributed so much to the production of the China we know today. So the film also has great historical imports. <br /> <br /> Also fans of Stephen Chow's latest Kung Fu Hustle should really watch this movie carefully, as Chow clearly learned from it before making his own movie. br /> <br /> A very entertaining, well-made film. Oh yes, and kung fuen in it really is really good. Purists won't admit it, but it's probably Director Li's best movie.
