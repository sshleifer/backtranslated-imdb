It must be said that this movie is definitely one of the better "dealer bag" films out there - I would feel a bit cheated if I had paid £ 15 for it, but at around £ 1.50 I felt I was completely surely got more than my money's worth. <br /> <br /> The movie can't quite determine whether it will be "Mad Max" or one of Clint Eastwood's "unnamed" spaghetti westerns, and as such is stacked with clichés from both. Even the manic loony that hangs out with the bad in "Mad Max" is there. <br /> <br /> The guy from "Blade Runner" cops also a good billing, even though he only appears at the beginning and end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Favorite bit - for me punch-up on the oil refinery - if you look closely, you can see the "post-apocalyptic" spattering traffic thunder past in the distance as the two protagonists knock seven bells apart . Get more stores in a couple of pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately lightweight but entertaining drivel.
