This movie was well done, but it also made me feel very down at times too. For anyone considering doing business, this is a must see, as it shows the raw deal in what is going on for these fighting workers. The soundtrack was definitely cool and plays and dance complimented it nicely. Some of the student's attitudes could have been slightly removed as Leroy, especially because I'm sure such a one would have been kicked out immediately to refuse to read and such if this were the real High School of Performing Arts. The coco-screen test is hard to look at for people out there with weak stomachs, be aware of my warning. Although it is very gritty, I know that is the truth about what is happening so in this respect the film is right. All in all, it is entertaining, and although some parts draw on the majority, it goes very fast. <br /> <br /> Final Grouping: <br /> <br /> Movie: Probably I would have skipped this one. <br /> <br /> DVD Purchase: Nothing to see again and again. <br /> <br /> Rental: Worth hiring at least once in your life!
