This is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics, and is a must for all psychotronic fans. Why? It has everything that a large 70's utilization film should have. Over-the-top dialogue, poor acting, enthusiasm, sex, sleaze, political inaccuracy, violence and many other elements of a good cult classic are included. In other words, the Dolemite is a must-see. <br /> <br /> As with many of these films, the plot makes little or no sense. What I picked up from is that the pimp-hustler Dolemite suffered from stealing fur and half a million dollars of drugs. While making time, his bow took over nemesis Willie Green (the same man who hit him) over his nightclub. However, the sympathetic ward (the only white character in the entire movie that is not totally evil or incompetent) decides to jump him free to stop evil Willie Green and his drug trafficking. Fortunately, he knows kung fu as it does about 50 to 75% of the characters in this movie do. And fortunately, while he was locked, Mrs. Queen Bee sent all her "hoes" to the kung fu school. With this army of kung fu fighting "hoes" (his words, not mine) on his side, he plans to take back the nightclub from Willie Green. But two racist white police are trying to hit him again and have him thrown back into prison. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, don't try to follow the plot. I've seen this movie about five times, and there are many elements that seem to have no connection to anything else. Supporting characters wander in and out of the movie. I'm still trying to figure out what was happening with Reverend Gibbs, the Mayor and Hamburger Pimp. Who cares in the end? The scenes with these characters are all invaluable. As for the dialogue, it is terrible with even worse delivery. When Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian, I wonder if this movie was a spoof or a serious action movie. It seems he couldn't decide which one. Lines like "Yes, I'm so bad, I kick my own ass twice a day" call for further investigation. In any way, the movie is fun, and the plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese factory. Another fun element is some of the most unrotic uses of sex and nudity ever in movies. Actors that you will never see naked will be naked (including the mayor and queen Bee). Not to mention the fact that the boom microphone appears to appear in all other scenes. Most of all, Moore shows incredible enthusiasm. He seems to have a generally good time and is certainly charismatic. His comedy rapeseed proved to be a major influence on the latter's gangsta rap, including Dr. Dre, who sampled him on his groundbreaking 1992 album "The Chronic". As technically scary as the film is, it is culturally influential. More importantly, it's a good time. The biggest crime a exploitation movie can commit is to be boring and it is quick and entertaining for all its mistakes. In other words, if you dig this kind of movie, you'll love "Dolemite". If you don't dig it, you're a "no-business, born-insecure, jock-jawed motha-f *** a!" (7/10)
