When I read through the comments, I was surprised to come across someone who said this movie was "not very deep." I have to disagree? This must be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking movies I've ever seen. Yes, the play and the music were excellent; they have been praised again and again in the reviews. But I also commend the heart of the film. It resonates with deep meaning and feeling. It is a story of redemption. It's about two very different and very flawed characters, knocked down by life, but too strong to lie down and die. It's about a man who sees more value in a girl than she saw in herself. It reminded me strongly of the book Redeeming Law of Francine Rivers, which has a similar narrative story. Yes, the pictures and themes are cluttered and sometimes shocking, but if you look close enough, you can just see yourself in these figures. Sometimes the true things in life are not beautiful, but they are real.
