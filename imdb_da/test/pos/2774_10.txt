Would you never miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I've always found myself imprisoned by the characters. Each one seemed really talented and knew how to act through a movie. I remember Friday evenings and running to turn on the TV just to watch their latest movie. Susie Q was one of my favorites all the time. I never forgot this movie. Even until this day, when you mention the song "Susie Q", I always remember the movie. If anyone is thinking of watching this movie, I promise you will fall in love with it. I don't think I'll ever forget it. You won't regret seeing it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is sad to see Disney movies like "The Hannah Montana Movie" come out. What happened to Disney?
