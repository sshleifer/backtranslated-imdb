Words alone cannot describe the pure beauty and power of this film. <br /> <br /> Think "Toy Story". Now think "Toy Story", approx. 1934. Now imagine that the animation looks like living, like liquid. Think of the movie, not as any adult and child can enjoy, but imagine it as a movie noire. Imagine trying to do something back in 1934. Somehow, "The Mascot" delivers. In a story where toys come to life and one of them tries to deliver an orange to its sick owner, Starewicz delivers a whole animation level completely unexpectedly. It's so fluid, you will wonder for a long time whether what you see is really stop-motion animation. <br /> <br /> Comparing Toy Story and "The Mascot" is an exercise in futility, plot-wise: while "Toy Story" is a children's story adults can enjoy, "The Mascot" is a dark, chilling story directed against adults. Meaning, no, your kids won't like it. Slightly. <br /> <br /> Still, get it if you can. You may find it along with "Vampire" in DVD and LaserDisc. And prepare to be stunned by what Starewicz could do back in 1934 with a couple of puppets.
