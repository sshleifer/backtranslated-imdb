Okay - it was in black and white and probably on 2 "tape - meaning the BBC dried it, right? But it remains in my mind from all those years ago (1960 ??) as a perfect piece of history historically most innovative editing and amazing actors full of youth and bravado. <br /> <br /> I want to see it again! Read this, BBC? Find your original 2 "tapes or 35mm movies, handle the actors and rights directors and reissue! I know I know some of them are dead, some of them are missing in action. Where else would I be able to see Mary Morris as "the snake's heart wrapped in a tiger hole"? Where else will I be able to see Paul Daneman do 'Now is winter dissatisfaction ....'? Or Robert Hardy gives his speech on 'the idol ceremony'?
