This is a Laurel & Hardy comedy card with some amazing and fun moments, but generally the movie depends a little too much on just a comic premise. The comic premises on which this film is mostly based are very simple; Stan Laurel doesn't wear pants. Laurel plays a Scottish naive young person arriving in America in full kilt. For some reason he becomes aware of this and his uncle, who is played by Oliver Hardy, seems because of this that it is time to put some trousers on Philip. His humor is well done, but the most important prerequisite also becomes a bit tedious after a while. While the movie certainly still has its comical great moments, at the same time it is also far from the best of the many Laurel & Hardy comedy shorts that are still there. The movie is simply too simple to be considered one of the greatest, although it is most certainly done most of the time. Great good clean fun, just nothing too remarkable or memorable. <Br /> <br /> 7/10
