I gave these movies a 7 out of 10. I think the general aversion to this movie is due to people who don't really understand the plot. If you think of the story line this movie actually makes perfect sense, it just never gives you a dumbed-down explanation. It is true that the special effects are substandard and it seems semi-low budget, but I think the originality of the original keeps you drawn. People say the vampire genre is exaggerated and clich√©d, but with Bled what you get is not your conventional vampire girl. It is a dream / alternative reality story line with a vampire / eternal life spin on it. I loved it. The only thing that prevented me from giving it a higher rating was the lack of special effects and that I personally do not like movies where most people have accents. But as I said earlier, if you really get the plot it's not a bad movie ..
