STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an incredibly important movie for our movie history. This second look of Mickey Mouse (after the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous movie - mostly because it was so groundbreaking. This is because it was the first sound cartoon. While you are not yet listening to Mickey, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the movie - something we take for granted now, but that was a great crowd pleaser in 1928. <br /> <br /> Now if this was just an important Historical film, it would be worth watching - especially for lovers of animation. But after seeing the brief again after approx. 25 years I was amazed at how timeless the film is. While Mickey and Minnie behave a bit oddly to the characters we've grown to love (thanks mostly to the cooked mind and talent animator Ub Iwerks), there's a contagious charm about the movie. It's just nice to see Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" on a very imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way. Clever and a real crowd-pleaser - this film is still among Mickey's best films, even after 80 wonderful years.
