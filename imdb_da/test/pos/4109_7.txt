A big caste gathered for this remake, which unfortunately was a box office failure, regardless of a good soundtrack. I can't say it was easier entertainment, not even a cure for insomnia. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie - it gave the escape I was after an afternoon. A good look at those looking for the ideal life, albeit a fantasy. Expect some corny moments, get tensions, and occasionally laugh.
