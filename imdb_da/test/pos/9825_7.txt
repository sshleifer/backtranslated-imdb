I read the other comments about this movie before I see it. If you have read them, you will know that they are almost all negative. I really don't understand that. I admit it is too long (it should take about half an hour to speed it up a bit). The music is often inappropriate. But strong ideas from Ford and Thomas are actually enough to carry this. With all its fame as a movie star, I had forgotten that Harrison Ford could really act! This role as a man who has defined himself based on a lie is remarkable. I find it absolutely credible that he wants all the details he can get so he can see what was genuine and what was deception. Thomas is always wonderful and that is no exception. Her original denial, which leads to confusion and then to inner peace, is immense. This movie will never be on anyone's list of big flicks, but it's not that bad. I'm glad I waited to watch it on video, but it's worth $ 3 or $ 4.
