One thing that struck me in watching this movie is that it was fun / exciting for the cast and the crew; I felt they were up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm and dedication, because they apparently liked the people involved. <br /> <br /> I tend to like B-movies that are original and have heart, and I think this is such a work. The actors seem to be putting hearts in it more than usual, perhaps because of a good guide from the leading actor / instructor, and they were obviously clear enough in their parts of the story to create a coherent, visible work of art. <br /> <br /> The criticism of this movie, more or less saying "why not just rent a hardcore porn movie", makes it clear why they didn't like the movie. Going on this movie hopes for a lot of T&A without the patience of the material in the plot, why it is so uncomfortable for them. One can say that the film is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie, even though I take it, the star has done its part of soft porn. I think she's educated. <br /> <br /> As far as writing is concerned, the dialogue is not a big part of the movie, as in a Tarentino movie, but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes funny. Especially the end is not a disappointment, but a pleasure, with the villianess / heroine and "leading man" learns from their complex web of emotions. <br /> <br /> I understand that the manufacturer got a 3 movie deal out of this. Hats off to prove a few tens of thousands of dollars can go quite far if you have some artistic sensation and pride. Gabriella and the other girls with nudity scenes were sympathetic to being hot, not just airhead bimbos, so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some beautiful nude art, even with the boundaries of B movie country, not disappointing.
