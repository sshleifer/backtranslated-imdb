Even though I saw this movie when I was very young, I already knew the story of Wild the Thief-Taker and Shepherd, who were famously escaped from the Newgate prison. <br /> <br /> Apart from the freedom taken right at the end, the movie follows more or less faithfully the true story. The deadline for bending the facts that characterize so many so-called historical films is opposed to this film, and the filmmakers must be praised for it. Of the performances there is hardly a poor performance, and Tommy Steele is ideally thrown. Also good is Stanley Baker, as Thief-Taker and Alan Badel are good as always. Because the film sticks to the facts, it makes it suitable for being seen by the whole family.
