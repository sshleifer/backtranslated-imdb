I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and history lines. One exception to this is Ramgopal Verma film. This is a great movie with fantastic performances from the star cast. This is supposed to watch movies for those who are sick of seeing stupid dancing and love stories. The adaptation of history and characterization was extraordinarily good. You should watch this movie for Nana Patekar. Based on the life of Mumbai policeman Daya Naik, this film is acting in a more realistic way. The film kills into the common man's life, which he has apart from being a meeting specialist. I rate this as one of the best films of the year
