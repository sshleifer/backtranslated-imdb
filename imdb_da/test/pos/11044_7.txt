'Anne Christie' was Garbo's 14th film and the first one where her husky Swedish voice was heard. She plays the protagonist, Anna, who has struggled to be abandoned by her father Chris (a drunken pram played by George F Marion), and with the unfortunate life she has, she must head her head over water. br /> <br /> Meet Irish Matt (Charles Bickford) can mark the turning point for her ... or do it? Garbo looks and sounds good in this drama, which, although looking a little lumpy and moving at a slow pace, still manages to engage and engage an audience almost 80 years later. Marie Dressler has an influence in the role that gave her another flush of movie success in movies like Min and Bill, Dinner at Eight and Emma; while Marion and Bickford are more than adequate. <br /> <br /> An interesting piece of film history. Garbo wanted to make better talkies in the years to come, but 'Anna Christie' will always be remembered for the first time she spoke on the screen.
