This movie is true action at its best, it doesn't get any better than this. This is one of those movies you can just kick back and see some really good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some good lines to go along with all this. My favorite is that there is a bad guy who breaks into this old couple home and he steals a TV or something and he goes all the way to them and shouts "I come in here anytime I like! !! " and just before he jumps out the window he shouts "Anytime !!!" I mean, it's just classic stuff all around, so you have a choice you can see that crappy Will Smith is trying to go into an action movie or you can see one of Masters Charles Bronson !!!!
