After completing the Zero Woman series I look forward to the Female Prisoner Scorpion series; both based on comics by Tooru Shinohara. Unfortunately, I was unable to see them in order, as this is the third in the series. It starts well when The Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) escapes from the police. Detective Kondo (Mikio Narita) managed to get a cuff on her, but she continued to cut her arm and get away. If it's not bad enough, dig a dog up the arm and see it in the street before he finds a place to enjoy his treats. <br /> <br /> Scorpion may as well go back to prison as life There is no picnic on the outside. First, a local Yakuza Tanida (v) threatens to put her back if she doesn't set off; And then the gang leader gets her when she gets rid of Tanida. But they don't last long before she escapes and looks for revenge. <br /> <br /> Soon they fell like flies. Some have certainly deserved to wear clad clothing with shirt collars so large they went all the way to the shoulder. Madam (Reisen Lee) turns in to avoid being killed. <br /> <br /> Police arrive at her latest kill and trap her in the sewer. She is in there for a week and the police find out that a friend (Yayoi Watanabe) has delivered her with food. (The story of O Yuki (Watanabe) and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting but only random with the movie.) They are trying to burn her out, but this is The Scorpion, and she has some unfinished business. <Br /> <br /> Not the usual mix of sex and violence, it's a slow narrative that's all the way through.
