It was a great movie! I like to see it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie held me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD. I would definitely buy a copy. This movie just proves that you have to be very careful about who you get. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter saw film with me. She thought it was great. All I know is I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it. It's the kind of movie that keeps you glued to t.v. I want Life to restore the movie, but use the same actors and bring it to the big screen.
