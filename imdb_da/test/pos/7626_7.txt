I was 9 when I first saw this on TV. on a Friday night. I remember full page ad in the TV guide with the picture of Rex. great how some things keep you in mind after 30 years. Anyway, if your a kid who likes monster movies, this is entertaining enough especially with boone and keats raging on each other. Special effects are not harryhausen, but it is one and a half hours if you find it somewhere on sennat tv. Have not seen it in a few years for some reason, these classics fall from cable TV. If you catch it on late night, don't be too critical just grab some snacks and enjoy it. It could be cheesy, but I thought it was much better than King Remake who came out in the theaters a year before.
