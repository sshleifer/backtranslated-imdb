This movie has inspired me to be a better person. In life, you do not know who you are going to run over, and sometimes our prejudices will make us predict a person wrong. I've learned to give someone the benefits of the doubt because of this movie. I also learned that hard love can build a stronger person. Now I want to know where to find the movie's soundtrack. There are songs in this audio track I've been trying to get for years. May I comment to act for a second. Jamie Fox was excellent. The man has risen to be the actor's actor. Also the performance of Regina King was fantastic. If I can get a woman to look at me, how she looked at Ray ... I can only dream. I picked up $ 18.00 for this movie and I don't have much money, but I'm willing to watch this movie again and again. This movie touched me.
