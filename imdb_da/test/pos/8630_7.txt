I wanted to watch this movie because I'm a very big Abbott and Costello fan, and when I saw it, I liked it. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, not hysterical, but fun. I think I laughed for many of the fun parts and I just enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Although not the best of Perfect Straight Man and Perfect Buffoon, you should see this if you really love Abbott and Costello. <br /> <br /> Out of all the Abbott and Costello movies I've seen, I can't say I've seen one that I hated. This is decent, fun and entertaining. Abbott and Costello made some pretty decent films in their later years. All in all, I liked this movie, it's not one of their best, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
