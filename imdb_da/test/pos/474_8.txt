Some people are born of sad souls with their singing singing singly until they meet another soul as tortured and / or bitterly sweet as their own and an unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look at two tortured souls who unite a moment of understanding and unity to be torn apart by the differences in the relationship between their pain. Death is explored figuratively and literally. That is what happens when the soul is dead or too alive, for the awakening to reality. It is life that you did not imagine behind the passenger's eyes. This film explores the painful pain in all of us, the wrinkle under the red facade, the pain below. The ugly instinctual animalistic thoughts and actions become honest and fact, and Bechard sprinkles a touch of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix, knowing that both dwell in us all. Bechard, the author, is an expert observer of the human condition and, because of his non-judgmental attitude, presents life in a light, we often protect our eyes, but long to see and understand. He as an instructor focuses on the nuances of the actors' spirit shining through the character they play to the actors, and have their personal knowledge of the emotions caused by each situation. This is the most accurately written and directed characterization of a man and woman's experience that I have experienced so far, even though the two characters come across, are probably not the "normal" meeting. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack encapsulates in each song text what the characters would let their hearts burst if capable and strong enough. It is every character's true voice sung through the beauty, pain, talent and emotional intelligence of new indie artists ready to explode on the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for us with problems - those of us who admit that we have problems and those of us who hide it. <br /> <br /> I always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with Mr. Bechard's both fascinating creative and realistic beliefs and the characters that are about it.
