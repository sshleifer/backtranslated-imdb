In a very near future, the world monitors a corrupt government all the time constantly with computers and surveillance. A man has managed to evade assimilation and work outside the system and struggle to maintain his freedom. An engaging and imaginative story and some very interesting editing and camera work. There are some confusing and slow parts, but all in all an excellent example of what a small crew member with brains and talent can do on a shoestring budget.
