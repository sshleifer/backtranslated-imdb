This film was very interesting to me, almost a movie in a movie about a very capricious director, who smartly persuades an actress and actor (who does not like each other) to produce sexual chemistry on film. The director faces a fusilade of obstacles as she tries to get the two people to perform beautifully on film. Gender is Comedy is much more than a comedy, filled with unpleasant quirky moments, the film also deals with the psychological and innate instinctual behavior of men and women with regard to the sometimes controversial act of sex. I loved this movie, the character Jeanne played by the beautiful Anne Parillaud performs wonderfully on the screen as you share in her struggle to produce a movie artwork artwork.
