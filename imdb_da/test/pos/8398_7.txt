I see this movie without great expectations I think everyone should do. It's a big TV series and of course we couldn't compare it with Gone With the Wind, but it's still nice to see. It is also strange to see another Scarlett. Joanne Whalley does not play Scarlett with passion and fire like Vivien Leigh, but I think Scarlett changes when she gets older. Don't expect much of this to look but don't look at it: I think it would be terrible.
