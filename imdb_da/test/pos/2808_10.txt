It really doesn't matter that no one here likes this movie, I do, and that's what this review is about. Lou Diamond Phillips is amazing in this comic role. the line about train ab and c is now for me an instant classic, cg is great, yes the train looks a bit fake ,, but aliens wow rocks they ever ,, Todd Bridges ,, where is Arnold and Mr. Drummond, wow he's been out of the loop, guess that's what prison is doing to you .. a ballpark is heading to Las Vegas with the senator for him to deliver a big speech, a meteor just hit, and now all of a sudden we got foreigners running loose on board the train, and our hero war must save the day to make matters worse as his former wife is on board with him. I just thought this movie was so wonderful, a must see if you like action.
