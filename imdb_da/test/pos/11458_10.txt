This movie was great doesn't understand the disrespectful it gets. I first scored this as 87-88 and it was actually scary. If you are an 80-fan fan, you should have no problem with this movie, it has everything that makes 80s scare great. I met a couple of the actor and they were cool. What is not good about a creepy old house, demons, crazy party and graceful young people. The dialogue and the special one made this movie a classic. This movie also dealt with one of the classic rumors of horror, the black guy must not die at the end anyway. Although this movie was amazing, there is one thing that is still undiscovered for me, what really happened to the old couple on the end was it intentional or not that the little side story had always confused me.
