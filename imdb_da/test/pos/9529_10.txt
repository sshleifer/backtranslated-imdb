I have seen this movie countless times, and never failed to be charmed by its domestic simplicity, sincerity, and goodness. Large characterizations of all the cast and the lovely small steam trains that play such an important supporting role. I admit that I fell in love with Roberta in 1970, and she still touches me today. Shown on TV in New Zealand on Christmas Day, the best gift I could have had.
