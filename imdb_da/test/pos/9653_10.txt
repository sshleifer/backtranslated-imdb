This movie is probably the best new French movie I've seen in this century so far. There have been some good ones, including Noe's Irreversible, Green's Le Pont des Arts and Hadzihalilovic's Innocence, but none of them come close to Les Amants Regulier's timeless glory. <br /> <br /> The film is a description of the events of May 68 and what followed in the wake of it, and it is also updating and a tribute to the Nouvelle Vague films from those days. Regarding the portrayal of the riots in Paris, the film is meticulously accurate (I'm only 19, and I wasn't there myself, but you know what I mean) and the almost real-time and very long riot scenes set the scene perfectly deepening of the events in the streets of Paris. The runners are not glorified or beautifully photographed as those in Bertolucci's The Dreamers (as the film can be compared in many ways) instead they are filmed in ugly black and white shoots thanks to the excellent William Lubtchansky. The love story, which is the main concern of the film after the 68 revolts, is engrossed in amazing and far less blurry shots and manages to evoke true feelings of love and youth confusion in the midst of the otherwise politically affected and apparently cold environment. <Br /> <br /> This movie is a beautiful love story and it radiates through the director's desire to portray his own experiences from the mythical late 60s that make the movie more convincing. But the film is also a tribute to the entire Nouvelle Vague canon. Much of the dialogue produces early Truffaut, and the length and non-action and plot less structure are reminiscent of Eustache or Rivette. There are even Godard-like verfremdung effects with those who look directly into the camera and even directly address Bernardo Bertolucci. This movie is undoubtedly an answer song to Bertolucci's The Dreamers, and it is also a Nouvelle Vague tribute, but it still stands as a beautiful and brilliant love story. Bottom Line: This movie is incredible and if you love French cinema, you shouldn't sleep on it. It can be the finest French movie since Eustache's La Mamain et la Putain.
