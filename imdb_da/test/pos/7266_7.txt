A very visible movie, and one that was eager to have seen the trailer a number of times. It all looks unrelenting, from the lavish effort of the upper class to refrain from mediocrity, to the lower class scum just trying to keep its head over the filth, the film captures the spirit of the 18th century brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Jonny Lee Miller plays Maclean extremely well, although the part doesn't exactly stretch, and Robert Carlyle seems a little wasted on Plunkett, Miller's highwayman colleague. The real star of the show was undoubtedly Ken Stott, who plays Chance (a kind of 1740's police officer) with a vicious joy that set him apart from the rest of the casting. <br /> <br /> An amazing movie, and anyone who enjoys the color and style of Peter Greenway's movie, will love the look of this even though the plot's thin appears to be within the 2 hours up. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
