If you want to watch this movie because Michael Caine or Michael Gambon is in it then don't bother, it's not their typical role, even though I found Gambon great. Instead, see it for Dylan Moran I am a fan of everything I have seen him, and it is no exception, I did not even understand that he could act but even the characters that he must pass himself as I found totally trustworthy, which is impressive considering the audience knows they are false. The plot is brilliant, and although it is not constantly laughing all the way, it has lots of other charms. A great movie for people with a sense of humor.
