After being thrown out of their last job and finding employment scarce in the UK, the six members of the Wonder Boys, better known as The Crazy Gang, see an advertisement for employment in the Red Gulch Gold Street in the Yukon Territory. It comes from a newspaper cut and on the back there is a story about Chamberlain that says the country is better prepared for war. Off they go to Yukon and The Frozen Limits. <br /> <br /> This is the case with misplaced Chamberlains. The mowing is forty years old and it refers to Joe Chamberlain and Boer War instead of Neville in the current crisis. But that's typical of how things go to this crew. I can see Stan Laurel making the same mistake. Of course when they get there, it is a ghost town inhabited only by young Jean Kent and her grandfather Moore Marriott. He comes on this year and is slightly touched in the head. Marriott has a gold mine that he is wrongly placed somewhere he goes to sleep, that is, when he is asleep. The Gang better help him find my or other beautiful Ms. Kent will not marry stalwart stairs Anthony Hulme, but rather saloon-owner Bernard Lee, a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> This was my first exposure to Crazy Gang and I can see both why they were so praised in the UK and why they never made any impact across the pond. The jokes come fast and furious and then there were a number of things that the Code in the United States just wouldn't allow. The witnesses are also strictly current British and much just wouldn't come here. <br /> <br /> The sights are universal, the final chase scene worthy of something Marx Brothers did in America. My suggestion is that if you see the frozen borders, lose it if you have a knowledge of British history and run it two or three times to make sure you download everything. It will be worth it.
