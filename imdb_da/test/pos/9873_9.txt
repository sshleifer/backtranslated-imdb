This movie is pretty good as it is, but the unpublished Producer Cut is my favorite movie in the series for the original. Jamie's story is handled differently, the death scenes are made 10 times better, there are several recordings of ritual types of things that give more story of Micheal, Jamie and her baby. There is also an alternative end which is also better. Why haven't they released this version instead, I have no damn clue. If you can find this version, you can see it.
