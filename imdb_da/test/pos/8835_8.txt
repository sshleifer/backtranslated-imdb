The film movie's history for film adaptations is filled with deviations that almost certainly show that tradition should never have started in the first place. However, there are some examples that manage to pull it out, just. Rising steam would initially seem to be the last sitcom that was suitable for the big screen treatment, as this hilarious series was based within the small borders of a northern bedding. Also, the author, Eric Chappell, was not paid enough to spend time making a completely original manuscript, so he harvested a series of TV episodes and stitched them together to form the film's body. This does not necessarily imply that the script would fail. David Croft and Jimmy Perry did the same with their manuscript for father's army and it worked great. Although the early father's episodes, with their stiff pace and over-arcing plot, were far better at film adaptation. However, the rising moisture episodes were high energy charges from the first scene to the breathtaking climax. As a result, the scenes within the movie become dissimilar when a story is finished and another is started. Another fall in the movie version of a TV series is the inevitable comparisons made. In this regard, the film pales in comparison to Rising Dam's brilliant series. After all, Rising Damp the Movie manages to be entertaining and occasionally outrageous. It may not be surprising that the finest moments arise during sequences written specifically for the movie. This includes a rugby match where Rossiter makes an excellent timed chat. In fact, while all the casting handles their roles perfectly (wearing a sub standard replacement actor for the late and really big Beckinsale), it is Leonard Rossiter who rigsby who shines the most. In fact, Rising Damp should have been made as a movie, so Rossiter might have been eligible for an Oscar, as is his acting talent. Criminally he was not even nominated. In the end, the film fails to match the TV series while managing to keep itself as a comedy in itself with some beautifully played moments. Recommended view. <br /> <br /> One last thing: Opening and closing music is by far the worst in movie history.
