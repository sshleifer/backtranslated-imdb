So many times, Bollywood has tried to restore Hollywood hits, only to produce total duds. Merely Yash Chopra's interpretation of "Sleeping with the Enemy" is an extremely stylish and well-crafted film. <br /> <br /> Shah Rukh Khan is obsessed with Juhi Chawla (who sees her very best in here!). When he realizes that Juhi has a fiance in Sunny Deol, he stops nothing to make sure she is his. <br /> <br /> Every frame of this movie is a pleasure to watch. Whatever it is Shah Rukh who sparks his trademark "I love you, K ... k ... k ... kiran!" or the sweet scenes between Sunny and Juhi (which fit perfectly together), you will not feel like you are leaving your stove in boredom. Every single song on the soundtrack is ear appealing, especially Jaadu Teri Nazar and Tu Mere Samne. As I said, Juhi looks like a goddess in this movie. Darr may not be SRK's best movie (the honor goes to Baazigar), but it is certainly one of his most flawless performances! Sunny is okay. He has done similar roles before, but he is good. <br /> <br /> All in all, Darr g ... g ... g ... amazing! ;)
