Purportedly made back to back with "Erotic Nights of the Living Dead" with the same cast and setting, but for sure this doesn't have Laura Gemser. Very foggy of all, I like this movie. Certainly the story and the dialogue are codswallop, but it's so beautifully filmed in such a wonderful setting, and I like hardcore. I find it at once naturalistic and exotic, and that doesn't just mean there's a black girl and some warm penises! I find the many and varied sex scenes very credible, though two are put on a tree trunk at the edge of the sea with the waves splashing around. The creature does not deserve to emerge up to half an hour before the end, and it must be said to be a disappointment. Still, he manages the remaining number to kill everyone with two of the expedition and in case the girls first have sex with them (or at least in one case!), And this movie is not as slow as some maintainers. In addition, there are some fine moments of sexual exploitation, not least the lady scientist and her urge for two natives, and the glorious finale, when the two survivors speed up their boat, glances back on the island, they have escaped and found there is still time to a last copulation.
