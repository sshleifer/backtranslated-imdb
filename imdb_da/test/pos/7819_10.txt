I loved this movie, it was sweet and fun! Lauren Holly was wonderful, she is fun and very trustworthy in her role. Costas Mandylan was also very good, nice to look at too !! Brenda Vaccaro, as usual was a pleasure to look at, she did a good job with her character. It was a pleasure to watch a movie that is fun, interesting and can be seen by the whole family. It's hard to find good healthy movies anymore. Thank goodness for the Hallmark movies, they are wonderful! I wish I could buy it, if anyone knows where to buy this movie, let me know !! I have bought several Hallmark movies and are very happy with them. I hope I can buy this !!
