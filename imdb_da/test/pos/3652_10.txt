I just saw this at the Philadelphia Film Festival. It was the most wonderful movie - the best I've seen in a while. Isa's tempting character is an open, exploratory and (as noted in the film) loving person - depicted by the beautiful Camille Natta. The accompanying music is soothing and transporting, a balm for the soul. Each character seems to be in conflict in some way - and their interactions (with conflicts) make a great story. The story told by A.K. Hangal like the old man was most magically done - I wanted it to go again and again. <br /> <br /> The Hari seemed to remember his "place" through the whole added get power to the story - a refreshing change to the bubble heads of many modern writers. <br /> <br /> Everything and everything, an excellent movie. Go see.
