One of champion Alfred Hitchcock's finer films is the story of an American and his family (James Stewart, Doris Day, and their young son) on vacation in North Africa. Stewart's Doctor and Day is a world-renowned singer. They meet a Frenchman who speaks the mother tongue and helps them out of an incident on a local bus. Later, the French whisper something to Stewart's ear after he is attacked and dying. The rest of the movie is a puzzle game as Stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery. The film is imbued with mystery and strangeness from the exotic site to the odd occurrences. You never really know what's going on in this movie, why people appear until the end and even then you're not sure. The final scene takes place in Albert Hall and is one of the most famous in movies that last for 12 minutes without dialogue. Hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934.
