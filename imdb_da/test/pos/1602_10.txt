Visconti masterpiece! I admit that I am not known for much of his work, but I cannot imagine his other work exceeding this amazing film. Yesterday evening I saw death in Venice after an absence of about 25 years and was completely captivated by everything I saw. This captivation was a pastiche composed of many elements: The extraordinary shots directed by Visconte, first and foremost his love for long, luminous shoots of people eating, swimming, walking and containing a significant character passing through this mass of people; filmographers brilliant interpretation of Visconti's shot selection It acts according to the principles without excessive dialogue and transmits the complexity of the scenes only through facial features. It is true: young people who are watching this movie for the first time must be aware that they see a unique movie, a movie that could not be made in 2006. A movie whose time rests in the short handful of years in The 60s and early 70s of the last century when artistic license was transferred to film directors and money men took secondary roles. As many of the latest IMDb commentators have written, this movie is in their judgment long, boring (too little action) and pretentious. I assume that, according to Hollywood paper standards, these comments contain profits. Unfortunately, they tragically reduce the amazing beauty and depth of this work and others like it from those years. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Death in Venice, rent a copy and immerse yourself in a movie and story from another time. You will be rewarded.
