I've always been a fan of the show, so I admit I'm biased. When the show ended, I felt that for many questions remained unanswered. This movie felt like closing. Seeing all the people I followed the last couple of years was finally the most rewarding. I have heard that this is probably the only homicide movie we can expect. If so, it's the right way to go. This film is sometimes skewed, sometimes disturbing, but always satisfactory. If you've ever been a fan of the show, watch this movie.
