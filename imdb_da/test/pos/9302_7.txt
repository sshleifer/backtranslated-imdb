This is a strange and convincing movie. The topic of the atomic bombs created in Los Alamos, NM in the US and used in Japan in the latter part of World War II, is enormous and, of course, deeply disturbing. The movie's plot has many heavy problems, and the actors must bear much of the creative excitement. I had never seen the movie or was very interested in what I must admit until I read the book "Smoking in bed: Conversations with Bruce Robinson." Robinson wrote the story and the manuscript. I think the movie was better than I expected to read Robinson's point of view in the conversations about it, but I can see how he thought it was being tracked. I think Paul Newman is pretty good but somehow tied up, miscast. He's for Hollywood. At one time, a large, medieval guy storms into Newman's office and has such a striking presence, I immediately thought he was going to play the character Newman plays. The other leader who plays the main researcher is also quite good, but somehow not brilliant enough to portray the tremendous anxiety that goes with that part - the enormous responsibility for the creation of an ultimate machine of death and destruction . One of the more effective characters seems to be a complex personality that John Cusack plays. He is strangely affecting all the time, and finally, the sign whose fate really hits home and which made me think most of the fate of more than 200,000 Japanese people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
