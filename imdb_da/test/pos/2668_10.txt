Sometimes the user's comments on IMDB read me with despair for the species. For anyone to dismiss in 2001: A Space Odyssey as "boring" must not be interested in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film making. Finally, I understand why most Hollywood productions are so superficial and vacuumy - they understand their audience. Fortunately, those who can't appreciate Kubrick's performance are still a minority. Most viewers are able to see the intelligent and pure virtuosity that went into the making of this epic. This is the film that puts science in "science fiction", and its depiction of space travel and the future of humanity remains unmatched to this day. It was so far ahead of time that humanity still has not caught up. <br /> <br /> 2001 is primarily a technical movie. The reason why it is slow and full of minutae is that the goal was to realistically imagine the future of technology (and the past in the impressive opening scenes). The film's greatest strength is in the details. Remember that when this movie was made, the man hadn't made it to the moon ... but it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey. Creating such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later is still the best we have is without faith - I still can't figure out how some of the shots were done. The film's only remarkable mistake was the optimism that it predicted the technological (and social) development of mankind. It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the movie 2001, not Kubrick. <br /> <br /> In addition to the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with much food to think about what it means to be human and where humanity goes. Yes, the end is strange and difficult to understand - but it is the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke have begun to imagine it, now it's up to the audience to continue. There is no nice resolution, no definite full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking about the last wheel. I know, that's what most audiences seem to have these days, but Kubrick won't turn us off so easily. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to see this movie in IMDB's top 100 movies, and only wish it was even higher. Stanley Kubrick is one of the very best filmmakers the world has known, and 2001 his finest performance. 10/10.
