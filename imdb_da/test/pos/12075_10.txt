This film is based on the true story of Iowa housewife Lucille Fray who had breast cancer after the birth of her 10th child. Realizing that the state would take the children away from its ineffective, alcoholic man, she dedicated the last year of her life traveling around the state to finding new homes for each of the children. A fantastic script - which still lasts 20 years after it was first made. The adult children, many of whom had not seen each other since their mother died in the late 50s, were reunited at "That's Incredible" before the movie's aeration in 1983. Barbara Stanwyck won Emmy for Best Actress in a TV movie or mini series, but during her acceptance speech she went out of her way to single Ann-Margret next to her moving ability.
