Many years ago I saw this movie (maybe on TV?) And loved it. So I decided to rent it on the DVD the other day to see if it still stopped my discretion. It did. <br /> <br /> Seen in Sydney's infamous King's Cross district (where prostitution, drug addiction and sex shops thrive), it tells the story of "Jimmy" (played by Heath Ledger). Jimmy is a young man ... maybe late teens or so who hasn't had a stable family background. He is on the edge of society and works as a 'tout' for a sex club (encourages people to enter the store). He is aware of an underworld figure called "Pando", which is a local bigwig in the cross. It is Jimmy's hope that he will find himself on Panda's radar and get into him ... a short distance to upward social mobility, he hopes. One evening Jimmy meets the beautiful young woman Alex (played by the charming Rose Byrne). You just know that a love story will play out between them. That same night, Jimmy first contacted Pando (played by Bryan Brown). Pando has a 'job' for Jimmy. It's the foot of the door that Jimmy has been waiting for! <br /> <br /> To reveal too much more would pamper the many surprises this movie has in store for the viewer. Stylistically, if you like Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie movies, be consistent with what to expect ... twists and black comedy. <br /> <br /> What's so good about this movie is its very 'Australian -ness'. It's not just turning off Tarantino or Ritchie, but a real Australian contribution to the genre. <br /> <br /> A fascinating aspect of this movie is how it all fits together. Sometimes you are introduced to characters that you wonder about what the hell they are doing there. Eventually, all these 'loose ends' tie together beautifully. It's like a celluloid Moebius strip. <br /> <br /> A highlight of the movie is Bryan Brown's character of Pando. Pando likes puzzles and it's fun to see him play games with his peers. It's the little details that were revealed about him who is so funny ... his taste in music, to begin with! <br /> <br /> Of the Heath Ledger movies I've seen (The Dark Knight, 10 Things I Hate About You), it's perhaps his best role. Wasn't taken with "10 things". If you're a Heath Ledger fan (Ledger recently died a tragic, accidental death), this is a chance to see him in his biggest Australian role, I think. There is great chemistry between Ledger and Byrne in this movie, so at one level it seems like a lovely love story. This movie has none of the series of Tarantino and Ritchie underworld movies, but it has some adult themes ... scenes that surprise you with their cold and beauty. In that sense, it's not an ideal movie for very young viewers, but it's not a movie that gorehounds will be tense either. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to say that it's great that Australia can make great movies like this. Usually, the kind of movie my home country does can be uniniviting. This film has strengths where many Australian films have weaknesses ... ie. It has a great story, great play and a good script. We need more popular quality films like this to be made here in Australia. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Other Australian movies I've loved include: <br /> <br /> Breaker Morant (10/10) Mad Max 2 (10/10) My brilliant career (not reviewed here yet) Evidence (No) Devil's Playground No.) This year's My Voice Broke (no) Bad Boy Bubby (no. A big, dark comedy) The bowl (no. A big, charming comedy)
