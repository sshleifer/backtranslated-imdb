I just got back from the European Premiere of the Gamers: Dorkness Rising. All I can say is that if you are a gamer (CRPG, RPG or LARP) then this movie is for you. And if you're not a gamer? Well, it's still a lot of fun. The play is certainly not Oscar-worthy, but in the whole element of the film it adds to the charm. The humor is everywhere, along with some very nice details (tribute to Gary Gygax is extremely well done if you can spot it). The cast is very down-to-earth in their appearance, making sure they are ordinary people who enjoy a regular hobby. <br /> <br /> The quality of the sound and vision of the movie is sufficient, but again it adds to the atmosphere that helps define this movie as the Dungeons and Dragons movie, written and performed by gamers. <br /> <br /> Not afraid to use terminology specific to a system, they still manage to allow product placement to be part of the movie, but in a very understandable and fair way. It also touches on some of the perceived prejudices that some players may have about other players and deals with it quite well. <br /> Overall, the movie is driven by a well-thought-out balance of character, plot and entertainment (Bard is amazingly good value for money). In the end, making the score makes this movie pretty hard, so I have given it 2 points. <br /> <br /> Score (for non-RPs): 7/10 (A few moments could go far above the head, but the main sections of the movie just work so hard and get so much more.) <br /> <br /> Result (for RPs): 10/10 (Everything fits together, in the perfect quantities and with the perfect charm and mood)
