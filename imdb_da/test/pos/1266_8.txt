The following is an exciting thriller that requires constant awareness of being fully understood. The plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology. The sequence of events complicates the following subsequently. If you're willing to pay attention, it's an exciting movie full of noir ear tags. With a maturity of 70 minutes, there is a lot to do with, but the fast pace helps keep the viewer excited. Bill is a lonely, sloppy guy who shadows people and sees where they are going - what they do. However, he is a little too sensational, and eventually gets caught by a well-dressed, cut block called Cobb. Cobb is compelling Bill in a world, the poor boy is not willing to live in. Cobb is a smart villain who seems to have complete control over the other characters. At the end of the film, the inconsistent history is explained in detail. The film is an excellent first effort by the talented Christoper Nolan, who will continue to make Memento, one of the most original films of our time.
