I like that many others saw this as a child, and I loved it and the horrible me until adulthood. I have been trying to find this movie and even tried to play it again on TV a day since it originally played on US networks. Does anyone know where to buy this movie, or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me? Does anyone know if there is a chance that it can be played on TV again? Maybe we should all fans write a station in the hope that they will fly it again. I don't think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows people know only about the Stepford wives and the Stepford man films. No one is aware that there was a children's version. Maybe they should also resume it as they seem to be doing a lot lately with many of my favorite old thriller / horror flicks. Well, if anyone has any posts, please write me with information. Thank you Taira tcampo23@aol.com
