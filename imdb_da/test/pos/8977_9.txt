I stopped watching "The West Wing" after Aaron Sorkin ceased writing and producing. It just wasn't the same. Imagine my excitement by watching a movie he wrote again. It's been a long time - the American president, a few good men. His script was a beautiful mix of humor and tragedy. He made a compelling story credible, and made me cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was incredible as a small Texas congressman whose constituents only wanted lower taxes and keeping their weapons. Not a hard work, so he had plenty of time to fool around - and he did. His office staff looked like he was at Playboy Mansion. As he allegedly said, "You can teach them to write, but you can't teach them to grow breasts." Despite his sexist attitude, which fits nicely with a Texas congressman, they were extremely loyal, especially his assistant husband, Amy Adams (Junebug & former Hooters girl). Now you need to add a rich Texas socialite who wants something done in Afghanistan, played perfectly by Julia Roberts; and a pain-in-his-boss CIA agent, excellently made by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you have a movie worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Excellent writing and superlative plays and a story that needed to be told. What more do you want in the movies?
