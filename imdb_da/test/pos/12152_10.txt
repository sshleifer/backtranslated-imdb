I have become a big fan of Barbet Schroeder's work, so maybe I'm already a little biased now, but I think this movie is good, although there may be a few lengths. It's a romantic uromantic view of the great liberation in the later sixties, stylistically incredibly polished (nice set design!) And in my opinion still very reliable. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is an ironic tale of the story of Adam and Eve driven from paradise after tasting the Forbidden Fruit, which has been transformed from an apple into a hypodermic-filled heroine. The woman seduces a man to use it, thereby speeding up his death. ‚ÄùThe guy seems to be condemned and bound to an intense life and an early grave from the great title sequence forward, there is no room for hope, even if the story is quite sad, I was caught by the beauty of both the beautiful location of Ibiza and Mimsy Farmer. I found her character at once shallow, enigmatic, endearing, annoying, interesting and boring. Somehow she represents what men look at women in a basic, unofficial way. Architecture and building materials in general are very much started or used which seems to be a Schroeder brand of this kind. <br /> <br /> There is even some humor, primarily supplied by Stefan, German h person and his accent. His head nemesis is not a snake, but an older German of dubious reputation ?? and the heroine's provider - called Wolf. Although it is a German name, and Stefan is German, he speaks English, and in jealousy does he spit the name of his girlfriend on a regular basis? becomes a boy crying ... At times Stefan has to work to earn a "celly". At some point, the guy goes snorkeling and then he gently clinges a stone with his rubber stoppers? Never have male frontal nudity more fun in movie history.
