This cozy Euro-West opens with a scene taking place on a similar scene as Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for "Once Upon A Time in the West," but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to show up. Three hard lookouters enter a city. One is dressed as the man with no name in a poncho. Another is dressed as Colonel Mortimer from "For a Few Dollars More" and the third is tamed as Django unless he rides a horse instead of pulling a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them on Main Street behind a cart loaded with three chests. "Any Gun Can Play" is a spaghetti western with an in-joke on spaghetti westerns, as the hero here wipes out the three killers. Apart from a little too much comedy, especially in the acrobatic battle sequences, this is an above-average oater. The infamous Mexican criminal Montero (Gilbert Roland of "Barbarosa") and his gang of trigger-happy pistoleros rob a hearse train carrying $ 300-thousand dollars in gold coins across the border. Managing Director Enzo G. Castellari of "Inglorious Bastards" controls the attitude of a number of camera angles that pushed you ahead of the action. The bandits grab the locomotive with the coach, who carries the gold and separates it from the rest of the train that houses the American cavalry. While Montero and his armed men hold the cavalry, Pajondo (Pedro Sanchez of "Sabata") commands the locomotive, kills engineer and his crew and rolls it away, leaving the other pistols behind to cope. In essence, Pajondo Montero doubles and steals the gold for himself. Later Montero catches up with Pajondo at the Rio Grande. Before the bandit can reveal where the foliage is to Montero, a cavalry sergeant shoots Pajondo dead. Before he dies, Pajondo Montero tells of a medallion that serves as a clue where he stashed the treasure. The irate Cavalry captain (Ivano Staccioli of "Commandos") captures Montero, but he cannot loosen the bandit's tongue even after he has used his whip on him. The defeat of Montero's reticence threatens the captain to have the Mexican shot if he does not speak. Meanwhile, the prisons let a priest present to Montero, but he really is not a priest. The six-gun toting Stranger (George Hilton of "The Ruthless Four") masks as a man of cloth and rescues Montero from a firing squad. Unfortunately, before Montero is rescued, Clayton (Edd Byrnes from TV's 77 Sunset Strip) takes the medal away from him and holds it to himself. Clayton is the bank representative who was sent to protect the gold. He is appalled that the captain wants to shoot Montero. Clayton's career at the bank depends on his ability to recover the gold. The alien trains a fire at the fort to distract the sliding panel, and Montero takes the captain hostage and tries to escape, but the alien shoots him out of the horse. Before the authorities can verify that Montero is dead, the alien body claims the beautiful reward he will receive and he rides out with the captain's gracious thanks. Previously, they have left the fort than Montero's men turn out to save him from the stranger. From then on, the alien, Montero and Clayton promote short-term alliances between each other as they seek gold. Castellari and Scenario Tito Carpi, who have written a number of spaghetti westerns such as "A Few Dollars for Django" and another Castellari oater "Seven Winchesters for a Massacre", rely on clever humor and surprise conversions to keep the action fresh and fast paced . A cool scene has Clayton sitting at a table eating his meal when he hears some suspicious sounds behind him. Clayton puts his drink on the table and sees the armies behind him with hollowed six guns. <br /> <br /> "Any Gun Can Play" lives up to its title. In fact, many weapons play and at least 20 or more corpses occur before fade-out. This western is not so much a parody as it is a rejection of Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." Remember, bad guys fall as often as ten-pin in a bowling alley, but their deaths are not depicted in the brutal way that a Leone Western has. "Any cannon can play" doesn't take as seriously as the aforementioned Leone masterpiece. The three lead jockey back and forth to supremacy. Each has a piece of puzzle that brings them to the treasure, but they refuse to share their information to the shoot'em up final. Lenser Giovanni Bergamini's colorful widescreen photography is spectacular, especially the opening shoots on the train, which run along the railway tracks with distant mountain peaks that dramatically raise themselves in the background. Another big shot occurs when Montero tests the alien unstable calm. This scene happens after the alien rescues Montero, and the Mexican minions arrive to rescue their chief's bacon. Confiscate the alien six-gun, Montero aims at the poncho-clad hard guy and empties the revolver, places his well-targeted bullets harmlessly in and around the blurry pistols. Bergamini, who photographed Castellari's World War II thriller "Inglorious Bastards," hits the scene with the stranger in the background and his gun in Montero's hand in the foreground for a comfortable three-dimensional shot. Meanwhile, Francesco De Masi's lively orchestral music is as memorable for his own idiosyncratic melodies as Ennio Morricon's soundtrack was for Leone Westerns. The opening song is reminiscent of a 1950's Hollywood Western with its captivating lyrics and guitar riffs. Although not a great spaghetti western, "Any Gun Can Play" is always entertaining nonsense with interesting plotings and good performances, especially the incredible Gilbert Roland, who was 62 at the time!
