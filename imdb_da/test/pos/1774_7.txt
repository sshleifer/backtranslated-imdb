This movie was much better than expected. ++++ In fact, Jean Peters does an acceptable job as a pirate and does decent work in her sword fighting. (To the extent that she might have doubled to do the action, it's hard to tell ... but Peters himself does a good deal of it and does it well.) ++++ With a good and serious script could have been a great movie. But it is basically cheesy. Still entertaining though. ++++ Not up to a regular Jacques Tournier movie, but definitely over a regular Jean Peters movie. Color is typical of this 50's time period, ie. for garish and not realistic. The actors for Blackbeard and her first mate and the drunken doctor were good. Louis Jordan was a little weak. I also don't think Debra Paget was right. But certainly Jean Peters and Debra Paget were probably the two most beautiful female stars in the 50s.
