This short film (and the poem behind it) is one of the greatest metaphors I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The poem is beautiful! It describes exactly the feeling of a person chasing a dream and can't realize it ?? but it also tells how to fulfill it! I see "Cats and Moon history" as a beautiful metaphor for human relations, passion and love. <br /> <br /> Technically, good work has also been done. Despite being very simple, the black and white animation gives an allegory to the film and its message, but also to tenderness and nostalgia. <br /> <br /> In addiction, music also contributes to this poetic feeling. <br /> <br /> "Nothing else means I will wait! She comes when she can or when she wants to!"
