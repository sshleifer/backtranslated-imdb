Free from one scene to another from one story to another, like when walking, from a shady path to an open place, like the wind in the leaves, from one tree to another, how many different sounds? Like when traveling, people meet and tell their stories and then share forever, who knows? And just as when you go through these places full of the lost expectations of another time, the world's human thickness is breathing. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with my friends, not all of them liked it, maybe they were also used to scenario-based and finished stories, I don't know. So this movie is for those stupid who love to watch the sun shining on the sea, go without hurrying in the hills or through the small villages and listening to the growing grass that tells the stories of them below, six feet below, in the hot wind of summer.
