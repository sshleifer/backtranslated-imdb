I took my younger niece to an early view and she LOVED it (I also enjoyed it myself). I don't have to explain the plot, as the film is absolutely true to the award-winning, best-selling book by the famous author Carl Hiaasen. The movie takes the popular book and stores it with beautiful filmography (I'd like to go to Florida now!), Humor (thanks to the funny man, Luke Wilson and some newcomers) and great music! I have to get a Jimmy Buffet CD now! I know a movie is good when I get goose bumps in the end. Overall, it was a great family movie that I felt comfortable taking my younger niece to. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
