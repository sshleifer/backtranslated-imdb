Great movie about a big man. Thomas Kretschmann is first rate as in all his other films. I would never have imagined him as Pope John Paul. It speaks volumes to the casting director. Why do they continue to throw him as a German officer in the movies? And he only came to universal attention for the "pianist"? Of course he looks so hot in the uniforms. I know that many girls fall over his beautiful face. But this guy is a great actor and has such great potentials. If you don't believe me, see "Stalingrad". I hope he will have a lot of excellent roles in the future with more diversity. Otherwise, what a heartbreaking waste of great talent.
