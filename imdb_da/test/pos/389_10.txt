One would have expected Hitchcock's return to major movie film production to fail on the side of chastened caution. Certainly few expected his most riotous, unobtrusive films, a merry melange of evil black comedy, exciting excitement, mocking manipulation and amazing wing of fancy. But that's exactly what they got: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. The remarkable thing is how much Bruno's violation interferes with the film world. Much has been made of the masterful cross-sectional motif, but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress, Guy makes his life and thus the society he represents or eager to join. Guy is the archetypal American, the working class boy did well, moving in influential circles, athletic, successful and beautiful. Bruno is his devastating opposite, gay, decadent, 'European' (he lives by his father, in a big house and lounges just about dreaming about murder). Bruno's life is one of repetition, circularity, while Guy is moving straight ahead. It is Bruno's achievement to move Guy into his realm (represented by merry-go-round) and force HIM to violate (breaking the law, hoping for murder (Bruno's)). Bruno is quite literally struggling with patriarchy. All government figures in the film are criticized - Bruno's father, a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of, but the true scare that is constantly highlighted in the film (especially in Aunt Charles's paintings - the incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); Anna is incredibly Machiavellian, self-serving father; The insensitive judge who does not seem to have lunch after an execution tennis comment, whose smugly authoritative comments are always confused. Hitch, perceived by Robin Wood, is far from being the mother-hater of the legend, is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchs. <br /> <br /> Bruno's violation makes the world topsy-turvy. This is Hitch's most surrealistic movie. When Guy is in his plot, he is filmed just with traditional romantic music. But when Bruno invades, the atmosphere becomes carnival, bizarre, very fun. This is Hitch's first true American film that bursts into the primitive detritus of Americana. Grown men puncture small boys balloons, or try to throw them off joyfully round. Distinguished professors in mathematics sing about goats on trains. Older social patterns are choked on elegant soirees. Washington is a series of extra lines in a great desert under a big sky, like a joking Dali painting. There is one of the biggest and funniest scenes in all cinemas when we see a motionless, smiling Bruno in a sea of ​​turning heads on a tennis match, a picture worthy of Magritte. Just look at a scene with Bruno in it and see it trace in the bizarre. Phalluses are abundant in the most ridiculous permutations - check all these balloons (Hitch had obviously just seen the third man) - as well as in quieter surroundings: Washington will never see the same again. STRANGERS is, regardless of, VERTIGO, Hitch's most obvious sexual film - as well as the fake, the persistent homoerotism, the remarkable game of 'riding' horses; Gobsmacking fellatio joke when Hitch's daughter wastes powder over the policeman. <br /> <br /> And yet, Hitch doesn't stick to good old excitement. In the right attempt to show what a great artist he was, critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place. Much is made by Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates, and Hitch plays merry chaos on audience identification, willing Bruno for murder. There is a hilarious order in which Bruno loses the lighter, which he intends to hit Guy into a drain. The excitement and sigh of relief from that part of the audience I was part of in support of an insane killer is inherently fun, a little disturbing and very revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success. And Hitch milk it with dull joy - listen to the mocking music and exaggerated compositions, and kick yourself to take it all so seriously. <br /> <br /> STRANGERS is one of Hitch's five best movies and is therefore one of the greatest things in the cinema. The dialogue is so strange and brilliant, I can't believe it wasn't written by Chandler. Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful cock who is in charge of her cheeky father when she cheats Guy. The Fairground Final is a remarkable, dizzying fusion of exciting, tense set-piece, black comedy and symbolic site. If Bruno's final words condemn him to hell (according to the Catholic ordinances that Hitch is supposed to represent: comparing to a similar end in the dead), we welcome his integrity, infinitely preferred to Guy's worn down servant of his own.
