The philosophical, meditative tone of this film makes it kind of. I would give it 10 stars for it alone. Having said that, however, which hit me with special force was what I take, perhaps wrong, to be his Art Direction. Many of the internal shoots have a rich composition of color blends apparently based on highly underrated Munsell Color Model advances and complementary side positions. This makes the film unrealistic for modern eyes, but for me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself. I think this movie is totally unique to this quality and if for no other reason does it serve a full, careful digital restoration. Fox, are you listening?
