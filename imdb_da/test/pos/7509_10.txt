This movie is George C. Scott in his very best, Bernard Hughes at his very best and Diana Rigg at her most pithy, and of course Paddy Chaevsky writes on "masterpiece" warp! There are also very short excerpts of future biggies such as Susan Sarandon, Stockard Channing, etc., which have a scene lines that you don't necessarily have to see before your fifth or sixth time watching. Nancy Marchand as a young to middle-aged nurse tutor is also great, as well as virtually every "face" in Hollywood in 1970. It's one of the few movies that gets better the more times you see it. Look for the "surprise" scene ala "Wait for the dark"! This is one of the few movies I've ever bought on DVD. It is so amazing.
