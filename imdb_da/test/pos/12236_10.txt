In the changing world of CG and not for cartoon animation, etc. Faerie was warmly welcomed at least by me. I think it's important to show these kinds of movies once in a while to preserve them and help remind us of how original and fun comics actually came from. People talked about how boring it is because of the graphics and things, but hey! Think of the movies that will be considered boring if each movie looked like the new state of the art that everyone and their mother are doing these days. Call me old-fashioned, but I liked it. It is a wonderful story of supernatural beings and humans, and all that really needs from the audience is their imagination.
