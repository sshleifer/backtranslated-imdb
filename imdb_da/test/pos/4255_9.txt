I thought I might be disappointed to see this movie again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with his honesty and courageous humor. In 1969, the transition between African-American groups from a predominantly consultation and integration policy to a confrontation and self-determination was still quite new and more controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the establishment and the anti-establishment as the caricatures, they often approach in real life. Particular mention is made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he has successfully avoided having his character decay in either sociopathy or buffoonery. I'd rather see this than "To Sir With Love" any old day!
