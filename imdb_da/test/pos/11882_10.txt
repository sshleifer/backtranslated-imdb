This movie would have worked much better if this was the first Critters movie, this is a low budget movie with only two (2) Critters shown on the screen. Why it looks like a mistake is because this is the last Critters movie, and it's so low budget that it seems like the director has made the whole movie with his own pocket money. But I liked this movie, I compare the most to the third movie (which was bad). Critters 4 have a more serious tone in it, the first half of the movie (even without seeing a critter yet) you have a scary feeling to see it, too badly, they don't "milk" the critics, I mean though they only had two (2) puppets, they could still have used them on the screen much more. The critics also have various deaths in this movie, which made this a bit special, especially at the end of the frozen Critter. Ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie, which surprised me. Finally, I liked this because it also has some sort of conclusion to the series, so we will at least not see a Critters 5 anymore. Oh, one last thing I missed a scene in this movie, we never see a Critter shoot a tip from the back, maybe they didn't show that feature, but I was very disappointed not to see it (in Critters 3 we see one lots of spike shooting, which was the only good thing I liked about that movie).
