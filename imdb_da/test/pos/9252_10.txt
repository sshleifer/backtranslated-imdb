Not only was this movie better than the last season of H: LOTS. But it was better than any movie made for TV I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Look at "Top 250" I see that only a small screen movie has made it: How Grinch Stole Christmas. I think it's time to increase this group to 2. <br /> <br /> I admit that the original series had more shows that were better than this, but I didn't mind. I LOVED Just To Get Into The Baltimore Homicide Squad World Again!
