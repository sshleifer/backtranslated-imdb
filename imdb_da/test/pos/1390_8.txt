1891: Stalwart, Morally Fair Military Doctor Lieutenant Claude de Ross (though Claudio Cassinelli) and several other shipwreck survivors wash ashore on a remote tropical island, ruled by an iron fist of the ruthless and sadistic Edmund Rackham (excellent game for the delicious slimy hilt by Richard Johnson) who lives on the island with the feisty Amanda Martin (a winning spunky performance of the overwhelming Barbara Bach) and her unhinged rogue biologist father Professor Ernest Martin (a wonderful dotty depiction of Joseph Cotten). In addition, they discover Ross that Professor Martin has control over a dangerous breed of fishermen exploited as slave labor at Rackham. Director / co-author Sergio Martino tells the lively and absorbing story at a constant snappy pace, providing a tasteful statement about the lush and distant tropical environment. Make an expert job of creating and maintaining a creepy and mysterious atmosphere in the eerie opening third, further spice things up with a good line of dry humor, and introduce the exciting action-packed climax with a significant rip-roaring aplomb. While the central premise is obviously inspired by "the island of Dr. Moreau", the story nevertheless gets much freshness and intrigue because of Martino's artificial message of as diverse elements as voodoo, the lost underwater city of Atlantis mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption, buried treasure , conscientious genetic experiments and even some intriguing coarse fingers between the Ross and Rackham during the thrilling conclusion of a completely dynamic, imaginative and often incredibly entertaining whole. The sound that works from the robust cast qualifies as another big plus: Cassinelli makes for a passionate hero, Johnson essays his succulent crook with super-drag-smacking aplomb, Bach wagering as a pretty retrieving lady in distress, plus there is nice support by Beryl Cunningham as sinister voodoo priestess Shakira, Franco Iavarone as superstitious Jose and Roberto Posse as surly troublemaker Peter. Giancarlo Fernando's lavish widescreen cinematography delivers a host of striking images, while Luciano Michelin's buffing tribal score hits the funky spot. The amphibian humanoid fisherman's creatures are also beautiful in appearance. An extremely fun flick.
