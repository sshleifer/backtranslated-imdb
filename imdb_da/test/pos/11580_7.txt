It is a soap opera drawing on an applied ethical idea. A film about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie. I didn't get any sense of it, the ideas are not new at all, the excitement is lacking, it gets boring to the other half, but in the end I think it will be very interesting in a burlesque way. I mean, you have this middle-aged, paralyzed bald guy who gets more women than Don Juan. He does not seem to suffer as much as you would expect from a person who is completely paralyzed for over 28 years, he has no problems with God (and you would probably expect it too), the people around him seem to be the perfect ones slaves (I can't get out of my mind, Bergman's Cries and Whispers, looks like this in many respects, just bursting with emotions and not all of them humane) etc. This movie is the perfect recipe for housewives looking for some emotional tensions But don't expect to be blown away. The film is worth seeing among all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical problem without any desire to awaken the viewer. Amenabar does not rub your face in it, and he does not take sides, he does not want to make us fanatics to a particular idea. Still, I have no idea why this movie was so highly regarded.
