Antarctica, winter 1982. The team at an American research base is surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians chasing a dog with a helicopter and trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed, and the Americans are left with nothing but a dog, a few organs and questions. It's the beginning of the biggest horror / thriller movie I've ever seen. From the beginning to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and alone in non-country. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know, as far as I can see his score is simple, scary and very good. It really gets you in the right mood. <br /> <br /> The action is amazing! The best performance is probably given by the dog, which is just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs, I can say nothing less. <br /> <br /> You can think of 1982 and special effects aren't the most impressive? Well, think again! You haven't seen it all before you've seen this. Bodyparts fall off and creatures change forms ... Rob Bottin has done a good work witch today stands as a milestone, special effects makeup. <br /> <br /> The movie didn't get a big answer as it first hit the big screen because of other foreign films at that time, and then it's not very well known. In fact, you can almost consider it an unknown movie. No one I have asked has heard of it. But the movie has been able to survive for over twenty years as a cult movie on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time, and with the exception of the haircut, the film is still quite up to date. This movie should be considered a classic. <br /> <br /> The movie is undoubtedly one of mine, if not my favorite. I've seen it several times, but it's as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian, the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady still calls the Norwegians Swedes!
