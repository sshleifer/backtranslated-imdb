What can I say? Not as bad as many here have made it to be. The only reason I even saw this movie I had never heard of before was strictly for IAN McSHANE. I was not disappointed at least. IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings a wonderful subtlety to his role. He is always great to see and for my money ... an extremely underutilized actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the movie .... Every other actor in the movie delivered strong, solid performances. These people were certainly not paid large amounts of cash for their participation (as this was a relatively low budget film), but that did not mean that any of them "emailed" their appearances. Everyone was convincing and convincing with the given parts to them. <br /> <br /> I was even pleasantly surprised at ADRIAN PAUL's performance, though I have to admit that I only saw him in the HIGHLANDER TV series before this movie. well paced and storyline exciting and much like real life, not everything ends in a nice nice little package for you at the end of the movie. Anyone who was expecting a clear, by-number, connects the dots "conclusion" or "answer" at the end of the movie ... CLEARLY didn't watch the movie close enough! This movie is not going to tell you what the "meaning of life" is! The idea is that after watching the movie, you can go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee. I certainly did. <br /> <br /> No car chases ... No explosions ... No bar room brawls .... (sounds pretty boring, huh?) But the reality is that I was completely absorbed by movies and it's just a well-written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved. <br /> <br /> ****** WARNING ... ****** If you are the kind of person who does not like movies that dangle a huge "question" like history's key engine and then quit the movie without answering that question directly ... You can't enjoy this movie.
