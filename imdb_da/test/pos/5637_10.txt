Looking for proof that reality is more entertaining than fiction? You just found it. This amazing documentary about an aspiring feature film player (Mark Bortchart) refusing to admit defeat is the funniest movie I've ever seen - probably because it's also one of the most tragic. Strangely enough, the more I see the movie, the more inspired I become.
