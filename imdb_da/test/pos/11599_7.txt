I watched this movie at the Locarno Film Festival in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai looks great. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 7/10 because of its fine moments. <br /> <br /> * front spoilers * <br /> <br /> It has some really nice biographical moments in it, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> Although my overall feeling is too long (over 2 hours and 40 minutes) and contains too many dialogues. And almost no dance at all. <br /> <br /> Obviously, a Bollywood movie like Lagaan or Devdas is a completely different kind of movie compared to Chokher Bali.
