Anyone who has spent time working in a hospital or medical facility should appreciate this movie. The plot is absolutely wild but entertaining from start to finish. The action is amazing. George C. Scott is the brilliant doctor, but class A failure as husband, father. Diana Riggs, a sex symbol for the 1960s and 1970s (by The Avengers) saves him from himself. The surrounding cast is amazing and the dialogue quite entertaining. I think I enjoyed the movie more on the 4th, 5th or 6th time because I got so much more into the richness of the dialogue and the interaction between the characters. Worth seeing again and again. You just don't want to check in at a hospital in the near future.
