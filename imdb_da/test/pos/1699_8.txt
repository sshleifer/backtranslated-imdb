This movie is not as bad as some say it is infact I think it is more fun than the original. Maybe that's why some people hate it so much because they won't admit it's a good (not big) movie. <br /> <br /> Most if not all, for example, were made by CGI, which I didn't mind at all cos it was an enjoyable movie. Phil Buckman - (Chris) was in my opinion the best guy in the movie Julie Delpy was pretty attractive, she brought the sexy in the movie. <br /> <br /> There were many wisecracks in the movie that I thought was good. This movie is in my collection, but the original is not because I don't like it as much as this one. I didn't get bored when I watched this movie, so I did not like some horror movies I could mention as saying = driller killer & suspiria (dario argento's movie) that is to mention two. <br /> <br /> this is an ok werewolf movie it should be in people's collection if they like werewolf movies maybe i get the original at some point maybe. I have only one complaint and that is Phil Buckman - (Chris) should have been in it more than he was, but apart from that, the movie was fine. Rating for this movie 8/10 an ok werewolf movie not the worst out there. <br /> <br />
