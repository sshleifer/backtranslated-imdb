This was a great anime. It is true that the animation is old, but it is still worth seeing and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was a bit long. Japanese movie star Hiroyuki Sanada, who played Ujio from Last Samurai, played the protagonist Jiro and it was directed by Rintaro who did the Galaxy Express 999 and Metropolis. <br /> <br /> Anime has some great animations for an old anime, interesting characters like the biggest villain Tenkai and Ando Shouzan and of course we must not forget the beautiful musical scores in the movie. All in all, this movie is worth watching for fans of anime, animation in general, action and Samurai / Ninja flicks. Despite being low in the movie, the movie was not a good movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie.
