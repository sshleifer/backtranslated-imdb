"Two Hands" is a great addition to the Australian film catalog. <br /> <br /> It's the curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love that Australians have developed on their own. <Br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to move on, he falls in with a local "Big" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But the moment he puts a first toe on the dark road to crime, he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the reason for the mistake of changing his life in ways unexpected. After getting on the wrong side of Pando by accident, things get very bad very quickly, and if not for a little second world war it would be a short sad movie. Yes, Jimmy teaches a few lessons in life, and no one escapes rudely in one way or another, but at the end it has a good feeling for it. Although there is a lawless theme throughout history, it is not glorified and helps to show how devastating crime can be on normal life. Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and knowledgeable at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan are wonderful as usual. This is a small ensemble of characters that are trustworthy, and I found myself breaking the good guys and not like the bad guys. <br /> <br /> This DVD is usually in the cheap time, so I recommend adding it to your DVD collection, it would be money spent. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
