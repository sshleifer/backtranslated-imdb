The skeleton of the story is that the protagonist must win a public kung fu tournament with high stakes. The flesh of history consists of many battles, a love triangle, fraud, rivalry and revenge. There is much to this story. The main character is very sympathetic as a uniform, gentle way, and very hard country boy. A good versus bad movie is only as good as the bad guys, and the main villains are tough and clever, not to mention ugly, wasted and cumbersome. <br /> <br /> If there is a weakness, it is the scene where the fiance main character depicts her and the protagonist runs toward each other in a thriving field and hugs when they meet. I thought I was watching The Sound of Music for a second and almost lost the hope of the movie. Fortunately, the movie quickly recovered with a battle scene.
