*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** There must have been something in the air in the immediate post-war years that made night towns attractive settings for movies. A number of nightly city films were made at that time and not just in America. One of the most notable was Carol Reed's Odd Man Out, an English image of a wounded gunsmith who strung through Belfast's streets. In America, it was the high noon, or more correctly, high midnight, of film noir. Crossfire is not really movie noir, but has a square of noir, although it uses them for its own goals that are related to bigotry. Directed by Edward Dmytryk, written by John Paxton, it was adapted from a novel by Richard Brooks. The book concerned the murder of a homosexual; In the film, the victim changes to a Jew. Although filmed as a mystery, there is little excitement in the movie, as it is quite obvious who the killer is early on. What makes the film so easy and beautiful is its statement of a city, Washington, D.C., just after World War II, by some of the most gifted artisans who worked in film at that time. Unlike many night films, Crossfire is mainly indoors: in police stations, room houses and all night cinemas. Soldiers are everywhere in the movie and most claws come back to their civilian lives. Yet, most of the men we meet feel that their personalities have been shaped by their military experience; it will be difficult for them to return to their old neighborhoods; for some maybe even impossible. They seem more tied to each other than anything or anyone else. <br /> <br /> But some men are never bound to anyone in the military. The killer, Monty, is such a person. One feels that he was never connected in his civil life either. He is a lonely wolf who also needs humans. Desperately alone, he has a sadistic stripe one kilometer wide and always needs someone nearby to be the ham of his jokes. The man he killed made him no harm and was actually a stranger to him. But when Monty counted on man's religion, it was enough. He didn't really mean killing the guy as it was his intention to "just" humiliate him and just beat him up. But when he was pretty drunk at that time, Monty's nose got better from him. It is this action that sets the story going. <br /> <br /> When the film builds up a steam shock, the other characters quickly come into focus. Monty's opposite number is Keely, another soldier who, although introspective as Monty, and something detached, has no anger at anyone and seems a fair, even gracious guy. Finley, the rowdy murder detective, is dandyish and a tad effete compared to the men in uniform, but shows more than one battle for the various and most recalcitrant soldiers he deals with. The actors playing these roles, Roberts Ryan, Mitchum and Young, provide excellent performances, each with a different key. Ryan, as Monty, is excited and paranoid, always looks for someone to choose; And one can feel his anxiety about becoming a victim himself. As Keely, Mitchum is low key, almost sticky; he never raises his voice; and he seems to have more to say more than is permitted by the script. Young's performance has often been criticized as being too soft, but I find it fraudulently strong and well offbeat. He cut off the stereotype of the hard-boiled policeman, making Finley a little prince of crime detection. <br /> <br /> There are few surprises in Crossfire, although the script is sometimes surprisingly well written, even brilliant. Character actor Paul Kelly gives one of the best short performances in the movies as "girlfriend" to a woman a soldier picks up in a bar. Kelly must or not be her husband; and he may or may not stay with her, although he seems to be relaxed enough in his apartment. The beauty of these scenes is that nothing has been made clear, and this man himself seems more or less confused about what his role is, should or should be. In this way, these few scenes form the thematic core of the film, which is anatomy. With the exception of the detective, all the men in the movie, meaningless and basically lost, kill some more seriously than others. In this respect, Crossfire for the entire sermon is at the end a film about the vigilance of identity and how easy it can be lost or distorted. The men go from one line to another in this movie as they engage in a kind of woozy comrade, their personalities merge into a kind of ordinary American male template. Then something happens that is split down. A word is mentioned, whether 'Jew' or 'hillbilly', and things suddenly get tense, and the very mindset of individuality, an identity outside the group, of someone who is not them becomes deeply offensive, even noisy. Then, after the temper flared and what was touched up, they were resolved or forgotten, the men returning to their loose, non-personal group of normality, and the order being restored.
