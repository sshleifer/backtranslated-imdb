Well, it's new ... Famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci shoots a film about a famous Italian horror instructor called ... Lucio Fulci. After years and years of witnessing horrific horror sequences, it becomes difficult for Lucio to separate reality from fiction and he often hallucinates to commit violent murders. He quickly goes further into a seemingly endless spiral of madness and irresponsible poison. Even the dedicated psychiatrist can't seem to keep Fulci on track ... Now, when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value, Cat in the Brain is definitely one of Fulci's most enjoyable movies. Gore is overwhelming and abundant, to say the least. The amount of dirty massacres is impossible to describe, especially when you are able to get your hands on the completely undeveloped version (referred to aka: "Nightmare Concert"). Depths around, sacrifice bowel are scattered on all sides of the screen and the chainsaws work overtime! The movie will also be unintentionally fun very soon (as it is so exaggerated) and a perfect experience to see with a group of friends when there is beer in the fridge. Of course, from a more professional point of view, this production cannot even be called a masterpiece! There is no minimum voltage or atmosphere to be recorded and the characters are completely empty. To make more room for gore, characters are only introduced for 5 seconds and subsequently die a horrible death. Especially compared to Fulci's highlights - like "The Beyond" or "Do not Torture a Duckling" - this movie looks like a fast-heated snack. The best way to interpret "Cat in the Brain" is as a personal statement by Fulci and a direct attack on censorship. Maybe after seeing so many of his films? especially the latter ?? Being cut by censorship committees and based on pseudo-artistic critics, he wanted to avenge himself by delivering a gory mess that simply cannot be cut! If you take out the explicit violence and the really sick makeup effects, you only have approx. 10 minute recordings left! Especially because the crazy kills resurrect later in the movie, as Fulci re-hallucers them. You can almost hear our instructor thinking things like: "Let's see how you want to censor it now!" Even the entire development of the murder investigation takes place in the background. Are the victims missed by any of their friends or family members? Are there any police officers looking for clues that will lead them to the killer? You do not know, and Lucio does not like to inform you about it, because it would lead to sequences that do not require cutting. Oh, and it's too damn pretentious! The name "Mr. Fulci" or even "Lucio" is mentioned every three minutes (34 times throughout the film, to be precise) and our director clearly enjoys being spotlights for a change. Hi, I certainly don't guarantee him ... After over 30 years of entertaining movies; he deserved to have some extra fun. You are a God, Mr Fulci!
