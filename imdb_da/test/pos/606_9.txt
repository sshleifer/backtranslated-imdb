MINOR SPOILERS <br/> <br /> Misguided classics remain one of Henson's finest and most personal films. It may seem fun to call a movie beloved like this "misunderstood", but people seem to remember this one mostly for Jerry Juhl's snappy manuscript and Paul Williams knockout songs. Although these things are great, as is the movie's formal viability (manuscript-in-manuscript, movie break, etc.), distinguishing 'The Muppet Movie' from the other Muppet films is the serious, wistful thread that runs through the picture . It is a road movie, okay, but like most road films it is the joy of getting there, and the achievement of the characters' goals is tempered by uncertainty and by the knowledge that they can never really come back again. Throughout the movie we are shown on the lower side of the show shop, even before Muppets has done it: Piggy Surrendering Kermit Without a Second Thought on a Phone Call from his Agent, Gonzo Expresses Loneliness and Deplores a Performers Life on the Way in His Haunting ' I'm going to go back there one day, and worst of all, Kermit is continually tortured and tested by Doc Hopper, who wants him to promote his art for the most unfortunate purposes. (One can only wonder what Henson would have made of his family's management of the business after his death.) Kermit himself agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene, and the final 'Magic Store' number asks if it's all been worth it before concluding that it probably has no meaning. All of this was designed with the expected muppet chaos and satire and deliciously horrible jokes, and of course, the serious things wouldn't work if that were not the case. But 'The Muppet Movie' is not just another joke party, as the rest of the Muppet movie's falling recurring movie becomes. No, it's a nice, gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business, and it's just as effective today as it was 25 years ago. 9.5 out of 10.
