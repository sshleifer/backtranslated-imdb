I thought this movie was great! I saw it when it came out in the theaters so I can't remember all the details. I remember it's based on Homer's story of Odysseus. Names places and events change, but you can still see the similarity with the story. <br /> <br /> I found it fun how they would get in trouble and how they would get out of it. I really enjoyed this version of modernized old stories much better than Romeo and Juliet with Clair Danes. <br /> <br /> I agree that in some parts of the story it gets a little silly at times, but all in all, it's a great adventure with some big name actors.
