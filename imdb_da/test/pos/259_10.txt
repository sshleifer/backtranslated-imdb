I watched Love Life on vacation when it was filmed at a movie festival in Florida. It was a wonderful surprise to find a British film that was not derivative or exploitative. A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of the audience who are willing to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the movie. The transitions between scenes I found a little distracting, but as a whole, I think Love Life is a winner, a ruby ​​in the dust. One for the whole family. A pleasant change to watch a British movie for teenagers not filled with four letters. Try and see it.
