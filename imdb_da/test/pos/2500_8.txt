This movie was a sloppy sweet cutesy romantic comedy, just the kind of movie I don't usually like, but this one was just cute enough to keep me interested. It was really fun in an instant (probably why I liked it) and looked just as serious in the next. Plus, it had Ellen in it, and I've always had a soft spot for her. <br /> <br /> Basically, the owner of a bookstore, Helen (Kate Capshaw), finds a love letter in one of the old sofas in her store. She thinks it's for her and gets crazy and tries to find out who sent it. She has a little cut off from the world, so she really throws her in a loop. Eventually, almost everyone finds her with this letter, and they get all mixed signals that create some really fun moments. As I said, I'm usually not one for this type of movie, but I've really hurt up enjoying it and highly recommend it.
