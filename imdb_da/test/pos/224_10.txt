I'm still counting the "Police Squad!" as the absolute funniest television show in the 1980s. Somewhere, at BetaMax no less, I have all six episodes. I knew that a show, this good would not last and that I had to preserve it for myself. How stupid was ABC? They were quoted as saying that viewers did not know that "Police Squad!" was a comedy because it had no laugh! Right! When Drebin has a line like "You just take the chances up in the morning, go to work or put your face in a fan." How can it be comedy?!? I've seen every episode at least ten times and still see something new I missed before. Even the deep backgrounds always have gags continuously. Don't miss it if you have the chance to see an episode, but if you read this, you've probably already copied in a place like I do.
