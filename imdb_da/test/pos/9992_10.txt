I will split my review into the following 5 categories each accounting a maximum of 100% (if perfect) ________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> Visual pleasure: [100%] This is extremely comfortable film visually. I was happy to see it. Golf scenes are very well shot and the dramatic effects on the green were absolutely stunning. I also loved to see the old wooden clubs and the bag. <br /> <br /> The Director's work: [70%] Bill Paxton is more involved in acting, but this film shows he has talent. Made a decent job. Acting: [90%] Shia LeBeouf was very good in her role as Francis Ouimet (this guy can work well). The rest of the casting was also good. <br /> <br /> Entertainment value: [100%] I enjoyed every minute of it. It was overwhelmingly entertaining. <br /> <br /> Script: [91%] Based on a true story, therefore making that movie much more special. It was exciting right from the start and loved every scene to the end. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> My advice: Absolutely a MUST take care of all sports lovers especially Golf (You will all love it). Anyone looking for a nice entertaining movie and not hating sports can see it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
