I love this movie, first of all because Mark Wahlberg is in it, and secondly because the end justifies the funds. There is something about this movie that sucks you in and allows you to feel all the feelings that people feel. Jen Aniston is great as a girlfriend in this movie. It takes a look at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived back in the day (maybe these days they just got weaker). It takes through a rainbow of emotions and has many subtle facets to allow light through. Like a diamond, this film shines. You don't waste your popcorn on this one. Semi-chick flick but my husband enjoyed it too. There are also some laughs thrown in.
