Peter Boyle was always a great actor and he proved it by his performance as a gun-ho Bigot, which made me hate every time he used the N-word, I saw him and his big mouth and wanted to turn his light out. (Just think Peter Boyle was a monk once) (Now a supportive actor in "Everybody Loves Raymond") Susan Sarandon makes her first debut need a bath right away and enjoyed sharing it with someone else in her own dirty water. I noticed a great Raggerty Ann Doll (creator, John Gruelle) was the only thing Susan really could trust and loved, and the doll appeared in a couple of scenes. If you really want to know about the way out of the 70s with drugs, free love and dream dreams, then enjoy the excellent direction of John G. Avildsen ("Rocky and" The Karate Kid "). I always thought Peter Boyle should have been blown away in the end! This is definitely a cult-worthy worth seeing and sharing with others.
