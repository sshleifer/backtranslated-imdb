it's the best movie I've ever seen !!!!!! i just love them !! I see it every day! I have episodes from the internet! here in Romania the 6 season is being broadcast! I am glad that I have seen the show from the start, and I am glad that I can watch the 7 season over the Internet. So far, season 5 is my favorite: D I love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. I've also had Dean, but Logan is the best. I want Lorelai to stay with Christopher because he is beautiful. This show is good for all ages and is worth seeing. I really want the DVDs, but I think that here in Romania will never be shown because I think they don't even know they have fans here. But whatever, I want to see it. Goodbye!!
