Cinema, is the best entertainment. If one is to question any aspect where one finds room for disagreement and much of the recorded history is based on contemporary opinions - often biased - then one must leave the cinema because their prejudices will always spoil their enjoyment. When I saw an airplane flying overhead in a movie dated 33BC, I was entertained. The background landscape of "Casablanca" is absurdly false. Then I sit down and say that the movie couldn't convince? Fiona, relax and enjoy some great plays. Wajda's decision to throw the protagonists as French and Polish was inspired. one was immediately aware of which side each of the protagonists represented. No need to dwell on the authenticity of the wigs. This is a powerful movie theater. If there is a political message that is still relevant today - eat a party - a Château d'Yquem with foie gras; a Puligny Montrachet with main courses; some Polish vodka sorbets and maybe a 1961 Château Lafite-Rothschild with beef - and discuss the political aspects of Danton until you lose fatigue. Danton would definitely have agreed?
