A teenage movie about anxiety, friendship, loyalty and adult? But this is not a good excursion on its part because of the circumstances and the life-changing dilemmas surrounding the premise. What may be quite numb, joking, and just cold. But I was expecting something a little more powerful and effective, and while it was enchanting and unforgettable, it didn't quite get in the way of emotion. The performances are reasonably a mixed bag, but there is a brutal honesty to them all. Dennis Hopper and especially Daniel Roebuck are amazing ?? Crispin Glover eccentrically over, it seems and Keanu Reeves' dead like wooden corner pays off in his tailor-made role. Joshua John Millar is pretty good and it's Ione Skye. Jim Metzler chimes in with a short but very engaging performance. The story is dramatically confronted, character-laced and harrowing in its eventual collapse, where it infuses a gritty and painful blow. JÃ¼rgen Knieper's swirling music score tastes of anxiety, excitement and wonder, as morals and obligations are tested and learned.
