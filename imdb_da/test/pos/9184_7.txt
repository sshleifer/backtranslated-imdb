Not having seen the movie in its commercial debut, we just caught it with DVD. Expecting the worst, "Hitch" turned out to be a pleasant experience because of the three main characters in it. Thanks to Andy Tenant's direction, the movie has an easy pace, and while predictable, the comedy has some winning moments. <br /> <br /> Hitch is a sort of "date coordinator" for losers like Albert, who is not exactly what one would consider a hunk. Still, Albert is a real guy who, without any professional help, would go unnoticed by the same women he would like to take out. Enter Hitch to prepare him to overcome the obstacles he cannot overcome, and although Albert becomes overweight and never master social gracies, he overcomes us because he is a genuine, in sharp contrast to all the phonies that do rounds in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> The basic mistake that most production designers make when preparing Hollywood movie sites is how ignorant they are with reality. The apartments, where they place these characters, are so rare to find that only the film's magic can make these people live in places like these. It is clear that most filmmakers deal with imagination, as most city dwellers would kill for spaces that are as fabulous as those they show in the movies, let alone the same people depicted in the movie cannot afford them. <br /> <br /> Will Smith is a charismatic actor. He has a disarmed way of charm without doing much. The surprise of the movie, however, is Kevin James, who, as the overweight Albert not only wins us over, but he proves he can keep himself in his scenes with Mr. Smith. Eva Mendez is fine as Hitch's main interest. In smaller roles, among others, Adam Arkin, Amber Valletta, Michael Rappaport and Phillip Bosco are seen. <br /> <br /> "Hitch" is a fun movie to be seen thanks to the inspired direction of Andy Tenant.
