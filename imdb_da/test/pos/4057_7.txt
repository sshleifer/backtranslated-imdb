It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's career. It is an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure, but not entirely up to the actors' standards, especially not Roberts. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and has some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def. <br /> <br /> Showtime is about two very different police, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). You take work seriously in a low profile, quiet way, while the other is more light and wants more fun than criminals in the back seat. They are both following the same crimes behind a huge cape of television, VCRs, etc. They cross paths and a television station wants a new reality TV show so they fight for crimes while on TV. Mitch hates the advertisement while Trey loves it with his line, "It's Showtime!" Their TV antics and methods appear on TV and they are the new "Cops" show. The fun begins. <br /> <br /> All in all, Showtime is a fun action comedy. A good movie, but not quite up to the actors' expectations and standards. But it rolls together as it enters and parodies reality TV shows. A good break from shows like Cops. Really at the end, just a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> Eliason A.
