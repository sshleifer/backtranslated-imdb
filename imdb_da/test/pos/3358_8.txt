I'm a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will change it. I got all the tapes, DVDs and audiobooks and every time I watch / listen to them is brand new. <br /> <br /> The movie. The movie is a reverberation of certain episodes, Man and Hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School and many others with a different edge. The introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was an excellent move - especially when he didn't pay the account (something rarely done now). It follows through the early years to get equipment and uniforms, startup and training. All in all, it's a great movie for a boring Sunday afternoon. <br /> <br /> Two draw backs. One is the Germans fake dodgy accents (came one, the Germans can't pronounce the letter "W" like us) and Two Casting by Liz Frazer instead of the well-known Janet Davis. I like Liz in other movies as the pillars, but she does not carry it properly in this, and Janet Davis would have been the better choice.
