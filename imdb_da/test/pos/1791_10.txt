As Margot in "Fear of Fear" becomes the victim of his ambitious man, Fox in "Fox and his friends" driven to suicide by his girlfriend who took all his money away, like Xaverl Bolwieser in "The Stationsmaster's Wife" who goes to jail to give his cheating wife a chance to get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann, seeking refuge in insanity to escape his stupid wife and bankruptcy company, so also Hans Epp is the victim of the German "Wirtschaftswunder" Society after Second World War in RW Fassbinder's "The Merchant of the Four Seasons". Simply from the fact that Fassbinder played through social abuse between men and women as well as between heterosexual and homosexual couples, it must be clear that he does not favor any gender. <br /> <br /> In Hans Epp's case, there are those women who drive him to despair, illness and eventually death. When he comes back from the foreign legion where he flew because he could no longer stand over the mother's pressure, she complains that he is still alive while the good boy from his neighbor had been killed. Then Hans gets a job as a policeman, but is surprised by his husband while he is seduced by a prostitute. After losing his job, he works as a fruit grocery store with little income, going from backyard to backyard "crying" his product. His mother, one of his sisters, and her husband are ashamed of having such "street work" in their family. "The love of life" (she has no name in the film) refuses to marry him because his job does not match her social status and origin. Then he married Irmgard, whom he didn't love, and didn't love him. From her constant pressure on him, he flies to drink. One evening, after his wife stalked him, he exploded and hit her. She flies to her family, for which this event was just what they were waiting for. When Irmgard calls a divorce lawyer, he suffers a heart attack. Imrgard decides to stay with him, but from now on he is no longer allowed to do heavy work and drink alcohol. So he begins to feel more and more redundant, becomes quieter and quieter and more and more depressed. When he finds out that Irmgard is cheating on him, he chooses to end his life, but not as Hermann Hermann by taking a walk in the light of madness, but he drinks himself in front of Imrgard, their little daughter and his bursting friends. Fassbinder said in an interview that Hans knew what he was doing. The question, however, is: Has Hans just killed himself because he could no longer stop his miserable environment, or did he self-righteousness?
