L'Homme Blesse is not for an impatient, adventure-seeking audience. There are no explosions or the drama is straightforward. Like Lynne Ramsey's film, the director works more deeply with mood than with narrative in a way that is effective and incredibly moving. Because it does not depend on free nudity or superficial pop culture. The story lines, this is frankly one of the best gay foreign films I've seen (see also Francois Ozon, Pedro Almodovar). Nicolas Roeg's "Do not Look Now" gets a lot of bad press because it is sold as a horror movie. The movie that L'Homme is more than what the box can make you believe. If you're in the mood to sit back and be absorbed by the cinema's subtle transformed powers, you'll love this movie.
