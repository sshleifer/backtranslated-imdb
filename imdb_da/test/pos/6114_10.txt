Well, I can safely say I'm human, Wong. And I didn't throw up. I laughed. And laugh. If this movie made you puke, there is something wrong with you. But this movie is incredible. I bought it four days ago and have seen it 5 times already. The cruelty of the animal gets my heart but not long enough to be guilty. The film is shocking, disgusting and vulgar. The action is horrible. What more do you want from a movie? I'm a die-hard cool movie maniac. Pink Flamingos are amazing. That makes Rocky Horror, as someone has said, similar to the teletubbies.
