Here you see Mr. Eastwood in all its glory (ie at the top of its form as an actor and at the height of his physical appeal), but the "ladies" depicted are hardly typical of the South, then or now. The young girls at the boarding school are incredibly naive, some show signs of developing into truly depraved women, and Geraldine Page, who is fully blown in her corruption, hardly represents the strange when it comes to wives from girls' schools, either now . (That is not to say that there is no occasionally bad apple in a barrel.) Mr. Eastwood has said this is one of his own favorite films. <br /> <br /> "Beguiled" has an original plot, many attractive characters and many surprises in the shop of the viewer. It is thoroughly exciting and entertaining, but not really realistic. (I know I've grown up in the South and attended a girls school and college. In addition, I've been familiar with countless girls who did the same, not to mention their backward teachers, or even say "repressed professors "It was far from the gentleman depicted here.) She is actually comical in her depiction of a southern gentle woman who is not quite what she thinks. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bit scandalous when it first appeared and is still, I think, but you won't be sorry you spent your time watching it.
