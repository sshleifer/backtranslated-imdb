I don't know if I would go so far as to say that this movie belongs to the "Aussie trash" pile, but it is fair to say that there are no Academy Award nominees here. What is to be considered is that most of the actors in this movie were not really actors as such, just children with something better to do at that time. There were many others who were offered roles in the movie but knocked them down to surf the coast; All in all, it really wasn't a bad movie for his time. In some respects, it's really not unlike today's times, where peer pressure still lives and kicks, just without cell phones, computers and other similar gadgets that kids lived without, unlike this generation. Anyway, I have to judge this flick as an old fave, which I see once in a blue moon and never take too seriously ...
