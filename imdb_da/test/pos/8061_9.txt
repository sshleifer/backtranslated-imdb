I read "Anne Frank: The Girl of a Young Girl" when I was in high school and found myself completely confused in her story and also in the Broadway game in her life in the secret annex. <br /> <However, I'm a little confused about how people have perceived her diary and her as a person and see her as a little saint or have a message of hope for the world. I don't think it was the original intention of her diary. She wrote it mainly for herself, though she made some rigorous rewrites before the residents of the secret annex were betrayed and intended to be published one day. <br /> <br /> But I never saw her as a saint or as a messenger of hope ... but as a very talented writer who could express her thoughts very well and very entertaining in a diary. There was no doubt that she was a very engaging author, and she has an extraordinary talent in expressing herself fully in words. You really got to know her well through her diary. But the importance of her diary lies in the fact that it is a will and an important historical document on the evidence that the Holocaust happened. It also took the Holocaust's tragedy closer to home, losing a person to whom we could put a familiar face and personality at such a young age ... literally, her young life had ripped away from her and from the other residents who became murdered in the Holocaust. It is a hurting accusation for the Nazi systematic murder of over 6 million Jews, and it should not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> But I'm sorry that her diary is so misunderstood as anything more than that. Looking for hope, I have the Bible ... the first most read non-fiction book in the world. The word of God in the Bible is eternal ... but Anne's diary is a diary for a young girl in exceptional circumstances, and that is it. She is not someone to be worshiped or idolized because she was a common girl with many mistakes who had incredible talent as a writer and who died for 15 years from typhoid in the concentration camps in Bergen-Belsen. She was the victim of the Holocaust, and when this otherwise outstanding documentary has such a living witness, she was Hitler's most famous victim. <br /> <br /> In addition to the history of Anne Frank ... the stories of her family members and friends and survivors of the Holocaust were exciting, vibrant, and powerful. I especially enjoyed Miep Gies' testimony and wondered that she is still strong and alive today. Hannah Goslar's testimony was also very interesting. And I also liked to hear from Otto Frank. But I also agree that the moving image of the young girl with the dark hair and the known big eyes at the end was particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> Another thing about the Holocaust that I disagree with the documentary ... is that I don't think it was just a matter of discrimination ... but rather something deeper and deeper, and It was just an act of pure evil. Pure evil. Nothing but pure evil. <br /> <br /> Excellent documentary from Anne Frank and the Holocaust to be seen.
