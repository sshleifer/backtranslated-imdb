LIFEFORCE is an extremely schizophrenic film based on Colin Wilson's novel The Space Vampires script ignores most of the novel's concepts and structures (in fact, it's more to the QUATERMASS series than the novel), but the scenes it goes from the novel are almost identical to those of the movie. And talking about the script must be one of the most uneven in the history of the cinema, but it is written in chapters of several different people. For example, take Carlson, he disappears after the early shuttle scenes that led me to believe he was dead, so he returns halfway through the movie to explain the plot to the besieged Britons, and that is the lack of attention from the actors It destroys the movie. And there are plenty of other clumsy writings that the heroes who return to London in a helicopter and have not realized it have been driven by zombies until they fly over it. <br /> <br /> I could go on lengthy about these plot holes, but LIFEFORCE is actually fun to watch as long as you don't use your brain. It is good to see a sci-fi horror movie from an era where foreigners were portrayed as fun creatures that children hid in their bedroom so that scary human adults would not get their hands on them. Special effects and pyrotechnics are very good, there are lots of action and stunts, and LIFEFORCE has one of the most memorable foreigners in the form of the butt. When mentioning LIFEFORCE in conversation with men, it is always a race to say "See the alien in LIFEFORCE? She can suck the life force out of me anytime." Almost surprisingly, the demographics of the voices see that this movie is more popular with men than females <br /> <br /> "Don't worry. A nude girl can't escape from here" Can't she? Pity <br /> <br />
