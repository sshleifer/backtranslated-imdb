We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you haven't seen the Oldboy (or the sympathy trilogy for that matter), you're missing some of the best movies made in this century. But I'm not here to talk about them. I'm here to talk about thirst. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what you would expect. Yes it is a vampire movie, but at the same time it is also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl. I don't want to get into synopsis (you can read the above) but instead tell you what this movie has to offer. Chan-wook Park is a master of filmography and this film is no exception. With some very surreal scenes supported by intense lighting, he puts the mood perfectly in almost every scene. The movie starts a bit slowly, but I felt it was necessary to build a relationship with the characters. When things start moving along it, it almost never goes before the credits roll. "Thirst" is predominantly a love story, but not in the same sense as you would think. The relationship between the protagonists is very intense, but at the same time disturbing. Chan-wook Park is no stranger to controversy as we know, and this movie touches taboo almost as much as oldboy. The final scene is by far the most powerful in the movie, and perhaps one of the best conclusions for a movie I've seen. All in all, this is a unique movie that I feel all movie buffs should see. It is an exciting (and different) to take on the world of vampires, and romance is far from juicy or boring. This movie is gritty, selfless and beautiful in all the wrong ways. Of course this is not for everyone, but chances are if you read this review you are already interested. See it. Do not hesitate
