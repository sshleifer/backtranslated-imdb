This is the standard fare of a director who has long been among my favorites. Although it is very flat compared to many of his other work, but it is Argento and it can be biased but I will give it a good review anyway. <br /> <br /> It contains many good ideas. The subtle voyeuristic element. The needles under the eyes. The gory and disturbing deaths. And the Argentine clich√© flashback. <br /> <br /> Cons include heavy metal soundtracks, plays and the end. <br /> <br /> All the movies are worth the birds in the theater sequence near the end. <br /> <br /> A pretty good movie from Argento, but he's done better. Much better!
