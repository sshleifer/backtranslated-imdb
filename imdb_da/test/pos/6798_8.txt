Mickey Rooney (like Mi Taylor) is a young man running along the figurative road to ruin, where he meets 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor (like Velvet Brown) - she loves horses, but he has a dull story with the animals. Ms. Taylor is enchanted by Mr. Rooney's horse dance; She takes him home and gets him room and table with her family. They are very well supported by Anne Revere and Donald Crisp (like Mr. and Mrs. Brown). Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are Taylor's strained siblings. <br /> <br /> The basis of "National Velvet" is prohibitive for a mistake; For example, conditions leading to Taylor's turn in the "Big Race" are quite straightforward (but were probably more credible on paper). Nevertheless, the character's connection to horses and to Mrs Revere's character is well thought out. Rooney and Taylor are outstanding in the lead; There is a balance between Rooney's fading "child star" and Taylor's incredible new "child star" that adds depth to their characterizations. <br /> <br /> The outstanding achievements of Rooney and Taylor are further enhanced by fine-tuning, photography, and editing by Clarence Brown, Leonard Smith, and Robert Kern. A sentimental classic. <br /> <br /> ******** National Velvet (12/14/44) Clarence Brown ~ Mickey Rooney, Elizabeth Taylor, Anne Revere
