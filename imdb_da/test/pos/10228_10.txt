I would love to see some connection between NightBreed, The Fury and the X-Men Series, as the way the other extreme border line would bind - especially stories and plot lines to the fact of creating a story Arc even though you were never thought. I would also like to know if there is any more information available - anecdotal or otherwise, anywhere about the relationship and / or the cooperation between Clive Barker and David Cronenberg. I simply can't think that David Cronenberg appeared as an actor in a Clive Barker movie. Is there any additional information on the subject really? Finally, it has been 17 years since the film was released, and I was hoping that there would now be a successor. Is there anyone out there who knows if there were any plans to do what never came to fruition or if there were actually plans for a successor now?
