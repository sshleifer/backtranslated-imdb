... and my reasons for that are simple - there are so many good films presented and discussed here (most of their own directors and stars), so many clips of infamous moments in the 70's movie story and indeed a number of movies I have not yet seen that it would not be fair to judge this work. With this logic, I should not have rated other film documentaries such as Martin Scorsese's personal journey through American films and my trip to Italy. But while these films were based on a man's cinema view that tells most of the time, Richard LaGravanese and (late) Ted Demmes' Decade leave the movies and the creators to speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> What does 'decade' mean that at least one watch for movie buffs, or just the likes of the late 60s-70s movies in America, are the levels that go to that in the undamaged version (three hours, not the theatrical version that I have no comment on) lots of ground is covered. Interviews include Scorsese, Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet, Julie Christie, Jon Voight, Francis Ford Coppola, Paul Schrader, Pam Grier, Bruce Dern, Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Dennis Hopper, Robert Towne etc. flow of insights from start to finish. The way the cliffs and instructors discover, is edited together in a flashy and fast style, is also fascinating. <br /> <br /> The one down comment I have on the documentary is that most of the information provided has been reported in various books, such as Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, and even though I haven't seen the movie version of that book, I'm sure it would have covered many of the movies and directors and events like here (in fact, the book is one of the best I've ever read. But this documentary serves as something special for movie buffs and occasional filmmakers - they can look at this and learn not just about so well-known pictures as Easy Rider, The Last Picture Show, Annie Hall, Coming Home and landlord known as scarecrow, panic in Needle Park, The Landlord, Joe, they shoot horses do not. also learn about who has influenced them (new waves in Europe and Asia), who they served as influence and how the topic that created controversy after the controversy still serves as exciting and chances for contemporary volumes. ut!
