It was not surprising to me that this was a very depressing and draining film. It is all about the impact of the war on civilians, and it is of "King of Depression", Ingmar Bergman. In other words, so many of Bergman's works dive deep into human misery and anxiety, so this movie does not seem to be so unusual from this director. Though it is harder to see, the last half of the movie may provide more insight into the lower depths of man. That's because initially the protagonists (Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow) try to overcome adversity and basically are decent (but a little stupid) people. But as deprivation after deprivation occurs, they (especially Von Sydow) become smaller and less humane and more expensive - do something to survive. <br /> <br /> Fun to watch, NOT ERROR! But an interesting insight into human nature. PS - 1 thing I LOVED about this movie is that it avoided a stupid movie chiche. When the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or a wine, they finished the wine completely! In most films, they hardly touch their drinks or leave them untouched. It runs me wildly since I would never leave an alcoholic beverage at $ 4 without drinking it, unless it tasted terrible or had a bug floating in it! BRAVO!
