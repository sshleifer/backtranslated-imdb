Why all the negative reviews ??? You don't expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece, did you ??? What we have is a movie that tried to entertain us and it worked for me. Not an oscar contender, just entertainment. You can really see how the movie is old, especially with everything the Internet has to offer today. I still remember when this was first released and the web was still so new. Crazy and scary thoughts when I saw this for the first time; I was 15 years old and thought seriously that someone could get your information on a computer and destroy you. But who can say it can't happen ??? I'm not the kind of person who kills a movie, analyzes it until I'm blue in the face. It's not my style. Average action, suspicious and once again, very entertaining. Sandra Bullock as Angela Bennett is so sweet. This is my favorite movie with her in it because she is like computer genius that I find very attractive. Of all the films released in 1995, it would be my favorite, even though I didn't see it until 1996. My rating, 9/10 because it dropped a little.
