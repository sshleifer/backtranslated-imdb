I am deeply grateful to have seen this movie. The action is amazing, the film itself is powerful and clear, and the problems involved are dealt with subtlety and depth. <br /> <br /> This is an important movie. It could be deeply transformative. <br /> <br /> I'd pay good money never, ever to see it again. Because it is * so good and so complex, it is extremely difficult to see. I admit that my taste in film has a strong direction towards light entertainment; The visual medium can be so powerful that I usually avoid it for something really important. Those of you with greater strength than I have can find it easier to handle. <br /> <br /> But I strongly urge people to see it at least once. Preferably with others so you can talk to each other and get someone to remind you that there is more to the world than the movie.
