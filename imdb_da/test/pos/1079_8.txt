I saw this at the London Film Festival last night, apparently the shorter version. James McNally's summary of the movie's content is very good. Nossiter combines his study of the wine industry much more with regard to globalization, homogenization, the impact of the mass media, the power of capital and the need for diversity. <br /> <br /> The movie is shot on the hand, held DV, as some may find offputting, but allowing Nossiter to catch people on guard on a number of occasions that would probably not have been possible by more conventional equipment. <br /> <br /> Despite the scattering feeling of the film, editing is very sharp, not only gives us a parade of world dogs, but also underestimates a number of interviewee comments with somewhat conflicting visual images and gives others adequate ropes to hang themselves. To a certain extent, this caused Michael Moore's recent work (although Nossiter operates in a more subtle way), but probably the roots of the films go back to Marcel Ophul's' Sorrow and Sin, both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of the 'earth of the earth' French peasants as the stars. The Montille pere et fils were present at the LFF screening and answered questions afterwards. In fact, we all need a little suffering - Bravo Hubert! All in all, an excellent movie with implications that goes far beyond the world of wine in the way we construct ourselves as humans and organize our world.
