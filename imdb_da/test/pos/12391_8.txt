Emilio is a successful businessman, a perfect father and a good man. Or that's what everyone thinks. The perfect story he has carefully built along these years begins to shut him down suddenly. Will he be able to keep up with his own lies? <br /> <br /> This is a very well-laid drama, with great acting and stable direction. Although the plot is pushed up to the limit to increase excitement, the film explores some of our worst fears ... Do we really know the people we deal with? Can we be so secure? History is evolving at an ever faster pace as it reaches the point where Emilio no longer has control over his lies. A lot of Spanish films have interesting stories, but are far from technical skill. The perfect rhythm and well-shot scenes make the actors so credible that we enter Emilio and hate him and suffer for him as his situation becomes increasingly desperate. There is no need for any Spanish folklore, nor is it an attempt to create a Hollywood style. This is real Spain, 2002, and regardless of the obvious unlikelyness of Emilio's life in reality, there are good chances that we know are not like the person he claims to be. Not just a great commercial product, it will let you wonder where lies can get us into. Can we stop? <br /> <br /> Well done.
