Although the video box for many copies of this movie claims it's about people turning in, it's a total lie. In fact, apart from the opening segment, not even a horror movie. With its sunken treasure, legions of fishermen and crazy scientists, it's much more like a Doug McClure adventure movie. Of course, this movie is not a work of art, but it is fun to see ... Just be warned that the beginning is pretty gory.
