Christian Duguay led this early little espionage thriller early in his career. It is played on television fairly regularly, albeit with some amazing scenes of violence and sex, unfortunately trimmed. I finally came to see the theatrical version on a $ 3 tape from the local video store. Avid Quinn is being recruited to imitate the infamous Carlos Jackal, and becomes a bit confused in the role. Donald Sutherland Ben Kingsley plays Quinn's superior, with Sutherland a true zealot and Kingsley as the more planned. The first half of this fun flip shows that Quinn is being trained and indoctrinated. The other half has him out in the field and loved Jackal's woman and shoots it out with various enemies. The idea is to make the hunt look like a skin to the Russians, and let them take care of the world's most infamous assassin. Things don't run out as planned. At times, I almost expected the cast to break out with some of the corny dialogue, but they all play it very straight. In the end, this is a great little thriller that deserves your attention. The Jackal's former mistress teaches the noble and very married Quinn to coarse her up, lick blood from her face and then go down on her, alone, worth the price of admission.
