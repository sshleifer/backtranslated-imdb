I've been a fan of Amanda since All That, and she's still fun. For me, it is as simple as that. If you like Bynes, you will like this movie. It is harmless fun and quite fun in parts. We are crazy Sebastian accent and way is completely unrealistic, but made me laugh so hard at some points I almost crawled on my popcorn. <br /> <br /> And everything that makes teens reading Shakespeare (maybe) is a good thing for me. <br /> <br /> On a low note, Tatum Channing is quite * ahem * freaking hot. He also does a good job with some of the movie's harder scenes. <br /> <br /> Some of the side signs are very wide, but they are wide in "twelfth night" so it's cool.
