The English are a little too evil, the Scots are also a bit <br /> <br /> heroic. The dialogue is too dramatic at times and <br /> <br /> the transition between scenes can be smoother. <br /> <br /> Still, "Bruce" has the feel of authentic, if not polished, <br /> <br /> story ... even though it plays loosely with some important <br /> <br / > facts. <br /> <br /> Sandy Welch is no Gibson or Branagh, but he does a stalwart <br /> <br /> Bruce. And Brian Blessed chews the scenery in lovely <br /> <br /> villain as Edward I. <br /> <br /> While lacking the budget needed to make the final battle truly impressive, they still shook an impressive crowd to those <br /> <br /> English and Scottish armies. It is, according to the filmmakers, the <br /> <br /> "biggest filmed reconstruction of medieval battle ever staged in the British Isles." <br /> <br /> Allows a few flaws, the movie still <br /> <br /> makes a compelling portrayal.
