There isn't much that comes close to the perfect pace and narrative action-packed levels like "GoldenEye". When it came out, it was the best full-time game and even today it remains strong. <br /> <br /> I will admit that this game became boring after a few months of playing and not playing it again until two years later, I was withdrawn to its biggest, almost as if I was playing it for the first time again. <br /> <br /> There are 20 action-packed levels, which is probably the most of any James Bond game to date. Probably the most unforgettable is the Tank level, which was probably the most explosive video game sequence at that time. And the first-person shooting as well as the use of Q gadgets is what James Bond fans always die to use. <br /> <br /> Frankly, as a James Bond fan, I look for aspects of a true James Bond experience now appearing in the PS2 games. So this game, while having some good actions and useful gadgets, I expected a little more, even back in 1997. I also didn't like this game not having Q or M or Moneypenny or anyone from MI6. While watching the movies, Bond interacts with these characters at least a few times in each movie, but they are nowhere to be seen in this game. And vocal dialogue would have made the game more lively instead of the text dialogue they use to use. They had the technology. They just didn't use it. <br /> <br /> It is most likely that the most annoying element of this game is that in some ways it follows the story of the movie precisely, and in other ways it is incoherent. For example, there are two many levels where you have to protect or save Natalya, even though you can take care of yourself in the movie. There are also some unnecessary levels such as the boat level where you have to disarm some bombs (which are not in the movie), which adds nothing to the story at all. There are even some levels where you save Natalya, but at the beginning of the next level she gets caught again. How? <br /> <br /> Oh yes. Even the little things can't really put this game down. And while I prefer the newer games, this Bond experience is definitely one you will not forget. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
