I love dogs, and the most interesting character in this movie is a Golden Retriever. He is smarter, better looking and more interesting than any of the human characters. Like many other contributors, I haven't read the book, but I doubt having done that would change my mind about the movie. It is predictable from the first five minutes on. No surprises. Food scientists create a monster that detaches and a teenage age gown and his wonder dog collaborate to destroy it. All in all, the film is a dog. But as I said, I love dogs and will therefore give this movie a 7/10 rating. See if it comes on TV, rent it if you're bored, and nothing else catches your eye, but don't buy it unless it's special.
