Mon Oncle Antoine observes the crooked face of a homespun community from different angles, slowly and takes its time through the beginning as it should, until we come from broken (but banal) hopes and expectations of whirling ecstasy of dreams and a heart-stopping revelation about the terrible mystery of mortality. <br /> <br /> Infinite pans and zooms over the snow-covered mountain side comfort the mind and hypnotize the viewer. This restless camera work is personified in a fringe character that is just like the drifts, completes its work on the coal mine and leaves its family to cut timber and then ends again and returns to his boy's poor humanity. <br /> <br /> Getting an old woman cheats on her husband and a young boy dies. Old things are new and new things die. The whole thing is snow-covered whiteness, which strangely touched the history of the cinema.
