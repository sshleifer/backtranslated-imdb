in history. It is real mixed with Americana - and very original. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is a young girl tired of her boring life working with a minimum wage job in New England. Her shabby boss suggests her - she quits and takes some money from the registry. Driving from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida, is not a short ride and her Ford Escort dies out. She then meets a personal elderly couple, portrayed by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have an RV and gracious offer to help her out - it's not safe for a girl to be alone on the road. Especially I-95. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is very realistic as Alice, and initially Judith Ivey lets the character help her; buy her decent clothes, cosmetics, etc. In the beginning, it's a good holiday for Alice, who hopes to stick to her boyfriend who attends college in Miami. There is interesting filmography as the trio drives the RV down to Florida: the resting places, bland scenery and finally beautiful mountains in North Carolina. Finally, there is something wrong and the Ivey character seems to have produced stories about her daughter, as well as her husband, who now seems a little scary. <br /> <br /> I don't want to ruin the result of this movie - but it does end positively as the audience is waiting for excitement - This movie reminded me of Spielberg's "Duel" - while it was not so threatening - the story is moral - You never know what people think - especially if you drive nationwide. Beware!!. You will enjoy this movie.
