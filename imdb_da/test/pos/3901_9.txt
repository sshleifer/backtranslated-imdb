This was a riveting movie, one that really penetrated me. I am a big fan of William H. Macy and he is doing a fantastic performance. His similarity combined with the way his character breaks the fourth wall really gave me a sense of compassion in his actions. I thought I was waiting intently for the whole card house to come together about him (and by extension himself as his confidential and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax when the movie was finished, so I was wrapped in it. <br /> <br /> Good shows also around, not just with Macy. The arkin was pretty good as it was Cromwell (he was surprisingly hard). In short, I highly recommend this movie to all fans of Macy and / or the murder mystery. But you may want to prepare yourself to feel a little guilty.
