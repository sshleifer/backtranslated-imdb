Another masterpiece that needs a DVD release, but some libraries have VHS and it's worth searching. Just a brilliant game about many things, first and foremost euthanasia, "respectability", religion and basic human relationships. The script effectively uses intelligent humor, not only to deal with a problem as a severely handicapped child, but to bind the parents in their love of "Yes" and each other. As the couple Alan Bates and Janet Suzman match perfectly in the real virtuosity and in bringing their deep, intelligent characters to life. I have recently seen Bates brilliant performance in "Butley", which was released as a movie a few years after "Joe Egg", and he plays a teacher in both cynical, intellectual and fun, although Butley is much darker than his character of Bry here. If you throw such great performances in "The Go-Between", "Women in Love", "Whistle Down the Wind", "The Caretaker" and "Georgy Girl" not to mention the more obvious "King of Hearts" and " Zorba the Greek "and I would say that Alan Bates had a career comparable to Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney and the other great British actors in his era. <br /> <br /> Director Peter Medak also had one of my all-time favorites "The Ruling Class" released that year (1972) as "Joe Egg", which includes a career year in one's book. He has had some kind of nice filmography ("The Krays" was another highlight), but these two gems will mark him as a great instructor.
