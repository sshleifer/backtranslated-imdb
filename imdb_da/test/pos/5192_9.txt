I found the movie very real as much as saving Private Ryan and giving an upfront account from the German perspective. The graphic action and the individual characters gave this film much to keep me interested throughout the film. Stalingrad was a very brutal battle, and the scenes gave this film the sharp reality of this battle. I recommend this to anyone interested in military history. This was my second view of this movie in a few years and was fascinated by its realism again. Weapons, uniforms and hear the German while reading the subtitles gave it a lot of credit for a good military film. In fact, this was a German perspective of the struggle, I rooted for the Germans, even though they were aggressors and ultimate losers of the war.
