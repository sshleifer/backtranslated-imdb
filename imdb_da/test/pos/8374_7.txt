An unusual movie for an audience outside the United States. Lena Horne looks great, and Ralph Cooper does. There is no added background for tape steps as in other musicals, so you don't hear the beat of those cocks that are great realism. Music is subdued to hear which dance steps are. Acting is a bit stuttered and the molds speak slowly so you think the film is older than it is. Costumes are bold at the time in the dance routines at the end. You often feel like part of an audience on a stage show. What furniture you see is very modern, which adds to the film's sense of other worldliness. A must for all movie buffs.
