Awww, I love this! Cats and the moon's story do not really need a synopsis, as that is what it is ... the cat is chasing the moon for a Spanish poem. It is the artistry that is interesting. In fact, this animated card called the Fan and the Flower was the winner of an Oscar last year (2005) ... well, almost the same thing that makes me believe it can just be a rip off. <Br /> <br /> But this is a really good card, with sharp black and white characters changing and turning into beautiful movement and poetic seduction ... If you think cats are poetry in motion, then See this and you will believe it more. <br /> <br /> It also has such a touching end. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
