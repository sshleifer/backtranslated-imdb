What can I say? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC, and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> MESSIAH is a great thriller, a really shocking and eerie tale of a serial killer that carries out sacrificial tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team are tasked with trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events before more lives are lost. <br /> <br /> But be warned - even if it is '15' (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a cruel movie. Some of the murder scenes are similar to those of the SE7, and one or two can really be stomach acid. But if you can do it, sit back in your chair and enjoy ... even if you're likely to be on the edge of it or hide behind it. <br /> <br /> Rated 15 by BBFC for moderate violence and severe horror.
