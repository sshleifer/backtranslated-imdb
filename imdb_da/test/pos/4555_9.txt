During my trip in a youth management forum I was channel surfing until I found "Tommy Boy" at TBS. Since I have never seen this movie before, I would check it out. My roommate, who has already seen this, told me, "This movie is a classic." After watching the whole movie, I came to the conclusion that he was right. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is constantly fun from start to finish thanks to the comedy duo by Chris Farley and David Spade. Farley is a rebel as a title figure, a spastic doofus who just sails through life as if it wasn't important. His slacker-esqe must soon come to a standstill when his father (Brian Dennehy), a wealthy "Break Pads King", dies of a heart attack on his wedding day. This leads Tommy with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend Richard (David Spade) to pave the way to selling enough pads to save the business. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the "Tommy Boy" workers is fun headquarters performances. Farley is the funniest person in this movie, the other funniest person is Spade and the third is Rob Lowe as the movie's villain who has accidents. Another fun guy is Dan Aykroyd as Ray Zalinsky, a well-known auto party extraordinary. Another reason why the film works is the large amount of jokes. Chris Farley has hilarious slapstick moments, and David Spade has fun carving comments and one-liners. Gags in the movie (some involving a deer and a plane bathroom) are laugh-incredibly fun thanks to director Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3), authors Bonnie & Terry Turner <br /> <br /> (3rd Rock From The Sun, That 70s Show) and cast. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is a really fun movie, although for some unknown reason most film critics (including Roger Ebert) are horrible and unfunny. (I wonder when their sense of humor died.) I recommend "Tommy Boy" to those who are great fans of comedy. Thank you, roommate.
