I play the final fantasy 7, and this movie is LIKE the game, all fans of the final fantasy will love this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is amazing and the story is good, but the best of this movie is the visual effects that are amazing. The characters are equal to the game and the details are good for the fans. <br /> <br /> You don't have to play the game to like this movie, all people can enjoy the movie because the story is different and easy to understand. I buy the DVD because it's great is 100% ADVISABLE, if you don't see this movie, what are you waiting for? Believe me, you will fascinate me
