I was very impressed with this movie, which was directed by (Luigi Bazzoni). The story was about a young female translator who has suddenly lost all memory in the last three days and has a little nightmare about astronauts on the moon. She can't explain how this happened to anyone. One day, a postcard comes to her from the island of Garma, where she goes to visit. strange, even though people seem to know her even though she has never been there before. Also her dreams of astronauts on the moon come back to her. <br /> <br /> I thought this was a very strange Italian movie that seemed to be very scary at times and there were also strange pictures in the movie that seemed to be with you all the time you watched movies. I would recommend this movie to people just to see how good it is. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
