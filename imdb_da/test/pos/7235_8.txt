This trash version of `Romeo and Juliet 'passes in Manhattan in today's days. Romeo (Will Keenan) is a ** hole and violent member of the Que family, and Juliet (Jane Jensen) is a sexy (with beautiful legs and breasts) and bisexual girl from the Capulet family. The skatological situations facing this romantic couple are very fun. Although it is a cult movie (including exhibited in the Rio de Janeiro Festival), it is not recommended for all audiences. If the viewer is a fan of Peter Jackson's earlier films (`Braindead ',` Bad Taste'), `Toxic Avenger ',` Body Melt' and other trash, he will surely love this flick. Otherwise he will hate it. When I belong to the first group, my vote is eight. <br /> <br />
