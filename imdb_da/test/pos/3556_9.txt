I hardly saw 'Hi-De-Hi!' I think it must have been the title that struck me off. These days, the Welsh language editions of 'The Radio Times' used only to write titles on specific shows without scrapping information about what they were actually about. Hi-De-Hi! "suggested me a bad quiz show hosted by Leslie Crowther or worse an inane US import. But I managed to take a later episode and was surprised to find it written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft, as was the case with" Father's Army " and 'It's not half hot mum' Perry based it on personal experiences, in this case his time at a Butlins vacation camp, before arriving cheap flights in the 60s, these camps sprang up along British coastlines, provided entertainment for working class families and served million to their owners. <br /> <br /> (As a matter of interest, I worked in such a camp in the 80s as a chef - Barry Island, South Wales - known to all and different as 'Shag Land' for reasons , I do not want to go in!) In the late '50s, it began with the university's academic Jeffrey Fairbrother (Simon Cadell) taking over as Maplin's entertainment manager, a job he was ill-equipped to handle. His staff included resident comics e Ted Bovis (Paul Shane), his sidekick Spike (Jeffrey Holland), miserable Punch and Judy Man Mr.Partridge (Leslie Dwyer), Snoby Ballroom Dancers Barry (Barry Howard) and Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves) Diane Holland), and the unforgettable Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc) who was looking for Fairbrother at every opportunity. Bubbly Su Pollard stole the show as cleaner Peggy Ollerenshaw, whose aim was to be a "Yellowcoat" (all the key employees had them). A number of sexy girls also recorded these jackets, especially Nikki Kelly's 'Sylvia' and statue Rikki Howard's 'Betty'. We never saw Joe Maplin, the owner. He conveyed his staff in the form of grammar missives, which poor Jeffrey was forced to read aloud. "Hi-De-Hi!" was the camper's greeting, usually met with the equally insane 'Ho-De-Ho!'. <br /> <br /> One fan was the late Sir Fred Pontin, who told Perry and Croft that he recognized most characters from real life. I've always found Bovis the most compelling of these as well as the most tragic, as Archie Rice, he was the comedian whose great break never came, reduced to breaking corny gags to the amusement of the drunken late-night crowd. He took advantage of his position to pamper a few perks, and in a memorable episode, Fairbrother's patience snatched him out: "Lies, Ted! All lies!" As with any other Perry / Croft series, the casting was excellent, especially Cadell and Shane. Ruth Madoc's prizes' Gladys' came to my nerves (no wonder that Anne Robinson hates the Welsh!), But Leslie Dwyer's misanthropic 'Mr.Partridge' and Felix Bowness' jockey 'Fred Qulley' more than compensated. <br /> <br /> The visual gag remembers the drunken Mr.Partridge spotting a pantomime horse riding right along the beach. If he looks at the bottle of whiskey in his hand, he decides to stick to it and instead throws the banana he had eaten! <br /> <br /> With its frothy mix of '50's nostalgia and saucy gags,' Hi-De'Hi 'was a big hit for BBC-1 in the 80s, resulting in a massive increase in bookings for Butlins and Pontins. It went downhill when Cadell left to return to the theater. I never took his replacement, squadron leader Clive Dempster (David Griffin). Worse, Leslie Dwyer's death fell on the show of one of his best characters. Kenneth Connor was brought in to replace him as 'Uncle Sammy'. <br /> <br /> The period set occasional issues; In an episode, Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to save Peggy, who for some reason was dressed as a shark. The revealing costumes they had were wrong for the era. Still they looked so good in them so who complains? In another song Ted Tom Jones hit 'Delilah' for campers. It was not composed (by Les Reed and Barry Mason, by chance) until 1968. <br /> <br /> Maplins closed the doors in 1988, and the last shot was Peggy (now a Yellowcoat) all alone in the camp, leaping into the air and shouting (what more?) 'Hi-De-Hi!'. <br /> <br /> I don't rate it as high as Perry and Croft's other shows, but its popularity is undeniable. It was probably one of the last British sitcoms to generate huge public affection, mainly because it featured sympathetic characters in a recognizable setting. Good night campers!
