This was the best movie in 1998 and one of the best of the 90s. Yes, it's a rip off of Goodfellas. But as it says good poets say to borrow, good poets steal. And PTA has stolen brilliantly from some of the best, plus added some genius touches by itself. I gave this a ten (which is very rare for me). The main reason I comment on this though (because I could just rave all night) is all the people who have seen it on VHS standard problem ... what are you thinking about? This deserves the FULL SCREEN experience. Look at the relationship it was shot in! I watched it five times in the cinema and have not bothered to watch it on video. <br /> <br /> Nuff said!
