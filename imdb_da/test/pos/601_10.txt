First of all, I would like to say that this film is the greatest thing that ever happened to humanity. It's the best of all the excellent Muppet movies and all the other movies out there! so BOO-YA for Jim Henson! <br /> <br /> This movie is the first of all the Muppet movies and the best. (boo ya) It's about a frog (kermit) trying to make for Hollywood. Along with the amazing friends he encounters on the road, a few of the greatest songs ever made bound to become classics, including the "Rainbow Connection". To sum up, I would like to say watching this movie was the greatest thing ever! If you haven't already seen it, take care of your computer and get yourself crazy for your nearest video store !!! (If they don't have the muppet movie, I would sue them BIG TIME)
