This is as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> These are six episodes that track (briefly) what life could have been like when dinosaurs ruled the earth. Finished in the style of a nature documentary, this show off with talking heads instead gives us just the good things with the dinosaurs trying to survive. This is certainly not a true documentary, as none of what we see on the screen can be proven with any certainty, but it is a good guess and an entertaining one. Here's a show that brings dinosaurs to life in a realistic way that doesn't involve them eating people. This is a show to be shown to any child who loves dinosaurs, as it will infuse them with the OH WOW factor to go out and find out more. It will also entertain hell out of them and you. <br /> <br /> See this. If you love animal shows or nature or science or Disney True Life Adventures (except that no one really gets killed) or just a really good trip to another place, you run out and get yourself a copy. Your brain will thank you.
