Sophisticated sex comedies are always difficult to pull off. Watch the movies from Blake Edwards, probably the master's genre, and you'll find as many misses as hits. Because if a film of this kind ever fails to work, it can never fall back on the tried and true toilet humor of a teenage comedy [ie. "American Pie"], or warm audience with the sentimentality of a romantic comedy [ie. Julia Roberts' entire career]. It can only hold a boost to the end and hope that the audience can appreciate the almost required irony of its decision. Written by husband / wife team Wally Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, "Seeing Other People" opens with engaged couple Ed & Alice [Jay Mohr & Julianne Nicholson] just seconds away from the backward car in front of them. When the frame freezes, we unexpectedly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters. From here we are welcome that the story of unfolding will enjoy a view from both sexes. Two months shy of their promises, Ed and Alice are already looking like an old couple. At an early stage, their actions alone show us how good they are with each other and how long they have been together. So when the line to drive the plot forward is pronounced - expected from the least likely of the two - it is as if the relationship itself requires a change, even if it means that it is its own destruction. <br /> <br /> When all the basic rules are set [Ed cannot sleep with his mother or, for that matter, Salma Hayek], the two lead in their separate directions hoping to find some meaningless sex for to strengthen their relationship. First, everything seems to go as planned, as their daily trysts only help burn the passion between them. But predictably, as the deeper feelings of regret and jealousy begin to emerge, they soon find themselves away from each other and on the brink of breaking up. All of these actions lead to a decision you may or may not like - depending on your own degree of cynicism. For a comedy like this you need a solid cast with supporting characters as strong as they lead. And director Wolodarsky does not disappoint. Here he has cast two of my favorite actresses as sisters - Julianne Nicholson & Lauren Graham - and allows them to play for their forces. For Nicholson, who has always reminded me of a young Shirley MacLaine, she brings an air of naive and vulnerable to Alice, even when her actions seem less than that. And as for Graham, an actress who has proven she could survive an entire Howard Hawks ensemble, she steals every scene she's with an edgy "no BS" persona. <br /> <br /> As for the boys, Jay Mohr is service-less here, as is Josh Charles. "Malcolm in the Middle" Byron Cranston needs to be applauded for taking a British accent and letting it all hang out. But the lovely treat here is Andy Richter and his under-plot involving single mom, Helen Slater. While his scenes almost seem to belong to another movie, they are by far the funniest, and his dead hooded supply steals the show. <br /> <br /> For an independent production, "Seeing Other People" has a more personal and introspective feel - something that would be noticeably absent from a great Hollywood movie of this kind. Not to mention that this movie also has some really fun moments - unlike most Hollywood comedies in general. <br /> <br /> Rating [on a 5 star system]: 3 1/2 stars
