If you think a given war movie can make you feel the war, see "Letyat zhuravli" (called "Cranes flying" in English). It tells the story of Veronika (Tatiana Samoylova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), who are in love with the brink of 2. world War. They walk along the waterfront and see the cranes fly by when the war starts. Boris sent immediately to war. Veronika hides with a family and ends up marrying the son she does not love. Meanwhile, Boris continues through the landscape, fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the war graves until he runs out of energy. When Veronika - who works at a military hospital - receives this news, she refuses to accept it until Boris's body comes home on one of the trains. At the same time, the radio announces that Germany has surrendered and the Allied forces have won the war; The Soviet Union lost 27 million citizens, but that is the start of a new era. This film did a very good job showing the human influence of war not only on the battlefield, but also on how it was influenced by the civilian population. This is definitely a movie that everyone should see.
