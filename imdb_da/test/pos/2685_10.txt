This is by far the funniest sitcom ever broadcast on television. I own all 9 seasons on DVD and could literally watch them again and again. Anyone who does not find this show hilarious, heartwarming, entertaining and laughing loudly hysterical is crazy! Kevin James is definitely one of the most talented comedians out there. My boyfriend and I love to come up with comedy shows in Boston (where we live) and have seen Kevin James twice and his brother Gary Valentine (Danny) once. They are both so incredibly talented and just plan smart with their work. There are so many comedians out there who are just awful, and Kevin and Gary really show the true side of real comedy. Leah Remini, although a snob and bitch in real life (so I've read) is a great actress and deserves more credit than any other woman in sitcoms. She really does the show with Jerry Stiller! This show is a must see and you will be addicted within one to two episodes!
