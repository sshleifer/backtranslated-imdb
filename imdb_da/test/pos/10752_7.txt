For those of you looking for the crazy stunts that characterized a Harold Lloyd silent comedy, this is not the movie for you. What The Cat's-Paw gives us is an interesting and atypical character for Lloyd who tried to establish himself in sound. For me, the closest movie comparison to Lloyd's character is that Peter Sellers is there. For all the education that Lloyd has received in connection with the world, he might as well have been brought up in isolation, as the sellers were. <br /> <br /> But when he was brought up, he was a missionary's child in China and I don't know how much Christianity he and his family were able to teach the Chinese, but young Harold has learned the wisdom of the Chinese philosopher Lin Po, whom he cites constantly as a counterfeit coopism. As it turns out, Lin Po seems to be a wise guy. Lloyd's father Samuel S. Hinds has nevertheless decided that his son needs an education in the modern world of 20th-century America, and he sends him back to be a guest of the pastor of the home church who sponsors the mission. The pastor is the stubborn candidate for the "reform" movement in that city Stockport. But soon Lloyd and the priest will die. <br /> <br /> Now, the reform movement is a shame and the pastor is a patsy of the political leaders who need a stray opponent in every election. They decide Lloyd, it can just be a better patsy than the guy who just died. Of course, as this type of movie goes, the patsyet does not easily show a suggestion. In fact, Lloyd constantly quotes from Lin Po, the way Charlie Chan used to deliver wisdom shows quite the adversary of the villains who run Stockport. In addition, Lloyd gets admiration for Una Merkel, who cynically a lady like Jean Arthur was in Mr. Deeds and Mr. Smith. <br /> <br /> The Cat's-Paw is still a good political satire, even though it didn't make Harold Lloyd a great comedy name when he was in silent movies. A fine cast of players was selected by director Sam Taylor topped by George Barbier, who plays a political chief who discovers Lloyd and actually turns out to have a bunch of honesty in him.
