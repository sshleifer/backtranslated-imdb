While most films that come across people against horrible extra terrestrial end up being cheap imitations of the 'Aliens' series, Pitch Black stands out as a fine piece of Sci-Fi and an excellent movie around. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie is the lighting. This film beautifully uses many different colors, shades and intensities of light that set the mood and give a unique feel to the film itself, something other than the "normal" movie lighting we are generally exposed to. Vin Diesel brings his character to life in an excellent way, skillfully avoiding routine depiction of the cured criminals. The movie is after all about Riddick's (Diesel's character) personal journey, so fortunately Vin does not go with the ball. The rest of the casting (with the exception of the talented and beautiful Claudia Black) was unknown to me, but everyone appeared in fantastic performances and animated the various characters with unique quirks and manner. Pitch Black is a perfect example of making a good movie without the resources for an exaggerated budget. The special effects are more than adequate, but at the same time they are by no means the only focus, as in many high budget 'blockbusters'. It's a great movie because it uses science fiction as a medium to tell an engaging, advancing story, rather than telling a mediocre story of using the flash of science fiction.
