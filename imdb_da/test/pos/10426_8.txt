I LOVED THIS MOVIEE well, I loved the romance part with COBby and the girl ... Rachel (?) 4got her name .... I was honestly only interested in them too. I loved them in the movie, I want to see more movies as such. but please no more sad endings where they can't be 2gether! = (It made me cry! But the romance between them. The reason for the trauma was everything big. =) I was just more into Colby and Rachel. ha ha =) everything about this movie was exciting that kind of to keep you glued to your seat. because I was sure of it. In fact, my only personal will would be more focused between the couple (Colby and Rachel) and at least a decent ending. I hated the end, a better one could have been more thoughtful, not the fact that you forced COBB to his death, and Rachel had a son. The end would have killed the movie.
