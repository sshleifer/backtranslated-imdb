I've seen this show from the start, and I'm a 45 year old man. For me, it's so much more that a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family anyway. It is centered around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in the fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history and a population of people who can be unusual but act as a dysfunctional family. The show also casts in the relationship between Lorelei and her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore, old money DAR WASP people who do not endorse Lorelei's choices in life, even though Lorelei doesn't care. The relationship history and through line is what makes this show, in my opinion, the finest on the WB network (soon to be CW). See this show!
