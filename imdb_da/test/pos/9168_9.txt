As I have said in the title of this review, it pains me to say this, but "hitch" reaches the pinnacle of what Hollywood Romantic Comedies can ever hope to strive for. I have been a critic of both genres, and it's namesake as long as I can remember myself, but in an almost tragic remark, "Hitch" has made me use somewhere near two hours of life with a ridiculous smile plastered over my face. This film can be misogynistic and presumably at times, but it nevertheless has some humor about it, whose subtlety can only be described as British. This is a wonderful attempt by Hollywood to make (or resume as it may be ...) a movie that appeals to all our desires for a romantic comedy that can make us think and laugh at the same time. I give brave and most elusive this movie a 9 out of 10 ... Something you will hardly see me do for a romantic comedy in the near future, or at least I hope.
