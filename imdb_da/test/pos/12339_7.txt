A bunch of sorority girls make a new promise at night in a cruel mausoleum. Of course, the recently deceased does not remain dead for too long, and the whole hell goes loose. "One Dark Night" is an enjoyable 80-horror with some horrible dead bodies floating around, ruled by a dead mental Raymar's spirit. There is no gore and nudity, but the atmosphere of a mausoleum is very creepy. The action is solid, but the script takes too much time to develop the characters until the last 20 minutes that Raymar finally breaks out of his grave. Cinematography is impressive and the mausoleum is a good place for the climatic events. The movie takes so long to get started, and this is its biggest mistake.7 out of 10.
