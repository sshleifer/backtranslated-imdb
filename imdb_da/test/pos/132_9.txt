This film demonstrates strong struggle for two women in love in a culture so deeply rooted in ritual and tradition. All this on the basis of an India, which itself fights for freedom from the same values. This film is both political and personal and never too predictive or idealistic on both sides. It is easy to see why "fire" has caused riots in India, but tragically. A real movie like this deserves to be seen by all world people, not just privileged Westerners.
