I found this movie on one of my old videos, after "Godzilla vs Sea Monster" (which should instantly give you an idea of ​​the tone) and I hadn't seen it for a while so I decided to watch the. I didn't remember much about Rainbow Brite unless I used to like the comic and that it was cute. Most people feel that way about her. You probably do. <br /> <br /> Well, when the movie started, I wondered if it was the right one! It didn't fit the shape of Rainbow Brite when I remembered her. But it turns out she is kicking ass! This must be the weirdest animated movie ever! I can't believe these characters were so popular (the series is not very different) while you're so bizzare. As soon as I saw this movie again, it became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> I really don't want to give away too much. Just know that if you watch the movie in the video store, rent it and watch it. No questions asked. You get a kick out of it. Especially the monstrous princess character. And the robot test. And the hypnotized sprites. <br /> <br /> If you don't know, it's an 80-comic cartoon that is truly an undiscovered "head" movie in disguise! Have fun!
