I thought I wrote a comment on this movie before, but I can't find it here. Anyway, I am writing it again. I accidentally found this movie from my colleagues' library collections. It was free to see, so why not. <br /> <br /> I'm certainly glad I saw it. I love this movie. I've seen a couple of Russian movies before, most of them have serious issues. I'm surprised this was a good comedy. I had a great laugh while I watched it. And it's a movie I want to buy. This thing is so much fun. And they're not just stupid fun, they were very original and well thought out, so they don't seem to be stupid at all. I am surprised that this movie did not attract many viewers. This is a classic that you can see it over and over again. <br /> <br /> These actors were also very authentic, their plays are real, not fake. if you haven't seen it, take a copy soon! definitely recommended.
