This is the middle cartoon of the three (between rabbit fire and ducks! Rabbit, duck!) And are the weakest of the three while still very funny. It simply depends on a gag for too much of the action. Still a good cartoon. I feel a certain sympathy for Daffy in this, which is rare for me. Daffy is so clearly overmatched that it is almost painful to see at times. Good cartoon in an excellent series. Recommended.
