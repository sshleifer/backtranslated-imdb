I remember seeing this in the early 90s on UK TV and was hooked. The international reach of the production is breathtaking and sees how the characters evolve through the five hours it runs for, is magnificent. The scenes set in Pakistan and Afghanistan are of particular interest and, as a viewer, you get a real sense of a basic view of these countries' culture and atmosphere in the final stages of the Cold War. The characters in Fazal and Helen evolve really well throughout the series and rivals modern shows like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in this area. In the UK, VHS goes for about £ 6 and the DVD is about £ 10 - a quality bargain. I thought the Soderbergh version was also great - but clearly this masterpiece is a big debt.
