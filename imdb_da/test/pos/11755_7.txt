This movie is likely to be too sentimental for many viewers, especially modern audiences. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this movie thanks mostly to the earthly charm of William Holden, one of my favorite stars and the dazzling beauty of Jennifer Jones. There are some really heart-warming scenes between the couple, and the talent of these two actors saves what in smaller hands could have been trite lines. Chinese film from Hong Kong from the movie is another highlight of this movie. All in all, a better than average romantic drama, 7/10.
