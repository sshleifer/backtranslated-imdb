Very rarely does it happen that I sit down to write a comment on a movie .... but this movie !!!!!! oh my holy god !!!!!!!! never was there a hindi movie better than this ...... and never ever came a movie better than this ...... it is the king of all comedies ..... aamir khan is without a doubt the best comic actor in the Indian movie industry ... even though it's fun to say it because he's a class law, not a comedian ... but what he's done in this movie is perhaps the most hilarious performance of an Indian actor in a out and out comedy. .. <br /> <br /> salman khan has never been a good actor in my eyes .... but this movie got the best of him .... he was an innocent cartoon ... if ever there was a term like that .... just what the doctor ordered for his role in the movie was worried ... <br /> <br /> rajkumar santoshi I do not know why, never tried his hand on comedy again. ... he led great ventures like The Legend of Bhagat Singh and khakee, but could not recreate the magic of the andaz apna apna .... I don't care why this movie is bombarded at the cashier's office .... although I feel sorry for the fact that a movie like "hum aapke hain kaun" was the cause of the failure ...... from now on I hope the rumors will be true ..... there will be "duck apna apna-2 "they say ....... we as the audience can only say AMEN !!!!!
