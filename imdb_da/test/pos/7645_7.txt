This is a quirky heist / caper movie, one that seems predictable at first, so remains surprising until the last scene. The protagonist is a getter who goes to work in a small carnival where he is paid to kill the manager's belly dancer wife Divana, so end up falling for herself. She is prolonged, difficult and deadly, and she disappears and jumps again as a kind of magician. The film's other props include her unmanageable husband / employer (played by the talented Armand Assante), some unpleasant Dominican mobsters, and most importantly the plot, a suitcase full of money. Like the old "shell game", the one in which you have to guess which honor is under, you will guess who has the money, and as the victims of hucksters running such games, you will probably guess wrong. Dagma Dominczyk, like a lovely Divana, is a talented performer and an eyeful, whether she is dancing with the big snake around her shoulders or working on all the unlucky men in her orbit. Norman Reedus is fine as the young con who is flummoxed by the unpleasant beauty he was paid to kill. Don't count him out because he turns out to be smarter than anyone gave him credit for. This oddball movie is worth seeing.
