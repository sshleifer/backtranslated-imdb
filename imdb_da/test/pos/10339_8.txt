This is the kind of movie you choose in the first place to make the numbers from video rental ..... only to discover an undervalued, entertaining and fun movie !! Police opening sequence coming to a dark and rainy house where "wife" has committed murder ....... or is it ?? .... and the rest of the movie is trying to solve what really happened. ... OK ... the movie is a little "campy" ... but has good editing and dialogue ..... professional play ..... often humorous ...... and the very first scene with facial expressions is a of the best of its kind ... definitely worth seeing ..... deserves at least a 7 or a 8!
