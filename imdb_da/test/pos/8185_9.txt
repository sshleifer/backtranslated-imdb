Chen Kaige gives us a magnificent depth of the atmosphere. Yes, it's a 'period piece', but Chen's artistic use of images makes it something more. The actors often act as players using the Peking Opera's stylized expressions, attitudes and facial expressions. All actors in a scene play to the 'back wall' even when they address each other. They are like the spirits of the past, who with strong clarity tell a story of acute importance to them in the present. Combined with great attention to scale and masterful filmography indoors and out, "Jing ke ci qin wang" is a great story told with great reverence in its own idiom that captivates completely.
