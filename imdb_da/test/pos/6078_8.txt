In World War II, a heavily burned amnesiac known as the "English Patient" was found in the African desert and transported to Italy, joining a convoy of medical troops and others in an abandoned monastery. Among them are Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian nurse whose boyfriends generally encounter unpleasant ends; Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Whately), two explosive experts seeking the monastery for bombs; and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), a Canadian fortune soldier who knows the identity of the English patient and has a score to settle. <br /> <br /> Through flashbacks we learn the patient's story: he is Laszo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian explorer who, in the late 30s, falls with a group of British cartographers, including Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his wife Katharine (Kristen Scott-Thomas), while mapping the deserts of North Africa. After leaving Clifton in the government area, Katharine and Clifton fall in love with each other in the desert, resulting in an affair that naturally has a less than happy than. <br /> <br /> If one is able to overlook the illogical parts of the narrative line (for example, why would a patient found in Africa be sent to what is essentially the war front line in Italy ?), then you can appreciate "The English Patient" as a return to David Lee's intelligent, layered, sweeping epics in the 60s. Much more than "Titanic" or other epic romances too late, this film puts in the mind of "Doctor Zhivago" and "Gone With the Wind" - an epic love story against a huge historical background. You shouldn't expect a war movie, though there are some striking (if too brief) scenes of violence that stand out more than the romantic sections, as is usually the case (Caravaggio's interrogation of a sadistic SS officer (Jurgen Prochnow) in particular. <br /> <br /> The movie is very ambiguous compared to just about anything. The key question in the movie is: How far are you willing to go to love? As critics of the movie are quick to point out Almasy on the surface is a long-standing sign - he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by giving cards and intelligence to the Germans and causing the death of his friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and Caravaggio's torture and actually killing a British soldier who has arrested him at some point, that Almasy is in many ways reprehensible is a kind of thing - he is in love with Katharine and sees the world narrowly with regard to his love, loyalty to the country (or something else for that matter) s fault) is secondary; as Almasy says, he hates "ownership." own it. "The two are involved in a rather daring love affair (shagging within ear shots of hundreds of people on a Christmas party), and it is clear that Katharine is more attracted to the mysterious, exciting Almasy than the relatively boring Geoffrey." > <br /> The 1944 part plot is somewhat shaky and superfluous; the romance between Kip and Hannah is never entirely credible, and I feel the movie could have done without it, but these sequences add an interesting texture of mystery and complexity to the movie so I won't complain too much. <br /> <br /> Like the epics mentioned above, the movie is able to convey time and space through simple devices such as crowd scenes, strategically placed posters, and military presence. The fact that it is 1938 in Cairo, but it is useful to know: The direction of Anthony Minghella and the desert cinematography of John Seale is absolutely beautiful; the sand dunes, sandstorms and desert caves are trapped in Beautiful details Gabriel Yared's score is scary and atmospheric. The action is generally solid. Fiennes gives a very layered performance as a sign that is mysterious, complex and haunted. The difference between Almasys from 1938 and 1944 is remarkable; an exciting and somewhat carefree, the other haunted and reflective. Kirsten Scott Thomas is effective as Katharine, the female explorer looking for adventure, and Colin Firth gives one of his best performances as Geoffrey, who realizes it early that he has no competition for the exciting Almasy. Willem Dafoe seems fine as Caravaggio, the shady, chased thief-turned spy driven by revenge. Jurgen Prochnow gives a performance similar to Jose Ferrer in "Lawrence of Arabia" (and a similar character too): very short but more memorable than some of the main characters. Some of the 1944 actors are unremarkable: Juliette Binochette is nothing special, while Naveen Andrews is good but unremarkable. Kevin Whately, as Kip's poor partner, does what he can with a rather small role. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient" is not a perfect movie in any way, but the vituperative attacks on it with much of the film-making public are not at all deserved. Perhaps it is a show of how film feelings have changed since the era of the lions and cubes, or people expected something that was easy to understand. Complex for failure, brilliantly directed and shot, "The English Patient" is a wonderful modern epic. <br /> <br /> 8/10
