Sometimes I wonder if perhaps Meryl Streep has been so accepted as the most impressive, versatile actress since, yes, maybe even at the beginning of the age, perhaps her talent is being taken for granted. There are probably about three tics that she relies on consistently through her performances (most notably a pinched lip), but apart from that, her performances are incredibly variable and original and fresh expressions of internal activities. Although "Sophie's Choice" and "A Cry in the Dark" and "Silkwood" may be more prominent, her work here and in "Bridges in Madison County" is also remarkable - just more subtle. In "One True Thing" she is mostly sweet and in love with her domestic life, and Streep does what could be routine, even boring, seems attractive and charming. I think she must prepare these mini-theses for each character and find out what things make this person real and interesting. She works from the inside out with each character, and perhaps it is this essential quality that has provoked the main criticism of self-awareness or self-awareness. I don't think she's cold at all, but has instead thought of her character's unique qualities. I think her critics confuse self-awareness with intelligence. Not too many other actors would be so complicated thoughtful and creative that they make Kate Muldrun easy and carefree in her beloved, domestic environment, to reveal only an unprecedented depth due to her true attachment to the domestic environment. Her performances are of unmatched consistency, she rarely does anything wrong. I wonder if it is conceivable that any of Streep's pictures do not appear to be diminished because of her presence. At least, Kate loves her home, and her love for her "family life" is just as loving as her new home conflict is devastating. When all this comes together, and Kate begins to recognize that she can no longer function in the same capacity, and she breaks the pie dish and screams that she is not disabled, it is painfully sad to see because it has not been exposed for emotions. Streep is smart enough and generous enough to recognize how much better everything works because she has felt Kate's dramatic validity and is really the only scene when she allows her character to go. But how refreshingly true is seeing a sign that can really surprise you by showing something that you would not have thought possible. Once again, Streep has at least three dimensions ... God, it sounds like a dissertation itself, but as an actress, Streep has just one special kind of intelligence, incredible empathy, and good expression skills. The film itself is somewhat mediocre. I suppose William Hurt is supposed to be a jerky jerk, and he does it very well. I think Hurt is really so scary. Script is quite standard - another tribute to Streep that she was as touching and credible as she was.
