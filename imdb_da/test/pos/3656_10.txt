Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within an abundance of Indian places and a plot inspired by Bollywood but still grounded in reality, this very moving movie is a must-see for those who love a good romance / adventure. And by this I mean "good", not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and constructed happy ending. East meets west in another roof of the buddy. The performances are inspired and brilliant, cinematic epic and plot entertaining, engaging and poignant with no trace of schmaltz or cheap drag on heartbeat. HARI OM is a cute movie that does not reveal your teeth. See it!
