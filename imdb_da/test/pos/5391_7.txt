Dallas stars Gary Cooper, Ruth Roman, Steve Cochran, Barbara Payton and Raymond Massey. It is directed by Stuart Heisler, photography is from Ernest Haller and pencil fell to John Twist. Produced by Warner Brothers, Dallas is vividly recorded in Technicolor out of Iverson & Warner's California ranches. Very much film with the tongue stuck in the cheek, the film is a recall to the western of yore that exists without pretensions or deep penetrating meanings. The plot sees Cooper's Civil War renegade, Blayde "Reb" Hollister, fake his own death to kill his reputation and free himself to the persecution in Dallas by the brothers who massacred his family. Essentially, a routine interpretation, Twist's story perked up along the way by many is a fun and exciting diversion. There are the roles of the role, dandy fashion, horse art, shooting effects, a love triangle, powerful dialogue and delicate little twists to keep the piece clean from painting it with numbers. <br /> <br /> Cooper seems to enjoy himself too, further enhancing the feel good factor offered. That's right, he's not being asked to do anything more than be a laconic guy on a mission. But when he is encouraged to act, he delivers the goods his fans have come to expect during his successful career. The bad guys entertain {especially Steve Cochran's fake and stupid Bryant Marlow} because they each have their own small peccadillo to keep them away from familiar familiarity. The two ladies in the play look beautiful and fit well with machismo, while the high production value allows Haller to treat the eyes with the lush Technicolor and involve camera work around the sites. <br /> <br /> It has ideals to be a list Oater does Dallas, something it just can't quite achieve. But it is not for lack of trials and the end result is one of pure entertainment, which in fact must be enjoyed on a cold winter day when the viewer needs a pickup. 10.7
