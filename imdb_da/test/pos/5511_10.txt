I didn't really think this movie was bad. Well, the detective sucked a little on what he did and he usually happened at Capt. Howdy accidentally, but he got the job done. Capt. Howdy himself was pretty scary. The make-up artist did a good job. I really liked seeing Dee dressed in all geeky. I laughed so hard when I saw it. I can't see how anyone can sit through crap like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and call it a good movie, and then see Strangeland, which is more disturbing because much of it could actually happen when the internet is so popular and calls it bad . Personally, I think Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a lot of crap. Probably one of the stupid movies I've ever seen. I enjoyed Strangeland. It was a very disturbing movie, for almost everything actually happens.
