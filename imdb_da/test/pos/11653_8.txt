This is the most human and humane movie I've seen for a long time. The irons are abundant, Susan Sarandon as a nun, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in a film that does not preach, but it does not condemn either. It is cinema verite at the best, and yet the story is fictionalized from several real events. Which of the two are more amazing, Sarandon or Penn? It is easy to say who is more sympathetic, but it is difficult to say who is more convincing. They are simply magnificent. You may have to believe that all killers must be killed or you can claim that life without parole is no life and that death is more merciful. Regardless of your personal feelings, this movie allows you to pause and rethink. <br /> <br /> In the end, you just want to sit in silence and reflect. It is the great drama doing, it gives catharsis, it creates a moment in time, a common memory that touches our humanity.
