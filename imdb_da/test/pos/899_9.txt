I think this movie has got it all. It has really cool music that I can never get out of my head. It has sailing grades. Is really fun (you know the kind you want to look up on the ground and you will continue to say the fun parts every day for three weeks). Despite the bad plays, bad cgi and bad story after a robot, it's really cool. Its one of the movies you and your whole family can see, collect, eat pizza, laugh like crazy and watch it twice. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun parts, as when Kurt was trying to get Edison's attention and gave him his finger and then threw a paintball gun on him to play paintball. On that part, I continued to say "Remember, remember?" To my cousins ​​who saw it and showed them what happened. There was also a really fun part when Edision entered the room, and Kurt was there (just before they fought) and Kurt talked about his "strange dream" and how he was "superman". I LOVED the part, even though it has been a while since I saw it, so I can't remember that part. Everything the actors said was fun, just as Kurt says, "I worship you as a GOD!" to the robot. <br /> <br /> Although there were some bad things, it was a great movie overall. Man, I can't stop laughing. I wish I had that movie. );
