NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have today. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the movie to their last embrace. The location, the beauty of their attraction to each other as it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other, are genuine, is romance that is projected to a audience with tenderness. James Franco in another microlight is just the right casting, and Lane's elegance combined with the beach house is a true Fall 2008 movie that remembers forever, which was NOTEBOOK.
