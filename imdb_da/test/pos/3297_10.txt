When I see a card like the Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On one side I am happy. I see something that has been well thought out, seamlessly done and just bold enough to be interesting. On the other hand, I find myself regretting the level of comedy that is generally produced. TV and movies are so consistently filled with easy, discouraging crap that we find judgmental excellence in a mediocrity scale. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without "benefit" of study notes or a big budget; can create a really cool little cartoon. Manufacturers and network suits should turn to Travis Davis' out there for material and stop awarding offers to people simply because their CV or agent may require them to. Hopefully, Boy-Next-Door has got the right people's attention to facilitate more work from Davis. It's really fun and very well done!
