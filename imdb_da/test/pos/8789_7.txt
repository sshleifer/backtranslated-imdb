NO SPOILS !! <br /> <br /> After Hitchcock's successful American film, Rebecca based on Daphne DuMarie's lush novel of Gothic romance and intrigue, he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early British period - wrong identity and espionage. As the United States settled in the Second World War and the great "war effort" of civilian construction sites, weapons and other necessary militia, the thriving movie entertainment business began to extinguish paranoid and often jingoist thrillers with war themes. These thrillers often involved networks of misleading and skilled workplace operators in the shadows among the good, legislative citizens. Knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock to manage a property he owned, dealing with corruption, war time sabotage, and a helpless hero evokes a coincidence's vortex and wrong identity. The darker elements of the story and the sharp white of literary belly Dorothy Parker (in his short style in Hollywood before returning to his bohemian roots in NYC), co-authoring the manuscript, were a perfect match for Hitchcock's sensibilities. <br /> <br /> This often-neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25-year-old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings), who, at work at a Los Angeles Airplane Factory, meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later framed to commit sabotage. Flying the authorities that do not believe in his long-haired story, he meets several characters on the way to Soda City Utah and finally New York City. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful 'freaks' and a popular billboard model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who, during the worst crisis in his life as well as national security, he falls in love with! Of course, in Hitchcock's country, Patricia, kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry, falls for her prisoners and therefore adds romantic excitement to the mix. <br /> <br /> In good shape for this excursion, Hitchcock breaks a national network of demure old ladies, average Joe's and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists who harbor criminals, drag weapons and detonate bombs to keep things move. It's a fantastic plot that takes its time forward and once ignited, culminates in one of Hitchcock's more memorable finals. Look for incredible life as NYC tourist attractions (all of which were re-created by Hollywood art directors because of the 'time-out' ban on public attractions in the wartime). While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's best-known films, it is a popular B-movie that is certainly solid and engaging with lots of clever plot phrases and as usual - amazing Hitchcock villains. Remember to look for Hitchcock's cameo look outside a pharmacy in the second half of the movie. Hitchcock's original cameo idea shot (he writes in sign language with his deaf wife) was granted by the Bureau of Standards and Practices, who were afraid to offend the deaf!
