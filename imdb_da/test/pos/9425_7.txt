This is a great movie! What I mean by that is that I really enjoyed playing my $ 3.00 VHS copy (now I have a $ 6.99 DVD copy!) Many nights just before bedtime or if I have insomnia. There's just something about this movie that makes it fun to watch in repeated views. It could be fun as Basil Rathbone has in "The Secret Weapon" wearing several aprons that trick the evil and Holmes assistant Nigel Bruce (Watson), but not the housekeeper (Mary Gordon). It could be espionage, code cracking and WW II theme. It can even be the easy touch that the director uses to deal with the threatening situations Holmes finds himself in while history is moving. Either way, "Secret Weapon" is simply a pleasurable and enjoyable detective story that takes us back to a time when the Nazis were seeking world domination and doing so with their buddies' bonus between Watson and Holmes. Whether you agree with the patriotic speeches and noble "save the world" themes in this movie or not (I think they are right!), I find that they only add to the taste and fervor of this fine old fairy tale movie that holds up to repeated views. I rate it a comfortable 83/100 point.
