I'm a fan of Jeff Bridges, so I snapped this on DVD without having seen it before. I also instantly became a fan of Kevin Spacey. The general plot of "stranger in the human body" has, in my experience, been done to death, but I liked the approach taken in K-PAX, which hit me as completely different and much more sensitive than most. Bridges make an excellent doctor (you will * tell him what you have) and Spacey's expression and movements are perfect in the role. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Prot and the completely human characters in the clinic is lovely, especially the subtle manipulation of their behavior. The end is bittersweet - I like Prot's choice, but the final scenes (with Bridges) made me tear.
