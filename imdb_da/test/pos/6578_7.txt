Paha Maa is another Finnish movie. But the things that make it different are copied abroad. Some narrative techniques are from Amores Perros, Jackie Brown and Elephant. Scenes are shot from different angles again. Paha Maa is a good movie, but it is not so good that hype tells: "Realistic movie, no happy ending, and no commercial footage." Some actors did good work. Sulevi Peltola was as good as a vacuum cleaner peddler. Jasper Pääkkönen also shows his skills. But Mikko Leppilampi was so boring. He is so overstated actor, he is beautiful and a good guy, but not Finland's best actor. But if you like Finnish movies, Paha Maa is worth seeing.
