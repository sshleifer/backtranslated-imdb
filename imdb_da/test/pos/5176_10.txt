The big news is that this movie is now available on DVD from http://treasureflix.com for all those who want to own it as well as on video. This is good news as it is one of my favorite movies! <Br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the first time in the 80s and it's a mandatory vacation viewing. Living in the small market town, called Tewkesbury, picturesque and with its own traditions, restorations and traditions, we are also a cozy tight community. We are now also facing major housing developments that threaten to destroy the Community and you can see why I love this movie. First of all - and most importantly there are LASHINGS of snow !!!! Then there is the wonderful play about the Christmas tree and also the Christian degradation, as the whole community coughs up to help the poor farmer save his farm and stay in the community. The evil developers - only after the money is sent packages like the whole city, promise their money to protect what they have, which is very special. I love the way the whole community sends their message to Santa via the post office, which is misunderstood by the hero. He and his daughter have a long journey to do after the death of the wife and family of the family. (There is a likely candidate for this). Another sled ride and the most cordial is that the taxi driver whose engine is broken is mysteriously given a new one on Christmas morning and no one has constructed it! There is a nice moment when Denver sings a lullaby and an exciting search. Great gentle movie for everything Christmas is really all about.
