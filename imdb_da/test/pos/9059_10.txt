On a scale of 1-10 "Suicidal Sweetheart" got an 11 from me and from everyone else on this view. The picture was incredibly fun. I told my wife "It's obvious that this man goes on the water, but over a bed of fire, it's a bit much." This is one of the very best mixes of comedy, satire and uses of insinuation I've seen since Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein". I can't believe this picture was not taken by a big study. <br /> <br /> This "Film Festival" audience was sophisticated and was able to retrieve every comic book, either visually, speech or implied. The signs are genuine, and the combination of a good script and a great casting was obvious. Max and Grace are real people with real problems that are handled regardless of the odds of success. It keeps you smiling while you are serious and laughs with all the indirect humor that is excellently built into this production. <br /> <br /> To summarize, this is a "must see" image.
