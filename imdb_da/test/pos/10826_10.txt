When I went to see Bon Voyage, I expected a good, talented multi-drama on the order of the Grand Hotel (1932) and Les Enfants de Paradis (1944). It was better than that. With few exceptions, none of the characters were quite good or evil - just like in real life. The action was wonderful, especially those that played Frédéric, Raoul and Camille. The photography was fantastic as it recreated the period perfectly and managed to be shot in / around Bordeaux during a time of new public works, but managed "look" in June 1940. Costumes and makeup were accurate. There is so much in this movie that it is worth seeing another view. It is exciting, fun and ultimately touching. NB .-- Be sure to see it in a theater with good quality projection. It's in the wide screen, and in the theater where I saw it (Clairmont in Montclair), the first 30 minutes had the subtitles in the bottom in focus, but the actors' faces are a bit unclear! This was ultimately directed, but degraded by the film's pleasure.
