"Black Nula" is the # 1 Box Office Portuguese movie from 2004. This extreme low budget production (estimated $ 150,000) opened in Christmas versus US Blockbusters like National Treasure, Polar Express, The Incredibles and Alexander, but quickly caught the adulation Portuguese moviegoers. Despite the fierce competition, the little movie made surprisingly good and topped all other Portuguese films from the last two years in its first weeks. The film is a mystery / murder with a humorous tone, authored and directed by Fernando Fragata, who has become a solid reference in the European Independent Film Arena. Do I like the movie? Oh yes!
