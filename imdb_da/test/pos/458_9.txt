Seen during the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, this story has all the excitement of a good cold war book or movie, as a multinational group of foreigners are trying to smuggle Jason Robards from Hungary to Austria. But three things complement the story, making this a very good movie. <br /> <br /> First, the actors use the actual languages ​​in their roles. The Russian soldiers speak only Russian; The kids only Hungarian; The Germans only German, at least to tell the story. When Debra Kerr is English, she speaks only English, and of course, Yul Brynner and a few others who are important to the story speak strongly English. As a result, the audience's empathy for travelers becomes crucial. The viewer shares all the confusion and excitement of being involved in an illegal border crossing when he / she cannot understand one of the languages ​​spoken of them. Very powerful emotions arise in the audience, and despite the heavy use of foreign languages, the audience is never lost to follow the film. No subtitles are required. <br /> <br /> Other. I was in Hungary in 1995 and I tell you this movie is right on it. From the gypsum music overwhelming dinner meal to the underground caves in the buildings, where much of the action takes place to the village scenes, realism is incredible. If I didn't eat in the actual restaurant in the movie, I ate at double. I thought I actually walked down the main street of the village. (In fact, the film was shot in Austria). Third, and most importantly, this movie Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner (after the King and I) are recreated and the magnetism between them as history unfolds is nothing short of Oscar qualified. Of course, Yul has already received an Oscar to play this relationship, so Acadamy wouldn't give him another, but that's the quality of the movie. Don't miss this one.
