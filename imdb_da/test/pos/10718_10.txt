This is a phenomenal movie. Really one of the best movies I've ever seen. I'm a serious critic and it takes a lot to touch, but this movie had all the right combinations for "stirring". The passion of the actors, without overburdening, the pain of all the characters involved, the serious and subtle truths of marriage and divorce, makes all of this a must see movie, despite the fact that it is the 1970s. This is certainly not an "old movie", but a classic / vintage movie. I hope you involve what I did when you were considering how volatile matters of any kind can be when you also consider how deep pain associated with love can be, and how the toughest decisions to make will always be the most painful, but when they are made the pain will decrease, but only gradually. This movie certainly shows that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that it is certainly not synonymous with losing / missing love. The "design" of this film certainly comes out of a place deep within a person's heart and mind.
