The railway kids were on TV again this weekend and I had forgotten how good it was. <br /> <br /> If I have a criticism, it is that the episodic structure sometimes shows a little too clearly where there is little narrative flowing from sequence to sequence. The film's charm and beauty is such that it means very little. <br /> <br /> I don't want to see other comments except to add my voice to the final scene on the platform as being possibly the most emotional scene in British movie history: As a cynical old git going through the Middle Ages I too quickly find out that I can't even think of that moment without being hit by a serious case of "I have something in my eye." In fact, it's not just something in my eye that it moves things around me also with the beautiful happy pain we sometimes feel. <br /> <br /> And Jenny Agutter was exquisitely beautiful in this movie, standing with one foot in her childhood and one in young woman, bringing qualities of both to her depiction of a girl who must grow up pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> Plus a quick plaudit for Bernard Cribbins. Mostly referred to as a lightweight actor, he gently created a great human perks.
