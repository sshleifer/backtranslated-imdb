I was recently given this movie on DVD as a gift and I was in no doubt that it would appeal (though one of my favorite actors has a leading role). In fact, it is about to become a favorite. <br /> <br /> First of all, fortunately, it's not the same as the book, whose conclusion I find to be excessively melodramatic. Second: It's one of the best movies I've seen about World War I. "What?" you can ask. "It's not a war movie!" True: we see no blows or bombardments, no trench, no gas. But it shows the cost of war, the damage done to the men who fought in it, and the impact of it on those close to them. <br /> <br /> We first see Helen (Sarah Miles), a baron's widow, awaiting her release from a mental hospital. All the women in the movie seem to be widows: some from the war, but Helen's much older man, Sir Thomas (we later see a photograph) fell ill and died while at a party and thus her guilt - hit collapse. She is lost and lonely. The management around the hospital's grounds evokes POW camps and trenches: Like many of the men in the world, Helen has a kind of shell shock. <br /> <br /> Outside the hospital she has to find her feet in the outside world again: a world we experience through the eyes as gloomy, desolate and unfriendly. Her mother can't give her any real support. Even widowed she has put her own emotional defenses behind her, hiding to avoid treating her daughter in need. (Like many people, especially at that time, she seems to find mental illness embarrassing.) Ledbetter, the embedded driver, becomes a supportive presence and helps Helen adapt to life again, but she doesn't realize he's being dangerously obsessed of her. This is an excellent performance by Robert Shaw. Ledbetter is a former regular soldier, a former sergeant major who runs a boxing club and has set up his own car rental business. Superficially, he seems to be hard and strong, reliable, but there are cracks beneath the surface: he has not really adjusted himself to civilian life. He discovers (for reasons he later explains) a family and home life that he does not have; He has brutal outbreaks with colleagues and loveless sex. Come close to Helen ?? a woman who, even with the greater post-war social freedom, could not have realistically hoped to marry? exposing psychological error lines that tear him apart. These days, one can diagnose PTSD. The same goes for the other man in Helen's life, aspiring politician Captain Hugh Cantrip (Peter Egan). He is ambitious, beautiful, but also very young. Tellingly, his girlfriend Connie (Caroline Mortimer) mothers him, fights his hair and makes sure he has a clean handkerchief before he goes out. He is known to both Ledbetter and Helen: it had previously served under him during the war, and Helen had met him in political circles and had believed him a "popinjay". But he and Helen are now starting a relationship where Helen intends to support her political career, financially and emotionally. Peter Egan, fresh from his stage success as Stanhope in R C Sheriff's Journey's End, makes Hugh more than an immature cad. There is a revealing, discreet scene behind the car between Helen and Hugh, citing Brooke 'The Old Vicarage at Grantchester'. She asks about her war experience: "Was it very bad?" He can't answer. She says, "Well, you're back now." But his soft answer? "Am I? Sometimes I wonder?" ?? is the key to his character. As light and shadow flicker over his face, we know that there are some horrors that cannot be put into words. The disproportionate deaths suffered during junior officers of his kind? right out of school or university and expected to lead from the front page ?? are well known. In a nervous speech (where Helen calms him) to local political folk music at an evening party, he reveals that he will stand as an independent, no longer as a liberal (the party that had taken the country in the war). His emotional life is as damaged as Ledbetter's. He can't easily emanate from Connie, who depends on him emotionally and economically: reading between the lines, she is probably a war squad (perhaps by a former comrade?) With a child whose drawings we see on her wall. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> The crisis between the trio slowly builds with a scary scene between Helen and Ledbetter in the car, and Ledbetter listens to Hugh and Connie as he drives those who Hugh is trying to persuade Connie that, although his relationship with Helen develops, they can continue to claim that he will at least continue to support her. Jealousy, obsession and his conviction that he must protect Helen from a duplicate gold digger Ledbetter to confront her and Hugh tremendously in her home. The end is quite different from the novel and is better for it: it is dramatic, but less melodramatic, and maintains an unsentimental tone. We started with a sign that was restored after a mental breakdown; we end with another disorder one. Helen, a sense, is now wiser and stronger than both men who have not been able to fully adapt to the so-called "land pass to heroes", which they returned from the nightmare of the total war. The new end is open: one feels that she will at least manage what lies ahead without illusions. Here, it reflects well the reality of the time when women (Helen, Connie and so many others) had to gather pieces of a world where too many men had died or had come home with varying degrees of mental and physical harm. <br /> <br /> "Well, you're back now." ?? "Am I? Sometimes I wonder?"
