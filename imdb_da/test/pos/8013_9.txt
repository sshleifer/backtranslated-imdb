After watching this movie, I experienced a new feeling. I had seen a movie where the main actor had set a performance that almost rivaled the legend Chevy Chase in 'Fletch'. This is not to say that the performance is comparable, but both provide virtually flawless delivery of their lines. The actor is Marc Singer! Singer is Jack Ford, the title 'Droid Gunner' in the title, releasing a vivid collection of bounty on androids. There are some mutants, topless newcomers (!), A Scandinavian smuggler and possibly a half-hearted attempt to make a statement about the class or maybe even globalization or ......... yes that doesn't really matter. What matters about this movie is the dry way Singer delivers his lines, resulting in side-slashing humor! What is important about this movie is that director Fred Olen Ray seems to realize that serious sci-fi works very rarely, and when your budget is skewed, it is best not to take yourself seriously. Olen Ray has said that everyone involved in this movie had fun and transfers to the movie. I dare to criticize a movie that makes it possible to portray futuristic land as ever dark and neon-lit and then end up in a 'pipe and valves' store. Self-parody is a very redeeming quality. In summary, Fred Olen Ray is an ambassador for independent film production and Marc Singer is the perfect B-film lead. If only Olen Ray could draw in Tim Thomerson for the equation then we would have a movie on our hands.
