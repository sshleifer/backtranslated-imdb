We just watched this movie previewed before the release at the Norfolk (VA) Film Forum, and there was general agreement on two issues: There were excellent performances in a first-class drama by the two leaders and by others: and secondly, the marketing for this movie will only cause disaster. We saw a lurid poster with chains and suggestive comments that involve a kind of wacko sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, while the film has some real depths and some thought-provoking ideas. What is sad is that people searching for porn will be drawn in to watch the movie and be disappointed because it gets too heavy for them, while the people who really wanted it would not be caught dead, went into the theater showing it. Too bad. A good movie wasted.
