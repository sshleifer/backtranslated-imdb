Evil Ed is a Swedish film about a man named Ed (of course) and his collapse in total madness after editing a series of B-horror films known as "The Loose Limbs" series. Ed gets so angry that he thinks he sees demons and monsters, but in reality they are people he knows and people who are close to him, like his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie back in 1998 and was amazed by what I had seen. To this day, I think this movie is one of the darkest comedies out there. Since the movie is almost slapstick fun with its acting scenes, there are still a few scary moments. <br /> <br /> This is a cool flick, but don't expect anything wonderful. It is simply a fun movie that is good to show some of your friends a little laugh. 8/10 stars
