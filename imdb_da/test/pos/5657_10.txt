This is one of the most anti-traditional war films I had ever seen. Instead of the typical films that spell glory and perhaps super human characters (like John Wayne), this film is the opposite - stresses de-humanization, which also happens in war. The story relates to the Japanese who are stranded in the Philippines after the United States returned at the end of the 1944 early 1945. When the film began, the Japanese have been clearly beaten, but because of Bushido's crazy logic, they cannot afford to consider surrender. At one of many exciting moments, the protagonist at the beginning of the film is told to report to the hospital as he is unable to fight because of his TB. The problem is that the hospital won't accept him, so his commander will tell him to go to the hospital again - and if they don't accept him, he'll have to blow himself up with a grenade! Well, it only happens in the first five minutes of the movie - much worse things this soldier and the few stragglers fall because they will not surrender. Plus, there's a case in the movie where a soldier is trying to surrender, but is shot down. This happened much later in the war because the surrendering Japanese soldiers booby so often caught up to blow up when they came close. In addition, the film shows the most vivid depiction of hunger and the accompanying madness of any movie I've seen. In addition, cannibalism, cowardice and fraud accompany all these very gritty, realistic and depressing realistic films. You simply couldn't have made a better movie of this type. Terrible but fantastic.
