"Coconut Peace Fruit Salad Island!" is a fun show that is on Saturday morning at WB. It stars Coconut Fred and all his friends on the island, and each episode is a very fun misadventure of theirs. Most of the time it is because of Coconut Peace's trouble making antics that make fun and other things happen on the island at the same time. The humor is great and no one on the island is very bright at all, adding that it is as entertaining as it is. I don't think it could be more fun. Voice talents of the characters are superbly superior and exaggerated, adding to the show's hilarity. If this is ever on DVD, I get it A.S.A.P! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for a good laugh.
