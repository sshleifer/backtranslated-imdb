This movie deserves a 20/10 if I could give one. "HOLLOW" is a great Hercule Poirot novel and the twist in the end fool most people. I am glad that this film remained absolutely true to the novel. There was no major difference that I could spot. The only difference was that Poirot was introduced in the story earlier in the short story. The action was fantastic and the music was as usual fantastic quality! David Suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the role is also perfect in their respective roles. In no other movie I've seen so far, Poirot has been portrayed so brilliantly! Hats out to the producers - they have made a movie that I, along with many others, will appreciate for a long time to come!
