There won't be a moment in this movie where you don't laugh. This is Mel Brooks at one of his highlights, and Cary Elwes carries that part of Robin with compelling humor. Every time you watch this movie, you'll discover a new joke, but those you've noticed before will never be old. Highly recommended!
