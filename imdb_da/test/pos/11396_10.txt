The brilliance of this story delivers at least one cleverly crafted message to every viewer in the audience. This story is about success, it's about failure. It's about the choices you make in life and the choices that others make for you. The story is about self-realization and determination on a scale that is so large that no camera angle can cover it. Within the understanding of each scene, there is an element that is marked for imaging in your imagination. Remember it when you watch the movie; It's more than eye candy. The sexually suggestive, rarely explicit scenes only serve to distract and entertain you during the boring character development process.
