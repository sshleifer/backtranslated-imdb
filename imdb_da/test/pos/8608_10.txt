The opening of Imamura's masterpiece avoids only sensationalism in its portrayal of the incredibly horrible events of August 6, 1945, when 90% of Hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives were destroyed in an instant. Instead, the Imamura emphasizes the unprecedented inferiority of the disaster, focusing on such sharp images as the diabolic fungus clouds quietly in the distance and the black rain spattering a beautiful young woman's face. The rest of the film tracks the ramifications of the latter event, bringing the atomic holocaust and its aftermath (over 100,000 people died of radiation poisoning) down to the understandable level of Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka) situation and her small "community bound by the bomb." The survivors strive for normality and continuity, especially by trying to find an appropriate marriage to Yasuko, but the imminent possibility of radiation disease shadows every aspect of their life. Of course, Yasuko's potential suits are probably away from a young woman, no matter how attractive they can suddenly get sick and die. True love, when it finally looks, makes it unexpected and ambiguous. We wonder if love across class lines is more a sign of Yasuko's status as "damaged goods" or of a common humanity cast in bold guidance in harsh circumstances that exceed class divisions. <br /> <br /> The classical restraint of the movie intensifies the impact, the extraordinary, eloquent interior shots remind us that Imamura began his career as an assistant to the great Ozu. Imamura's mastery is evident, for example, in the mated scenes of Yasuko bathing, the first emphasizing her lovely back and legs, the other how the hair falls out. The shoots are almost like bookends to the narrative path that distills its tragic essence. The film's documentary realism is violated in expressive eyes several times, perhaps especially in a scene that puts the troubled inner life of a shell-shocked veteran. Both scored by the famous avant-garde composer Toru Takemitsu and the stunning black-and-white photograph greatly contribute to the film's exciting atmosphere. When Yasuko's uncle (Kazuo Kitamura), the film's laconic narrator, in the last shot looks at the vacant sky for a rainbow as a sign of hope and regeneration, the black and white picture play suddenly becomes so exciting that it is almost unbearable. Few films from Japan (or elsewhere, for that matter) could be compared to the large, humanistic Japanese masterpieces of the 1950s. This movie is one of them. When I finished seeing it for the first time, I was stunned, unable to move for at least five minutes, overwhelmed when I was of the emotions, great tragedies were to inspire: terror and pity.
