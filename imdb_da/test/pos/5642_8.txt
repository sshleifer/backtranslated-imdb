Fires on the plain directed by Kon Ichikawa and written by Shohei Ooka and Natto Wada is another world war film that finally does not show the Allies fighting for the powers of the axis, but the Japanese fighting and fighting for their lives in the Philippines. The protagonist's name is Tamura, played by Eiji Funakoshi, and he is a soldier who leaves his regiment because he is ill. All he has on him is a hand grenade, his gun and some potatoes. In this way, he tries to make his way to the hospital to get the doctor and cure for his illness. But since the hospital beat him away and is destroyed, he begins a long walk. Throughout the movie, Tamura remains a little flawed, but much civilian as the other soldiers become more like animals by using their basic instincts for survival, Tamura is still a human being and will not break down. A scene that has influenced me a lot to think positively and differently about this war film is when Tamura enters a Filipino village that is completely deserted. There he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses with Japanese soldiers stacked up in front of a church. This makes Tamura think and even more afraid than he already is. It shows that the soldier is not a brave killer, but one serves to higher beings and humans most importantly. After turning away from the bodies, two Phillipinos (a couple or a brother and sister: very close relationship) return to the village to get their stash of salt back. The main movie in the film will first be friendly, though he went up to them with his gun, but shoots the woman when she starts screaming. Her brother / boyfriend / husband then runs away in fear and after a while Tamura follows him and shoots wildly on the fleeting Philippine. He doesn't hit him. After Tamura has picked up salt bag, something very valuable, he drops his gun in a river. This gesture is very important for understanding Kon Ichikawa / Shohei Ooka's profiling of Tamura and the war. Comparing this movie with other World War 2 movies, it is not typical at all. Of course, all movies are suffering, but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura. He expresses everything that is human: He is manipulated, he is weak, he becomes afraid, he has hope. This is typical of Japanese World War Two films and for Japanese communities. Since World War II is not a discussed topic in Japanese society, Japanese will probably put Japanese in World War II in the role of the victim. This victimization is also very visual in this movie. One of the examples is Tamura, another stacked by Japanese soldiers in front of the church, and another important one when the Japanese soldiers are trying to cross a street, and the Americans are already waiting for them and shooting all the Japanese soldiers who are inferior Equipment and being fed worse and have no health equipment or anything the same. In my personal conclusion, I must say that it is worth watching this movie for finally watching a movie from the other side than normal. Nor does it have any nationalist propaganda that could have been easily incorporated. Once you have watched the movie fully, you will be able to see the horror from World War II to its full extent.
