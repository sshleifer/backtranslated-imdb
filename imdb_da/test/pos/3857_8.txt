I have to say a big reason why I thought AristoCats was so big because I love cats. I love cats, which probably gave this movie a great score from me, but not only that, it was definitely a good movie as well, and I love where they make the movie's setting. This is one of my favorite animal films, although animated, and I really love how the actors / actors don't sound so unprofessional behind the animal's voice. For me, this movie seems like a classic, but I assume that IMDb it is not because it has yes, I think too low of a rating. You look at all the other "ORIGINAL" Disney movies and they have a much higher rating than this, but nevertheless AristoCats is one of the best animation movies there and I liked it over and over! !
