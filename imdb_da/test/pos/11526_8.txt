I loved it. I had just sat through half of "The Glass House" (off ... God, what was a prerequisite for predictable plot and bad acting) and then I saw this movie. I thought it was great. Loved both Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster in it. I liked the escapism of the whole setting, traveling around Europe in the 60s - yet they made it more realistic by showing the dark side and all the bad things that could happen. It kept my attention altogether, though I thought the portions were incredible.
