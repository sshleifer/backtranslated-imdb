Many years ago when I first read John Irving's World According to Garp, I was amazed that most of the younger adults I contacted didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. I saw something of a déjà vu when I read some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Separate Lies is certainly an age and experience thing. In this movie, the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he is a successful lawyer - she is the perfect wife for a successful lawyer. They have a townhouse in London and a home in the country. Everything is good until there comes the "villain" in the deck of the richest man's son in the village. This guy seems to be a cad from the word, "Go." He is contemptuous of everyone and everything, including his own children. Lastly, in the traditional form of fine guys, the lawyer's wife goes into an affair with the bounder. You see the lawyer is really a good guy, but with an organized perfectionist marriage killing feature. Although he really loves her, he bored his wife to death. The bad boy is far more exciting. <br /> <br /> All this is rooted in a death-killed death of a man in the village, where all the facts indicate that cad is the driver of the vehicle. <br /> <br /> It is easy to conclude that this movie is not a good ending, but it leads to a very satisfying end, as the man and his wife learn and grow from their experiences and will probably be able to do their personal life in a more successful way. <br /> <br /> Three outstanding actors play the main characters of this movie, and there are performances that make it all a pleasure to see. Tom Wilkinson is perfect as a man. His depiction shows us a kind man who has so much control over his feelings that he has lost touch with the world. Emily Watson shows us a woman who has become so caught in the role of perfect wife that she has almost lost her knowledge of passion. This passion is reborn by the character Rupert Everett has played right. <br /> <br /> If you have reached the point of life where you understand that everyone has the camp's feet and that everyone - even with gifts of intelligence and opportunities - makes many wrong decisions, then you will probably enjoy To see these excellent actors creating the lives of three such people. This is a beautifully acted and directed adult film about realistic adults.
