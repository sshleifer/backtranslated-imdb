Career criminal and criminal chief, Abel Davos (Lino Ventura) has been on the run for more than 10 years, hiding in Milan, Italy. In his absence, he has been sentenced to death in his homeland in France for his crimes. Disillusioned with his life in Italy and with the police closing in on him, he decides to return to his old stomping in Paris. Sending his wife Therese and two young sons up to Nice, Abel and his next commander Raymond Naldi make a final hoist to fund their new life back in France. Heist proffers a meager half million francs, far less than their sources had suggested, despite this and with the police in pursuit they both make it to Nice, where they hide short. Having stolen a pleasure boat from a local, they aim to make it to San Remo as a tourist resort where they will interfere more easily, but they are stopped by armed customs on a deserted beach that comes out and Therese and Naldi are both killed. A now-wounded Davos with two toddler children is easily discovered by the police, so he urges his old friends in Paris to send help, but they have gone further since their old friend was hiding and not too likely to take one. risk themselves so they send little time thief, Eric Stark (Jean Paul Belmondo) to save him. Davos is appalled that such a small thief is sent to his aid, even though he immediately knocks it off with the charming Stark, he sets out to find out why he has been stumbled, but their fraud does not stop there. Classe Tous Risques (aka Big Risk) was written for the screen of former death prisoner and criminal, Jose Giovanni (Le Trou, Le Clan des Sicily), with Ventura already on board for the project, Giovanniwanted Unique unique to lead the project, suggested Ventura an assistant director who had received his attention to a previous project, a Claude Sautet, who was known at that time to help Georges Franju at Les Yeux sans Visage. Sautet immediately agreed and the rest as they say is history. Sautet made a nice gangster movie that plays strongly on characters and relationships. Davos constantly hiding has plenty of time to reflect on his life, past, present and future, his friendships that no longer seem to be what he thought they were, his now deceased wife, and what will become of his two young sons. Ventura as a drawing actress has always amazed me, both comfortable and convincing in both the police and criminal fraternity. Here is his world's weary performance sublime and powerful as his world crumbles around him as loneliness and loneliness of a man on the run kicks in. Ventura's former profession as a pro wrestler gets plenty of use as he throws Parisian hoodlums around with complete ease. Belmondo as Stark enjoys the second story within the film, that of his emerging relationship with a girl he meets on the weather. With his sincere charm, his coming to this woman is in danger of being only a "Voleur" and that "the only good thing about me is my left" when he knocks out his aggressor is also a joy to see as she falls for him anyway. Belmondo's performance was overlooked at the time Godard's A bout de Souffl√© was released just three weeks earlier, achieving Gudard's credit for discovering the new kid in the block, his versatility within these two films that are there for everyone to see and admire . Sautet's movie is a classic affair that uses lots of attractive places, the movie also has a very sparse dialogue, Sautet prefers to let the actors do the work with the best-known looks or looks enough to continue the story, needles to say this Noir fan will Check out more of Sautet's work in the future.
