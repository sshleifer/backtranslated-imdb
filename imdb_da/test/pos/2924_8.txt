Few people realize it, but there was world literature in the ancient world before the Greeks came on stage. In addition to the literary remnants in the "Old Testament" of the Jews, there were significant works from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The first summit was the religious poetry and "The Epic Of Gilgamesh". The Egyptians produced many poems, but there was the main story of adventure at a traveler and doctor called "The Story Of Sinuhe". It is from this work (actually a fragment that we do not know the end of) that the short story "The Egyptian" came from. The story is unique (as it is the movie). "The Egyptian" was a best seller in the early 1950s, and Darryl Zanuck decided to take a chance to do it: yes he wanted a showcase for his boyfriend Bella Darvi as Nefer, as well as the rest of the cast. (Victor Mature, Edmund Purdom, Peter Ustinov, Michael Wilding and Gene Tierney), but he was aware that these movies rarely made big box office. One can criticize this as an example of Zanuck trying something else. The number of films dealing with ancient Egypt is very small. "The Pharaohs Land", "The Egyptian", "The Ten Commandments" (both De Mille versions), "Moses", "Holy Moses!", "Cleopatra", "The Mummy" (All Versions), "The Scorpion King". If there are 20 films about ancient Egypt, it is huge. But "the Egyptian" is unique. While the second "Ten Commandments" discusses Ramses the Great (Pharoah Ramses II - Yul Brynner) and his father Seti I (Cedric Hardwicke), and the films at Cleopatra dealing with her, there are few other names in ancient Egypt cut into films. . Egypt's largest Pharoah was Thutmos III, which captured most of the known Middle East by 1470 B.C.E. or such. No movie about him has appeared, not even by his unsurpassed predecessor, history's first great female ruler Hatschepsut. But the only known Pharoah who tried a religious revolution approaching what the Jews (and later the Christians) were trying to do - a kind of monotheism - is the subject of "the Egyptian". This is Pharoah Akhnaton. <br /> <br /> In fact, Akhnaton practiced a personal form of monotheism that was not intended for public consumption. But it twisted the clergy class who worshiped Amon, rather than Aton. Because of our uncertain historical records (although Akhnaton's official records - the "Tel-el-Amana" letters are completely complete, as far as they survive), we do not know whether Pharoah was killed in a palace coup or not. But he died, he was followed by a younger brother or son of his, whose name is better recalled than any other Pharoah except Ramses: Tutankhamun. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually pretty good as far as it goes. Wilding makes a good natured Akhnaton who is too weak to be as effective as a religious reformer should be. Elderly is good as the ambitious (and - beyond the film - ultimately successful future Pharoah) Horemheb. Tierney and Purdom are good at their main parts, and Ustinov is good as Purom's friend. Also good is Ms. Darvi, in a large support section. In a wonderful cameo, John Carridine is a philosophical tomb robber. The film is definitely worth seeing as one of the few attempts to show part of history and culture in ancient Egypt.
