They blame him for the deed, but Kane knows it was a man named Fry who was there. He becomes a fleeting and goes to find this man named Fry.He is helped by a friendly blind man. He lets his niece, billboard model Patricia Martin take the man to a local blacksmith to have his handcuffs removed. They do not stop there for the woman does not believe Barry and will take him to the police. But soon he will change his mind about Barry and find out about another sabotage attempt that will soon take place. There is a group of anti-American fascists. And Frank Fry is a member of this group. Saboteur (1942) is another example that Alfred Hitchcock couldn't make a bad movie. Robert Cummings plays Barry Kane and he is really good ..Priscilla Lane with her beautiful appearance plays Pat Martin. Also really good. Otto Kruger makes a great biggest villain as leader of the fascist group, Charles Tobin. Norman Lloyd, still alive at 94, plays Fry and makes a very credible villain. Vaughan Glaser is the most sympathetic character of the blind man Philip Martin. The dance hall is fantastic. And also moments on the circus train. Finally, we are at the Statue of Liberty.
