First of all, I have seen this show since I was a toddler and I have always loved it. Well, I didn't understand it when I was so young, but I still enjoyed it! And now I have been able to understand it for several years, I love it even more. The score in this musical is the most wonderfully detailed score I've ever heard! Every note is perfect, I don't even have to hear the song to enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Move on to this particular production - This is magnificent! Of course, no one could play Mrs. Lovett in addition to Angela Lansbury, and she made it perfect. And she was supposed to have played this role for years. George Hearn is absolutely brilliant. The best Sweeney Todd I've ever heard. He has a wonderful voice, yet he can throw his voice so well! His "epiphany" is incredible, as you can tell from the audience's reaction to it. The judge, Toby, Antony and Pirelli are also so wonderful in their roles. Everyone is perfect! Well, I still have to fast forward through Johanna's green finch and linen bird. She just doesn't sing the song well. <br /> <br /> This show can be appreciated at any age, but it is not always accepted. I am not your typical medieval theater lover, I am only 15 years old, but Sweeney Todd has given me a greater understanding of music than I have gotten from any other musical.
