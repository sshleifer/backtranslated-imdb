Roy Andersson's "Du Levande" is not entirely original, as it is the counterpart to Andersson's previous film "Songs from the second floor". The film still has aura of total originality. Some film-making conventions are still thrown away: most of the actors don't look like what one would expect in movies, and the shot takes a long time. Most of the time the camera is not moving, but people are moving around it. The shoots start from one place, and many times the stage builds in amazing proportions. WG Sebald comes to mind in the literature with the same technique. Due to the time invested in each shot, the suspension is really high in many of the scenes. There is a story and is not - it is left to the viewer to build in his or her own mind. This movie is positive. It is determined not to see all of this in a negative way, and at the same time will not pass the social injustices. One of the messages I got from it was that maybe all the flaws and accidents are not fatal. Great film.
