It's a shame that this movie is rated PG 13 - it's really quite suitable for everyone - although young children might not follow it all too well. It belongs to the wonderful genre of comic ghost / angel stories that should include everything from Capras "It's a Wonderful Life" to Wenders' "Wings of Desire." <br /> <br /> The shooting is amazing, the acting first movement, and - wondering wonders - the tone is uplifting. My only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the movie. The two interwoven stories seem first and foremost exciting mysterious; but they do a little too well for my taste. As the instructor points out in his comment on the DVD, all the ingredients in Irwin's history are on his bedside table. The symbolism is just a little bit too pat for me. <br /> <br /> But what a lark! My favorite scene should be when the relocator tries to have breakfast in a dining room. This is practically theatrical in its magic - a turn the force of witty - subtle, playful and positively rhythmic - combined with striking filmography and an acute eye for the grotesque. <br /> <br /> "Northfork" is fun, touching, beautiful to look at, magical (with the above reservations) and doesn't have a single car chase. An easy nine stars.
