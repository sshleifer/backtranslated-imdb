I never understood what a fantastic dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and beautiful. What a pleasure to see her with George Murphy. The story was typical of his day, but the dance was really special. I never tolerate seeing Fred and Ginger, but Lana Turner in this movie was just as amazing. I've always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to hand over. She should have done more dancing and less of Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. I had a new understanding for her after watching this movie and her wonderful dance. Too bad, "Academy" does not give an "Oscar" to dance.
