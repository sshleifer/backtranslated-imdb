Of course it made the cheap to exploit the infamous "Mandingo", this eerie pandering hunk of blithely rancid Italian sexploitation junk really spawns the sordid stuff with a commendable lack of taste and restraint: the evil arrogant white family who owns and runs a lavish slave Plantation spend a majority of the screen time engaging in hanky panky each other and their various slaves. Director Mario Penzauti and scriptwriter Tecla Romanelli applaud this cool filth with an overwhelming surplus of sizzling sleaze: we have ugly rape, interracial copulation (a white lady makes wild love for a muscular black stud while tied to a cross), abundant Female nudity, brutal whippings, creepy degradation, lots of lurid soft-core sex and a serious twisted tragic surprise end, blending elements of incest, murder, and misrepresentation into a dubious attempt to make a statement about the ugly inhumanity of slavery. Special kudos are in order for foxy brunette actor Paola D'Egidio, whose merry and unrestrained depiction of fake and very evil bitch Rhonda burns positively on the screen. In addition, Marcello Giombini's funky, throbbing tribal score hits the groovy spot. Maurizo Centini's retouched film picture does the same. A satisfying, lumpy lump of mucus swollen.
