If you like subtle psychological dramas / thrillers, this is a movie for you. Those who want to see a regular sex'n'rim erotic thriller will surely not understand this movie, as Colin Firth of course did when he called it "waste." But Jennifer Rubin is still the right star of the movie. She is such a brilliant and beautiful actress! Along with turning and turning history, it becomes more and more psychological and makes you think about yourself, the wonderful management, photography and especially the music making this movie a masterpiece. Also, the small parts are very good, especially Belinda Waymouth is great in her little scene. I hope it will soon be released on DVD, and a soundtrack album would be a dream come true !!
