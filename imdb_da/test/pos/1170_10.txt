This movie is well cast, often stupid and always fun. Lemmon and Matthau work their roof team magic to perfection. Brent Spiner is just a revolt as a cruise director's selfish tyrants. From the first "hare krishna" to the last "you should pay him fifty bucks to call you two sticks", I thought it was a totally entertaining fun comedy
