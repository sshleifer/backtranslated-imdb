I thought this movie should be completely paralyzed by the ads I saw in theaters. When my sister borrowed from a friend, I decided to see it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. . . Needless to say ten minutes in the movie and I loved it Amanda was a great actor in the movie, her comic timing was perfect. The guy who played Duke was warm, clean and simple. My favorite scene was definitely when Amanda goes by the gardener and a fellow student who is suspicious of her and she talks to her mother about dresses - which she pretends to be a guy! I re-watched this part over and over again ... to make a long story short, the movie I thought would be paralyzed - I own it now.
