Akin's award-winning 2004 film Head-On / Gegen die Wand portrayed the appealing chaotic world of a self-destructive but dynamic Turkish-German rocker named Cahit (Birol Ünel). This documentary is an offshoot of Head-On and explores the range of music you could find in Istanbul today if you were as energetic and curious as German avant-rock musician Alexander Hacke from the group Einstuerzende Neubauten (who arranged the soundtrack and performed some of the music for Head -On) and had the help of a film cabinet and Turkish speakers from director Akin. You get everything from rap to the most traditional Turkish classical song, with rock, Kurdish music and Turkish pop in between. It is so chaotic and open to a world like Cahit's, where east is east and west is west, but the two are somehow meeting. <br /> <br /> Like Istanbul itself, sitting on the edge of Europe and Asia, bringing the two worlds together while remaining sui generis. This is a melange that includes Turkish pop, Turkish traditional songs, Kurdish laments, Roma jazz musicians and group of street buskers (Siyasiyabend), lively and offbeat shots of Istanbul street life, and some talking about the camera about synthesis and some personal and musical history of singers and musicians. Work out of the Grand Hotel de Londres in Istanbul's Beyoglu neighborhood, where Cahit stayed at the end of Head-On while looking for his beloved Hack roams around the city with crew and equipment that interviewed people and recorded their music. <br /> <br /> He begins with some loud rock of the "neo-psychedelic" band Baba Zula ?? These are musicians he has tied to as he merges Head-On's score and stands for the absent bassist - and by Turkish (including brave female) rappers ?? which makes some old-fashioned to go out of the theater early and miss the predominantly tuny and easy-to-hear sounds that make up the bulk of the movie. (Head-On's story overruns were tempered periodically by musical interludes performed by a traditional Turkish orchestra sitting outside on the other side of the Bosphorus.) Hacke allows us to meet and hear performances by some of the most well-known live Turkish singers, including Müzeyyen Senar, a lady of the late 80s whose aging elegant musicians are reminiscent of the way the great Egyptian singing fight Umm Kulsoum used to perform. Hacke gets the songwriter-movie star Orhan Gencebay to make a striking solo on the long-necked old, he has written all his songs and persuades the now eerie big Sezen Aksu.to make a special performance of one of her most famous songs "Memory of Istanbul." This is a coup and it is also a regret of a beautiful Kurdish sangressor, Aynar, who is admitted to a bath whose acoustics are spectacular if they could only have turned the heat down ?? songs and musician faces flowing with sweat. There is also a young Canadian woman, Brenna MacCrimmon, floating in Turkish, singing Turkish traditional folk song with expression and joy. The sound mix is ​​of high quality throughout. One wants to see a successor; many fantastic examples of Turkish popular and classical music have necessarily been omitted. <br /> <br /> Films released in the summer of 2005 and shown at festivals in 2005 and 2006. Opened at the Angelika Film Center in New York City in June 9, 2006.
