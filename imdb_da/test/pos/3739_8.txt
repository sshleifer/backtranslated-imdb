That's right, we have a 2008 movie using themes of "Brief Encounter" and "Bridges of Madison County." It is basically the story of lost love, redemption, and a triumph of the human spirit. The performances of Richard Gere and especially Diane Lane are very good. Gere is giving this kind of detained performance here as a physician looking for meaning after a patient dies on the console. Lane is the mother of a rebellious daughter and a lovely young son who has split from her wandering husband and has also sustained the loss of her father in the same year. Scott Glenn steals the show in a stage meeting with Gere. He is the heartbroken man, and he tells his love for his late wife, it will bring tears to his eyes. <br /> <br /> Fresh from her triumph as a greeting mother in "Doubt", Viola Davis looks like an understanding friend in the movie and literally hangs her hair down to a pretty good performance.
