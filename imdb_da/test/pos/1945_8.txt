River's Edge is an extremely disturbing film written by renowned American actor Neal Jimenez. It is based on a concrete event that happened at a time when most American youths were trying to make sense of their lives. This is one of the most outstanding films made by American director Tim Hunter. Much of the film's attention is focused on a ruthless murder by an innocent teenager. This unfortunate event initiates a series of questions about real motivations of young people in American society. Those who watched this movie during its initial release should have had vivid memories of the great actor Dennis Hopper in a confused role as a sympathetic social exclusion. Matrix star Keanu Reeves also looks good as a teenager before reaching stardom. At a time when teen flicks are made without any serious preparation, it is hoped that "River's Edge" can not only be ignored as another silly teen girl.It had massive impact on people who lived in turbulent times of the past when It was a resident of a sleepy town who was akin to not being born. For today's generation with their well-known Internet overdose props like Facebook, Twitter and Orkut, River's Edge seems to be outdated, but its importance cannot be denied by a serious movie manager.
