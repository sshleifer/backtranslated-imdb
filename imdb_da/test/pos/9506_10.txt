As other reviews have mentioned, there are a few missing videos from this collection, but what's on this disk is overwhelming. There are two separate audio tracks, an original recording and a completely new version of the new performance. Any new music from the residents is welcome, and for the first time I assume the listener that the new version may be more earliest, but I prefer the original recordings (probably just because they are "the originals." The production of this DVD is amazing, New and old videos are all interesting, with live performance videos probably the least interesting of what is offered (although the excerpts of live footage saved as Easter eggs are very welcome) .This is not a tenant, this is a must own collection.
