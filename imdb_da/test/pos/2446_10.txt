Want to know if "The Outsiders" (Australian TV series) will ever be released on DVD sometime in the future? And is the music (Title Theme) available on CD? There was only a series of 13 episodes of this drama and should have gone on to at least three or even four series in total. <Br /> <br /> The young German actor in the series was also in a German television series called "Black Forest Clinic" which was sent here in England with English dialogue overlaid to lip-sync. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to hearing comments from the TV Industry staff on the above questions, thank you in advance.
