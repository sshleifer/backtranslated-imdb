Sally and Saint Anne are a very funny movie. The first time my mother told me I was 7 and Saint Anne was just the Saint I had for my Communion Saint. My mother knew it so she told me to see this with her. I did that and have seen it many times since it is really fun. Aunt Bea from the Andy Griffith Show was in it, and Sally's grandfather was the guy who played Santa in Miracle On 34th Street. Then there were many actors, we also watched TV shows. There is a bad guy trying to steal the house away and Sally keeps trying things with St. Anne to help raise money so they can keep the house. It includes a boxing match with Hugh O'Brian, who plays his elder brother. This is a good and fun movie that I still love.
