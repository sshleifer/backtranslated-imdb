When I watched this movie for the first time, I was both surprised and somewhat shocked by the obvious vibration of history. It is a very artistic drama with incredible special effects, spectacular plays, not to mention a very excellent work in the makeup department. Jennifer Lopez has withdrawn from previous roles who dug into her career with this film and portrayed a very sensitive child psychologist working with a team of engineers to enter the brain of comatose patients to treat them. Vincent D'onofrio played incredibly well. His depiction of a sadistic serial killer was perfect for a T. The sheer feeling conveyed by his performance is amazing. Vince Vaughn is not my favorite, but still performed exceptionally well. The symbolism and the artwork were exciting and titillating, sometimes surprising and other times shocking. All in all, I say this is a wonderful movie with excellent plays and beautiful artwork.
