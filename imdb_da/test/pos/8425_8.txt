Despite the fact that this production has received a number of bad reviews, it actually keeps pretty good at its age. Also note that it is not a BBC program, it was simply licensed to them by Granada Ventures when the Jane Austen collection was released on DVD. So how does it compare with other adaptations of the same novel? The most famous version these days is the 1995 film with Amanda Root as Anne Elliott and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Frederick Wentworth. The movie was of course shorter, but a good snapshot of the story - the previous version with Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall in the same roles had four hours to tell the story and moved at a more relaxed pace. <br /> <br /> Firbank is a good ten year old for its role, but she is very good - Marshall is excellent as Wentworth, a man disappointed in love and bitter about interference. And hidden in the cast are people who also contribute - Michael Culver, later seen in Cadfael, as Harvill; Richard Vernon, later seen in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, as Admiral Croft; Noel Dyson, formerly in Coronation Street, as Mrs Musgrove. <br /> <br /> One criticism I have is that the hairstyles are a little distracting and the costumes are terrible! Nevertheless, this should not detract from a tremendously enjoyable Austen adaptation.
