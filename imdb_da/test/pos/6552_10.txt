Uzumaki has a formidable reputation in Lovecraftian circles, and now I know why. Uzumaki is based on a Manga title (which is incredibly allegedly better than the movie) and follows the bizarre events of a typhoon in an isolated Japanese city. I'm not telling you anything that happens in this movie because it's an absolute must see movie. I saw it for the first time last night, and I was blown away. It shot into my movie all the time and blasted Pan's maze as the best amazing movie (literally and photographically) released in the last decade. <br /> <br /> This movie is very Lovecraftian in nature without formally having any direct connection to Cthulhu Mythos. It is made in the same way that Lovecraft composed his stories; It exudes power as an aura of 'something is not quite right here' intensifies through a burning phase to fear and ultimately scare through subtle progressive changes in the soundtrack and cinematography. This is actually a "Weird Tale" par excellence. <br /> <br /> Simply amazing.
