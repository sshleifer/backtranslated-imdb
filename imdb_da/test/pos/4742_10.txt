Commitment rules are one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It is well designed, well pieced together, and provides excellent footage to back up the claims it takes. The film's best quality is that it is not based on being sympathetic to the participants, as much as it informs the public about the obvious state errors and lies surrounding the whole situation. I'm back with feelings of disturbing anxiety and extreme anger over the way the government handled and then covered a tragedy of this magnitude. Covered up is what left me really firing. It's one thing to make a mistake in an operation and admit guilt, but another to see the American people completely in the eye and lie to them. I suppose it shouldn't surprise me with the story of our beloved country, who has seen the JFK murder, the Vietnam War and other important events that smell so bad on a cover that you have to keep your nose every time you drive through Washington DC The recordings from a plane with special heat-sensitive technology and the autopsy on some of the bodies clearly show that the FBI is lying to the public. One of the things I try to pay attention to when I see a documentary like this is that I usually only receive testimony from a point of view. But again, it is undoubtedly one of the brilliant successes of the engagement rules. It presents its evidence in such a final way that even though you were presented with statements from the FBI, how could you really believe them. I can clearly remember when the standoff occurred as the media presented the participants as this crazy group of cult governments with David Koresh, the self-proclaimed, reborn Jesus Christ as their leader. None of this was really fact, but rather history spun from bits and facts. They simply stood up to have the rights to carry weapons and exercise their religion as American citizens. If you were the ATF and you wanted to search the connection, the building attacks with a unit of men armed with rifles and bulletproof suits, the way to do that? If you are the FBI, why participate in psychological warfare and offer a bit of negotiation to help solve the situation? Why save gallons of harmful gas if you want to save children? Why open large holes in composite structures when you know the possibility of starting a fire? Why lie about not shooting weapons when clearly visible on video? Unless. Unless you wanted to see the situation end with the way it did. The scene at the end when the Dividers Star of David flag flew out of the flagpole into the fire and the ATFs was shortly upright was an emotional climatic scene that made my head shake in disgust and my stomach becomes uncontrollable. The filmmaker William Gazecki deserves my highest congratulations. It takes a lot of effort to make a movie like this, and I am sure there have also been many consequences for the government. Because of people like him, the public can show real truth rather than crap, which is filtered through a media that presents information that can hardly be considered genuine. Looking back at how I felt at that time against the Divids because of the media representation of David Koresh and how I felt after watching this movie, it is truly amazing. It reminds me of the line from the Bible to a man who was healed by Jesus and asked by the elders how it happened "before I was blind, but now I can see", he continued to tell them. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You may have to search for it, but it's really something special.
