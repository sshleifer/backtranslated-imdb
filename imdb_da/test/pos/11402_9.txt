Boogie Nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples that any film will have a long look at. Sure you could spend lots of quality time reviewing the classics from Hitchcock to Scorsese; But let's follow the modern generation and study half-heartedly. <br /> <br /> Where to start, you assume you could watch the movie as just a story, perhaps even docudrama, focusing on the porn industry in the late 1970s â€” and what an industry it was ! The other half could focus on the incredible details that a brilliant-cut film maker can achieve by simply using polyester and * ahem * rubber. But honestly, Boogie Nights brings back the clean, no bull! Shi $, in your face kind of cinema, I haven't experienced since the movie's greats of the 1970s ... ironic ... or brilliant blow. The story is full of richly detailed characters that you can also relate to, love or hate; But the effect is clear - you feel something for them. Among the figures are the two performances that stand out: Burt Reynolds as director Jack Horner and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams / Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is also brilliant, like Heather Graham ... but if I focus on an actor, it should be John C. Reilly. John's performance is a perfect balance between comic timing and character-driven feeling ... I'm a sucker for the line "Have you ever seen the movie Star Wars? ... People say I look like Han Solo." Still, the film's appearance is incredible, director of photography and director / author / producer, come with a vibrant color and flashy style that compares to Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick (regarding his perfection of his craft); But with creating its own unique look and pushing the edge with the longest single shot I've ever seen ... it's New Year's party sequence. <br /> <br /> The music, as in any good movie, is a character of its own. Sometimes it is consumed with grief or grief ... but mostly it is about fun, dance and good time; The spirit of the 1970s. OK, back to the show. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a porn-controlled, who feels the burden of what the future of "movie" means for his genre. The horrible transition from recording to film to recording on tape. It looses his art as it was ... and the changes in the mentality of the people he works with. Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocence and sexual bravado needed for the character. For all the people who have seen Burton's Apes Planet, don't pay attention to Wahlberg's performance in that movie ... rent boogie nights and see what difference a good script can make! <br /> <br /> Julianne Moore plays the wild mother for everyone and with it comes the agony and anxiety she feels when life imitates the art; and she loses all those close to her. Heather Graham is eye-candy, but later holds his own and steals some of the scenes from even the great Mr. Reynolds himself. Each character is multidimensional, rich in life and performed by actors who seem to be pictured for that matter. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is often fun, tragic, exciting and provides an uncompromising insight into the turbulent lifestyle of the fast 1970s. It gives no excuses and does not tell lies; and give the audience a ride back. But more importantly, the film gives us an excellent example of how movies should be made; and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film.
