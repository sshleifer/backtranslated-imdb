I think this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best shows in a movie and I've seen most of her movies. I saw this for the first time on TV when I was about fourteen and I was so scared. I watch this movie every time from time to time and I still enjoy it a lot. I know these movies wouldn't scare people too much. It just shows that the public film and television audience has seen too much graphic violence over the last thirty years or so. I love movies that don't show the graphic details you let your imagination do for you. Cast in this movie was top notch. Jess Walton, who played the sister in history, was very good, although her part was rather small. She also played in a fantastic made for TV thriller around the same time, which is called You will never see me again with David Hartman. I got the biggest kick out of Eileen Heckart's housekeeper performance. Eileen was as good as a lady with a very poor disposition. George Maharis, who played the man, was quite efficient. Of course, this story had many so-called mistakes in the plot, but I still love the movie. I highly recommend this movie to people who love a good thriller without graphic violence. I gave this movie a voice of seven.
