Wow! In my opinion, NET is an excellent, nail-biting techno thriller that lets you feel good everywhere. When I first saw it, I felt good all the time. When Angela (Sandra Bullock) went to Mexico, I thought to myself: "It is a really nice place to vacation." From the moment Jack (Jermey Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) began chasing her, I thought to myself: "Don't do anything for her!" I also took a few deep breaths to prevent me from screaming more than I already had. On the bright side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. In conclusion, I give this excellent, nail-biting, techno-thriller with four stars.
