Yet another in the long line of "Do not" films from the late 70's and early 80's is much more than that. This movie is a very undervalued low budget schlocker with a twist. It has the grainy quality and the bizarre soundtrack typical of horror movies from the time, but it is the very underrated notions of the surprisingly talented actors / actresses that make this movie good. A young nurse arrives at Dr. Stephens' progressive mental hospital right after being murdered by one of his patients, and everything is not what it seems. It seems that Dr. Masters, a rather ambitious female doctor, has taken over her duties and started to implement her own ideas. Each of the patients takes their own unique personalities and has their own personality traits and deficiencies that provide very entertaining interactions. There is the nymphomania, the crazy old crone, the woman with an unhealthy obsession with infants and a man who has returned to his childhood among others. There is also a strange little twist to this bizarre story, which later finds the young nurse trapped inside the asylum area, with the patients running loose and organs leaning up. If you are a fan of cheap 70's sleaze than this is the movie for you!
