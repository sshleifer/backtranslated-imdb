This is a powerful movie that apparently never resurrected after the Joe McCarthy censorship period. It affects me as a Jewish teenager who had friends of different colors and whose father's family suffered from the fascist regimes in Europe in the second quarter of the twentieth century. Unlike the later rip-off, "On the Waterfront", which seemed to take some of the same themes and twist them to fit the clear political correction of time, it told its story directly and with respect for the signs and reality it reflected fictionally. It was an antidote to "Gone With the Wind", "The Birth of the Nation," "Willen's Triumph," and so many other glorifiers of hatred and violence. I would put it along with the recent German movie (also almost hidden in the US), "Rosenstrasse." <br /> <br /> I remember the television version, also black and white in format and history, was blacked out by some stations because the black hero's wife turned white. As a young civilian, it has created a conflict for me because on the one hand I was opposed to smoking cigarettes and on the other opposite the boycott in Georgia by a sponsor of the television show, a large tobacco company (I no longer remember which one - does anyone else?). <br /> <br /> I would love to find a CD on either a movie or TV show to let my sons see something that informed my opposition to racism universally (as opposed to only fighting racism against Jews) and recognition of the inherent link between racism and militarism.
