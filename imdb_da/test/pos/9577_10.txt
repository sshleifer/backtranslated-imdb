In the era of the Farrelly Brothers and Jackass series, getting a movie made and performed by Americans coming out that is well paced and full of charm as well as hilarity is almost close to miraculous. This ensemble has been behind some other endeavors, most recently "A Mighty Wind", which was so subtle, it seemed to be an actual documentary without overlaying entertainment, but "Best In Show" hits on all cylinders. It is superbly cast with some of the best American actors, Parker Posey, radiating energy even when standing still, Eugene Levy as tolerant everyman who is not doormat, even though he seems to be (or perhaps "indomitable doormat"). Fred Willard's brilliant styles, many of which are entertaining performances, which are usually not associated with Americans or American actors. One of the few humorous movies I can see over and over again.
