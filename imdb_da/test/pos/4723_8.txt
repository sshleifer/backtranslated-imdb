This film worked against two goals: to make a political point and to tell a frightening adventure story. It is often difficult to make a political point and still tell a good story (consider the very political but rarely entertaining last season of Ellen). Beyond Rangoon finds a good balance between politics and storytelling. I already knew that Aung San Suu Kyi had won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and knew something about the repressive political situation in Burma, so the political message of the film was mostly a dramatization of what I already knew. But I thought the film did a great job of telling about Aung San Suu Kyi and the most faceless dictators who have been trying to silence her for years. The unit of presenting an unknown setting through the eyes of a character with which viewers can identify is quite common, but it is quite well done in this movie. Of course, the real goal of the movie was its entertainment value. Arquette was excellent as a young woman whose sister took her to a distant, unknown place to shake her out of her depression over her husband and son's violent death. She is convincingly detached and depressed. Her mourning condition gives her a clear reason for her distracted walks in the tongue of a dangerous situation she doesn't understand, otherwise she would be too intelligent to stumble upon. <br /> <br /> When the dangers become so obvious she can see through themselves through the grief of grief, she is caught without any escape. It puts her on an adventure road where she needs her intelligence to survive. The authors deserve great credit for making her intelligent and inventive enough to handle many dangerous situations while still finding a likely reason why she is stupid enough to get into trouble in the first place. The management is also strong and stops the tension during the race to escape the forces of the dictatorship. <br /> <br /> This movie had additional impact on me and my wife due to other events of the same time period. We were preparing for a trip to India and heard news reports from Western tourists hosted by a terrorist group in India. Avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is completely different from escaping an oppressive dictatorship. But the movie and the news shared the item to avoid danger in an unknown country. This common characteristic gave the film meaning beyond the strength of its own talented storytelling. The film illustrates the international tourist's worst nightmare.
