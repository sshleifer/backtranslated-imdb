Honestly, when I went to watch this movie at the Rave Theater in Plainfield Indiana, I didn't expect much. I only went to this movie because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie, it will be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and looked and then why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has a great advantage for other movies that attract me to a horror movie. It shows Jacob Godnat as someone who is human. He has a heart no matter how twisted and scary it is. He feels pain, something Jason never does or seems to show. He feels sadness and pleasure, even if they are crazy again, as you will see if you see the movie. All in all, a different experience in my opinion than many slashes, and it surprised me in a few ways, as with who eventually lived.
