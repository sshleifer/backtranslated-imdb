You can read all kinds of references in the Idiocra world. A futuristic world populated by pampered, self-satisfied morons spun by technology in a bygone era: This idea is the precedent of HG Wells' "The Time Machine" and Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" among other satires. /> <br /> Early in the film, one explains the rapid degradation of humanity over five hundred years, but does not fill the gaps in which all futuristic technology came from in the meantime. Most criticisms of this very funny (and funny) movie seem to surround this omission, and the consequent complaint that the world is not "realistic". As if "realism" has ever been a necessary quality of satire. Is "Brazil" realistic? What about "Futurama" or "Transmetropolitan"? Hell, what about "Gulliver's Travels"? I did not believe. "Idiocracy", while it may not be as sharp as the best of the genre, hits the same notes and generally does it successfully. <br /> <br /> Also, I didn't find the futuristic technology a problem. It's pretty easy to find out that Mike Dommer is satirizing the current trend of automation and simple product interfaces so that even total idiots can use them. As in "Brave New World", the film community seems to have reached a point of automated self-sufficiency at some point in the past (apparently created by the now extinct "smart people" to place an increasingly stupid population), leaving the rest of mankind free to spoil all the worst, most selfish impulses they can come up with, and become even more stupid. The movie just happens during the last rubbing of humanity, as everything begins to fall apart for good. It can still be "unrealistic", but in that case it is a remarkably well-presented brand of unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The stupid people take most of the screen time, of course, but they are just the victims - they don't know better. Mike Judge rescues his real hatred for the intelligent powerful who have died when the film begins, but lives very right now in the 21st century. People like scientists chasing "hair growth and long-lasting erections" for no other reason than the possibility of winning their snake oil treatments. People like politicians who let businesses buy simply the FDA and the FCC. People like media conferences and their yuppie stooges, which promote stupidity - make it possible to destroy all culture, morals and health to get a quick money. After all, who's really blamed, Morlocks or Eloi? Paris Hilton, or the brilliant leaders and advertisers who put her on television and lowered our cultural standards enough to leave her there? However, this is all implicit in "Idiocracy". A line here, a hint there (witness the fun auto-doctor who literally does all the work in the health system). It is one of the few aspects of the film that is NOT bound in the ground by the unnecessary narrator. It's just there for the viewer to pick up, or not, but it's one of the most interesting themes in a movie that is much smarter than any other comedy of the year. Pity that so many people will let the movie think, it's just an excuse to show the back end and people are hit in the groin. Not that things aren't fun too, and maybe it's a little pandering. But in "Idiocracy" it just isn't as simple as it seems.
