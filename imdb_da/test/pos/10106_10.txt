This review is a long time ago when I consider a story of two sisters to be the greatest single movie ever made. I put this gem up against any movie in terms of manuscript, filmography, acting, post-production, editing, management or any other aspect of film making. It's practically perfect in all of them ?? a true masterpiece in a sea of ​​faux "masterpieces." <br /> <br /> The structure of this movie is easily the most closely built in the history of the cinema. I can't think of any other movie where something of vital importance appears every two minutes. Quite literally, Ji-Kim seems to have made a movie that virtually cuts the viewer to dissect it at the most detailed levels. An apparently insignificant object can be displayed? a rack of dresses, two diaries, a blood drop coming from a floor crack, a bottle of pills, etc. ?? but after careful inspection turns out to be so much more ?? a clue that helps to sense the scene in question (or perhaps the movie in total), which almost always contributes to a reflection on the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewers intelligence asks them to come to the foreground. Such an event may occur a handful of times during another movie, but in a speech by two sisters such events occur in such a fast and relentless manner that the viewer must see the movie in perpetual state so that they do not miss anything important. In other words, the content of this movie is enough to easily fill a dozen other movies. How can anyone in their real mind ask for something more from a movie than this? It is simply the highest and most superlative form of cinema imaginable. The most talked about criticism of A Tale of Two Sisters is nicely summed up by Zaphod B Goode, who mistakenly claims that history is an incoherent, undissolved mess that uses confusion to infuse a false sense of intelligence because it does not give a last set of facts that is the basis of the exciting questions. He says Ji-woon Kim threw a dozen possible explanations and left it. In reality, however, nothing can be further from the truth. A narrative of two sisters provides a number of unacceptably objective facts that help the viewer identify the EXACT occurrences of each scene in the movie. If our good friend Zaphod had been aware, he would have noticed ?? e.g ?? the series of obvious flashbacks that provide sufficient factual information to make sense of the movie. These feedbacks convincingly convince Zaphod's claim of complete subjectivity. The objective elements of A Tale of Two Sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere assertion of lack of objectivity can only question a viewer's patience, which apparently will not make even the slightest effort at all watch them. Can Ji-woon Kim really be spoiled for the impatient viewers who lack a desire to understand his movie? I do not think. <br /> <br /> Please note that I will not offend the intelligence of critics such as Zaphod who cannot "get" a tale of two sisters because it really has nothing to do with lack of intelligence as much as lack on persistence. The film sticks out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort from the viewer. Yes, this movie requires quite a considerable amount of puzzle solution, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful image. You just put them together. Remember, the manuscript was written by someone with the image already in mind? He simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully everywhere with the purpose of delivering a magnificent brain effect as ?? when completed ?? provides an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. There are movies that seem to start with an incomplete image and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble in design. Spider Forest (2004), Perfect Blue (1998) and Donnie Darko (2001) are perfect examples of this. A tale of two sisters is not. It is ironic that Zaphod claims that Darko is more masterfully constructed than a number of two sisters, especially given that Darko not only provides almost no objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential deus ex machina cliché That could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence. I am ashamed to mention the two films in the same sentence, but contrast is an important one. Though it confuses me that Zaphod would quote a movie that crumbles when exposed to even the smallest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a movie that becomes visible only through a significant use of intellectual action. Apparently, he seems to be able to make his "intelligent" film in the most superficial form possible. This is evident when he makes 17 consecutive questions in his review, which is answered quite convincingly by the film itself. Just read the threads of Opiemar in IMDb A Tale of Two Sisters Discussion Forum. Anyone who carefully reads these threads and still claims the lack of an objective solution to this movie may just as well stop seeing intelligent movies completely because the answers are so damned OBVIOUS. <br /> <br /> I'd like to say more, but I've come to my 1000 word limit. Everything that has been said here was necessary to say. Then it is said now!
