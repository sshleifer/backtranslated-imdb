Wow! Great movie in my opinion, I didn't expect to be so good! I was imprisoned from start to finish - it is a very well-educated and educational film that really gives us a fascinating insight into the attempts Darwin had to undergo to convey his ideas to the world, chronic his life as he writes "Origin of the species"; struggles both personal demons and the ignorant society of the time to do so. He struggles hard with his mind, body and soul when personal relationships break, and even his family seems to slip away ... while the rest of the world is against him as he knows his results are shaking the very foundation of their life, culture and meaning of existence. It's a subtle movie (not exaggerated in any way in the typical Hollywood way, this is a BBC produced British movie), but fortunately very powerful in importance, and it's thanks to the fantastic orderly scenes as well as the amazing play by Bettany. Connelly seems more of a light supporting role, but I enjoy her in this and she is as good as expected as always, her chemistry with her husband was definitely strong and endearing, you could feel the connection and their real husband / wife bonds shining completely Clearly through their performances. But the star of the show is definitely Bettany, and he does a brilliant job, a very moving performance - I understood and sympathized with him as he fought for his own degrading health and forthcoming "insanity" to try to understand what he has uncovered and come to understand what it all really is and means when he found his thinking contrary to his feelings and found himself losing everything including his wife, who was, of course, a firm believer in religion and a strict Christian while he was in the realm of science two worlds that could not see the eye, so their relationship was also at stake. <br /> <br /> Anyway - a really good, well-behaved emotional drama and dare I say that I throw a tear under the tragic climax that was really heartbreaking as well as beautifully poignant and moving. The film is also symbolic and very intellectually artistic, in fact I can't wait to see it again, as there was a lot to take in the first time, which I missed. Easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.
