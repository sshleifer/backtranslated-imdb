Maid Kitty (Sothern) is engaged to Bill (Kelly) who neglects her to work long hours in her garage to save money for their marriage. After standing up on her birthday, Kitty goes on a double-date / blind date when she meets the department store heiress Bob Hartwell (Hamilton). She falls in love but leaves him when his love protocols seem to cover a desire for her to be his mistress, rather than his wife. Faithfully Bill rallies around to comfort her, and finally, she repeats her repeated requests to restore their engagement, partly pushed by Bill's family support, after she's lost her job. When Bob returns, but convinced he wants marriage, Kitty will follow her heart or conscience? <br /> <br /> This movie was much better than I expected to be. The bill's character only begins as the kind of high comic Irish type that Jack Carson played so often. But Kelly (and the script) infuses the character with true compassion and love, and Bill turns out to be the best person in the whole group. Viewers can find themselves rooting for him against the harmless Hartwell! However, the tone of the movie wavers between bright heart romance and a much darker side, especially in the portrayal of a dance marathon and a rather horrible accident at Bill's garage. <br /> <br /> The cast is rounded off by the reliable Jane Darwell as Kitty's mother, an impish but not yet thoroughly uncomfortable Mickey Rooney as Kitty's younger brother and Spencer Charters as Kitty's ne'er-well-well father.
