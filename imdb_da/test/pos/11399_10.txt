One of the things I like about PT Anderson is that he has the courage to take talent that most people push to the side or have pushed to the side and make them stars. Case in point, one washed up ... Burt Reynolds delivers a great performance in this movie. And if it turns out that Adam Sander can be a great actor (Punch Drunk Love), it wasn't enough ... here comes Mark Whalburg ... like you've never seen before. <br /> <br /> I think many people are passing up "Boogie Nights" because they are anti-porn, or just flat out hating the adult industry and can't overlook the aspect of this movie. But beneath it is a great story of characters who lose everything and struggle to regain themselves. There's a beautiful movie ... and it's too bad enough people see it.
