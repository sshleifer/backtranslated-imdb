Cassie (Sandra Bullock) is a hyper-serious police detective. When a former girlfriend tried to kill her and actually left her severely wounded, she is determined to bring those who harm others to justice. As a result of her near death experience, too, Cassie favors one-night stands and trusts no one. One day, a woman is found dead in the forest near Cassie's community. She has been murdered heinously, hit hard and left to die alone. Of course, Cassie stops nothing to find the killers. Awarded to help her is co-officer, Sam (Ben Chaplin). He soon discovers Cassie's relentless attitude and consumed instincts when she asks him to get a sample of vomit that has been left on the spot for analysis, among other actions. The trail soon leads them to two high school students, Richard (Ryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt). Could these teens really be responsible for the planning and execution of the perfect "joy" killing? This is an exciting movie, but viewers should be warned that the subject is cloudy. Killing for the "sport" of it is rarely the subject of film that is of "all sweetness and light" variety and this is no different. That said, the cast is huge. Bullock, without a hint of her comedy talent, is great as a police officer whose own past forces her to unlock the evil people in the world. Chaplin is also pretty nice as a detective, which is both attracted and rejected by the powerful Cassie. As for Gosling, he gives a most memorable performance as a brilliant mind with a satanic soul. The production values ​​for the film are also good, with appropriate fine costumes, settings and photography. If you're a fan of Bullock, you're looking for a laugh, this is not the only thing for you. But if you love mysteries, even those with the shameless plots, you will find this story enchanting.
