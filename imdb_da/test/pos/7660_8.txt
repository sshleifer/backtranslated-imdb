Hercules' son is seriously injured under a lion hunt that goes wrong. Hercules (a solid and engaging performance of the stiff Reg Park) must venture into an eerie and dangerous alternative dimension guided by the evil and avenged Gia the Earth Goddess (a deliciously wicked depiction of Gia Sandri) and fight various monsters to save his son's soul. Meanwhile, Gia's just unpleasant son, Antaius (a completely hassle-free tour of Giovanni Cianfriglia), constitutes Hercules and takes over a whole city as a cruel and ruthless tyrant. Director Maurizo Lucidi tells the exciting story at a steady pace and maintains a serious tone throughout. This movie begins a bit slowly, but really begins to cook when Hercules enters the dire and dangerous underground spirit world. Red highlights include Hercules, which sneaks with a humanoid animal, Hercules climbs a giant tree and Hercules is attacked by a bunch of cruel rats zombies. Even better, the bizarre spirit world just a range of spooky atmosphere (must love the persistently thick swirling fog!). The strenuous rough mano-a-mano great physical confrontation between Hercules and Antaius is also quite stone. Of course we also get a big mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption too. Allvaro Mancori's sharp widescreen film gives the film an impressive expansive sense of scope. Ugo Filippini's rugged, appalling score has a beautiful majestic sweep of it. Okay, so this flick is an obvious cheapo cute'n'paste job that uses ample footage from both "Hercules in the Haunted World" and "Hercules and the Captive Women", but it is still an extremely lively and entertaining romp all .
