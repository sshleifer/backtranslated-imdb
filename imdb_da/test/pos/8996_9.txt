A very positive message to our youth is shown in this movie. Through the sport of rugby as a means, a High School rugby coach leads his players in their behavior and lifestyle, the ON and OFF field. <br /> <br /> The acting and management are good. Rugby shots are just OK if you know something rugby or really cool if you don't know much about it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie, worth seeing, especially at a time when this sport is gaining more and more every day. The plot is based on a true story that takes place in Utah. The coach, portrayed in this movie, has been in the Highlanders riders for over 30 years (and loses only games every three years). <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
