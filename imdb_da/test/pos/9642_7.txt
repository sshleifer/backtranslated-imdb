I recommend the movie viewers if in the New York City area go to the Intrepid museum and get an idea of ​​how closed and cramped living was for the crews of World War II vintage submarines. How much more should it have been for the seamen during World War I. It really must have been hell below. <br /> <br /> Walter Huston and Robert Montgomery head the hell. Captain and Montgomery as his free two wheeling. They are both pretty credible, like Navy officers and the rest of the role of Robert Young, Eugene Palette, Jimmy Durante, Madge Evans, Sterling Holloway, etc. Fill their roles quite nicely. <br /> <br /> The silent service became more popular during World War II and beyond. It's great, but I could mention a whole lot of submarine pictures like Torpedo Run, Operation Pacific, Hellcats of the Navy, Run Silent, Run Deep and many more, and you'll see the same plots in them all. I think there really is a limit to situations too. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Durante's performance is interesting. He's pretty funny, and his scene with the boxing squirrel while you go ashore is a lot of fun. But I have to say that a sign like him in the tight quarters is probably very much needed for morals. If you have no such thing as breaking the excitement aboard a submarine, you must immediately get one transferred to your ship. <br /> <br /> However, the highlight for me is Sterling Holloway's death scene. Much like Sean McClory in Iceland looks like Sky. It will haunt you long after you've seen this movie.
