A word for that. Hysterical fun. I haven't watched movies like this for a long time. At points in the movie, I completely forgot that it was a movie, I just felt that I was back watching Viva La Bam, or even seeing my own friend going through something like this. It was realistic, and I liked how Bam, Ryan, Raab, Rake, and Brandon and the rest of the boys didn't try to act really. They, for me, just seemed like their famous idiot myself. There were a couple of scenes that I loved more than others, like Raab in the shower, holy, I laughed so hard. He was honestly probably my favorite character besides Bams. He really made the movie a little more fun. It is basically a must see for all fans of the CKY crew:]
