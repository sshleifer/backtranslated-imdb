I just want to say I was thrilled to find these comments about the show. I have tried online searches for info on the show in the past without success. I LOVED the show. I find it hard to get motivated to train, but this show made it fun. As another comment mentioned, it was not as complicated as the routines today. It was an ideal workout that got the job done! I would give something to be able to buy a copy of just one workout. I can remember many of the features, but not nearly all of that. Someone is trying to get it back on the air and also make it available on DVD. It's so good to know that I wasn't the only one who loved that show! Thanks for making my day!
