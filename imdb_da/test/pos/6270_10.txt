The Ator series is a shining example of what B movies should be. They fail in every aspect, but in such a fun way that they are fun, rather than sad. "Ator l'invincibile 2" aka "The Blade Master" aka "Cave Dwellers" shows us Europe's favorite Conan clone, Ator, where we left him in the first movie - after showing us a long list of all the events of the first movie. This time, the world must be rescued from "The Nucleus", a kind of bomb represented on the screen as a bright light (I assume they could not afford a prop). This one contains invisible attackers and samurai. As with the first movie, lots of storage recordings have been used (including a pretty obvious bit from "Star Wars"). Thoroughly ridiculous and unforgettable bad - this is an exception B movie.
