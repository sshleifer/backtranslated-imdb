As beds protector for drive-in tears (1970s-1980s), there are many movies that I have seen and forgotten. This is one I could never forget. Despite its low budget, movie production style, STORY was very well done. The isolated therapy asylum, where patients perform their fantasies to help heal their phsycosis, the unintentional murder of the general practitioner, as well as the new nurse arrives on the spot, the (supposed) assistant doctor takes over the various crazy patrons, the revelation that the assistant doctor is actually a patient himself and finally the rescue of the young nurse of the simple Sam who killed everyone else in the house so that she could escape unhappily, made for a great story, holding the film together. I emphasized the word STORY, because that's what makes a good or good movie. No matter how much blood, gore, nudity, sexual material or outrageous behavior you put into a movie, if the story is not good, then the movie is not good. The movie credits show clips of all the actors, including the old hag with the last line that tells you to come out and never come back, which is a great end to this movie. If it is out on video / DVD, watch it and enjoy it.
