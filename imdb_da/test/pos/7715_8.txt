This is one of the animated films from The Animatrix Collection, one of nine - the only one in black and white, and the only one containing Trinity. Richly structured and beautifully reproduced in every way, and the animated version of Trinity does its justice absolutely. If you're a fan of The Matrix, put this on your short list.
