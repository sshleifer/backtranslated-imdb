I experienced Nightbreed for the first time on television a year ago, and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker is said to have revitalized horror with Hellraiser, but it's a movie that effectively stopped his cinema career. What an unfortunate thing to do because this movie as the inhabitants of Midian seems to be misunderstood. <br /> <br /> Barker has created a cross-genre advertising in this story - it begins as a traditional horror movie but soon becomes a fable of human inhumanity to man. Awakening to the devil is tough at best times, but when the characters are as visually demonic as they are in this movie, it becomes almost impossible (cue the child!). The virtually clan-like human rebellion (pitchforks and sacred anger) at the conclusion of the film is twofold disturbing to what has gone before. As a parable of ethnic excitement and white supremacy, this film can be really evocative. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for those who don't see the movie from this angle and think of what Barker's amazing indulgence has gone too far. We have a real forgotten gem here, and the sooner the studio and Mr Barker do it well and spend some time for it - the better.
