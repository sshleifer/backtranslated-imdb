This film entered production before World War II began, but was not released until it was well underway. With the considerable fascist sympathy in the United States, and Chaplin himself suspected as a communist sympathizer, the great dictator was a very brave effort. Such risks of filmmaking - thinly blurred political statements - would be almost unthinkable today. Imagine the fallout if someone were to make a straight satirical movie today that criticized US foreign policy? <br /> <br /> This movie is hilarious, sharp and tragic. The tragedy is that Chaplin makes a plea for the end of madness, but it's already too late - for him and for us. One has to see if you have any interest whatsoever in history, film making, politics or satire as an art form.
