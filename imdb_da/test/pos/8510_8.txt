I'm sick and tired of people complaining that Never Say Never Again is just a weak remake of Thunderball. Yes, the film's influence is unmistakable, but the enormous and almost universal inferiority of restored films is reserved for such thoughtless and unintelligible films as the 1998 Restoration of Psycho. Although it is true that the opening theme of the twelfth (and Connery's last) Bond movie is one of the worst of the whole series, the film itself manages to stand on its own despite many other weaknesses. In addition, even the weak title song is made to flash quite nicely with the final dialogue in the movie. Of course, Sean Connery was a bit of an age when this movie was filmed (at least by James Bond standards), but there is plenty of evidence in the story that makes it clear that this was not exactly unknown to the filmmakers. James Bond is near retirement before being handed over his job, having spent most of the time teaching, not doing so, and even the tongue in the cheek's claim that he attaches more importance to his health, dieting and training and gets more training and what not. Besides, it's James Bond, remember? This guy has to be a kind of super human and all his fans are completely disturbed because he has some gray hair. When this guy retires at the end of the movie, M sends poor "Small-Fawcett" (in a hilarious comedy from Rowan Atkinson) to tell Bond that without him he cares about the safety of the free world and all of you people Can't get over the fact that he's no longer a strong young man. Come on, Sean Connery could still play James Bond as well as he could ever, or at least better than anyone else has ever been able to. <br /> <br /> The majority of the film deals with the comprehensive plan to steal nuclear missiles and hold the hostages of the world (as Dr. Evil would say, "Oh, let's just do what we always do?"), so there is obviously not much new there, but this is one of the Bond movies that had the better a liners. There is the fun scene where Bond is asked for a urine test? `If ​​you could just fill this cup to me? ' "From here?" There are many good one-liners, but the sexual innuendos directed at Mr. Bond is especially prevalent in this installment. But then he later came to throw the very urine sample on a villain's face, so he screamed as if his face was burning off. Not a very good attempt at comic relief, especially since this guy had kicked Bond's ass with a kind of super-spring unit that could cut through virtually anything. And of course, Kim Basinger is stars in this movie as one of the best Bond girls in the entire series. <br /> <br /> It's no secret that Never Say Never Again is dated badly, and one of the things that is dated the worst is the special effects ?? with one exception to the flying missiles that were obviously fake but still impressive for 1982. The colored contact lens at the beginning of the movie was completely ineffective and the laser clock was one of the worst things in the whole movie, second only for the stupid sharks. Obviously Fatima Blush put a kind of unit on his deep tank that attracted sharks (granted, they had their own strange control mechanisms) in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line: "I have a simple request. And that is having sharks with FRICKIN 'laser beams attached to their heads!' And then of course there is the exploding hotel room scene that was turned into an episode of The Simpsons, which was, of course, followed by another mandatory and overly casual one-liner from James. <br /> <br /> The dominance video game created by Largo, the movie's villain, is a particularly memorable scene, and the movie also boasts what is probably the best motorcycle hunt in the whole series (far better than the ridiculous in Tomorrow Never Dies). Weaknesses more evident in the audience's mind at the end of the movie due to much of the anti-climatic underwater conclusion (one of the more obvious parts borrowed from Thunderball and subordinate recreation). Never mind the fact that Largo revealed some important information to Bond when he left him in the tower alive (Dr. Evil's brilliance again: "I just want to leave him there without actually seeing his death and just assuming that everything went to the plan. What?"), Climax One of what is expected to be a quick action film never takes place in a subdued atmosphere. <br /> <br /> All in all, Never Say Again Again stands very high on the James Bond scale and Connery's flashes at the end of the movie (as well as the two closed lines) are suggested at the time he had to return to another trip like Bond. Obviously, this is no longer very likely, so we can only hope.
