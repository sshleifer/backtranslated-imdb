Frank Sinatra did so many good things in the entertainment world that it is hard to single out as the best. If I were to mention the best he ever did, it would be his performance as the Frankie Machine, the hero-independent musician and poker reseller who is rescued, just scarce love for a good woman (played by an unusual babelicious Kim Novak). The "cold-turkey" scenes between Sinatra and Novak are scary and heartbreaking. The film is almost perfect, actually from Saul Bass's title graphics to the groundbreaking jazz score of Elmer Bernstein. It may not be the kind of thing someone thinks about in the 1950s, but it is a must-see anyway.
