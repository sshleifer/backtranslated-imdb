I'm just looking up "who will love my kids" to buy when I came across this site and a post made by a fellow !! I'm a big fan of this movie and would and have recommended it to everyone. What I found comforting is finding someone else who also finds comfort in the good will of others. I also have a son with Asperger's (among other things) and it is also a fear of me to think about whether there ever happened to me and my husband that a person will not just take on me just my beautiful "normal" daughter, but my special and gifted son too. Lack of home and being able to relate to people raised with the same values ​​as myself, have more meaning than you know. Staying here in the US, I have not yet met anyone who has seen this movie. So for all of you who are reading this, if you haven't seen it, make an effort to do so. It is a very moving experience, especially for anyone who is a parent, or even if you just have a sympathetic bone in your body, you will cry and beg. Then you count your blessings, and to anyone who has ever been through an experience like or close to this, my heart goes out to you. It makes me realize, no matter how hard or stressful things get, just remind yourself that there is always someone who is worse than you. An amazing movie and what makes it more powerful is that it is based on a true story. Don't be discouraged by how sad it is, while this movie is heart warming and makes you feel encouraged by the strength and goodness of humanity.
