So this flick on Saturday afternoon cable. The man, hit it. I have the metaphors, the symbolism and all those things. No, I didn't care about the sexuality of the signs. But pacing the story and scripting almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> That's ..... until Ruth Marshall was naked. If you are a breastpiece that is not homophobic, you may be able to rent it. Ruth has a lesbian sex scene that is pretty hot, and then a heterosexual scene that is higher than most standard movie fare. Her jiggly D-cups made the movie worth the watch. <br /> <br /> - The Mighty Avatar
