I watched this movie at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, Everything Illuminated is the direct debut of actor Liev Schreiber. Schreiber also wrote the manuscript. In the film, Jonathan (Elijah Wood) collectively collects items from his family, from toothbrushes to paper cutter holders, which he then seals in ziploc bags and taps into a wall in his house to record his family history. But the space for his grandfather is eye-catching bar. Everything Jonathan has of him is a piece of jewelry and an old picture of him with a woman who hid him from the Nazis during World War II. Jonathan decides to do a job for Ukraine to find the woman, thank her, and learn more about her grandfather. <br /> <br /> His quest is helped with a few characters driving a tourist company for Jewish people, including a young man obsessed with Western culture (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather (Boris Leskin), who believes that he is blind and who may have his own memories and own demons from the war, and his grandfather's temperamental eye dogs. <br /> The play combines effectively both humor and drama, as the three characters travel through the country looking for Jonatson's grandfather, who deeper and deeper into past memories. The best performance is likely to come from Eugene Hutz, who plays Alex Jr., who starts the film as a training suit, just knocks out dancing to have fun, but develops into something more than not just Jonathan, but all the characters get their own lighting . <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber, Elijah Wood and Eugene Hutz participated in the screening and made a very humorous Q&A after the movie: <br /> <br /> - Schreiber was very close to his grandfather, who was a Ukrainian immigrant, who died in 1993. This made him start writing to get his memories on paper. In the meantime, he was asked to make a reading of Foer's short story, The Very Rigid Search, which was an excerpt from the still unpublished novel. Schreiber was blown away by the quality of the writing and said that Foer had done in 15 pages what Schreiber was trying to do in 107. Schreiber approached Foer and they talked about their grandfathers, culture, film and the nature of short-lived memory in America; In the end, Foer accepted to let Schreiber adapt the book. <br /> <br /> - Schreiber's own project was intended to be a road movie, but the book has a parallel story that is a pictured chronological story of the city of Trochenbrod spanning 500 years given his budget and limitations as a film maker he said he would leave it to Milos Foreman and take the breath instead. This imagined chronology was what moved him to make the film in the first place, the idea that "a past that was lovingly imagined was as valuable as a past that was precisely recalled". - Schreiber said the film was a series of happy accidents. After searching successfully in Ukraine for an actor, he went through the Lower East Side of New York when he saw a poster of a woman centaur, topless from the waist up, with an insane coffin that is disturbing her. Under the poster said the name Gogol Bordello Ukranian Punk Gypsy Band. <br /> <br /> Eugene Hutz took over the story. He had never pursued acting as music was his first passion. One day a friend gave him the book, and he thought it was written in a way similar to how he writes music; screw set / syntax, language is my own. Later, they received a call from a production company looking for Eastern European music that was medieval but modern. Hutz met with Schreiber, and he soon found that the film was based on the book he just happened to read. Not long after that, Schreiber asked Hutz what he thought of Alex and whether he could make the character without risk. <br /> <br /> - Foer and Schreiber talked about the movie in the fall of 2001, shortly after the events of September 11th. Both were in Europe at that time, and they talked about the derogatory remarks they heard about Americans, which led Schreiber to try to find an articulated American who would defy the stereotype of Europeans by Americans. Someone who was awkward, vulnerable, flawless, innocent and looking for history beyond the country's own borders. Schreiber began to think about who it was and Elijah came up. <br /> <br /> One of Schreiber's inspirations as the filmmaker is Emir Kusturica (I think it is who he said who also led a segment in another festival movie, All the invisible kids) who said "you're not looking for the actors, you are looking for the people. " Schreiber said there is something about who Elijah is, that he has a generous spirit and a sincere kindness as a man who came across movies. Schreiber said that the eyes are important when trying to articulate an observer character and that if "eyes are the doors of the soul, are Elijah's garage doors." <br /> <br /> - Elijah Wood had fun with a question about the similarities between his character Kevin in Sin City and Jonathan in this movie, as both are kind of an empty slate where emotions are projected. Wood replied that Jonathan may seem silent and seemingly numb, but it's about his observations, his experiences with other characters and the environment he was in. <br /> <br /> - About the differences between governance and writing: Schreiber said that he likes to write much more and jokingly described as "hell". After his grandfather died, Schreiber began to think about how to preserve some sense of history and himself; is he content driven or not, or just good at interpreting others' work? He said he loved the pursuit of finding out what is emotional for you, important to you.
