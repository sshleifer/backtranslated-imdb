This American masterpiece came as close to perfection as popular art constructor to be from its beautifully undeniable and suggestive title to the magnificent achievement that William Wyler elicited from the nonprofessional amputee Harold Russell ?? <br /> <br /> The movie epitomizes both the dream and the reality of the world war? This intimate engagement with the psychological facts of American life gave it an almost universal audience ?? But, unlike contemporary and previous "message" pictures, was it not a preaching? It showed Americans as they were, presented their problems as they themselves see them, and gave only such solutions, partly, temporarily, personally, as they would accept themselves. The values ​​of the image are the values ​​of the people in it? <br /> <br /> William Wyler, an excellent instructor, triple winner of Best Picture Oscar, adds an air of distinction to the melodrama, epic and western ... With its distinctive visual style and taste for solemn material, he a reputation as a careful and serious artist ... Wyler's most proficient use of deep focus reveals the real commitment to emotional content ... <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of three men coming home from war to one small middle american community and find it difficult to pick up where they left off. The three heroes are: a middle-aged sergeant (Fredric March), magnificent as the devoted family man who succeeds in breaking the ice with his family; a sharp air force captain (Dana Andrews) returns to an unfaithful wife; and a troubled sailor (Harold Russell) who has lost both hands in use, replaced by real-life hooks ... Winner of the 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, "The Best Years of Our Life" is eloquent and compassionate, one deeply personal motion picture with touching wordless homecoming scenes: <br /> <br /> - The affectionate wife's first word when he comes home unexpectedly: "I look awful! It's not fair to break into us like this. "<br /> <br /> - The sailing mother is involuntarily sucking when she first sees her son's mechanical hands ... She exclaims:" It's nothing! "<br /> <br /> Martini's voice combines Myrna Loy's charming female qualities with motherhood; Teresa Wright is lovely as the sergeant's lovely daughter, who falls in love with the pilot; Virginia Mayo is tough as the disloyal flashy blonde wife whose first love is money and high life; and Cathy O'Donnell is wonderful and sensitive as the sailor's fiance ... Situations and even some of the signs seem a little obvious, but this is an excellent example of high quality film production in the eighties, with smiles and tears crumbling away and a movie that says what is needed on a vital subject ...
