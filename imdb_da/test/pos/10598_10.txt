"Haggard: The Movie" is well-written, well-registered and well-acted. There are many laughing moments and some amazing skateboard scenes with Margera. The scenes in West Chester, PA are filmed beautifully and the script is just fun. What I like about the movie is that instead of being another sappy love story or another version of "Jackass", it takes a dark fun look at break-ups from a different perspective. Most break-up movies have a naive woman who is trembled by a cheating man. She then goes on to find Mr. Right and get to tell his cheating items to get lost. This movie takes a look at the emotional roller coaster of a jilted man ... without taking himself too seriously. Ryan Dunn does an excellent job as the rugged man and with Bam Margera and Brandon Dicamillo as your best friends trying to help you through this hard time, how can you take it all too seriously? It is obvious that Margera and Co. is incredibly talented both behind and in front of the camera. I look forward to their future films and efforts.
