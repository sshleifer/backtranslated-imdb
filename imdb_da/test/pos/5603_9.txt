While the camera was definitely "funky" - perhaps a Dutch-roll map of "rocky" - the premise of the movie was amazing. It really took a frightening satirical (in the true tradition of Hal Hartley) to look at God, Jesus and the Devil. The interplay between Jesus and Satan gives some fun scenes ... Even Jesus' monologues were great - this was by far the best Jesus I have ever seen. So laid-back, Zen-like, Son-of-God-ish, but still such a good guy. At one level, this is a very general look at the paradoxes of Christianity, yet there is still a personal level where you can relate to Jesus Christ without having a God-Complex (thanx to Martin Donovan and Hal Hartley).
