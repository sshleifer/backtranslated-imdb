"In the mood of love" a just claim of loneliness and longing. Here is a movie without sex or even kissing - and this is undoubtedly one of the most gender and definetly the most thought-provoking and psychological romance I've ever seen. Tells the story of two people who randomly live in the same apartment and are a door away from each other. The film, which, unlike "Random Hearts," is about how two people come together through the affair of their two lovers. Only when they receive this news do they take time to think about the consequences of an affair and each other's feelings of having just broken up - and whether the two people are willing enough to fall back in love or not. /> <br /> What is great about the movie is the way director Wong Kar-Wai presents each character's way of handling loneliness. With Maggie Cheung's character, he shows her in a repeated montage: leaving work, going home and watching her neighbors gamble, head to the noodle shop, leaving the noodle shop and encountering her attractive age-old, played by Tony Leung. This is a smart, if not subtle, scientific technique for presenting loneliness. Because it is when you are alone when you find yourself in a loop. This movie worked for me because I can identify with that feeling.
