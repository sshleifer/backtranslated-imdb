Fred was such a great show.It was simple but somehow very dependent. I still remember the days when I wanted to see this on Kids WB Saturdays, but then the Kids WB made it unforgivable. Kids WB became the older relative trying to act "hip" and "funky fresh". * shudder * They became like the relative trying to trade everything cool, but the experiment is a cheesy disaster. my life (Johnny Test). The only thing that keeps me watching KWB anymore is occasional bits of the old shows and anime on 4kids. It was such a big mistake to pull this show off schedule.This brings me back to my first point ... BRING IT BACK !!!
