When "The Net" was first announced, the ads made it ridiculous. So when I saw it, it was actually pretty good. Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) spends her days on the computer and never got to know her neighbors. Then she is identified by a series of events deleted by a shadow of shady people and she cannot prove that she exists. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the movie are slightly removed; You would probably know which parts if you saw the movie. Nevertheless, it is a good look at what the existence of the internet may have done on unsuspecting people. I recommend it.
