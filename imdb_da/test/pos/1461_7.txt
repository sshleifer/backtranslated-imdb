This is a very strange series with Dean Learner. I really didn't understand the guests. I knew they weren't serious, but if they really were, it was unclear because ... I think I'm just the stupid. I do not know if these classes are spoiler, but the guests are not genuine as in Ali g or something they are played by a man or I think. I love the serious look he's got. Its like the program that was on a Sunday morning that I forgot the name of lol. I also like the costume and mustache he is having. It's pretty hot. He is insensitive, which is one of the funniest qualities. I also like the way he has subsection of the program. It seems to make it more authentic.
