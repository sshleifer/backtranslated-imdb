Uncle Frank's everything uncle. This documentary covered all aspects of aging in America, loneliness, humor, the irony. Uncle Frank and Aunt Tillie were extremely generous in sharing their life experiences with the audience. The director did an unbelievable job of catching the small and large pieces that made up their lives. Thanks to everyone who helped make this movie!
