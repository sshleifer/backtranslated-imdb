It has been said that Batman begins in the first Batman movie to "get it right", but I think it's a horrible overstatement, because I think the new Batman movie, though the larger Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, pales in comparison to Tim Burton's classics, with this being the best of the five. The darkness is beautiful, as does music and scenery creating a mysterious gothic city, unlike Batman Begins, where Gotham City is a common city. The bad guys are amazing in this movie. You can literally not take the eyes of penguin and cat woman. I welcome Tim Burton to be original with his use of the penguin as a freak, rather than a regular criminal or a clone of the old Batman TV show. In Batman Beginner, we have scarecrows, if not almost demanding on the screen as a penguin or cat woman. The movie doesn't just need to focus on Batman because we already know his story, and it's the villains we explore and try to find out, and they're the ones who make the plot, with the penguin running to mayor and seeking revenge for his parents forfeiture by killing Gotham's first-born sons, a task he fails. Danny Devito gives the finest performance ever of a superhero villain in any movie that exceeds even Nicholson's joker. The final scene, where the penguins draw the body of the purse in the water, touches and strengthens. It is a tragedy that Tim Burton was not allowed to complete his trilogy when Warner Bros., who was interesting in the marketing complaint, wanted to "illuminate" the Batman films. And they got their wish ... unfortunately. Tim Burton planned to control the third movie using Riddler as the villain, without Two-Face and Robin destroying it, and I'm sure Michael Keaton would have signed. So this is the last big Batman movie. Batman Begins is dark but boring, boring, plain, full of missing villains and a playboy Bruce Wayne. A decent Batman movie, but the best Batman movie ever? Never. Batman Returns keeps that crown.
