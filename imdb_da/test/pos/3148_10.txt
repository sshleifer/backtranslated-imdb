I saw "The Reader" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells an exciting two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a fantastic job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this movie is that the director has chosen a story that suits the card format. These are really interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect time. This is not a small feat. Have we not all seen shorts that are just longer stories that are pressured to fit the format or scenarios that are not properly matched to the screen? I welcome "The Reader" to really do it right, and I encourage anyone interested in movies and narrative to see it seriously. Worth every moment!
