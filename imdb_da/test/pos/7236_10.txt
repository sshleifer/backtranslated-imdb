Tromeo and Juliet (1996) are another jewel in Troma Studios' film archives. Like The Toxic Avenger, Troma's War, Class of Nuke 'em High, Terror Firms and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. This movie is an instant Troma classic. James Gunn updates Romeo and Juliet by taking a medieval tragedy and finding it as a modern street punk drama. If you have seen or read the game before nothing, it is very much changed unless it has been "thrashed". <br /> <br /> Lloyd Kaufman adds his own twisted vision to the manuscript and makes it a very fun movie. The actors handle the script very well. I was amazed at how well they conducted the dialogue, much better than some great big budget beginners in Hollywood who use a huge budget and expensive set. I really enjoyed this movie. Lloyd Kaufman does not disappoint because you know what to expect from his films and other Troma productions. I'd rather watch one of his movies and be entertained than watching a boring animal movie spoiled by paid actors, lame scripts, lazy instructors and the awful C.G.I. special effects. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. If you like funny movies with cheesy special effects, over the top acting and inspired rule, then this movie is just for you!
