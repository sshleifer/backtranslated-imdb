I caught this movie at an OutFest screening in Los Angeles in July 2006. It's rough around the edges (especially audio recording is wobbly) and often very fun. The script is quite huge episodic and ends steeply, but Ash Christian infuses the movie with lots of real heart. It's also a refreshing change of pace to have a gay movie that doesn't star underwear models obsessed with partying and chasing straight guys. Props to a warmly sympathetic Jonathan Caouette as Mr. Cox, a relative of Rodney (Ash Christian), the lively and sprouted Ashley Finke as Rodney's best friend, and Deborah Theaker as Rodney's mother, who gets the best lines of script and steals her every scene. The movie is like its author / instructor / star ?? lumpy and a bit odd, but also very sweet.
