It takes a while to adjust the sound of the pioneers' sons, but then you thoroughly enjoy it. If the soundtrack were to be played by an orchestra such as Max Steiner or Dmitri Tiomkin, it would lose its folly. The music leads the movie, everything seems to follow its rhythm. The whole cast is excellent. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. are the young men who control the caravan. Ward Bond is the Mormon leader and Joanne Dru is a flirtatious actress. Ford was able to make what would be a plain western, something completely different and original, showing us the music, the dancers and most of all the people.
