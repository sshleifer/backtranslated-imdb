<br /> <br /> Being a teenager, I have about a hundred years of film making. I try to see a mix of classics, mainstream, art houses and other movies. The 70s are one of the most important decades of film: that is, when the average, ordinary, classical films changed in full of messages and antisocial behavior. It was like nothing anyone had ever seen before. What a decade under influence basically shows how important all the films are from The Graduate to Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Richard LaGravenese and the late Ted Demme are the primary interviewers in this documentary, interviewing people like Dennis Hopper, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman and Jon Voight, including how they are changed cinema forever. It is a very professional, polished documentary and even funded by IFC movies. But since this is a very professional, I think they would at least change the sound of someone behind the camera laughing. For me, it took a lot of time for how clean and clean it was. <br /> On the other hand, it is a very interesting documentary about films by the people who do it. Of course, they do not base their own films or anything like that, but they reflect honesty on what they thought about the movies and what they meant. I don't know much about movies (but I will be involved in it when I grow up) so I want to like someone like me. This movie is a great asset. I've seen a large number of movies as they mentioned, such as Chinatown and One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest, but a little more insight into these movies was very informative. <br /> <br /> The main reason I didn't do it I love the influence is as smooth as it was edited, it seemed to take its time in the beginning and be quite relaxed and therefore didn't have enough time to get it all what they wanted to show. They stuffed Star Wars and Jaws in the last couple of minutes as they were two of the most important. It seemed that they were trying too hard to show lots of clips, and that's fine, but some of them were unimportant, such as an extension from the Network. Overall, however, influence is a very exciting, informative documentary that helped me at least learn more about another "golden age" in American cinema. My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Classified R for languages ​​and images of sexuality, violence and drug use.
