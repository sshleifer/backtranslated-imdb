I was very excited to see a documentary on one of my favorite Italian directors. D'Amato has dabbled in everything from Horror, Post-Apocalyptic to Hardcore Porn. He has touched genius a few times with films such as Buio Omega and Emmanuelle & The Last Cannibals. This documentary is a lengthy and informative guide to D'Amato's film. He is interviewed throughout with English subtitles rolling over the bottom of the screen. The excerpts from his film are told by a narrator (with English subtitles). The documentary appeared to be interesting as it analyzed the often censored "Emmanuelle In America". Here, D'Amato explains the fake "snus" scenes in detail and reminds of some funny stories. Actually good ol Joe is very warm and fun throughout, always wearing a smile and smoking a cigarette. The one disapointing aspect of this documentary is that it spends some time on the D'Amatos Horror movies like Anthropophagus and the brilliant Buio Omega. It spends too much time on the erotic cinema and hardly touches the post-apocalyptic movies. But I can't complain. It's great to see D'Amato get the respect he deserves. Highly recommended for fans of D'amato. May he rest in peace.
