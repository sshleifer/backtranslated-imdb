My dad has worked with top secret information in DIA before, and he is the one who mentioned this movie to me. When I was a kid, I would always ask him what would happen if he gave away secrets and he recommended this movie. <br /> <br /> In the film it really puts 2, almost totally different friends! in a tangle they never really knew what the outcome would really be. The snowman, Daulton really hit me up because the film portrayed him as just some drug puppies who didn't know what he was arguing for, and in the movie it seemed like he was getting the worst of everything. The Falcon, Chris is just a guy who wanted to express his feelings on us government in a very radical picture. For movie lovers this is a must see !!!
