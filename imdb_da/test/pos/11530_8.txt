It's 1969. Phoebe (Camilla Belle) is an 11 year old girl who grows up with an idealized vision of her 19-year-old sister Faith (Cameron Diaz). Faith is the judge, the truth seeker, the fixer of all the injustices of the world. Then Phoebe and her mother Gail (Blythe Danner) receive the words that faith is dead. Faith has killed itself. Both Phoebe and Gail are overwhelmed by this news and, though mourned, Gail. Phoebe can't let it go. Phoebe decides to go to Europe and find out what happened. It is now 1977. Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) is 18 years old and decides to go to Europe over the mother's objections to discover the truth. When they were alive, Faith was inseparable from a man she called "Wolf" (Christopher Eccleston). Although Wolf did not know anything about the last days of faith, Phoebe convinced him to tell her everything. Within a few days, Wolf realizes that he has not erased the past, and he joins Phoebe on his pilgrimage to Portugal. Ultimately, Wolf can tell about the decent of faith in substance abuse and his own guilt by not preventing suicide. Although angry, Phoebe ultimately realizes how human and fragile faith really was. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. I am old enough to remember the Red Army robberies and I was 10 in 1969. This story was known to me. I still remember young men trying to decide whether to go to Canada or not to avoid the draft. <br /> <br /> The story is simple but has probably taken place several times in real life during that period. Camilla Belle was fun and fun to see as she portrayed the young adoring sister excitedly by what happened around her. Jordana Brewster slid easily into the role of older Phoebe. Blythe Danner was the always supportive mother, a role she is all too familiar with on American television, unfortunately. I would have liked to see her with stronger material to work with. Cameron Diaz played the immature anarchist perfectly. Although she sometimes seemed like an activist from the 1960s, he came out of a news roll. Of all the letters, it was Christopher Eccleston's Wolf that made the greatest growth. When we are introduced to the character at the beginning of the film, we can see that he is a secular man. He is a patient and kind man full of anger at the world's injustices. Eventually, he understands the direction he and the faith leader is wrong, and begins to "grow up" and decide that he should fight against injustice in his own way. Faith refuses to join him in this and it eventually leads to her death. Eccleston's Wolf is the most real of all the characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. It was comfortable and thoughtful. "The Invisible Circus" is rated for MA MA but there is very little curse, sex or violence in it. The subject of the film is the reason for the assessment.
