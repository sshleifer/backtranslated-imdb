I didn't realize how much of this episode was taken from The Enemy Below until I finally saw the movie (it has since become my fave war flick). There were also a few items lifted from Run Silent Run Deep as well. Nothing wrong with stealing ideas as long as you do something cold with them. And the boy did Roddenberry and the company something cool with this. The story begins when Romulan violates a 100-year treaty and by crossing the neutral zone and destroying a number of federation posts along the zone, apparently testing their superior weapons and invisibility screen (and subsequent shift in the balance of power between Romulan and the Federation, in their view) as a prelude to an all-out invasion. Kirk must decide if it is worth risking war to try to stop the Romulan ship, or if there is actually a greater risk of letting the invaders go after destroying 4 military outposts. Kirk wisely chooses the latter. <br /> <br /> This is our first look at an enemy of the Federation, the Romulans, a warlike yet honest race that is distant family members of the Volcanoes. But, unlike their peaceful cousins, the Romulans did not resign their feelings and violent and imperialist ways, even though they advanced technologically. None of this matters to Mr Stiles, the ship's navigator and this episode's chief antagonist on board the company (the Romulan commander has his own problems with a gung-ho junior officer). All that matters to him is that he hates Romulans, and Spock looks like a ... until the end when Spock saves his life (of course). This contradicts himself with Captain Kirk and the Romulan Commander, none of whom have any personal bad will toward the other. Both men simply do their duty. In fact, there is mutual respect. This is the first Trek episode to deal with direct prejudice, and it does it right (unlike season 3's not-so-subtle "Let it be your last battlefield"). Like The Enemy Below, we have a classic chess match between two masters who are actually very similar. You immediately see that both of these captains are good. ALL GOOD. If you went into battle, you would have one of those men as your leader. Both are honorable and decent men who are obliged. But even though the Romulan commander is bound by duty to his home business, he still finds himself wanting to be destroyed before he can make it home rather than start another interstellar war. Yet he still does everything he can to make it at home, just as Kirk does everything he can to stop him. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of Treks 5 bests. It has everything: Lots of action, excitement, great dialogue, fine acting (I still maintain Romulan Commander was Mark Lenard's best Trek role), and it made it his social comment without being too preaching. A shame Roddenberry forgot the last part when he did TNG. <br /> <br /> See this episode and then watch The Enemy Below.
