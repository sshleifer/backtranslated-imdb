I think more of American baseball movies are among the best movies ever made. When this film was in production and heard it described as a rugby movie. I wanted to read about the Highland team in the newspapers but did not have high expectations for this movie about a sport that didn't interest me. Last night I watched it "on demand" and loved it almost as much as my favorite baseball movies. Ryan Little and the cast and crew did a fantastic job. Neil McDonough was particularly convincing. As the "bad father" he showed fine selection and a subtle but moving character bow. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the Pacific Islander actors. I have been fortunate to know many of these fine people and this movie captures their wonderful spirit and culture. A feedback showing how the Islander culture became an important element of the Highlands team would have been an excellent addition to the movie. <br /> <br /> Some beautifully sticky films have been shot in Utah recently. It is good to see a quality movie like this from Beehive State.
