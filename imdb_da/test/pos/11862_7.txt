One night at McCools is one of the movies that starts with a terrible promise, but when the movie continues it gets silly and loses it's really great time. Liv Tyler plays a manipulative woman who tries to get her own way by flipping her body to every man she meets, all falling under her spelling. There are a few fun moments in this, but they are getting fewer and fewer as the movie gets worse in a comedy farce. Michael Douglas, who plays the killer is good, as is Liv Tyler, though she looks as though she had put some weight since armaggedon. This is ok, but is only memorable for the scene where Liv Tyler washes her car, you want to know what I mean when you see the trap is! Shwing !!!!! 7 out of 10 (straight).
