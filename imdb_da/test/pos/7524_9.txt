This short, formative cartoon with Pepe Le Pew relates to a cat who thinks he will solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk. The problem is, he is attracting the most unwelcome attention of an honest and truly skunk (our heroes, Pepe, going back into the scene) are becoming more attentive, we must say than M. Cat would have. Every major plan has its drawbacks, but this one is a cork! I wonder if Jack Warner got a call from Hays Office over that Pepe and the object of his worship were both men. After all, Betty Boop was partly responsible for the production code in existence. Subsequent "conquests" were clearly and most definitely female. Very good cartoon, but Pepe is a character that works better as a focal point, rather than supporting. Worth to see. Recommended.
