I first saw this movie as a teenager (I'm now in my 40s) and have long considered it to be my favorite movie. The story is immensely moving without being sentimental. The action, especially in March and Loy, is dead. And the fact that Dana Andrews is too old for her role does not disregard the credibility of his romance with Theresa Wright (which I think is the only great character in the film still living). This could have turned out to be another post-war melodrama, but the manuscript and cast are simply too good for it to happen.
