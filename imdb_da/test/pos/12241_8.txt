Or maybe not. Whatever anyone thinks of "Broadcast News", good or bad, almost all of the credit belongs to the "thinking" author-producer director James L. Brooks. As a scriptwriter (which he has long been one of the best) it is not easy to saw a whole business - in this case, "business" TV news - but to do it with a smile, a wink, a knowing nod and a laugh almost every step of the way. To do everything that takes real talent, something has Mr. J. Brooks in abundance. <br /> <br /> A user on this site, in his summary, asked the musical question - "Did Walter Cronkite act like that?" Answerve: No! Of course not! And the reason it is in Walters - uh, Mr. Cronkite's - day, the only thing that mattered was bringing the news to the people. The same goes for John Chancellor and Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith. Sure, they had to pay the bar service attention to their ratings if they would only please their bosses. But all they really cared about was THE NEWS SELF. <br /> <br /> Now, of course, everything has changed. For the past 25-30 years in the network news business, the only thing that really matters is the reviews, reviews, reviews. Bottom line. How much money will our news department deliver to the network? Don't think so? Let's consider "The Big Three": Tom Brokaw, Dan and Peter Jennings (also known as Stanley Stunning). All three have now been at work on their respective anchor benches for the last 15-20 years (Peter actually got his first shot at the national anchor table seat back in the 1960s, but was completely unprepared at work). Of the three, Dan is the one with the greatest training on the spot as a reporter. Personally, I think that all three make amazing jobs as news anchors and deserve their positions. Everyone has nothing to do with why all three are actually in these jobs. All three are now in their 60s (Dan pushes the big 7-0) and all three are still very nice. And if you think they still look good, imagine how good they were in their 40s when all three were hired (let's say "insert") their current job. But do you honestly believe that one of these three would have been "deployed" if he looked, let's say, Fred Gwynne ("Herman Munster"). Or similar - the sky is forgiven - ME !!! Not only that, if Dan were to step in tomorrow, was a younger (than he is today) Walter Cronkite unable to get his old job back. Why? Not pretty enough. And that doesn't matter what he is, or even was "the most trusted man in America." <br /> <br /> It's about Broadcast News. Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), the next beautiful boy-national-news-anchor-to-be who has problems with a few minor things, such as thinking for himself, being able to write and know things. Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the brilliant news producer with news standards and ethics, all of whom are thrown to the wind even when she falls for beautiful boy-Tom. And Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks, no relation to James L.), a top-notch newswriter and field reporter who has no hope of a national job because he "flop-sweats" behind the anchor table. And many other so modest characters that you know really exist in the various network news sections. <br /> <br /> "Network" blew the track. Eleven years later, the "Broadcast News" brought the torch as a worthy successor. In the new millennium, what will be the next movie to save the business of networking "news you can use" ..... maybe. Or maybe not.
