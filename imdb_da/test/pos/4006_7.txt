I can't hate the show. When the old (and better) tech TV hit the bricks, the channel was reformatted and new shows entered. "Attack of the Show" is the replacement for Screen Savers, with 3 co-hosts in the beginning. They were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran also came to be a co-host, but he mostly made pieces for the show. Kevin Rose decided to leave the show and in the end there was a competition to see who would be the third host, but for some reason it didn't go out. <br /> <br /> Finally (I just learned this from this very IMDb messaging board) Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran moved on because (hi, that's what I read) the two got married. It was a great secret to me! Now there is a new female co-host, the not-so-hot (my opinion) Olivia Munn. She hides something in the tops she wears while Sarah Lane had a perfect body and she was not afraid to show it. <br /> <br /> AHEM! Sorry. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Show" deals with everything youth wants to know about. These are music, movies, comics, the Internet and TV. This is what is good about the show. If you don't want to scour the net or waste time watching MTV, you can get everything you want at AOTS. Some segments and bits they make are fun. They have regular guests and contributors in the industry, as well as guests ranging from insignificant internet stars to real big names. Although the hosts are not as naked as I would like them to be, I have still found the "Attack of the Show" to be entertaining, even with its latest lineup.
