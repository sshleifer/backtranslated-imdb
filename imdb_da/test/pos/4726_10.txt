This is one of the most underestimated films from the 1990s. If you allow yourself to identify with the Patricia Arquette character, you will find it a very moving story of a woman who regains a sense of purpose for her life and finds a new will to live. <br /> <br /> Arquette's performance is brave because it is targeted "wood" - it is a way of defining her character's spiritual death, her complete lack of desire to be alive. She moves through life as a zombie because her family has been murdered and she cannot see the lifestyle. What moves is how, during the story, she is revived - by the Burmese landscape, by the beautiful quality of her people and landscapes, and by the primary choices she is forced to confront. <br /> <br /> Boorman visually supports this (and Hans Zimmer supports it with one of its most beautiful, scary results) with an often static camera and tends to shoot through glass, windows, windshields, etc. We are from the outside like Arquette .... until she finds herself deep in the jungle and is forced to choose whether to fight for her life. <br /> <br /> I also recommend the 1954 film THE PURPLE PLAIN. It is a similar story in a similar setting, and provides a fascinating comparison.
