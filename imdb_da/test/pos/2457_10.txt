This movie is powerful. I watched this movie at 3:00 and I was supposed to be at work at 6:00, it was unnecessary to say I was late at work. I couldn't get up from my bed to go to work. This is the most powerful movie I've seen for a long time. And it made me cry and feel the pain in the family. I think Emilo did a wonderful job of leading this movie. I agree with the previous comments from other views that this is the only movie I have seen that has brought the war home and shown what a family had to go through what a veteran went through. Thinking about it is almost heartbreaking, as people just thought you could come home from a life-changing experience and be the same person you were before you left. Kathy Bates reminded me of my mother in a way. I think she really showed how women felt and acted back then. I'm surprised this movie wasn't up to several awards.
