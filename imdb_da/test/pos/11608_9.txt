Chokher Bali was shown at the (Washington) DC Film Festival on April 15, 2005. The director, Rituparno Ghosh, was there to give a brief introduction and answer questions afterwards. <br /> <br /> As always, I think Aishwarya did a great job. I can understand those who think she should have been more aggressive or more bitchy, but would it really be realistic in 1904? Possibly, maybe; Really, I'm not so sure. I think her interpretation was valid even though there might be other ways to do it. <br /> <br /> I hate to use the word, but it was the most "inaccessible" of the Indian movies I've seen so far. I know a lot of Indian history, Hindu religion, etc. But the level of detail here was far beyond me. It was clear that you would have a much better understanding of the movie if you were familiar with Hinduism and its customs, esp. as they were c. 1904. I missed a lot of things - one of them was the fact that mother-in-law wanted Binodini in the house as a kind of counterweight to her daughter-in-law Ashalata. <br /> * spoilers * Ghosh had several things to say that explained the movie much better to me. First, the original Bengali version was 20+ minutes longer. So what was left out? Apparently three main things: an initial segment where Binodini (Aishwarya) leaves E. Bengal to Calcutta. According to the director, various characters are spoken by W. Bengali vs. E. Bengali - drawing up some of the political comments later. Of course, all of this is lost in the Hindi version, and destined for a non-Indian like me, it would have no meaning at all - but a setup of the Bengali situation would surely have. Next, there was a segment where Binodini wrote a poem - a sign of her independence, etc. Finally, a lot more about jewelry. So even though some think it was too long, I think the original longer version would have been clearer. The woman's hair was apparently another sign (Ghosh again) - mother-in-law had short hair (short hair for Hindu widows), her sister - also widow - had longer hair (more modern!), And of course Binodini / Aishwarya had extremely long waist length hair (rejection of the one-sided status). The end really threw me - suddenly Binodini, who had never had a political thought, writes a political manifesto? Whoa! Ghosh explained that he was in Locarno at a film festival when the subtitles were performed. The subtitles use the word "land" throughout Binodini's letter. Gosh said a more appropriate word would have been (I forget his exact word) something like "self" or "independence" - she talked about her own liberation and "find herself" - not about Bengal, India and British. So why does Binodini disappear just the day after finding Behari again? Apparently because during her stay at Ganges she realizes that she does not need a man - someone - to define / complete her. She can just be herself. So she rejects Behari who she was throwing in a few months (?) Before, and just goes away. Of course, I'm not sure how she buys her next meal, but that's another question. The red shawl (Ghosh again) she buys represents "revolution" and "passion". I'm not 100% sure why she puts the shawl on the dying woman, but maybe she rejects passion / revolution? Binoculars Binodini uses throughout the film (to see Mahendra and Ashalata, the boat on Ganges, etc.). She is a voyeur to see a life she longs for but cannot have. At the end (I missed this!) She leaves the binoculars on the table with the letter and shows that she no longer needs them - she goes out to lead her own life. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Tagore quotation at the beginning said how he apologized for the end ... Apparently, Tagore wrote this as a serial and hooked his readers with the sexy chords. But at the end, he sold conservatism and made Binodini kneel at the feet of Mahendra and Behari and beg for forgiveness. One of his students (?) Wrote to Tagore, who took him for his sold out ending ... and Tagore replied with his apology for the end. Of course, Ghosh goes in the other direction.
