Ok I'm a huge Traci fan, so her just being in the movie makes it automatically ranked on the 8.5+ rating. But even besides her being in it, I thought it was a good movie, especially because it was an HBO movie. But I'm afraid if you take Traci out of the movie, it would just be ok. But a person can't do that she's in it, and she's a wonderful actress. She just gets better and better.
