Anyone who is familiar with horror movies knows that most of them are not scary at all. Some people enjoy gorefests with subpar story lines and character development. I enjoy personal horror movies that focus on atmosphere and interesting concepts (eg A Tale of Two Sisters, Cairo, etc.). No matter what kind of horror movie a person likes, there is only a selection of few that really scares you. Noroi is one of them. <br /> <br /> This is a documentary, which means the entire movie is a collection of video clips associated with the legend of a demonic entity called Kagutaba. The premise is that a journalist filmed his own footage by interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with Kagutaba, and then preparing footage from other sources related to his research. What results are a relentless chilling experience that feels very real and very disturbing, even though the story itself is false. Some have compared Noroi to The Blair Witch Project, but the only similarity is the documentary style. A clear difference between the films is that Noroi scares the viewer by connecting events with each other using different sources. For example, the journalist records the outside of a house that he researches and sees something strange on the porch. Later in the movie, a clip from another cartoon's home video introduces the same weird occurrence. Viewers' memory connects the two events and chills begin to flow into the spine. Another example involves a TV show with a child psychologically answering each question correctly, except one. In fact, her answer is so wrong that the viewer might wonder what the filmmakers were thinking. Later, however, it turns out that the wrong answer is associated with an extremely worrying event. It is actually an intelligent film production. Another difference between Noroi and Blair Witch is that Noroi does not give one, but two very long finals, the other being one minute after the credits start rolling and is the largest single scare scene in the horror movie story. I'm not saying such things easily. It completely ruined me in a wonderful way. <br /> <br /> Other aspects of film making are well done. The legend and ritual background for Kagutaba is very interesting, and most of the actors have done a good job. The only over-the-top performance comes from a guy who was going to be crazy anyway, so it's expected. The cinematography is intentionally gritty because all the footage must represent videos shot on camcorders. Japanese films are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were amazing. In some cases, they create another world feeling (eg, the static interference or the first finale), but in other cases they are alarmingly realistic (eg, the second finale). When all is said and done, Noroi goes down like the scariest movie I've ever seen. I would go so far as to say that there are no movies that give such pure terror from the beginning to the end as Noroi does. See it now.
