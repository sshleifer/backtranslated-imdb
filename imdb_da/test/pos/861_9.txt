Saw the movie at the Hollywood Film Festival in October '04. Mark Robertson took a great chance of writing an extremely difficult part for his first movie and it paid off big in his casting by Kelly Overton. I had a strong feeling that she was coming from the theater, so I looked her up and ... surprise, I'm right. Several Hollywood actors should follow her, give up the expensive actors and come back to the theater, because only with that kind of training will you be prepared for a trip like this. For all the great things I can say about the movie and the director (and there are many), I just can't stop talking to people about Kelly Overton's masterful performance. We are undoubtedly seeing much more of her work. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mark and Kelly on a bold movie. Get it out in the theaters so I can bring all the people I made to watch the movie ASAP!
