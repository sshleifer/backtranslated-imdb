Shepitko is the wife of Russian filmmaker Elem Klimov, who directed the more commercially known 1984 film COME AND SEE, which is commonly considered one of the most realistic war films ever, bore no one that is remarkable for its hurting poetic intensity, but I Believes that it lacks the intrinsic complexity of this even greater Russian film, which not only examines the graphic external horrors, but finds truly inspiring images focusing on individuals or small groups of characters that reflect the absolute madness that takes place Inside these people whose end is simply respectful. Bullets fly, and bodies die in a gun-screen over the opening circles, where the intensity of the movie never lets up in the whole duration of focus on ugly faces, worn-out soldiers with almost nothing to eat, a frightened occupied occupation, starving children with petrified mothers, all threw in a huge landscape with endless white snow. Like CRANES FLYING (1957), this has a Russian army in retreat, a traumatizing shock early in the war, when they were almost exterminated. The Russian landscape has been overrun by German Nazis who terrorize the citizens, steal the food they have, and force them to become their informal eyes and ears. Which Russian soldiers are left hidden under the cover of a forest, but are forced to send food expeditions to nearby farms. This movie follows two soldiers, who from the beginning are on an almost impossible mission, as there is little food back anywhere in the winter's death. One is healthy and fit, Vladimir Gostyukhin as Rybak, while the other, Boris Plotnikov as Sotnikov, is lowered by a tuberculous sounding cough and finally a bullet in his leg that almost leaves him to death, but his partner saves him heroically. As they step through knee depths, at some points with insufficient protection against the hard elements, like many other Russian films, nature becomes their hardest enemy. <br /> <br /> Spoilers !! Everything is reduced to a question of survival. When they reach their destination, the farm has been abandoned and left in a state of rubble, pushing forward to the German occupied territory, where the next farm is manned by an older Soviet partner who fears Nazi retaliation. The partisan soldiers think him a coward, but continue where they are eventually captured and taken to a Nazi camp in a nearby town and held as a prisoner with a proud and protective mother (Lyudmila Polyakova) who helped them hide them. Tarkovsky stalwart Anatoli Solonitsyn appears as the Portnov interrogator, a Russian teacher from a nearby academy became Nazi sympathizers. Russians torture and execute middle Russians is the depth of war deterioration, and Solonitsyn is brilliant in the despicable role he perfectly fits. From what we can see as Nazi officers chatting jovially near each other, he is an outsider, even among this group, seen instead as a kind of cruel, dark-skinned undertaker routinely sending men to their graves. The audience is not spared of witnessing torture on Sotnikov, which only gives contempt, while Rybak speaks freely and hopes to save his life, but both are doomed to die, although Rybak has the opportunity to serve the German kingdom as a police force . The mother, the elderly partner and a child are added to this group and spend a night tonight together, discussing the benefits of a soldier's mission, being a patriot, mother, coward, or collaborator. Each of them works individually driven by a desperate need to survive, but Sotnikov offers himself as an unselfish example, trying to acknowledge his guilt to save the others, where the appropriately chosen title reflects his spiritual redemption. <br /> <br /> At the next morning, Portnov seems to be amused and mocked at their sudden willingness to speak, but saves no one except Rybak, who changes pages to keep his life and rationalize in his thoughts that if he lives , at least he has a chance to escape. But there is no escape, not from this plague. What happens is shown with exquisite delicacy and poetic grace as we testify of war betrayal without a single shot being fired, as the execution of hanging becomes a public spectacle where the villagers at a gun are forced to witness. The pace and harrowing intensity of this movie is relentless, as there is never a moment without imminent threat, shot shot by Vladimir Chukhnov (who died in the same car accident as Shepitko), with perfectly composed landscapes and lots of camera handling, much of it is close portraits, especially a tough young boy at the end, who sees the condemned men making a surrealistic connection to the next generation without saying a word, highlighted by Alfred Shnittke's psychologically horrible music resembling the transcendent yet furious disruptive monolith music of Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). The sound design of this movie is very sophisticated and uniquely modern, with the use of offscreen sound continuously exposing the raw nerves at any moment, dogs barks, wind blowers, bullets shoots, nearby Nazis speaking in untranslated German or laughing sadistically at their helplessness as only obscures the horrible tension to insane heights. In many ways, Dreyer's work plan (1928) resembles complete madness here, the relentless realization that you have no choice but you are forced to make one anyway. The marble endless thoughts at the end are expressed wordless, where the dead nobility talks volumes, where voices continue to immerse themselves in the livelihoods as an explosion of endless echoes, but only silence fills the sharp wintery air with a carefree reverence and a deep sense of loss .
