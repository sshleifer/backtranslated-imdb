Five years after joining James Cagney in "The Public Enemy," Mae Clarke shows yet another look, this time as his fiancé with Cagney's character on the other side of the law. It seems she also calls several of the shots in their relationship and tries to make Johnny Cave a little more practical with his money and career. You had to expect that they would come together again after she gave him the boot to challenge her crooked boss; These things have a way to train in pictures. <br /> <br /> I got a kick out of seeing Cagney in this one. I usually do it, and here he looked as if he could have auditioned the characteristic shoulder pusher movement that he used to have a good effect in "Angels With Dirty Faces" depicting Rocky Sullivan. It was just after he threw Cavanaugh (Robert Gleckler) out of his office during the first attempt to bribe the new weight and measure boss. He turns to the camera and hitches up as if it is completely satisfied with his answer to the villain - very cool. It is my understanding that this was not one of Cagney's Warner movies, but it might as well have been. Warner often took the cause of the common man, and the crooked merchants and the politicians who protected them would have been right up their street. You also have the great New York City street scenes that depict cars and shops in the era, with homemade signs pricing flour at eighteen cents a pound. Hey, what about the furniture store that sells the living room, set at a hundred and eighty nine dollars, you might get a single bar chair at that price today. <br /> <br /> Best part of the picture might just be that the meat counter scene when Cagney, James Burke (Aloysius) and the butchers play catch with an underweight chicken. One of the movie's brighter moments, but you get an idea of ​​how excited people can get when they get caught cheating. Same with the truck driver who is pressed by Johnny to sign for a precise delivery; He was just not used to it. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good diversion from Cagney's more typical gangster presence, though not up to the standard of his feature film. It's easy enough to get one of a handful of public domain Cagney pictures out there, and is often found in relatively cheap compilations.
