An astronaut is lost in deep space and finds himself traveling through unknown territory aboard a live spaceship accompanied by a group of aliens. This incredible plotted and comfortable TV episode comes together as a positive birth fantasy. The individual characters in conflict at the start of the series must learn to come together and develop into a strong group at the end. Most of the action takes place within Moia, the space ship (which even gets pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). Although science fiction stories are usually interested in negative birth fantasies (see, for example, 'Alien' films, especially the fourth part 'Resurrection'), it comes as a surprise. Also enjoyable is the absence of military hierarchy aboard the ship and the positive attitude towards gender and the human (and foreign) body. One of the female characters that is actually a plant experiences 'photogasms' while exposed to sunlight. The crew must even go to the toilet. Wouldn't it be impossible in 'Star Trek'?
