I'm not sure how to make ten lines out of this question, but I'll try. <br /> <br /> When Julie went to the dance, they danced to slow music. What's the song that played, and who played it? <br /> <br /> I love that song! And I watch the movie again and again just to hear one song. <br /> <br /> I did several searches online and even looked up the audio track, but I can't find the song. <br /> <br /> It may be because the song they were dancing to was not a complete song and only partial. <br /> <br /> I would appreciate if anyone out there knows what the name of the song and the group that dropped it. <br /> <br /> Thanks. <br /> <br /> Frank
