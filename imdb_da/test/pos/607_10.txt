This movie is about aging Geisha in the post-war Tokyo. Okin, played by the incredible Haruko Sugimara, lends money to two other ex Geisha, Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Otomi (Yuko Mochizuki), and they recover the way she's a little bit trapped. Tamae has a son, Otomi a daughter who announces during the film that they are leaving them, while Okin, never a mother, gets a visit from two men in her past, showing off just wanting money from her. It is a convincing narrative of what choices you make, what you do to get through life and who you are responsible for and retained for. Haruko Sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character actresses ever from any country, and she plays the most unpleasant, less than compassionate Okin with an air of superiority that doesn't make you like her, but at the same time envies her. At a time when amazing films were made by Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinoshita and Kurosawa, Mr. Naruse right up there with him. If you have a region-free DVD player, try to find the two Naruse box sets released in the UK. I think this movie was a great character study of women who are in danger of being irrelevant. That they really don't make this movie a true masterpiece.
