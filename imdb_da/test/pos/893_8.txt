The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the French "Emmanuelle 2." This amazing woman did not go unnoticed and was quickly cast as a leader in this brand new Italian series, where she is the centerpiece; a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism the world had to offer. In this first part, Mae Jordan / Emanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph the people as well as the stunning scenery and wild exotic animals. Like Sylvia Kristel's character, Emanuelle has not come into its own when it comes to being open and comfortable with its own sexuality. This first film is basically about how she becomes "Emanuelle", as most exploitative biographies are familiar with. Filled with beautiful filmography, beautiful people and a heady 70's score from the legendary Nico Fidenco, this one is absolutely safe. Those who enjoy the more history-driven style of the original French "Emmanuelle" should certainly also like this. The main story here is an interesting cat and mouse tale of a womanizing playboy who realizes that he is in love with a woman who is the female version of him! Sexy, fun and totally entertaining throughout; a soap opera to be safe, but one with sufficient skin and regular eye light to keep the male viewers entertained. For some reason it is the hardest in the series to find on DVD. There has never been a legitimate DVD for this, which is very strange. The bootlegs that sometimes appear online must be done until someone gives this diamond a movie a proper release.
