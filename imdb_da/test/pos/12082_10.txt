Who will love my children has changed my heart, it made me cry all the way through, the most I cried with was when the family had to say goodbye to the child, I cried most about it, and every time a child was adopted I cried when they had to say goodbye to their mother, it was sad they had to lose their mother, I was sorry the child with epilepsy, I was glad he was adopted by the same family as one of his brothers. To me, the boy I thought was the special because he went to a home. I feel that I am special because I am in a world of Asperger's syndrome and sometimes when I feel down, I can cry. I really enjoyed this movie, 10 out of 10. A true story, very good. Another movie that would bring tears to my eyes, I think should be on Tuesday with Morrie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805)
