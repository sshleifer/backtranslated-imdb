This mini-series is iconic for the Australian spirit. Although there may be what may be considered brilliant discrepancies, the film depicts a spirit unique to Australia and one that should be appreciated. If anything, this mini-series shows the aussie sense of humor. The ability to laugh at the extremely ridiculous. Our willingness to have a laugh in even the most serious situations. While much of this series focuses on mateship and how humor can be used as a means of survival, it also has elements of drama that evoke real emotions. The most important players that look are quite sensational and very convincing in their different roles. Captures the essence of their characters perfectly. This mini-series should be a mandatory display for all Australians.
