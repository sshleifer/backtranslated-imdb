Spain's director Luis Buñuel's career spanned nearly 50 years from 1929 to 1977. His best film was possibly the one he did during his exile in Mexico - from the late eighties to the early 60s. There he had to deal with very cheap budgets and work in an industry that was primarily interested in running commercial films for the unsophisticated audience, but somehow managed to make interesting, thought-provoking films that have been the time test . This film is based on a novel by Spanish author Benito Perez Galdos - and the adaptation is quite faithful, although the setting is now the beginning of 20th century Mexico instead of the early 20th century Spain. The main character, Nazarin, is a priest who tries to live a life that is as faithful as it can be to the one prescribed by Christ. The question that many would ask is whether such an endeavor would be possible without incurring in the hostility, ignorance, and blasphemy of hostilities. As it happens, he suffers a lot of indignities, but he stays stubborn (until the controversial final shot) to this goal. I think Buñuel wanted to show Nazarin as a somewhat ridiculous figure, but perhaps inadvertently, his stubbornness (at least to this viewer) comes out as admirable. In any case, a great movie.
