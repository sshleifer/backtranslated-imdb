At this day and age, where almost every news story involves discussions of waterboarding, pictures of Abu Ghraib or stories of compulsory content in Guantanamo Bay, Gavin Hood's "Rendition" is just as immediate and timely a movie as it will ever come out entertainment factories in mainstream Hollywood. It is not in any way the imagination, a perfect movie, but it does not deserve the appealing oprorium it has got in the hands of critics from all over the ideological and political spectrum. <br /> <br /> The term "transfer" refers to the CIA's ability to arrest any person who suspects terrorist acts, and then secretly whips them away to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them indefinitely, all without legal proceedings. Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian man who has lived in the United States for twenty years. He has an American wife, a young son and a new baby on the way. He appears to be a very unlikely candidate for a terrorist, but one day without warning or explanation, Anwar is seized and taken to a non-revealed place where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement in a terrorist organization which Anwar claims to know nothing about it. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, "Rendition" occasionally falls into its storytelling skills, often by biting a little more than it can chew on both plot and character. The apparent focal point is Douglas Freeman, a newcomer CIA agent brought in to observe Anwar's "interrogation" in the hands of Egyptian officials. The problem is that Freeman, as devised by author Kelley Sane and adopted by Jake Gyllenhaal, seems too much of a naive "boy scout" to make it a very likely agent and he doesn't get the screen time he needs to fully develop as a sign. We know a little about him at the beginning and even less so at the end. He "goes through the movements", but we learn precious little about the man inside. Thus, without a strong center of gravity to keep everything together, the film occasionally feels as if coming apart at seams, with story elements flying in all directions. A similar problem arises with Anwar's distraught wife, played by Reese Witherspoon, a woman we never learn much about, except what we can see on the surface. Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon have both proved to be fine actors in other circumstances, but here they are home to a restrictive manuscript, which rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances. <br /> <br /> What makes "Publishing" An ultimate powerful movie, however, is the extreme severity of the subject and the way in which two concurrent continuous plot lines elegantly dovetail into each other in the film's final lines. It might create a little more confused story than maybe maybe we liked about this topic, but hey, after all, Hollywood, and the movie has to pay some respect for mass members' expectations if it is to get themselves green, let alone see Today's light as a finished project. Two of the supporting performances are particularly convincing in the movie: Omar Metwally, which makes tangible terror for a man caught in a real life Kafka's nightmare from which he cannot awaken and Yigal Naor, which creates a surprisingly complex character out of the top interrogator / torture. Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also make their characters in smaller roles. There should also be mentioned the warm and real huedographic film by Dion Beebe. <br /> <br /> Is the movie oversimplifying the problems? Probably. Does it stack up the tire for the benefit of torture victims and against the evil government forces? Definitely. (You wonder how the movie would have played if Anwar really was a terrorist). Still, the film has the courage to step on a controversial basis. It is not afraid to raise dicey questions or risk disapproval of some of the political issues it takes. It openly opens the question of how to keep a nation firmly in its hard-won principle of "civil liberties for all" in the face of terrorism and fear. And how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally get up and say "enough is enough" even at the risk of being labeled terrorist appeasing and unpatriotic by the powerful? (The film in no way rejects the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism). In order to reject "extradition" out of hand, it would be possible to let the perfect be the enemy of the enemy well. "Extradition" may not be perfect, but it is good, and it has something important to say about the world we now live in. And that alone makes it very worth seeing.
