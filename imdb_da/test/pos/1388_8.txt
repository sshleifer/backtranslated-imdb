A screen text tells us that it is 'The Caribbean Sea, May 1891'. A small lifeboat effortlessly drives at sea with six prisoners from a shipwrecked prison ship and ship's doctor Claude De Ross (Claudio Cassinelli). It is night, a strange stream passing the boat to a strange, unnamed and unknown island. The boat hits some stones and torn apart. One of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fish crew. Next morning Claude wakes up to find himself washed on a beach. He finds a pool of white bubbling water and one of the prisoners dead next to it. Claude warns another surviving prisoner Jose (Franco Iavarone) not to drink the water as it will kill him. They finally meet together with the other surviving prisoners, Peter (Roberto Posse), Francois (Francesco Mazzeri) and Skip (Giuseppe Castellano). Francois walks by himself to try to catch an animal for food, he finds and kills a large waterfowl. But on the other hand, he is killed by one of the fishermen. Claude, Jose, Peter and Skip continue to explore the island as they put Francois dead on an animal attack of some sort. Shortly after, Skip is killed when he is pressed on a tip at the bottom of a pit. Now only Claude, Jose and Peter are back. They stumbled across a cemetery with lots of empty tombs and signs of recent black magic rituals. Claude stains a snake on a nearby stone, suddenly a shot is heard and the snake's head explodes. A woman on horses named Amanda Marvin (Barbara Bach) is revealed to be Claudes savior. She tells them to leave the island immediately when it is owned by an Edmund Rackham (Richard Johnson) and he does not like visitors. Claude, Jose and Peter decide to continue regardless, eventually finding Rackham's big house where they are invited to stay. That night Peter goes after Amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp, Peter quickly gets food for the fishermen. And a Voodoo priestess called Shakira (Beryl Cunningham), who lives with Rackham, performs a black magic ritual involving throwing the throat on a chicken in the cemetery. The next day, Claude and Jose decide to leave the island as they feel very uneasy about Rackham and think he's lying to them. Jose rides on horseback and is lost. Claude is rescued from one of the fishermen at Amanda and is again being asked to leave. Claude wants to confront Rackham again. Rackham reveals that he has a scientist and Amanda's father, Professor Ernest Marvin (Joseph Cotten), to whom he must be kept alive. Rackham says the longer Ernest remains alive, the chances of his own survival growing dramatically. Rackham tells Claude his plan. Rackham has found the lost city of Atlantis at a depth of over 2,000 feet. He uses the fishermen as a means to get to Atlantis' lost treasures and needs Amanda and her father to control them. He claims that the fishermen are descendants of Atlantis original inhabitants. Rackham offers Claude some of the treasure if he wants to help him keep Ernest alive. Later, Claude remembers the name Ernest Marvin as a scientist condemned for experiments that transplanted animal organs to humans. Find Ern's secret lab, he discovers that Rackham had lied to him, and the fishermen are not descendants, their truly genetically altered people became amphibious creatures of Ernest's grotesque experiments! Rackham has finally had enough of Claude and decides to put an end to his interference by sticking him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water as the island's volcano begins to erupt and send lava flying everywhere. Rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures and Amanda, Claude will almost certainly escape death to save Amanda and get out of the island before the volcano breaks out the volcano, tears it apart? Directed by Sergio Martino I really liked this movie that mixes different genres. The writing of Sergio Donati is quick, interesting and entertaining. The reason is revealed little by little which kept me interested in seeing it all the way through. I must say at this point that I have seen the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted because it is American release by Roger Corman. Barbara Bach makes an extremely attractive leading lady, but I hated the way she was introduced by shooting a snake head, I thought it was more than a little uncomfortable. Richard Johnson makes a great villain and Claudio Cassinelli a sympathetic hero. The fishermen themselves look a bit fake when the camera lengthens them too long, but their sail looks and I have seen worse. Some of the miniature effects also look a little poor, but generally I have seen much worse again. There is no real gore, violence or nudity in it, but it didn't really disturb me. The photograph of Giancarlo Ferrando and the production design by Massimo Antonello Geleng combine to create a very nice film. Period costumes, props and sets like Rackham's house and Ernest's lab with the old scientific equipment. The lush green jungle settings also add to the visual splendor of the show. I really liked this movie and I was entertained all the time. I am not sure who I would recommend it, as it mixes different genres, I guess someone might want something a little different and generally well made. If you can find a copy, give it a ride, I'm glad I did.
