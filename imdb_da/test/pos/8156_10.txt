This is an all-round excellent movie. A moving experience filled with the emotions of reality. There is teaching about love, gender, work, religion and American culture, regardless of their sexual preferences. <br /> <br /> Although this film is also a disgraceful accusation of Mormon (Church of Latter-day Saint) belief system, any conservative faith can easily take its place. But it is a little ironic that homosexuality is currently condemned by the Mormons in no uncertain terms. Here is a belief that mandates for generations that believers exercise polygamy! And these true believers only gave this practice because they were forced to do so by the federal government for Utah to join the Union. Talk about a unique form of hypocrisy! <br /> <br /> The sex scenes portrayed in the non-classified version are tasteful and surprising cards. There is nothing here that would offend anyone with an open mind. What this film makes so obvious is that homosexuality is quite natural for people who are gay, as heterosexuality is for people who are equal! Although love and sex are, of course, completely different needs, it is absolutely beautiful, in addition to words, when both occur simultaneously between two adults! Deep erotic love is one of life's most precious gifts! Congratulations to the filmmakers for a job well done!
