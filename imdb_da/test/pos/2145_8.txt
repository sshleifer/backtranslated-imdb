I don't seriously know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released. Sure, it's slow and somewhat gratuitous in its depictions of sexuality and violence, but it's also many well-founded movies. I don't seriously think the people who hated "Heaven's Gate" really understood it. The "Gate of Heaven" in its pristine form, like "Deer Hunter", shows the brutal differences in living an insecure and dangerous life (like immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living in comfort and privilege (like the resident "Americans" in Wyoming and Averil in prologue and epilogue). Living a hard life is painful, but it can also be refreshing as opposed to the boring life of Averil in the epilogue. Also, when Michael Cimino took great pains to make the picture historically accurate, it is fascinating as a document of (and perhaps accusing) American life in Old West Wyoming. The dialogue is often really smart and emotional. Combined with good music and movies, the film acts as a truly poetic work of art. Permitted, "The Gate of Heaven", with its rejection of rejecting the viewer, is not for every taste. But Hollywood is showing so much commercial drink every year, which is so much easier to dismiss as mindless eye candy (even when an example of it becomes a huge one) that "Gate" and Cimino really deserve more respect. All people should see the easy-to-use version at least once, and then they should make their own mind. <br /> <br />
