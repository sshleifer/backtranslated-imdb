"The Vicious Circle" is a very unknown British mystery story. Like many Hitchcock films, it is about a man who is accused of a crime he did not commit and does everything he can to prove it. This time it is a Dr. Latimer (John Mills), who finds a murdered German actress from his floor. As an honest man, the doctor calls Scotland Yard, which turns out to be a big mistake ... There really is nothing special about this little movie. But it's an entertaining way to watch movies watching movies. I enjoyed following the developments. Fine actors are a plus.
