I thoroughly enjoyed Carmen, better than Original Sin (Angelina Jolie & Antonio Bandaras), who shares some thematic similarities and which I also greatly enjoyed. I felt the play was stronger here (Paz Vega showed a wider range, has more fire, and Sbaraglia was also great). Overall, their plays were more gritty, more credible (less dreamy than Original Sin, and both actors here had less "celebrity status" and "pretty face" relying on making the movie work. Vega sizzles definitely as expected. <Br / > <br /> Director Vincente Aranda has also built a detailed world (again, better than Original Sin), which allows you to feel the dirt and the daily outcomes of archaic Spain - for example, people reading goods from a wagon The street changes workers shifted by the street lamp lights, all in the background of the action, although I very much sympathize with the recent idea of ​​redeeming our femme fat (like Brian de Palma's Femme Fatale), Carmen is an exciting, modern recording in the tradition of the noir classic double repayment and a great pleasure to see, this is another good example of the bold European cinema's triumph over sparkling and safe Hollywood fare.
