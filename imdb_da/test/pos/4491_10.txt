I will never forget the totally absorbing effect this show had on me when I saw it for the first time. From the moment the Major is frightened by the clown to his awful attempt to make sense of the situation ("We are alive, we are human beings, we must have memories!" Inactive quote but close) to his wise attempt to improvise one escape, this is riveting drama. <br /> <br /> Small touches remain with the viewer for a long time after seeing it. The moment when the lovely ballerina dances for everyone, the off-key, screeching bags of the Scottish musician; The tramp's wise remark, "A miss is as good as a mile", the Major's shaking conclusion that they must be in hell. This is a brilliant episode, beautifully written and acted. Susan Harrison's breathtaking beauty adds to the strange touching story.
