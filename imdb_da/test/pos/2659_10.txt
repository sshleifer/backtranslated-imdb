As a circle around the human state, 2001 starts at the beginning, skips the middle, and continues to the end, right back where we started. When taking note of weaknesses in relation to images, Kubrick wisely forbids dialogue to favor power and essence in nature and allows the public's intelligence to do deciphering. Or not, depending on the audience. <br /> <br /> A monolith in film history, 2001 is a high-level watermark of direction, performance and performance. If you consider the film's ambition (a movie about everything) and the measure of success that the film achieves in that end, a very solid argument that this is the greatest of all movies can be made. <br /> <br />
