Beware that My Lovely stems from a game written by Mel Dinelli, who apparently liked to write about scared women. His first and best effort was the manuscript of The Spiral Staircase. He also made a Loretta Young suspense thriller Reason for alarm a few years earlier. The play Dinelli originally wrote The Man, and it ran for 92 performances on Broadway in the 1950s. It was Dinelli's only bet on Broadway, and the star Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone. <br /> <br /> The roles played by Gish and Boone are taken by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For some reason, RKO thought about eliminating the age difference. Dinelli even rewrote his game to the screen, so I wonder what he was thinking about it. It is certainly completely unclear that was eliminated from the very beginning. It was not the only thing that was eliminated. People all have dress from World War II, but there is no reference at all to the time this story takes place. I thought it strange and later, when the telephone company repairman came to Ida Lupino's home, I noticed that his truck was a vintage one of the same era. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost entirely set in Ida Lupino's home, where she has hired a traveler alien in Robert Ryan as a craftsman. The movie is a good object lesson by not hiring strangers without reference. It turns out that Ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons Lupino in his home for about a day. Both managers do good jobs, even with the changes made. Movies like Beware My Lovely are the things that a small studio like RKO did best. If this was done at MGM or Paramount, the glossy stairs would have overwhelmed a solid story.
