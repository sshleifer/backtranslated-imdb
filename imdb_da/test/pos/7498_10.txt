For those who are not familiar with Paddy Chayefsky, this is a very good introduction. While Chayefsky deals with the reality behind the myths of many things, including medicine, this work is surprisingly prophetic of the way medicine goes today, two decades after the film was made and over a decade after his death. Besides that, some insights into Chayefsky's view of life are generally 'slipped in' in the film. The 20th century may prove to be the first and last century in the United States in world history. If it turns out that America's contribution to art was in the "movie" dimension, this is an excellent example of that art.
