I remember watching this movie 34 years ago and it was full of excitement and twists. It grabs you at the beginning and keeps you guessing throughout the movie. I have been thinking of this movie in recent years and have checked into video stores to see if it is available, but it was never possible to find it or someone who had even heard of it. I think this type of movie is timeless, and I know it would be enjoyed by a whole new generation of movie watchers. I hope it will come soon on video as it would be fun to see if it has the same impact on me as it did back in the early 70s. It is very rare that a TV movie can make so much of an impression, but it was and still does after so many years.
