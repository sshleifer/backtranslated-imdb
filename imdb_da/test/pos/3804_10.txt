The first time I saw this movie, I just thought "what the hell?" a 10-year-old kid runs around bizarre places that meet bizarre people, goes for a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yes! I enjoyed this movie a lot! <br /> <br /> Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a pity he stopped action. He interprets his character Gus on the film. <br /> <br /> Gus loses an eye, has tattoos and goes into the most strange cities that work with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? <br /> <br /> Okay, don't even try to understand the story, but why does this movie need one! Just open your mind and let Gus drive you into this journey. "Motorama Gus, you won Motorama"
