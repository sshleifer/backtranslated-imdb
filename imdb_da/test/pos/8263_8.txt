At the beginning of the 19th century, a young woman with a harelip falls against her family's ambition and testimonies in the community, but she meets a man who can see her differently and perhaps just change Prus's life forever. <br /> <br /> Precious Bane is a British Broadcasting Corporation customizing the highly acclaimed novel by Mary Webb. It is a beautifully filmed piece that works to an incredibly high standard, the story {manuscript of Maggie Wadey} is excellent, and the periodical and dialect use is second to none. It is such a shame that this movie has not yet received a DVD release, one would have thought that with Clive Owen's (great here as Gideon) rising to the star, the BBC would get it out there, but unfortunately no, so the only way catching it is in the very rare cases that TCM shows it. The main achievement of Janet McTeer as Pru Sarn is simply brilliant, courageous and genuine feelings go hand in hand as McTeer gives it to everyone. Pru should not only fight for her face disfigurement, but also the constant cheats and evil of the ignorant villagers. It's a time when people believed that if a Hare jumped in front of a pregnant woman, it spelled judgment, a time of Bull Baiting, a time of superstition and talk of witches. Despite constant setbacks, Pru is strong and resourceful, even his own family returns its dreams without realizing it, but this path may well be a terribly uneven, but hope is eternal, and Pru has hope in abundance. <Br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
