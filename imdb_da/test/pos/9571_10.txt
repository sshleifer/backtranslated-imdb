This movie has to go down as one of the funniest movies in history. Its cousins ​​A mighty wind, Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman is fantastic in itself, but the Best in Show takes the cake. <br /> <br /> A movie about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners showing their dogs competitively, they are the intricate characters that do so well. After watching the movie about 75 times, I have come to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this movie. There is very little interaction between any of the "groups" of characters, but it only seems to add to the beauty of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and don't find it as fun as I bill it as, watch it again. The first time I saw it, I thought it was usable but not overly fun. It's a movie that grows on you. Definitely a movie that you will often quote. <br /> <br /> Characters: Hamilton and Meg Swan: A + if you get the DVD check how these characters were "born" amazing that these two could hit it then upside down. And to find out that they really didn't go by a script and kind of made it up when they went. <br /> <br /> Gerry and Cookie Guggleman: A cookie is particularly fun and she does a great job of selling the cookie character. Gerry (Eugene Levy) delivers its standard star performance of the hilarious discombobulated type weaker half. <br /> <br /> Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donalan- A + Find me a more fun character than Scott Donalan, I dare you! He will forever be typecast as this character to me as he was so natural and did not seem to be forced at any time. Stefan (Micheal McKean) was also very good and they interact here (and a short look with Gugglemans) goes to show why he is always in these movies. A great actor with razor as white. <br /> <br /> Harlan Pepper-B +, I don't want it to seem like he's fun, he's sure to be the only "Solo" act he can't be as fun like the others over. He uses the dog more than others and has other idiosyncrasies for him. <br /> <br /> The rest is also good, there is no weak character. Watch this movie at least twice. Buy it, you won't regret it.
