This movie is undoubtedly the best I have seen and really shows what British talent can do. These are effects that are exceptionally good considering that the film is set in the mid-18th century, and all the grin and disgusting filth in England at that time is very well recorded. The character is developed and developed from MaCleane's whoring antics for his development in the highwayman and exhibitionary 'The Gentleman Highwayman' contrast well with Robert Carlyle, whose cynicism and honor show that you can love a thief and a criminal cos I quote: 'He is got more honor in his little finger than any of your fat bastards! "<br /> <br /> Not referring to you of course! But it's probably the most touching and emotional scene ever seen in a movie, but just watch it to find out it's enough to say, that it involves rope around the neck. <br /> <br />
