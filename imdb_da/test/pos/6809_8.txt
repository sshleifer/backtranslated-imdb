In "Lassie Come Home", "National Velvet" and "The Courage of Lassie" Elizabeth Taylor was eleven years old ?? Nevertheless, her charm and beauty were extraordinary, and what she lacked in talent and experience was well hidden in a fine production nominated for the five Academy Awards ?? <br /> <br /> As a horse trainer or dog owner who spurned wife or mistress, Liz is a woman who is absorbed in giving and receiving love: Devotion to the purpose of passion is the center of her life ?? Little Liz's lavish love on horses and dogs with remarkable intensity ?? ecstatic; a dream with a turbulent emotional life, persistent, young Liz dedicates to the award winning horse she later uses for men? <br /> <br /> Does her later photos of young sex goddess Liz predict as Velvet are both saintly and mature ?? Howard Barnes, in the New York Herald Tribune, called her a child "brightening up the integrity of a great passion." Directed by Clarence Brown with loving attention to detail, the movie that made her a star is a great bestseller from another era in Sussex, England, where Velvet Brown, a butcher's daughter, joined a vagabond teenager named Mi Taylo (Mickey Rooney) to train for competition a horse she has won in a raffle ?? <br /> <br /> From the coastal plains with its beaches, to the rolling hills, thatched cottages and miles of country walks, "National Velvet" is the product of a bygone era in film making? <br /> <br /> Follow closely the structure of the popular Enid Bagnold novel.

The Browns is a noble version of Hollywood rustic ?? Dedicated to a sober work ethic, they live quiet, exemplary lives ?? Mrs. Brown (Anne Revere) is the very spirit of general wisdom; the spokeswoman for common sense and fair play, she knows well not to hesitate the queer daughter's semi-hysterical energy, and she lets the girl have her dream ??? Anne Revere won an Oscar as the velvet mother, as did editor Robert J. Kern ??
