If you haven't heard of this movie, it follows two Sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in Africa to America where they convince themselves that they will find success and wealth. Life is harder than expected in the states, and this movie captures the frustration when things are not right. Life is captured so well, many moments seem written because they are so perfect. Whether it's at work, in school, or in time, the two boys, Peter and Santino, are very honest with the filmmakers, and make some very thoughtful comments about life in the states. It's one of the only documentaries I can remember when it ended, I wanted to continue for another two hours. It may be difficult to find this movie because it did not get much distribution, but check your local "art house" or independent theater and give it one time (page message, if you read this when it is already on video then it is definitely worth it to rent). Rating: 28/40
