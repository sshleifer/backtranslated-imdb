I would recommend this to anyone who is an admirer of late John Cassavetes. And for those who have never known Cassavetes. It's a great movie. I really don't have time to go into the details of why this is my opinion, but if you're looking for something gutsy, with lots of scenes to mull over, then this is for you. The cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film, as well as the story itself. This "review" does not do the film justice. It is an experience you have to see for yourself. Lots of character. Very real.
