Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows up on his promising debut, the Gothic horror "Frailty" with this family-friendly 1913 US Open sports drama, where a young American caddy rises from his humble background to play against his Bristish idol in what was called as "the biggest game ever played". I am not a fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently made to grand effect with "Miracle" and "Cinderella Man"), but some how this movie was enchanting all the same. /> <br /> The movie starts with some creative opening credits (imagine a Disney song version of the animated opening credits of HBO's "Carnivale" and "Rome"), but lumbers slowly for its first by-the-numbers time. When the action moves to the United States, the open things get very good. Paxton does a good job and shows an ability for effective directional blossoms (I loved the rain-woven mount of day two action in the opening), further propelling the plot or adding some unexpected psychological depths to the case. There is some compelling character development when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats that destroyed his family home as a child to make room for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually depicting what is happening in the players' heads under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought alive here alive. Creditors must also be given to the nominated designers and costume department to create an engaging periodic atmosphere in London and Boston in the early twentieth century. You know how this will end, not just because it is based on a true story, but also because movies in this genre follow the same template over and over, but Paxton puts on a better than average and may show more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it. Despite the formal nature, it is a good and easy movie to rotate for, which deserves to find an audience.
