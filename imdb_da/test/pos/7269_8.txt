I've been waiting since October last year to watch this movie! (It should come out October '98) and now I've finally seen it, I'm not disappointed. Bloody amazing! OK, it was a bit slow at first, but when it came, it's a very exciting nail-tipped time. Robert Carlyle is so different from either Gaz in 'The Full Monty' and Begbie in 'Trainspotting' that it's hard to recognize him! And Johnny Lee Miller, no longer with his Sick Boy from 'Trainspotting' blonde hair, plays his dashing gentleman highway man with the right humor and sensitivity to see why Liv Tyler's Rebecca falls for him. A good movie. As Hades in Disney's 'Hercules' would say, "Two thumbs up!"
