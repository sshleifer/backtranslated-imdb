I had never seen this movie before it was broadcast on a local cable sci-fi network. It reminded me of the Irwin Allen TV series in the late 60's (Time Tunnel, etc.). Excellent effects (they finished Star Trek 5 20 years later, but then it was not very difficult to achieve). I found the script very exciting and mature for this type of production. They would need a few touch ups to tie some loose ends at the character's level, but for a child movie it is surprisingly interesting (especially the glimpse of futuristic euro policy, surprisingly similar to today's EU!) <br /> <br /> The plot is actually reminiscent of the Twilight Zone in general (as other users have pointed out), but in this case it is a compliment. <br /> <br /> Big sets, by the way! <br /> 7/10
