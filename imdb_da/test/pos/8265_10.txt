I'm lucky enough to get a good copy of my VHS on DVD, so I can see it again and again. The characters are so well played I can't find fault with any aspect of the molding. OK, so there are some differences from the book, but the old clich√© of love that conquers everything is so highly portrayed that it is no difference. The reality of rural living in the early 19th century England is beautifully opposite of the changing seasons, from biting winter to glorious summer days, and this is reflected in the various signs, from Prue's bullying father to Kester's all-encompassing love. A story that changed my life.
