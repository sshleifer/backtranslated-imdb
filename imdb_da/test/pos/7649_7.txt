Not having heard about this movie, it came as a surprise when it was shown on cable recently. Gary Ellis, the gifted director of "Tough Luck", does wonders with the play written by Bill Boatman and Todd King. The movie involves the viewer from the start. <br /> <br /> Archie, the young hustler in the center of this story, has been involved in all kinds of petty crime. In fact, we are witnessing a confrontation right from the start, which makes him get out of New Orleans as soon as possible. He ends up in the carnival run by the mysterious Ike. Archie falls for Davina, the woman, he should have been wise to stay away from. The result shows a deadly sentence for Archie, which then becomes the subject of double crossing. <br /> <br /> The director should be commended by the casting of Norman Reedus, who is of course loved by the camera. In spite of its nature, you feel for him because we know that his heart is in the right place. The beautiful Dagmara Dominczyk is perfect as the exotic dancer Divana, who, despite being Ike's lover, entices Archie to fall heads over her heels with her. Armand Assante is hardly understandable with the thick accent he speaks in the first half of the film. <br /> <br /> "Tough Luck" shows a new director, Gary Ellis, who shows he wants to go bigger and better because he knows what he's doing.
