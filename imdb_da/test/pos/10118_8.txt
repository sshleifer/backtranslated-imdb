<br /> <br /> After reading the reviewer's review, I went to a "Radio" screening without knowing what to expect. Fortunately, the unemployed critic seems to me, anyway, a frustrated film director / film critic. His review is carefree and effortless! <br /> <br /> This is a movie that makes you laugh, it will make you cry and eventually give you a break! <br /> To rewrite a line provided by actor Ed Harris in the final barbershop scene "... and all this time we thought we were teaching Radio, the truth is ... He taught us. He treats us all the time, as we wish we treated each other, some of the time! "<br /> <br /> Yes the movie is dragging on the heartbeat. Yes it is emotionally manipulative and yes Cuba Gooding Jr. (In an Oscar worthy performance) is a little over the top at times (See the Christmas dance scene) but do you know what? SO WHAT! Every once in a while, the society of America must be reminded of what tolerance can do for our great country. We need to be aware of how big we can be. <br /> <br /> This is a solid cast. I was especially pleased to see S. Epatha Merkerson, who is spreading Radio's mother, doing something out of law and order. I have always wondered if Ms Merkerson is a great actor or is it the quality of writing delivered buy a strong cast of law and order. After watching this movie, it's easy to see that she really is a very fine actor. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast in small but important and powerful roles are Alfre Woodard as Principal, Debra Winger in a career -Reserving role of Coach Jones's wife and Chris Mulkey as protagonist, Frank Clay. <br /> <br /> We can't look over Ed Harris's performance as Coach Harold Jones. After reflecting on this movie and growing up in Deep South my own, it's hard to really appreciate Mr. Harris and his contribution to this movie. As Coach Jones, Ed provides a quiet, rock solid performance, a man on mission. Coach Harris won't let the city or circumstances divert him from what he knows in his heart, that's the right thing to do. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, make sure you stick to the final credits. You will be part of a treat as the real James Robert 'Radio' Kennedy, now in the mid 50's, still leads T.L. Hanna football team on the field every Friday night. <br /> <br /> A final note. If you were a teenager in the mid to late 70's, this movie is worth the price of recording, for the soundtrack alone!
