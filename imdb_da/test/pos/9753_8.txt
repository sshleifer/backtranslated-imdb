Hunting for Justice is about setting up Slobadon Milosevic for his trial in The Hague. While it was a little too clinical in the presentation, the subject could have been very depressing very quickly. A Canadian judge, Louise Arbor, becomes the prosecutor of the supreme war criminal at the International UN Criminal Tribunal in Yugoslavia. She struggles all to pull out the evidence that sent Milosevic to court. Not a bad document with class A instruction and production work. The evidence was disturbing with the sharp discussion of facts, fortunately they did not advocate for details and no real pictures of the tortured.
