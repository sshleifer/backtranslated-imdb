the film touches the soul to the audience a lot, a scene in the movie is ultimate and tears come out automatically, i'm surprised to see this movie that any director can lead this type of movie in the year 1925. As a student of cinema i can say that This film helps a lot in understanding the use of mounting. The first time our teacher told us this movie means genre of this movie, we thought nothing could be there in this movie to understand, but finally when Mr explained it then we came to know how big this movie is. Finally, I can say it helps a lot in understanding movies. And being a cinema student I can viewers that they can watch this movie.
