Creating the atmosphere of a movie within the first 5 minutes is always a well-known and important control unit. In the crucial opening scenes, the film has to assert itself and get viewers to notice and become interested in the rest of the movie. Here in "Mute Witness" we find an excellent example of this. <br /> <br /> * Scene spoiler * <br /> In the first 5-10 minutes, the movie opens to a very Hitchcockian scene of a beautiful blonde lady in her apartment, with the radio on. She walks around, uses lipstick, pops up and ignores the news report from a serial killer on it. Of course, the serial killer is in her house and monitors her movements, knife in her hand. She hears a noise, looks in a room, and there is her partner in a pool of blood. At the moment she screams, she turns to be confronted with the knife-waving lunatic who repeatedly crushes her in a brutal and scary action .... something strange happens. When the woman collides in her death, the killer sets down and takes out a cigarette to see that his victim is passing away. Before he finds his lighter, his cigarette turns on ... from another in the room! The camera pans out and we realize that there are more and more people in the room, some taking notes, some movie footage, some recording death, and the lady taking a very long time to die and doing a very hammy job of it too. When the audience realizes what's happening and the whole scene is part of a movie, the exciting and horrible scene takes an element of humor. <br /> <br /> * End Scene Spoiler * <br /> <br /> I have highlighted this opening scene for several reasons. Firstly, the atmosphere of the whole film depicts perfectly. A thriller in the style of Hitchcock or De Palma, with some very disorienting, and even black humorous moments. - It conveys a central issue (namely the difference between a movie screen death and a "snus movie death", a problem elaborated later in the film) and finally introduces the viewer to the characters, all as silently as possible. <br /> <br /> The foundation of Mute Witness centers around Billy Hughes, an American special effects makeup artist working on the movie, shot in a large warehouse in Moscow. Billy can't speak, but she communicates in sign language through her sister. After the end of an evening's movie, Billy accidentally finds her locked in the warehouse, and in her attempt to escape, witnesses to two of the crew, making it the first as a porn movie, but proving to be a snuff movie. Suddenly, her escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the first half of the movie is powerful and gripping. Billy's saving grace and her disability is that she is unable to pronounce a sound. (In fact, one of the best aspects of the film is, in my opinion, the fact that it is not full of women screaming). There are some disturbing moments, and some amazing pieces of real excitement (the corridor and the elevator shaft are perfect examples). The timing is fluid, and the entire first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in itself. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film introduces new concepts. While there are still more exciting moments, the focus is on flipping. New characters are introduced and it is ambiguous who they are on. Although there is nothing wrong in itself with the other half of the movie, it just can't quite measure up to the first half. There are some nice moments of black humor that perfectly match and puncture some very dramatic scenes, but there are also some very lame comedy moments (coming specifically from Billy's sister and her fianc√©, who happens to be the movie director Billy working on) that almost destroys the movie just because they are very wrong and / or distrusted and destroy the pace. - At the end, the turns continue at a fast speed, and the climax side of the film is appropriate, as tense as the first half. <br /> <br /> There are several things that really make the movie work. The barriers to communication that Billy has to face, both as a mute and an American in Moscow, mean that even an emergency call to help becomes a dangerous situation. The actor, who plays Billy, Natasha Zudina, does a wonderful job in the film, with a welcoming screen in advance and a brilliant performance, and finally the direction as a whole, but especially in the first half of the film, which is truly a study in Alfred Hitchcock's suspense / thriller movie techniques. However, as I have already said, the downsides in the movie are from some horrible comic relief moments that really do not need to be added. There is already a consistent and effective strip of dark humor appearing in the movie without the need for the characters Karen Hughes and Andy Clarke (sister and moviemaker) to make their scenes into some unusual sit-com. Despite these shortcomings, the movie is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller, and ideal for a group show on Halloween. (Definitely better than the usual slasher horror movie ...!)
