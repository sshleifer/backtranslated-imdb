just can't see this bit too many times, it's full of genuine enthusiasm and wisdom that Mickey Mouse had in its first 30 years. Today, Mickey is a beautiful ass little glow when comparing this. Steamboat Willie always makes me smile, at least the end where Mickey laughs after hitting a parrot with a potato. Animation is very nice, and although the steamboat Willie has no dialogue, the music is enough for it. <br /> <br /> IMHO, if this bit doesn't deserve 10/10, is a cartoon not only because it's true classic, but also because it's so full of joy, and it's always fun to watch.
