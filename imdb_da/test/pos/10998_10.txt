When I first saw the movie, I thought it was sweet - a family movie. For the rest of the night and in the next couple of days, wise moments and fun lines reside in my thoughts and our conversation ... Much, classic elements of farce, good character plays and Wendie Malick's storyline are just hysterical . Feeling a "feel-good movie" illuminates the white and funny - it's smarter than it looks like it's a wonderful life.
