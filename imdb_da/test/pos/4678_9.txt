I wonder how many MINI Cooper cars were sold thanks to this movie? It doesn't help to add to the sale of this little car, which is highlighted in this movie, along with an attractive cast. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining heist-and-chase movie. It has a "cool" cast with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> The best hunting scene is right from the start with a boat pursuit in Venice, Italy. The film does not exaggerate the violence, has a beautifully intelligent script (with few short exceptions). contains interesting characters and is nicely attached. The cat-and-mouse game between Norton and Theron's characters is exciting and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Once again, we are being manipulated to root for criminals portrayed as "the good people". How many times has this happened since the "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" in the 1960s? It's twisted Hollywood, for you. Here one of the criminals (Norton) stole the killed leader and grandfather (Donald Sutherland) in the gang, so he is the worst of the pile and the movie's villain. Theron's character is also in the typically overblown-feminist state of Hollywood, where women can do all things (including driving) better than a man. A third minor annoyance is Seth Green's slick, smart-ass attitude, which we also have to follow because it's hip and cool. <br /> <br /> Despite these hurdles, it is a very entertaining movie, and neither does it overboard fate or sexy .... and yes, the small cars are cool. Everyone I have spoken to who has seen this movie enjoyed it.
