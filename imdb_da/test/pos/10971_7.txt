This was truly a pleasure to see; The dialogue was - for the most part - excellent (I thought the women's roles were a little better written, which is a nice surprise). The performance was also uniformly very good. Frank Gorshin exaggerates a little when he goes into his various disadvantages, but it may be his overcompensation for what I see as weaknesses in how the character is written; he is very good otherwise. Harry Groener also does well with a slightly signed character (Tony), which exaggerates some of the character's angrier scenes. Ursula Burton is excellent as sister Theresa, who really wears the film through some of her weaknesses. Seymour Cassel and Louise Fletcher are a little underused here, although I liked their work as always. Shirley Jones, Wendie Malick, Jill Eikenberry and Faye Grant are also very good (I couldn't imagine thinking Grant reminded me of Catherine O'Hara here); Cloris Leachman tears rather into her role, with reasonably good results. <br /> <br /> I wish there was a more secure hand behind the camera. Sometimes the framing or set-up seemed a little away or awkward. The close-ups seemed overused (or irregularly used) to me. And we do not always go from stage to stage as smoothly as we would like. Some of the "hard guy" approach to the federal agent (music, costuming) was also over the top for me too. And the few fantasy sequences didn't really work. But there are things that were very well done; the opening sequence in Buffalo around 1970, for example. And frankly, all the scenes about Theresa's church work (I suppose the author and the actor liked the character a lot, which helps). The scenes between Malick and Eikenberry are very good. The plot is probably a bit overcontrived - there seem to be a few too many schemes going on at once to keep them all right at times and the coincidences must be a little too much. And I was a little bothered by the end (should we really twist for their biggest cone yet to succeed?), But the trip along the way is very entertaining. It would be nice to see more independent films like this one made. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
