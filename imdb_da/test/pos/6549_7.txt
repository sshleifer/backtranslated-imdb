Watched Uzumaki last night and immediately reminded of two early Peter Weir films from Australia, The Last Wave and Picnic At Hanging Rock. They were movie filled with atmosphere but short on real horror. Uzumaki seems to me clearly influenced by these films. It has a number of rather secular scenes that become more entertaining the deeper you are sucked in by the movie. It also has several scenes of direct horror, and although I don't think the movie actually measures up to the two movies, it's worth the time for the most thought-provoking fans of the unusual (not necessarily horror). 7 out of 10 seems fair, but I have to say that years after seeing The Last Wave, the film still remains with me, and it's just Picnic At Hanging Rock's unresolved end that makes it so exciting. P.S. All people criticize the actor ... pullleasse ... in this genre?
