America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately I have bored. <br /> <br /> Cycle 1: Yes I'm happy Adrienne won, I wanted her to win from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Cycle 2: It's too bad, I think Mercedes deserved it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 3: I didn't like Eva, but I didn't like most of the girls in this cycle. <br /> <br /> Cycle 4: The Kahlen should have won. I don't know what they saw in Naima, but I certainly know what they saw in the Kahlen. <br /> <br /> Cycle 5: Like Cycle 3, it wasn't a good cycle either. but out of all the girls, NICOLE who wins? eww! <br /> <br /> Cycle 6: I liked Sara and Joanie, but Danielle is okay too. Cycle 7: Caridee certainly deserved it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 8: No, I didn't want Jaslene to win. I didn't like her. I saw other girls in that cycle with certainly more potential than her, even though I'm not that much of this cycle. <br /> <br /> Good show, I just watched it too many times to like it much more: D
