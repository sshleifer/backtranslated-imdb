The begotten is one of the most unique movies I've ever seen. It's more for me, a study of sound, light and darkness and movement than a real story. The kind of thing you see as a video instillation at the Museum of Modern Art than a movie enjoyed at the local theater. I will not try to interpret the images of the mother's nature, the animals in the cloaks, the twisted and tortured body of her "child". Some things just speak interpretation.
