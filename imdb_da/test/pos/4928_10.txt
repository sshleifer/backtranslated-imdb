Tiny Toons is the first cartoon I remember seeing as a child and I loved every minute of it. When I was four or five, my parents bought the video how I spent my vacation. I saw it again and again until I enjoyed every word. Well a few days ago my three-year-old cousin came over and I had to entertain him. I decided to show him this old relic of my childhood. <br /> <br /> I was new, he would laugh, but I was surprised at how much I laughed. Like any movie and episode in Tiny Toons, humor is based more on wackiness and slapstick humor and is hugely successful. Bugs, Babs, Plucky Duck, Maton Pig and Fifi all endure fantastic adventures from Bugs and Babs white-water rafting with little help from Superman, Plucky Duck and Maton pigs traveling to the biggest amusement park just to ride monorail, and Elmyra goes on a Strange quest to find cute kittens in a safari country. Part of the classic humor is in this Tiny Toon Adventure and are some of the best crazy comedies I've ever seen. My favorite gag had to be the monorail thing when Hamton and Plucky arrive, ride the monorail, and leave) much to Plucky's horror). No matter what age you will laugh at yourself with tears while you do not have to deal with language and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiny Toons Adventures: How I spent my vacation. Starring the voices of: Charles Adler, Tress MacNeille, Joe Alaskey and Don Messick. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 5 stars.
