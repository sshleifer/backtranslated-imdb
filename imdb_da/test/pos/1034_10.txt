I can't remember the series, I think it could have been "American masters", but it was broadcast on PBS around 1980. Most people have some knowledge about the development of the A bomb and those who have Little or none, probably think it is a pretty dry topic. Anyone who has seen this 7 series does not feel that way. You will get to know the turmoil in Oppenheimer's mind, and how the evolution changed its life forever. You understand the tragic figure he was and why. With 7 episodes you get to know the big players and intrigue and backstabbing. I contacted PBS about the chance to get a video or DVD, but never received a reply. Too bad I would love to see it again.
