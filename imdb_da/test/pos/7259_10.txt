This movie has almost everything. The action is cool, it's fun, 2 great leading men and a really creepy villain that I really hated. Not many movies have bad villains. Only primarily cartoon villains. He really deserves a strong kick. <br /> <br /> Jake Scott really has his fathers talent to know how to make great visuals. The direction is flawless and has an irresistible light heart feel. I don't usually like movies in the old days, but I liked that because it makes a boring sad, as so many other feature films are (Sans and Sensibility, Age of Innocence and the absolute worst ... Lady and The Duke) . This will restore your faith. Thanx mostly to Craig Armstrong's amazing score. The music is both atmospheric and ethereal, and in scenes of action it is very exciting. The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and has a very grainy and muddy look 2.35: 1 anamorphic image.
