A review I've laid for too long .... <br /> Bluntly 2001 is one of the best science fiction movies made to date, if not the very best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius from a film producer, and this is one of his very best works. And while it is misunderstood by many and undervalued, it is considered to be one of the best movies all the time, and I have to agree. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has ever since. It was a wonder of a special effects breakthrough since then and how the effect stops today, it's no wonder why. The movie still looks wonderful after nearly forty years! Pay attention to CGI people. Through the use of large thumbnails and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever laid on celluloid. This aspect alone created almost one-sided space's atmospheric chilling voids, also attributed to music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another movie where you can't do anything in the room like it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is wisely used as a tool to create mood, and it seems perfect. <br /> <br /> Apart from the magnificent display of brilliant special effects, there are other factors that play a role in creating the feeling of the movie. The music played, all classic, compliments what the eyes look and makes you feel the importance of human travel through his evolution from monkey to space travelers. The story, while apparently simple, is deep. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integrated into the movie. What are they? Where did they come from? What are they doing? It is all questions you ask yourself while watching the story evolve and is asked to find its own way. While most come away with a general idea of ​​what happened in history, each one must decide what that means to them. In a way, you decide to answer these questions in deep solutions. It is not entirely up to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is completely chilling, regardless of your personal solution. <br /> <br /> Although it is a long movie and sometimes lowers, it must be in order to clarify the human journey. It's not a topic that would have faired well in a shorter movie, faster paced feature. Those with short attention span do not have to apply. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, the epitome of a relentless antagonist, HAL 9000, is the computer. Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. What reminds me of a movie with such a deep ambition and performance is surprisingly small dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius. All in all, one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction movies is made. A personal favorite. Everyone should watch this movie at least once. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
