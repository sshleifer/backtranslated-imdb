Compared to Battle of Britain, this is a real movie with real characters and a real plot. The Battle of Britain is basically a documentary with occasional Lawrence Olivier and Michael Caine, but the real protagonists are the tips, hurricanes, etc. On the other hand, you have two well-executed characters (actually three) and a real reason. I highly recommend it to anyone, even those who are not particularly fond of war movies. It's well filmed, and I wonder what the director can do if he had the big capitals behind him. And I don't think it is oversized. It is only in the warriors, you have real people, with real feelings and a real life - just as true as a fictional life in any big movie.
