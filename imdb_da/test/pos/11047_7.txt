Anna Christie (1930) <br /> <br /> Anna Christie has some amazing parts and some amazing performances and yet it should be even better than it is. It has drama. Some of the scenes are really atmospheric, and if the inside shots around the table are a bore, other shots at night and at sea are really pretty exciting. Then there are the almost historic, lively scenes in Coney Island (even a short jittery roller coaster) and the episode where two women stand behind a net in separate beds, and midway visitors can throw balls to try to tip them over and the women ( sharply dressed) the eggs men are weird, have sexually come in a way. All in all, Garbo (on the front of the audience) looks out. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garbo is what makes this movie more than just another very good early talkie. She plays all sides of her character. She is coy and skeptical and in a kind of inner anxiety. She laughs and cries, pulls and pushes outwards. In some ways, it is a forward-looking, remarkable movie (directed by Clarence Brown, which features a host of important films from this pre-code sound era). Although it is based on a successful Eugene O'Neil play, it is the writing that struggles a little as the actors seem to walk through the hallways at times. Marie Dressler is great in the exaggerated way she almost branded. And then there is Greta Garbo, who really has a natural presence, even though it seems like she is overcoming, just a little, at times (but then it is all others). Garbo is, of course, famous first as a quiet actress, and this is her talking film debut. The audience probably loved her that she made a German language version the following year.
