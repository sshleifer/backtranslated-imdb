I have great memories of watching this visually dazzling movie as a child in the late 70s / early 80s on wor-tv (now upn-9) in NY. Although a product from the swinging 60s, this film has hardly been aged. The effects are as strange as 2001, and in some ways superior (the model work is flawless). With an attractive cast, great color photography and set design, and an evocative score, JTTFSOTS is a winner!
