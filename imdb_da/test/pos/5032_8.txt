Michael is enough for cutesy for most action movie fans and for Hollywood for the intellectual crowd, but I found it both extremely fun and very touching, though it was both cutesy and formal. <br /> <br /> When three skeptics are sent to investigate a man claiming to be an angel, they end up escorting him on a grand tour of the western country side only to find out that it is each of their own hearts to be examined. <br /> <br /> When you take this movie apart, as with most movies today, there is not much new material, but when taken as a whole, it has a refreshingly original approach and is off-beat enough to entertain a whole. <br /> <br /> Although not a "family" movie, it is suitable for all ages and good movies to share with the whole family or person. "Michael" is not a good movie, but it is definitely a good movie, a moving movie, and it is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> KWC
