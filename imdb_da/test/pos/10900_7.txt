This is halfway to being a top film. The opening section, which spoof Hollywood movie with "social message", is absolutely brilliant. It's a rebellion from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The second section that introduces us to the protagonists of history is also really good. We get a lot of great comics, top notch performances, and the dialogue is really dynamic. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning!) However, one thinks that really annoyed me about this movie is the end that I think is contrary to everything that went before. My interpretation was that this movie took mickey out of all the stupid prejudices and induendo of toddlers and national tabloid sensationalism. I loved that the movie was the championing reason why a person's sexuality is NOT determined by their hobbies, idiosyncrasies, fashion sense or anything. And then the end goes and repeats all the gossip and stereotypes that the movie succeeded in the first place. It turns out that everyone was 100% right !!! (godamit!) This was very disappointing about what was actually a great story.
