Overall, I enjoyed the movie Scarlett. I'm a big fan of Gone with the Wind. I've read the book and seen the classic movie many times. I even have a small collection of Scarlett O'Hara ornaments and other stuff. I must admit that Gone with the Wind is my all-time favorite book and movie. Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable are remarkable actors and two of my favorites. Unfortunately I couldn't read the book Scarlett, but I was thrilled to see the movie. The truth is being told, the movie is not as close to the caliber of Gone with the Wind nor the actors. However, Joan Whalley Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were fun actors in the roles, and Joan sounded like Vivian Leigh in her depiction of Scarlett. Dalton also portrayed Rhett at times. It took a while to get used to the different actors, but in general I really enjoyed it as I am a fan of Gone with the Wind as I am. One major disappointment was that Joan did not have green eyes, and Scarlett O'Hara and Vivian Leigh both did. I also found Lord Fenton horrible and I didn't like his character. If you're away with the wind tab and / or enjoy romantic stories, see the movie Scarlett. But don't expect to be remarkable as Gone with the Wind. It's far from it, even though it's interesting with the new characters and so on. I'm glad it's not a remake, and some of the events in the story were what I imagined about the continuation of Scarlett O'Hara's and Rhett Butler's love story. If you haven't seen it today, get it tomorrow? After all tomorrow is another day. :)
