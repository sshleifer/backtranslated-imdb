The film of this film is set against the most horrible war in human history: The violent clash between Adolf Hitler's Germany and the Soviet Russia, from 1941 to 45. <br /> <br /> With the western areas of their country thoroughly destroyed and 20-30 million Russian people killed, vibes of this conflict can be felt in Russia until today. Once again in 1957, the memories were still very fresh and painful. This very black setting contrasts strongly with the fine and coherent style of 'Letjat zhuravli' beautiful shot. Its simple history deals with human behavior in wartime: courage, love, patriotism, weakness, cowardice and corruption. All beautifully tied together by a toy grain. <br /> <br /> Add to this the truly magnificent spectacle and it's easy to understand why this movie is so famous. Really, one of the very best ever made. <br /> <br />
