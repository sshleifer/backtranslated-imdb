SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> 15 PARK AVENUE: My humble take this movie <br /> <br /> Now, for a viewer of cinema who has taste as severely restricted as mine, niche movies like 15 Park Avenue should to be tasty for my senses. With this mindset and a mild sense of embarrassment that I hadn't seen the full movie before, I saw this movie on Saturday. There are some similarities with other works such as the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch), from which this film lends at least 3 concepts: - <br /> <br /> a) That (at least some) truths are relative b) The The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam, walking around in a car, as the opening credits roll, is uncommonly similar to the drive that Betty and Rita made in Mulholland Drive. In either case, the subject of investigation seems to be a place that is likely to be mythical in both cases and perhaps more obviously symbolic in the Aparna's film c) The incident about the mad beggar woman reminds extremely about the whole 'occurrence behind the Winkies' involves a bum, but while the scary creature is an embodiment of something and that it 'something' as well as the character per se is seamlessly associated with other Lynch works (note the confused long hair), the beggar woman's effect in 15 PA looks seems to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message <br /> <br /> The other movies, of which 15 PA also borrow, are Blow Up (especially the last scene is a throw back to truth Vs. perceived truth bags presented at the end of Antonioni masterpiece). Of course, the professor and schizophrenia angle also comes to the mind, "A beautiful mind". Though the subject here is high-rise physics and Shabana who fight it, ending up being the brilliant contradiction of the mad hallucinations of the Konona character through these very prophecies. In an excellent scene in the movie, some of these elements are in parallel with each other, and that scene cuts back and forth from the real world of Shabana, where Quantum Physics and Relativity Theory justify the ultimate and composite of the universe to the artificial building of Mithi 'make believe' The world But for all their differences, the sisters are the same. Both are unable to form long-term relationships - one chosen and the other out of nature. So, Mithi's pain of being rejected in love by Joydeep is in harmony with Shaban's inability to form a special bond with either Kunal (Dhritiman) or Sanjeev (Kanwalje). But I come before myself. Viewers generally tend to watch this movie in one of two ways: - <br /> <br /> The hypothesis 1: "It was Shabana all the time." There is a certain part of the audience who believes it. But that explanation is not only too far-fetched, but also confused, as it would mean that she also dreamed so many other characters (ie all the characters she visualized as visualizing Mithi with her). The hypothesis 2: "There was a real Mithi and the end is a metaphor" This POV says that the essence of the movie is summed up in a dialogue in the movie when it answers a statement of joy (Rahul Bose) that Mithi is looking for something where she will never find his wife Laxmi (Shefali Shah) philosophizing that we all actually look for the illusive utopia, the end of the rainbow, which seems to lie happiness and satisfaction <br /> <br /> There are others several smaller options that have not been carefully taken by our experienced audience as: - <br /> <br /> The hypothesis 3: "Shabana and Konkona are alter-egos of the same person" The hypothesis 4: "Shabana is also a figure of Mithi's Imagination "Hypothesis 5:" The old, haggard, perhaps sour, beggar woman is the real protagonist of history "<br /> <br /> Are these hypotheses worthy of being tested? Well, your guess is as good as mine <br /> <br /> "Why 15 Park Avenue?" Contrary to popular belief that she was thinking of Park Avenue in NY, I believe she got the name from a so-called semi-popular bath soap. Remember, she says Jo Jos's profession as "Prime Minister of Shikakai", which you might know is a popular ingredient used for shampoo manufacture. The prefix '15' is used as it was on December 15, that Mithi became engaged to Joydeep and after his expiration she remains forever in a time chain. The film has its fair share of shortcomings - lack of use of a strong background score, which in movies like these can really increase the narrative, some scary dialogues that have no kind of forced dialogue. Inconsistent performances (Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent though the IMO) of a few of the cast members, although many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted. Shefali Chaya's sudden insecurity about her husband seems to be an imaginatively introduced dimension in the plot. I give it 7/10 as it made me think, but no higher than that because I can easily grasp its sources of inspiration and have experienced (and mostly thoroughly enjoyed) the past, I have already thought of similar lines earlier . So the experience after 15 PA is bound to be a new level of news. Where do I come from? I gave 9.5 / 10 to '36 Chowringhee Lane '(although rumors still know that a Satyajit Ray ghost directed it), 7.5 to' Paromiter Ek Din ', 7 to' Mr and Mrs Iyer 'and 5 to 'Paroma'. At an existential level, it failed to invoke my interest, not even as much as saying a 'Truman Show'
