In spite of the apparent structural similarity to The Simpsons - high fathers father, housewife mum, 3 children, a pet, typically suburban home, Family Guy is actually functional and stylistically opposite of The Simpsons. Its eager use (and sometimes too much) of cutaway gags has been its primary residence since the first season. While some hit the nail upside down (The Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito bit in season 5 are spine-snapping hilarious), others are less successful who come across as constructed. And they can be annoying, especially when they don't shift history. (The Jesus bits are completely unfunny and insulting) The chemistry between Stewie and Brian Griffin lends itself to pure comedy gold, so much so that Chris and Meg can only fulfill the mandatory teenagers' role in your typical dysfunctional family. <br /> <br /> However, the feature film Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, MINDNUMBINGLY is horrible. Thank goodness it went straight to the DVD. In contrast to tired comparisons with the perennial Simpsons, Seth Macfarlane's approach to Family Guy is actually very different - it is much more politically incorrect and incredible, much more brazen. <br /> <br /> The creator of Ren and Stimpy, John Kricfalusi, criticized the famous Family Guy for having "extremely low" graphic standards from the comic book's point of view. I don't think it looks so bad, but the details and accuracy of some of the spoofs are quite successful. All in all, a huge series of great big bowl chips in ranch sauce and ass jokes.
