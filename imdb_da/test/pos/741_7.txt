Dr. Stephens (Michael Harvey), head of a seriously understaffed institute of the insane, takes a "progressive" approach to the treatment of his patients, even allowing the complete freedom of construction of his loonies day and night; However, he pays the price for his forward thinking, but when he rather prescribes that he carries wood with an ax as therapy for one of his patients, and thus gets his throat wrong to a log (serves him right not to suggest curve weaving ). /> <br /> Shortly after this tragic event, the nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives in the hospital to take a position as a medical assistant and discovers that the plant is now run by the very stern Dr. Geraldine Masters Annabelle Weenick). Despite not knowing that her late predecessor has decided to hire Ms Beale and not particularly eager to take on new staff, Dr. Masters stepped in to let the beautiful nurse start working, but after several terrible experiences in the hospital, Charlotte began to wonder if it could have been better if she had turned away. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take a genius to figure out what actually happens in the hospital, 'lunatics have taken over asyl''schtick is a prerequisite It should be known to most spicy horror fans, but SF Brownrigg does not look in the basement still proves to be an entertaining piece of drive-in fun thanks to its well-defined collection of nutters: lobotomised, popsicle-sucking Sam (Bill McGhee); Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross), who mumbles courtroom regularly; old Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) who recites William Allingham's creepy poet The Fairies and warns Charlotte about the impending death cackling wage Danny (Jessie Kirby), who is delighted to torment the other patients; Harriet (Camilla Carr), who thinks her doll is a real baby; army meeting Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin); and best of all, Allyson King (Betty Chandler) whose rejection of a number of men has left her with a need for love (ie she is trying to jump over someone approaching her). <br /> <br /> This compelling crazy set of characters, plus a bit of gore and nudity, reasonable guidance from Brownrigg (who also gave us the impressive white trash game Scum of the Earth) and a solid ride from Playboy covergirl Holotik, goes Everyone to turn an otherwise pretty predictable, low budget exploitation into a very attentive psychocologist.
