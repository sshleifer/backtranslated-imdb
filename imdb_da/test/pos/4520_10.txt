I was recently fortunate enough to see "The Kite Runner" in a small theater, surrounded by spicy films that knew how to enjoy a masterpiece of such sophistication. With all the controversy surrounding this film's central scene these days, I was expecting a piece both raw and violent. But the way Mr. Forster dealt with the sensitive issue, was touching and really, profound. Though the film's credits indicated China as the greatest location for the slider, I could have sworn that I saw Kabul through the scenes that were to take place in Afghanistan. The action, by non-professionals as well as professional actors, is excellent and the molding is magnificent. So it's a movie I want to see over and over again, because although it is unthinkable in its subject, the masterful way it has been awakened is a whole new hope in modern cinema.
