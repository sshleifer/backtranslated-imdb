I saw this again after not seeing it since it first came out (in '97) and it still made me laugh a lot. It's cleverly written, Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are both perfect in their roles, and if you look at Bob Newhart in this movie and not chuckle, you're more of a man than me. <br /> <br /> For that means that the scenes where Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline, where Kevin Kline listens to the "How to be a Man" cartridge, and (almost) wedding scenes with Joan Cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any movie. <br /> <br /> Surely, the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending, but ... few movies are perfect.
