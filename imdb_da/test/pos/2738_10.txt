Under the short golden age of Super 8 Magnetic Sound Home Movies, we purchased a $ 148.00 GAF projector near a Downtown Chicago Camera Store. It seemed that the GAF came out of the camera and projector business; although they would continue with their other companies, such as the former Sawyer's Vue-Master 3 Dimensional color slide viewers. <br /> <br /> Little did we not know or predict the quick access to the camcorder, Betamax, VHS and any DVD rpm. With the Super 8 Magnetic Audio Camera, which we also purchased, we took some sound recordings such as our daughter, Jenn's first sacred communion and her younger sister, Michael's preschool graduation. This was all around 1979-82. <br /> <br /> During this time, we also bought a couple of Daddy Toys to go with it; as some Super 8 magnetic sound LAUREL & HARDY Films and W.C. FIELDS 'Shorts from Blackhawk Films, Davenport, Iowa. We also downloaded a Columbia Pictures Home Movies audio movie of some sort of forgotten classic comic book, UPA's Gerald McBOING-BOING (United Productions of America / Columbia, 1951). It was a hit for our Home Movies Time! <br /> <br /> Being members of the Baby Boomer Generation, wife (Deanna) and Meself were reminiscent of the character of Gerald McBoing-Boing; for Gerald had a network TV show at CBS, early Sunday evenings, approx. 1955. Bill Goodwin was the advertiser / host. But we had never seen this original UPA Theatrical Cartoon; Nor was it known to us that the young master McBoing-Boing was a creation of Dr. Seuss of "Grinch", "Horton" and "Mulberry Street" fame. <br /> <br /> The overall staff was very talented and deep. The excellent production values ​​are clear. Director Robert Cannon and Supervisory Director John Hubley were veterans at the top of their craft. Authors were Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss, Self), Phil Eastman and Bill Scott. <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott is not so much remembered for his written contribution to the UPA, but to be partners with Jay Ward in such Television Properties as ROCKY & BULLWINKLE, MR. PEABODY, FRACTURED FLICKERS, JUNGLE GEORGE, HOPPITY HOOPER and FRACTURED FLICKERS. With Jay Ward Productions, he was a writer, voter and Kibitzer-General for the entire company. The comic receives its only "voice" from the narrator, radio / film / television actor Marvin Miller. Remember him? He was Michael Anthony on TV Ssries THE MILLIONAIRE (Don Fedderson Productions / CBS Television Network, 1955-60). <br /> <br /> The cool color schematic and imaginative design was to give the UPA animations a special sense of loneliness, fear of anxiety and any victory. And we can add, the animation is definitely the "Limited" Variety. <br /> <br /> As with so many good stories, ours starts out with a simple premise; you are born differently. In this case, the young boy Gerald McCloy has been born to make sound effects in communicating rather than speaking. The kids can be cruel and soon he is called with his not so flattering nickname by a group of youthful depictions: "New, new, your name is not McCloy, it's Gerald McBoing-Boing, Noise Making Boy!" At this point, the animation team is doing an excellent job of shifting the emotional gears of the young excluded from cheerful and carefree to isolated and lonely and finally to depression and despair by not turning to anyone for help and understanding; not even to his mother and father. <br /> <br /> A scary old-fashioned dark scene involving a heavily UPA styled lane with a train and an equally stylized snowfall gives Gerald the right edge of absolute despair. But then he is interrupted by a gentleman announcing that young Gerald is wanted by the producer of some radio program to give the sound to the show down in the studio. <br /> <br /> It's the premier show done with Gerald starring in the Sound Department, he rides in a huge limousine (which seems to have expected these Stretch Limos of our day) to cheers and admiration of his classmates and the world. <br /> <br /> It has been said that there are only so many plots, and in that case this story is probably a variation on The Ugly Duckling; for after all, a sad and lonely boy finds his place in the world and true happiness. NOTE: United Productions of America or UPA for short was an excellent creativity center in the field. Animated cartoon. They were not only responsible for GERALD McBOING-BOING and several successors and a TV series, but also the very popular MR. MAGOO theatrical cartoon and subsequent television show (with talents from Jim Backus), Classic Original TV cartoon by FROSTY THE SNOWMAN and the rather bizarre DICK TRACY Cartoon Show (with Tracy's voice made by Mr. Everett Sloane!).
