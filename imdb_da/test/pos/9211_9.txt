Get right into the viewer for the first time recently - the 2-hour "kidnapping" program. Don't know why I'm not sooner? James Caan is unique and completely credible in the role of the top honcho on the selected 5 * Vegas complex. So often, programs like this one or more in the ensemble, which are either rather annoying, or seem to have been picked because they must be related to the manufacturer or director. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not the case with this program. Along with Caan, all the primary and supportive cast are engagingly attractive and trustworthy. Guest actors are well-chosen. <br /> <br /> The stories I've seen are interesting, and the show also gives a good view of the city. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining program and I hope will remain. I do not know how I managed to miss it for so long, but plan to TIVO it from now on.
