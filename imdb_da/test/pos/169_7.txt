This movie is amazing. 80 injured slasher films about three children born during an eclipse, so they kill all they see. The reason they kill makes it hardly sensible, but it just adds to the charm of this movie. And dang, these kids are crazy, especially Curtis. If you've seen the movie, you know who I'm talking about. That child is vicous! Although the film doesn't have much to do, it's entertaining, and for some reason you're very worried about the characters. It also has some good nudity. Have some decent actions too, really a decent 80's slasher movie, it's worth seeing if you ever get the chance to see it. You have nightmares about the darn kids themselves, I guarantee you!
