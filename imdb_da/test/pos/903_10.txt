This is a well-documented action movie. There are lots of fighting scenes, the action is convincing (for this genre) and RS1 is great. I don't know why people feel compelled to scrape RS1, I thought his effects were done very nicely, and his design looked good. The reason was acceptable for a martial arts movie. <br /> <br /> That being said, I must tell you Richard Sun is one of the worst actors from Hong Kong I have ever seen. At least RS1 had the right idea by killing him. Now, for all of you who thought Sam Lee (Alien) was a bad actor ... he wasn't supposed to be taken seriously! I just had the pleasure of seeing Gen-X Cops (prequel) and Sam Lee played the same characters the same way! <br /> <br /> Now, please, all of you who are highly regarded Oscar winners: DO NOT JUDGE THIS IS A THANK YOU FILM! IT IS NOT THE COMMITMENT TO REQUIRE IT! Just meant to be enjoyed, that's all. I hope they do another soon.
