High school. Years and decades later, some look back on love, others with embarrassment. But few find it easy to forget. It is one of the most critical stages of our lives when changes come quickly and furiously, whether we are ready or not. No longer children, not adults, irresistible forces buffet us, push and pull us in all directions. <br /> <br /> "Fame" did its best to capture this turbulent, chaotic period for its draft of young characters. For the most part, it succeeded. It hurled, but felt like a piece of life. This film has a special place in the heart of the '80 class. We had a goodbye for a decade and soon to the end of three or four stimulating and sometimes difficult school years. We were led out into the cold, cruel world that left home for the college when sharing unknown. As we approached our waterfront event, this newly released movie was a two-hour yearbook for us. We couldn't escape the titular song on the radio. It was us up there on the screen. It was our friends, rivals, and classmates when we had confronted our own dreams, frustrations, successes, and failures. It is particularly attractive to those who attended New York City's other elite, top-level high schools, especially Stuyvesant, the Bronx HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech. Like the kids here, we were considered the best of the best. We had no auditions, but instead had strict access exams. Perhaps even more than the Performing Arts kids, we were expected to change the world, even though they were not necessarily famous. Like them, not all of us did. But the press cooker environment promotes extraordinary companionship and esprit de corps, not in contrast to the toe-tapping "Hot Lunch Jam" in the cafeteria. On our own departure day, our spirits rose almost like the jubilant crescendo in the rousing final. The film appropriately leaves us on a single triumphant note at the end of "I sing Body Electric," pointing to the dazzling bright, boundless future and all that promise it kept. <br /> <br /> "Fame" I couldn't have been tuned elsewhere. This story would never have worked in a small or suburban school. Los Angeles has a stronger movie and television identification, but NYC is a mecca for all art. Home not only to what was called PA, but also to the world-famous Juilliard, NYC is a cultural center that doesn't suit any other city in the world. It is also a time capsule of the rest of the city's time, showing fertility, grin and dirt that were endemic to a New York, still struggling back from the fiscal crisis that had almost bankrupted it. But most of all, it showed vitality as it was dampened by the influences of Giuliani, Disney and tourism. What I wouldn't give to be young again. But with "Fame" I can at least remember how it was.
