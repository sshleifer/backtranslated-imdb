Considering Mick Moly's scary track record since he left alone, I had pretty low expectations for Crackerjack. Even the advertising posters for the movie had me nervous. In fact, if it were not for the fact that I had received free tickets for the previve, I would have resisted the pressure of the missus (who thinks Mick is a hunk - there is a concern) to pay for it. /> <br /> The first few minutes of the movie had worried me - it starts with one of Mick's tire "getting angry at insignificant things" routines, but it got a nice touch that at least made it a little refreshing . The rest of the manuscript was pretty good and very light hearted - though the typical Mick Molloy (and Judith Lucy) humor was well delivered, and while I never had to pick me up from the hallways, it generated many more chuckles as I was expecting (and it was consistent). There's nothing new in the plot - pretty predictable, but it quickly moved between one-liners and other jokes - I've never felt it on any element for a long time or too short; Mick must have worked hard to polish his script. There were one or two "Late Shows" in jokes and one or two jokes that only Melbournians would get - but surely there are plenty of generic things in there for a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Something I found disappointing was John Clark's relative inevitability - he just didn't seem to act as the bad guy, but it didn't spoil the movie too much. All in all, I enjoyed this Australia comedy and was pleasantly entertained in the film's duration. I left the cinema with a decent size laugh - a pretty tough thing for an Australian comedy to do in my books. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br />
