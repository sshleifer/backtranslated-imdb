I am from Germany, so please excuse my writing. As I have seen Chucky 4 for the first time, I was a little surprised I knew Chucky as a usual 80's scarymovie, but the Bride of Chucky was very different from the old ones. First, there is the illustration of the very good director Ronny Yu, which we still have in mind from a Chinese ghost story. His visual style is firmly comparable to Francis Ford Coppola. Also the voices of Chucky a Tiff are very impressive. I have also seen a lot on the stage play, especially the scene in which Tiff casts Champaignbottle in ceiling mirrors. I give it a 9.0 vote for fun, gory and progressive entertainment. If you have comments on my opinion, just send me an email. MFG Schawez
