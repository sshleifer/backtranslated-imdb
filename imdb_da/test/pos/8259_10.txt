Superbly adapted to the screen and extremely faithful to Mary Webb's novel, this film is a true masterpiece. Apart from the exceptionally talented rising star, Janet Mcteer as the leading and one or two established actors, the film used mostly little known names. Still, the drama was more convincing for it. The social and personal tension is almost tangible, and I felt as if the cast reacted to each other's character as if they would have done in real life. I saw that a commentator asked if Janet McTeer really had a hare-lip, a testimony to how good her character was. I saw this on TV, when it first appeared, lost it, then the tape was lost. But it is clear as something in my mind. If you have any pleasure at all in the social period, it is imperative to see.
