I feel privileged to have seen this movie by accident. I actually ran over this movie by accident. I lost another movie on Showtime one night, overnight, and this movie came on afterwards. So I sat watching it and I was blown into the boy. The action is amazing. Kathy Bates ... who has been my favorite actress since misery and fried green tomatoes gave a great performance as a dominant mother trying desperately to hold on to her old school values ​​(religion, family) at risk of alienating her family. Martin Sheen is great as the "hard" patriarch who really has no control over anything in his life or family. The only thing I really loved about this movie is how it tells what happens when the hero comes home. It shows the true damage done to our soldiers after they fight for meaningless wars for political and economic gain. This movie just blew me away and I feel blessed to have accidentally lost this movie and seen it. This is a must-see for anyone who wants a true drama, this is not too melodramatic and predictive, but draws in your heartbeat like no other
