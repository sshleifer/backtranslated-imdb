This is a good movie with good performances by Paz Vega and Leonardo Sbaraglia. Of course, Vicente Aranda is a legend in Spanish cinema and certainly one of the great instructors in Spanish cinema, but I don't think it's one of his greatest movies, even though it's fine. The manuscript plays with the introduction of Merime√© as a sign, it is a good touch, but it is incredible. The music is composed by Jose Nieto, the National Spanish Prize in Cinema. I think this movie is very good in all the technical aspects. There are very good actors in supporting roles like Antonio Dechent, Maria Botto and others. I give it 7 out of 10 because I think it could be a better movie, but as it is, it is not boring at all.
