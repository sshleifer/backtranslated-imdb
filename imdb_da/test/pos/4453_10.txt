Cult director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his 1980's gory Zombie flicks, which gave him his rightful reputation as "Godfather Of Gore". Fulci's biggest movie, however, dates back to 1972, and even though it's quite cruel and fierce, it's not nearly as ugly as many of his other films. "Don't Si Sevizia Un Paperino" aka. "Not a torture a duck" in 1972 is not only far-fetched by Fulcis, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre. The great atmosphere and thrilling excitement, the great Sizilian setting, the exciting history of the brilliant performances or the intense moments of sheer shock - I don't know what to praise most about this brilliant Giallo! "Don't Torture a Duck" truly delivers film perfection in every aspect, making it an absolute masterpiece of Italian Horror cinema. Unlike other Gialli, it is not seductive beauty woman who is beaten one by one but small boys who fall victim to a killer on it loose. Organs of small boys are found in rural Sicily. While the police are desperately searching for the killer, the little town is almost full of strange people, and the city's people are screaming for a guilty ... The movie is amazingly exciting and uncompromising from the beginning, with a gritty, dark and constantly tense atmosphere yet have not found a straight. The acting performances are among the best in Italian Horror cinema. Tomas Milian (one of my personal all-time favorite actors) is excellent at the forefront, as journalist Andrea Martinelli, who investigates the crimes. Sexy Barbara Bouchet delivers both eye-candy and a brilliant performance. Straightforward performances come from Irene Papas and Florinda Bolkan, who are absolutely brilliant in their role. Riz Ortolani's amazing score intensifies the excitement and atmosphere intensively, and the film is brilliantly shot in fascinating Sicilian landscapes. Though not as ugly as many other Fulci movies, this movie is absolutely cruel and uncompromising in its violence with a few shockingly brutal scenes. "Don't Torture a Duck" has everything brilliant Horror requires. It's not as easy to get hold of as most other Fulci flicks, but I assure you that search will pay off. Any horror fan should see this personal favorite of mine and I highly recommend any genuine lover of movies generally not to miss this one. A masterpiece!
