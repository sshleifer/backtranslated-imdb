Much more than any other movie from that period, Night of the Demons represents the brainless and hugely enjoyable horror pastiche. It is undemanding fun with lots of unpleasant make-up effects, beautiful-looking (and horny) teens and cute clich√© elements. A group of celebrities, led by the alternate Angela, goes to celebrate Halloween in an abandoned funeral home that carries a creepy legend. It all begins to be typical and "innocent" with dancing, drinking and occasionally flirting between young people who cannot control their hormones, but soon have a bloodthirsty demon hostess. In the most ingenious ways you've ever seen, the rest of the cast is slaughtered only maliciously to return as scared creatures trying blood. What makes this movie better than most cheesy 80's horror films is a good balance between light fixture and atmospheric horror. Some sequences are really scary, and the funeral home sets the Night of the Demons supply with an excellent tone. Director Tenney makes great use of the set pieces (chests, a crematorium, endless dark times ??) and of course his young enthusiast cast love on what they are involved in. Of course, the amazing makeup effects of a whole team of artists and designers are obvious aspects to love and horror fanatics will absolutely love the vast amount of cut limbs, poked out the eyes and crushed skulls! However, the ultimate highlight is Linnea Quigley's trick with the disappearing lipstick! This nymphomaniac bimbo pushes a whole tube of lipstick into her nipple and continues her sexual murder spree! Terrific! Demon's night received two successors during the 1990s, and while still definitely worth checking out, they focus more on comedy than chills.
