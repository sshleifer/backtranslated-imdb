While Hayao Miyazaki's films have always been hit or miss with me about the story, they are incredibly beautiful to the eye, with signs of simple animation against a visual art of artistic images. Ponyo stick to the formula, with a protagonist, so sweet, I want a plush doll of her and landscape so beautiful that it does not look in place framed as a picture on a wall. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I haven't had as much as his last two broad releases, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. It was just a little bit for the youth who came across as more for kids and left adults just to enjoy the animation. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed that the score made by Joe Hisaishi, who also scored the above-defined two films, was not nearly as memorable this time. Although I can't quite remember Howl's score now, I still remember it's one of the most beautiful I've ever heard. Ditto Spirited is - although I only remember it was very complementary to the movie. Perhaps it is because Ponyo is more youth ticket price, that the score is not quite so joking. In any case, this movie is still a must-watch for fans of anime or Miyazaki.
