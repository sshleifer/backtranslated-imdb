"A chance to remember" is a completely derived, almost ridiculous movie, but has a warmth about what makes it a very effective and optimistic holiday movie. It's a beautiful newcomer, Challen Kates, as a strong ad executive, who, just before her wedding, must rush from L.A. to Seattle to hold a client who has declined every other presentation. She has transport difficulties from the beginning and apparently no money. This is the first stupid thing - were there no ATMs anywhere? She must make a fortune. In any case, she meets a taxi driver (Warner) who looks like a homeless man, and he drives her to her presentation, and when she comes up with a huge box of beef freaks (customer's product), he is there to take her to the airport. . All flights are canceled, so to come to L.A. for her wedding she hires him to take her there. <br /> <br /> Along the way, they bind and learn from each other. It's a very cute movie, even though there's nothing new in it - it combines "Six Days and Seven Nights" and a few other movies. But the love between the stars is good they like, and the play is good. Look for Jerry Springer as head of the beef church and a como of Karl Malden. <br /> <br /> It is a good movie to go into the holiday season. It is on a lifetime.
