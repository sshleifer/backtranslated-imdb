Inferno gives Los Angeles what it deserves - a baptism in fire, death from above. An excellent cast of obsessive characters could survive and sweat out of the passage of the coronal mass ejection, but it would not be fun and certainly not dramatic. A real lame review in Variety criticized the characters for being concerned about their personal redemption instead of banning together to save the world. But what is refreshing about this great heat is that there is nothing anyone can do about it. We are, therefore, mercifully not exposed to "heart warming" scenes of fascist presidents and other great blowhard extras as they strive for unimaginable plots to save a selected remnant of humanity (ala Deep Impact). Here, the sweat performs drained and lustful, fifty thousand their own redemption, or faces their personal oblivion the old fashioned way - together as individuals or ..... alone with alone. Excellent TV movies all in all. Clearly not denatured by the devastating meddlesomness of the overzealous Network Execs. I highly recommend.
