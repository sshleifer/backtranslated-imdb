I was in school at the end of the 60's and early 70's, and this film is very much how my school was. The school game where the leading actors kiss that happened at my school. A crazy goose boys, my school again only when we went on a cross country skiing, we would have a smoke! "The shed", someone in my school broke in through a heavenly light and broke the sugars! after they were kept in a safe place !!! And as for some nocternal activities! what can i say .... the movie actually came out in 1982, i remember it as it was when i bought my house and the movie showed at the same time. If you like British movies and movies about school, grow up and period pieces, then that's for you. Another movie that looks very much like "SWALK" came out a few years before, and I for one would like to see it again, also 'Kes' is in the genre. Highly recommended. (But believe me, 1982 is when it came out)
