"Cure" is a very touching and exciting drama. The film focuses on two neighborhood boys who become good friends. One of the boys has AIDS. The boys become good friends despite Erik's apprehensiveness first. The film shows the boys' journey to discover "cure" which is in Ohio according to "The National Examiner" and how it affects their relationship. The action is wonderful (I've never seen Annabella Sciorra do better) and the movie is just touching. I couldn't stop crying with the shoe scene. This is a good tower chopper. Keep the kleenex nearby. 8.10
