How many of us have read a book or seen a game and so when the movie version came out, we were terribly disappointed? Well, maybe it would be one of those movies for those who saw the game too, but as a person who never had the opportunity to see it on stage, I was very much entertained by this movie. The characters were funny, the music was great, and the story was interesting and made you feel real empathy for the characters, mistakes, and all. Jonathan Silverman has such good comic timing, and his lines are especially hilarious. I'm not going to give any spoilers, it's just a nicely finished, fun movie showing the inner effects of a middle-class family during World War II. So if you never saw the game, and if you've enjoyed other Neil Simon movies, don't hold back the few negative reviews seen here. In itself, Brighton Beach Memoirs is a great movie. I guarantee it (no money back though).
