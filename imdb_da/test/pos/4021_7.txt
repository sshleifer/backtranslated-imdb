Of the two Slaughter films, this is better, and although it is hardly a Schindler's complexity list, it's bloody fun. All men are the goodies or the evils, and the women are just Hoses and emotionally needy, such as Slaughterers Girl. It's also bloody fun and The Pro has to be the funniest movie pimp all the time, you just can't get enough of the hats, purple suits, gold chains and jive patois forever. The best bit is where he has Harem around him, "YOU BIT EXCEPT". Everything about him is bigger than life, and it is reminescent of Morris Day in Purple Rain. Jim Brown also shows that he is a private cock to all the chickens, and again he kicks whitish ass in every direction. The car scene is very unrealistic that they survive the unharmed, but hey it's the movies. Absolutely the finest blax flick and it surpasses Shaft (1971). Even the first movie is pretty good.
