'Nemesis' was the last book to contain Miss Marple written by Agatha Christie (the official final case 'Sleeping Murder' was written in the eighties) and I have always had a very soft place for it. I loved the characters and they are lovingly brought to life in this excellent BBC adaptation with Joan Hickson, amazing as always as Miss Marple. On the whole it is very faith in the book. A few characters have been dropped, the first (new) murder is slightly different, and a few new characters are introduced. Personally, I felt that Lionel Peels added character was unnecessary and quite annoying. The tour guide Madge was annoying in a different way but often quite entertaining. This is largely due to Lionel that I do not award 10 out of 10! The other characters are beautifully done especially by Helen Cherry as a worthy temple of temples and all three strange sisters, but especially Margaret Tyzack, who gives a tougher performance as Clothilde. She threatens to go over the top towards the end, but just avoids it. The female bodyguards are also good, and the episode contains one of my favorite Hickson lines ... 'An Archdeacon?!' <br /> <br /> This is another relatively early BBC Marple that looks wonderful and has a brilliant nostalgic feel to it. Highly recommended.
