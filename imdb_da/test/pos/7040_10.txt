Meatballs are a classic comedy with so many laughs that it is impossible to count. <br /> <br /> In what was just a precursor to what was to come, Murray reckons the screen of what can only be described as comic championship. Tripper Harrison is one of the greatest comedy characters in the last 50 years. Sarcastic all the time, smart when he needs to be, strict when he needs to be, and watch out for him, Murray infect Tripper with the SNL glint in the eye. <br /> <br /> The CITs are only in awe as they crash under the comic genius that is Mr. Murray. Summer is not summer without showing meatballs. One of the best comedies to enjoy on the screen.
