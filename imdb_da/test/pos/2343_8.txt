Must agree that this film and the talented director do not receive the rewards they deserve. Here we hope the DVD will work very well and bring both to a wider audience's attention. The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. Perhaps in general, the film is a bit long, but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy his actors when they give strong performances and therefore hold them sometimes closer than necessary. Good for the actors I'm sure, but sometimes as an audience you are ready to move so to speak with the plot. Must Miles Thomas deserve more recognition from the film industry as one of our prominent digital film directors,
