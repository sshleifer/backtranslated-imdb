Thirty years before THE DEER HUNTER came this movie, an excellent meditation on the effects of war inflicted on the American family, seen from both the war heroes and their wives. A truly ironic title, the best years of our lives are anything but since those times have disappeared in stills and everything left is an uncertain future for those involved. A real ensemble thrown in spite of the top-billing of Myrna Loy, the best years of our lives focus more on men's stories. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns to a house that is irreversibly changed when his sons have grown, though he finds support from his doting wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Fred Derry cannot find a decent job on return, despite being a war veteran and caught in a marriage that he does not want Marie, a happily fortunate girl who wants more out of life and who is increasingly coming to hate him. Homer Parrish, on the other hand, has greater problems because of his loss of hands at war and feels the whole world - including the girl he loves and her family - thinks he is a freak of nature. <br /> <br /> In almost three hours, the film never works long and pulled out. There are so many emotions happening even in small moments that the plot is booming; Nothing seems to be wasted or put on the screen due to lack of editing. Not a performance call wrong, though standouts are those of Dana Andrews such as Fred Derry, Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry. Nevertheless, each figure has its momentum on film, and time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that so far had not been seen in American films (including those made around World War I that did not double in such topics). Although there is never any obvious violence, everyone in the ghostly expressions of the three male leaders faces in the party where the aircraft are now, ready to be transformed into unwanted (and therefore forgetfulness) into cynicism by the shop owners could not be bothered to hire these shell-shocked men who had seen battle or worse, to make them wonder what it was worth. This is the movie where KOMING HOME and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY are guilty. At a time when America fled war movies, to come up with this, as the end of World War II was still fresh, it was a necessity to make a more honest film production.
