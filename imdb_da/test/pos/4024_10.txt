Barbora Bobulova's depiction of Valeria in this story was quite captivating and heartbreaking at the same time. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden passion and mystery presented by any actor simply by exploiting her facial features and the use of the eyes and mouth that Barbora does with this character. She was completely credible as Valeria and I was swept away with her characterization of this role. Still, the movie was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound. I was forced to read between the lines, and each of the key players took advantage of the body language art and emotional intent to convey a strong line of history. Barbora was especially visually stimulating in an almost asexual way and at the same time in a sexy way. This comment can easily relate to each of the many feelings conveyed by her performance. Understated in the form of dialogue but powerful in terms of presence. I have been caught by this actress's delivery and will eagerly seek much more from her work.
