Pink Flamingos is a movie no words can explain. It was as good as I thought. It expands movies. Beginning with a "more" beginning and ending with a shocking but smart ending, Pink Flamingos is one of the best films of the year. Don't miss this opportunity to watch a good movie. Rent it on video or watch it on a late midnight as I did. But just watch it.
