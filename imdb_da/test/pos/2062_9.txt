I hadn't planned to leave a review, but when I saw some of the other terrible reviews for this movie, I had to say something. I'm not going to give up the end or anything, but I give away some important plot points in this review so you should be aware of it. The short (non-spoiler) version of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis both kick butt in this movie and it's very fun. See it. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites all the time. Geena Davis is perfect as the heroine of action, torn between her existing life as a housewife and mother, and the memories that recharge her past life as a CIA Assassin. Her performance is great as she plays both facets of this relatively complex character perfectly. <br /> <br /> As always, Samuel L. Jackson's performance is excellent as the private investigator Geena Davis's character employed to investigate her forgotten past. He does a good job of playing the ignorant sidekick of Geena Davis' tough character. Some of the lines he publishes in this movie are the best he has ever used in any movie he has been in. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you haven't seen it, do it. It is a great story with many unexpected twists and turns, and it is extremely well-tended and acted.
