I heard that after the first Ocean movie, the sequel begins to go downhill. I think this is not the case (at least not for this movie). This movie is even better than the first movie! The original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed Terry Benedict's casinos. Now Benedict visits each one of them personally and tells them to get the money back within two weeks. To do this, they have to make a few hoists in Europe to get the money. The play is very good. The all-star cast exceeded expectations. Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones were probably the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some confusing moments in this movie. But that doesn't matter because there are only a few confusing moments. Anyway, this movie is only made for harmless fun. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a fantastic movie. I rate this movie 9/10.
