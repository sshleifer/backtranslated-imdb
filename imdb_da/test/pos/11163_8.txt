Currently playing at the 2007 German Film Festival in Australia http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/ff07/enindex.htm thanks to Peanutqueen and especially AriesGemini for her rundown on the actors in this ensemble cast. <br /> <br /> In Australia, these films were subtitled in English and while French films here often receive a mainstream release, German movies are still gathering that kind of commercial audience. But like BMW and Mercedes, when Germans get it right, I really like their movie. Like PQ, the time went so fast, many laughing from the audience, as each of the 9 men and 9 women moved the speed destination 5 minutes at a time. While many movies overlap this one I could have seen much more of. It had kind of character and character development to a series. Given the time, I will re-read the AriesGemini100 review and refer to the actors I liked and their other work in order to keep an eye on them. I agree .... Most of these players will go into bigger and better things. Some very good character players in this fine movie. I saw it in the program listed as a mockumentary. Mock or otherwise it felt very real. And quite romantic that way. <br /> <br /> Viva la Deutcsh!
