Cute Movie Feel Good Movie I had never heard of this movie but ran over it while I was looking for something to rent. I had great hopes for this movie based solely on Flex in this movie. I have never seen him in anything that is not worth it. True enough to form this movie delivered to me. I enjoyed the story. The film is full of amazing actors and actresses. The funny Tasha Smith, Essence Atkins and of course Tangi Miller. I really liked this movie. I didn't give it five stars because it didn't discuss some issues that I thought the movie should have detailed. The problem was apparently resolved, but I would have appreciated a discussion on solving the problems. I liked the movie so much that I now buy the movie after I have already rented and seen it.
