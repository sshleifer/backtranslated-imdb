I gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10. It had an excellent plot, and Peter Coyote and Michele Lee, as well as the rest of the casting, did their share well. <br /> <br /> Both Peter and Michele were too long in the teeth for the ages that their characters were supposed to be, and their children in the movie had obviously been better suited to their grandchildren. I missed the first ten minutes of this movie, so I don't know how this body came up after 25 years and was traced back to Denny Traynor (Peter Coyote's character), but I had no trouble retrieving the story. <br /> <br /> Barbara Traynor (Michele Lee) is stunned when her long-term husband, Denny is arrested for a murder in Oregon about 25 years earlier, claims a state that Denny was never in. But as evidence, Denny, his story changes. Then his story changes over and over until Barbara doesn't know what to believe. Barbara, however, made her come to the bottom of the mystery whirling around the fateful time Denny and a young girl named Sherry accepted a trip from a stranger named Wayne Kennedy who ended up with murder. <br /> <br /> I found the movie entertaining, well paced, and it kept me guessing what really happened between them three people. From what I saw during closing credits, this seemed to be based on a true story.
