Very reliable entertainment that Las Vegas amuses as well as intrigue, very light hearted and greatly enhanced by Josh Duhanel !! I like this TV show and I think many people see it as a form of escapist voyeurism ... Voyeurism in this case is very positive and many women in this series are very nice to look at .. This show incorporates Las Vegas legends as Wayne Newton as intermittent characters to authenticate the Las Vegas genre !! There have been plentiful depictions of the city of sin, this is one of the better efforts ... The producers and directors are fortunate to have James Caan in the show as he is a very perfect actress !!! Basically I like the TV show Las Vegas and I see it on Fridays, I also saw it on Monday, but with Monday night football I could see why NBC switched it to Fridays ... Nevertheless, I like Las Vegas a lot !!
