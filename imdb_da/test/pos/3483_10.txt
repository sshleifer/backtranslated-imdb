Michael (played by Steven Robertson) has cerebral palsy and lives a quiet and dull life in the Carrigmore Residential Home. When a newcomer to the home, Rory (McAvoy), turns to him, he continues to show Michael how to live past the disability. Despite, or perhaps due to, Rory's damnable disability (unable to move everything with his head and a few digits on his hand), Rory is highly independent and extremely rebellious. His influence on quiet and reserve Michael is spectacular, and the two soon leave the nursing home to create life in the outside world, recruiting help from Siobhan (Romola Garai) as a care assistant. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the gems of the year! Much like last year in America, the movie goes from being extremely fun, disturbing, touching, disturbing and really moving without even seemingly saccharin sweet. Knowing exactly where to pull on the heartbeat and where you can just let the story and the characters do their thing, O'Donnell has made a wonderful movie that tells us all to look past the surface and see what lies inside. /> <br /> The film's true strengths come in leading players. So convincing is their sign that you really believe they are disabled. To further communicate humor and grief over the already great performances is amazing. The couple seem really close friends, and as their story unfolds, they completely break for them. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the finest examples of movies this year and tells a very relevant story in a simple way. If this movie does not touch your heart, you must contain pure ice inside.
