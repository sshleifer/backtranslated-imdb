One night at McCool is a very fun movie that is more intelligent than it should be. Its shape is more sophisticated than what I had expected, and its coincidence was excellent. The thoughts behind the movie (mysogeny, sadism, stupid men) are infantile. That's what I have to say about this movie that it not only hates women, but it mocks men. It has no sympathy for any of the men, really. It looks like this because of the form, but the end says it all. No one cares. <br /> <br /> The form has the first 2/3 of the movie told in flashback with three characters: Dillon, the stupid bartender; Traveling, the mysogenic stupid lawyer; And Goodman, the stupid, rather than you cop. The story is therefore always perverted by their own self-image and changed realities. Travel's BBQ fantasy is a good touch. In the end, we never know the truth, and nothing is what it seems. Dillon was never so innocent, etc. In fact, the rest of the movie is fun too. From the coincidence of the last 5 seconds of the movie to too overtly of Tyler's manipulations, the film looks to have an energy of its own. Everything is just out of the blue and nothing seems to make sense. Do we really want if it does? No. <br /> <br /> It's also a very dark comedy but has a low presentation. Think about the nurse Betty or Jawbreaker. Very candy coated outside, dark twisted inside. If you like your movies random, dark or just plain means watch this movie. This will satisfy your calls for the weird One Night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> 8/10
