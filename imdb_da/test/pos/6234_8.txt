Slasher movies started may be 30 to 35 years before this movie, but believe me this among the gems that stay longer after turning off the TV. Especially if you are a person who is easily scared, it is the movie for you that you would not have the stomach to take it full of. Even after so many years, the film has not lost its charm and excitement. <br /> <br /> No blood is doing, but the excitement will surely chill out your spine. the movie starts with bang and it stays at the same pace to its end. BGM is nerve spreading and I remember this being the one copied in many Indian movies these days. Kings favorite? No wonder why ... that is the only reason I wanted to see this and it didn't leave me. "Don't turn off the lights" ... coz you won't find Enrique but maybe be a smiling doll sitting right behind you! beware. not for the little heart ... <br /> <br /> Two dumps up and I go with 8 out of 10, which is pretty low but I still keep my ratings for dramas ...
