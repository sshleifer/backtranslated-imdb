This was very good, except for two things that I would mention at the end. The animation is great, highlighted by Nick Park and the company's trademark for exaggerated teeth and mouth of the characters that make you laugh almost every time you see anyone. The color was also magnificent. <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the movie is the clever comedy woven all the way through. This is another one of those animated films where there is so much to see and hear each frame that it would require many views to catch all the gags. It's just a fun exaggerated look at the oddball "Wallace" and his quiet and smart dog "Gromit." Along the way, the fun people who are carried away with their vegetable garden protrude something like how the obsessive dog lovers were pictured in "Best of Show." My only complaints were two typical features of today's movie, animated or not: 1 - let's get the adhesive in the movie look like a total idiot; 2 - Let us exaggerate the final action scene with the predictable result, but way exaggerated. Aside this is still a very entertaining movie that has to make many laughs to many people and a movie to enjoy several times.
