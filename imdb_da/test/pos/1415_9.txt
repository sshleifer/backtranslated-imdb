Stephen Hawking has one of the greatest minds, or if it is too simple to coin for him one of the most curious and daring who also happens to be trapped in a body paralyzed by a disease that leaves him in a wheelchair and a computer to communicate. Maybe I didn't know enough about Hawking to go in (I always knew him as "the guy who speaks like a computer that knows a lot about the universe and things you know") that he is British that he was a rather normal Child, and perhaps most notably, the disease that might have left him dead at 21, enabled him to focus his life. According to Errol Morris just as curious and cool visually dazzling portrait in a short time history, Hawking was already brilliant, in the lead (when other Oxford students were confronted with scary algebraic equations, he replied more than three times the amount in an hour's time), but when they face challenges, mainly from other theories of other researchers, he jumped back with his own. During some of the complex scientific speeches - and if you have less than one B in astronomy, like me, keep your ears particularly pampered in explanations of the possible infinity of time or the special black hole - there is a man who just wants to enjoy his goose on his birthday. Morris catches Hawking right for those who can't get enough of his theories on how particles can go in and out of a black hole or if there is a creator or not, depending on how much one takes into account Einstein and time. But he also captures the back story of the man and his state, which creates this much more interesting than if Morris had done one or the other. Too much to talk about the cosmos would hurt his head and too much about his personal life, and one might wonder what all that fuss is about this block whose book of the movie's title was on bestseller lists for over five years. <br /> <br /> Almost in spite of his appearance, Hawking defines what it is to be a conscious entity in a universe which he observes that he will not be separated from if and when the universe goes off another 10 billion years ago now. Throughout, we get a glimpse of a genius and his humility (not to mention his colleagues and the family's' ten cents here and there) through an immensely hypothetical and mathematical process of thought in the universe.
