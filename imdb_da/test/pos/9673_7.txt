I own all family guy seasons so far and I have to say Vol. 6 has been the biggest disappointment to all of them. There are still lots of laughs to be found here, but I think Vol. 6 like the last few volumes slowly give less and less laughs. At least for me. <br /> <br /> The biggest annoyance I had with Vol. 6 seems to be very heavy in the left-wing policy. I believe very much if you can laugh at other people you should be able to laugh at yourself, but this volume really seems to push their political point of view down my throat and I think it takes very away from the show. Induced all conservative cases are horrible places, insinuating we need more gun control, insinuated school is underfunded, insinuated religious people are insane, Bush is friends with the devil .. I could go on and that's only from the first three episodes. It was probably fun, but there is a point when you are not making a comedy and you really push your political views on other people.
