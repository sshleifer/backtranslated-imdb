This BBC series is amazingly good fun. I had only seen a few minutes before I knew I had to own it and see it again with all my friends. I would not recommend this to anyone prudish, but almost everyone else will enjoy it - from the cinema snob to the entertainment-hungry masses. The protagonist is a lesbian, but it's still worth seeing if it's not your thing. Rachael Stirling is amazing in a leading role that stretches her into a dazzling array of emotions and situations, some of a bizarre nature. No one who saw this series would ever say she can't act. She makes us laugh, cry, get turned on and let go of our foreheads in astonishing. <br /> <br /> You can't really compare this story with anything else. It's not a rehash of style or plot. It is entirely its own animal part comedy, historical drama, eroticism, come-of-age narrative, musical and more. <br /> <br /> Don't praise the BBC for making this story. I can't imagine anyone in (too prudish and formal) USA ever doing it. Then stop reading about it and go buy it.
