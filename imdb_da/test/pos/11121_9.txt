I saw Fame when it first came out. It deals with high school in 1980, which was my academic year by chance. I watched the movie in the summer between high school and college, and being a practitioner myself, it has a special place in my heart. The biggest criticism of Fame usually has to do with continuity and there are certainly some story lines that are either not completed or do not make sense. But these problems are more than created by the passion and feel of the characters and the incredible music. <br /> <br /> I saw it again recently and was surprised that I still loved it as much as I did the first time. Fame is often compared to Flashdance, which I don't think is fair. Although Flashdance has some great music and Jennifer Beals is beautiful, I think Fame is much better in the development of his characters and the complexity of his stories. For anyone who truly loves art, this is a must-see movie.
