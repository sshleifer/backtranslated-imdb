For a television movie it was definitely worth seeing. All plays were very well done, and the story itself had a touching universal theme. I haven't read / seen the original and usually I can't stand Shakespeare, but I enjoyed this movie (the Civil War setting was also very good). Don't expect to see an epic, but you should find it moving enough to enjoy. By the way (on a side note) this (or any other movie for that matter) does not compare to the original work. Movies are not supposed to transfer a book to the screen, but rather take the general idea of ​​it and then customize a story from it. When people say "the book was so much better" (they are usually wrong anyway), what they really are trying to say, the book is so different.
