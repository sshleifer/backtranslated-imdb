Crazy Scottish warriors, stranded deep in outer space, low on food and budget free, started ten now down to three, who will help these men with picks, with visual effects as semi sucks, but I liked the freaky being, if i met one then i would escape, but if i had scottish buddies, we would swear and avoid the fate, so in the end it was not hit, it was a dvd i am glad i saw but if they ever make a sequel, dump some actors, not all were equal, some were good, with greedy actions, some were wood and should perhaps pack it in, but the action enabled me to see everything, the slider, shouting, did not stand I will tell my friends not to fear and look again in another year.
