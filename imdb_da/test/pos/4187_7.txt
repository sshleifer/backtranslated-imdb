Unfortunately, this movie is referred to as the 'curio' state it appears. Many people I asked "Did you know the monks made a movie?" answer normally 'no'. Having said that, if you are one of the great numbers, I recommend you see it, but with the following warnings: If you expect monkey style humor, it's in there. It's just not everywhere as television shows. Yes, they are trying to break their TV mold a little by poker fun on it as a bunch of no longer teenagers who have been on the short end of a lot of sticks. <br /> <br /> No, you don't have to be inebriated to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> No, you don't have to be inebriated to understand it. <br /> <br /> If you like classics, you'll love the interspersed clips all the way through. <br /> <br /> If you like the psychedelic era, you will love some of the comos. <br /> <br /> If you are Monkee's fan, you may recognize some of the jabs they take in the tough commercialization of the band. <br /> <br /> In the nigh-immortal words of one of my best friends after seeing 5 minutes of it: "This is a strange movie, man." In fact, it might be better if you don't try to understand it, just sit back and respond to it. It's weird, it's funny, it's a little surreal, it's experimental (still) ... there are many things. Overall, it's an experience.
