Considering Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry, I expected a movie that would be inclined to a hagiography of the subject. On the contrary, the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible, a drunkard, a bad father, a lier and a hypocrite and perhaps a prison. Of course, one can argue that all these things are an advantage when someone is an artist and especially a poet, as one of the purposes of art is to undermine the norms of conventional morality, but I do not do it as a positive role model could crop up from such a bundle of personality traits. In any way, I found the other male hero of the story Captain Cillic a more inviting character. The two female roles were played by actresses Knigtley and Miller and were truly charming, especially the first, as she performed slender outfit songs to inspire bombarded Londoners in World War II. Another good point is the role of sexual jealousy even in relatively progressive environments, which believe that ancient conventions can be easily overcome. The atmosphere in Blitz was also convincing as well as the portrayal of the various prospects among people who have experienced war as opposed to those who talk about it theorising it's possible political results. I think you would recommend such a movie.
