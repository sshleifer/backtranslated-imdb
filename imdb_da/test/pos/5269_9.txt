I am impressed that "Hail the Woman" was made at all; released just a year after American women voted, this turgid drama makes a serious plea against the sexual double standard, which judges women's sexual behavior more severely than men's. <br /> <br /> SLIM SPOILERS AED. A prologue set in the Plymouth colony in 1621 shows a pilgrim girl convicted of the ducking chair flirting with a boy; the boy is not punished. Now we come to Flint Hill, New Hampshire in the present (1921). Oliver Beresford (Theodore Roberts) is a bombastic bible trumpet: What we call in Britain and Australia 'a God-fighting'. Beresford is determined that his son David (Lloyd Hughes) will preach, regardless of how David feels about it. As for Beresford's daughter Judith ... yes, Beresford is convinced that women are not important enough to be anything more than wives and mothers. Apparently God told him this personally. <br /> <br /> David's gospel career has been compromised when he impregnates Nan Higgins, the step-daughter of the local strange man. (Tully Marshall's character is identified in the credits solely as "Odd Jobs Man", but a close-up of a check shows that his name is Jake Higgins. The 1921 prejudices demand that he be only Nans founder and not his biological parent.) to save his son from scandal buys Beresford Nans founder with a check. Nan goes out to the big city to melt into oblivion as a more unwanted mother. Judith is, of course, appalled by the limitations imposed on her by her gender. (Or rather by other people's perceptions of it.) She meets Wyndham Gray (excellent performance by Edward Martindel), an author who encourages her to transcend sexist stereotypes. But Judith is informally engaged to local Joe Hurd, who will not put up with such nonsense. Hurd is played by Vernon Dent, a burly performer now remembered only for comedy roles (like another banana for Harry Langdon and as a villain in Three Stooges movies). He gives an excellent performance here, in a role beyond his usual reach. Unfortunately, Dent has in his real life spent his last years in poverty and total blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. <br /> Finally, Judith ceases to work in an orphanage. This was 1921, I expect that the orphanage is only white so I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to include a Chinese boy. (And unpleasantly surprised when he's used to pushing a racial joke.) The movie makes an odd mistake here. In a Christmas sequence we see the orphanage, which recites 'A visit from Saint Nicholas' ... but (in a dialogue title) she credits Santa Claus with SIX reindeer rather than eight. This is followed by a short animation sequence showing santa with six reindeer hitched to his sled. I assume that the animators (either accidentally or to save money) left two reindeer and the title card changed the poem to match the error. <br /> <br /> Lloyd Hughes was generally a gentle and unimpressive actor. His most famous performance is his role in 'The Lost World', where he is easily raised by a raging brontosaurus. For his climax in "Hail the Woman", Hughes gives a memorable performance as he finally rebels against his father's tyranny. In his performance as the gospel-warring father, Theodore Roberts has been accused of over-activation to the point of making his role caricature. I disagree: Unfortunately, decades after this film was made, I continue to meet "holy" fool like this man ... willing to destroy the lives of all around them and are convinced that they have God's authority for to do it. /> <br /> In the central role played by Judith Beresford, Florence Vidor gives a sensitive, realistic and intelligent performance. I don't usually like Vidor, who used to be thrown into glamor roles, but wasn't quite enough to justify them. Here, her character's physical appearance is less relevant than normal. <br /> <br /> This film is impressively managed by John Griffith Wray, a director who deserves to be much better known. Unfortunately, Wray died at the beginning of the talkies era, in the mid-thirties: had he lived another ten years, he would surely have the hell more early sound classics. In 'Hail the Woman' there are several extremely beautiful screen compositions: I was especially impressed by a scene in the New England forest, since Vidor and Dent have a quarrel in front of a huge red tree. (I wonder where this was actually filmed.) 'Hail the Woman' deals with unpleasant subject matter, but it deserves to be much better known, and I will consider this ambitious drama 9 out of 10.
