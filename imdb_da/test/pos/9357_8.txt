When a man dies, a soldier becomes the main suspect. Undoubtedly the best movie that has three Roberts and everyone is in good shape. Young is the cold-headed, smoky policeman who investigates the murder. Mitchum is the murder suspect who is worried about the friend, and Ryan is a hot-headed soldier with something to hide. Grahame has a short but effective role as a femme fatale. Future Tarzan Barker has a part as a soldier. This film touches on anti-Semitism, a subject that is also covered by the Best Picture Oscar winner "Gentleman's Agreement" which was released that year. It is firmly controlled by Dmytryk, which creates an effective film noir atmosphere.
