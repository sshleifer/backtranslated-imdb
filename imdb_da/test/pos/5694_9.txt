WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the movie yet to read this comment. <br /> <br /> This movie was in the shelf of a movie store and since I had seen a handful of very corny horror flicks I had very low expectations for this. Well, I put it in, and almost immediately I was sucked straight in. As I watched, I became deeper and deeper into history, and I soon stared in full interest. This movie is surprisingly spectacular and I loved every second. The story is about a boat trip down a river in Australia. It seems safe enough until their boat is surrounded by a hook ready for some food. When I looked at the back of the case, I thought this movie should have crazy visual effects like in Lake Placid 2 and many others, but when I first saw the crocodile it looked incredibly real! Don't laugh when I say this, because I'm serious, but it's one of the craziest movies I've ever seen. It really knew how to build nail-biting tensions and excitement with its intense situation, I think, think about it; You are stuck in a tree, nowhere to drive, nowhere to hide with a hungry predator in the depths of the water below. You can't tell me you're not just getting a little bit of yourself. It even managed to give me a few chills in my arms, as when Adam was taken off the hook and Grace and Lee remained confused. This is a very appealing film. There were maybe 1 or 2 parts, where I found myself a little uninterested, but apart from that, I would say that this is my favorite animal engagement movie I've seen.
