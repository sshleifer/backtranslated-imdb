If you like his show, you may be a little disappointed. This movie has some very fun moments, and the laughs are pretty constant, but no one is very memorable or just as fun as the things on the show. The beginning is really really stupid and fun, and a good start. Yes! Borate makes a cameo look. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan, look it out! If you don't know him or don't like him then you won't bother. 6.5 / 10
