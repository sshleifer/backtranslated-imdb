Five teenagers set up to make some camping in the Oregon desert, and despite being warned by the park ranger, they soon realize that something is lurking in the backwoods and waiting to strike. <br /> <br /> When it comes to old Friday the 13th, so I took it myself to find the good old horror movies that were short to simply be compared to Friday 13th. , just before dawn just happened to be among those I found, and was really very impressive, it was not as bland as some of the things you find today, it was very sharp in terms of character development as it had a lot cozy, and it has this very relaxed pace, it is in no hurry to get to hack and slash, it takes time to set the right mood and tone and is very atmospheric and build some killer excitement by letting you always have that feeling for fear as something out there, but you do not know where it is or when it will be trike. <br /> <br /> Wherever I live it is definitely an overlooked gem simply because people have never heard of it or will not give it a try, but I would say that it is not a Friday the 13th rip Off, the two concepts don't even go close together, but in my mind it's generally one of the more impressive slashes I've seen for a while.
