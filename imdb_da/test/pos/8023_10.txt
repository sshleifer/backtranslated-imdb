The picture scene: A boring student with an empty day ahead, A video store with a special offer for 5 videos for a week rent. This ex-student usually just took a bunch of dubious quality videos for the most arbitrary reasons (The Turning anyone?). Occasionally, the odd undiscovered gem made it to its VCR - this is the case with this movie. Everything about the movie is good, but much more than this is all parts to give something too rarely - a good movie. Why this never got a British graffiti release is beyond me, especially when we are considering the bush that we are going to go through in the multiplex week of the week. Although I will happily accept this, it is not Oscar material (but it was not so-called Titanic - schmaltzy cgi-tinged bollocks) it is an extremely comfortable film. I was trying to think of a way to describe how best to appreciate / accept this movie - The perfect movie to watch while staying with your dad after a holiday home, after a great Sunday lunch.
