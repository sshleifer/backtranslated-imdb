If you want to see a true thriller, rent this !!! It is not from the director or screenwriter "Scream" that does not contain overactive, overpaid "TV" actors that go out like "stars" and are not a run of the mill special effects bonanza. Instead, you get a top-notch, edgy, very strong (in violence) but exciting nail litter.
