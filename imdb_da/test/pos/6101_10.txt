*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Wow, what a problem Joanna has found herself in. After an accident she drives over a small child, she goes to call for help only to return to crime scene in the middle of a group of very angry spectators. Understandably, it's too much for her to handle, and she floats the scene. Fortunately, the baby did not die, but was seriously injured and coma. So, the biggest fight in Joanna's life starts: should she keep quiet or speak up? At first she does not, but ultimately she realizes that it is torture that lives with such a terrible secret. <br /> <br /> At one point, she even joins a search party to help find the culprit. And gradually a detective begins to question this woman's behavior. She will tell the truth, and she never thought to run away from the crime scene, but is it worth telling and having the whole city hate you for it? <br /> <br /> Things with this movie are that you don't choose pages. Joanna is very good a good role model, although she has made some wrong choices. You feel for her even though you know what she was doing was wrong. Her journey is a good representation of what every human being would go through if something like this were to happen to them. <br /> <br /> Margaret Colin is an absolutely brilliant actress. She was fantastic in the television series now and again and great in movies as an Independence Day and the devil's own. Her performance here is so realistic and undisturbed that she carries us singlehandedly throughout the film. Eventually I wanted to see more of her. Lisa Vidal also provided some good support as the gentle, resourceful detective. <br /> <br /> To unpack it, if you want to watch a movie that makes you think long afterwards, someone who says "This is reality" will not miss this one. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
