"Imaginary Heroes" is a 2004 film featuring Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, Emile Hirsch, Michelle Williams and Kip Pardue. The story relates to a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the eldest child (Pardue) commits suicide. <br /> <br /> "Ordinary people" have often been mentioned in connection with this movie; It is kind of "ordinary people" with a role reversed. The mother in this case is Sandy Travis (Weaver) more accessible than Dad, Ben (Daniels), who is clearly destroyed and unable to cope. As "ordinary people", the younger son Tim (Hirsch) is the focus of the movie. <br /> <br /> For me, the film was absorbent enough to watch, but has a curious detachment about it. There were some wonderful interactions - mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (Williams) and some good offbeat moments. What was never clicked was that Ben was any part of that family or had any chemistry with Sandy. This seems to have been the goal of Director / Author Dan Harris. In a scene in a merchant, checkout kid assumes Sandy is "about 30" and gives her her phone number. In almost the next scene, Daniels asks Sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday. Weaver was 55 when this film was made, actually enough 54, and looks phenomenal. So what does Ben see? However, there is something that is being done about Ben's complete emancipation, because the viewer does not really see how Daniels was ever attached to that family. The end has a few twists and also some very touching scenes. Everyone is very good, with Weaver and Hirsch as standouts. <br /> <br /> There is not a huge amount of dialogue in this movie and lots of star stars. Scripture could have been sharper. But "Imaginary Heroes" is a good bet.
