I've been to the Hitchcock series lately. I always find myself renting one of his movies when I'm on Blockbuster or Hollywood Video. As I said before, Hollywood is losing it, it's amazing, I need a reminder that there are amazing movies out there. Not to mention, I will be a movie appreciator, not a movie buff. Is there any better way to do it than with Alfred Hitchcock's movie? <br /> <br /> The man who knew too much is another great and exciting thriller with Alfred's favorite man James Stuart and the woman stealing the Dorris Day show. They play husband and wife on vacation with their son, but when a spy tells James some information that can arrest another spy, his son is kidnapped and ransomed. James just seems to doubt Dorris and her ability to get ideas on how to get their son back, but she does a good comeback and almost ends up being the gangster. <br /> <br /> Again, I would say that Dorris was the one who fought the whole cast. James did a good job of holding together, these two made you sit and never bend through the whole movie. I loved the little bit of comedy at the end, which Alfred added. You will see what I mean. I would always highly recommend this movie, despite not being the best Hitchcock movie, it's still a treasure. <br /> <br /> 9/10
