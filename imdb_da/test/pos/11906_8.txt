The movie was better than I expected. I worked on the movie set for a short time when Damien made this movie. The gun's fire, stunt and acting came out well on the editing tip. All that was the music not so great. Better music would have top this movie. Some of the music sounds like the hippie day. Damien remembers you have gang violence gangsters some oldies or hip hop would have done so. It was more realistic than blood in the blood. Casting was picked really well.Suspectentertaint did a good job in this movie. The movie brought a bunch of a lifestyle I used to live. But in the end you don't always win. And in my story, that's how it was. I adapted the movie the first time I saw it. Lady Congratulations on this movie.
