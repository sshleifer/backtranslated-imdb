So we saw this on DVD on our apartment here in Paris. We are all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean, some of it was pretty clich√©d but still true, know what I'm saying. I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier, because I'm more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a warm roommate like Cecile de France. She seems like a cool chicken in the movie and really, after I saw her host the Cannes Festival last month. <br /> <br /> Now, I think I'm going to Barcelona next summer after watching this movie. I must also see the successor, who just came out here in France.
