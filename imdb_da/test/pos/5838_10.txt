I've seen a lot of television in my 51 years, but I've never had so much fun week after week when I saw Oz. The action of the entire casting was excellent. The script was just perfect, with each character remaining uniform over the six years. I also enjoyed the chaos and the ultra-violence. It may sound strange, but at times it was comical to find out how one of the characters would eventually end up dead. I especially enjoyed the true romance and love between Beecher and Keller. These two men really knew how to throw in every possible way. I really hope that HBO will continue to show us the detours of this amazing show FOREVER! I've seen every episode at least 4 times, but I'm still looking forward to Tuesday and Thursday night at. 11 for an episode of this fun and very entertaining show.
