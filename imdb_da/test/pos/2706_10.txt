Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this movie (although the wigs leave much to be desired!) And agree with many of the comments that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched. Regardless, it leaves your curiosity good and really dissatisfied, so I went to discover more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent reading and, unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy. She is a singer (as well as a dancer) in herself, and I think it was the edge that was needed to create the character. Some other actors may have struggled with this. It is ashame that the film does not delve deeper into her story. After all this is the movie title, but I felt like we learned more about Richard, but I suppose any artist who appreciates their salt should always let them have more!
