I enjoy the show Surface a lot. The show is very entertaining and it is a pure show. A show-like surface is interesting. It keeps my attention. It has compassion and excitement. I love all the cast members on the show. They are all very good choices. I think it's very important to have the right cast of Any show, because that's what makes something a success and of course the scenes and the show itself. Television has changed so much over the years. It has changed in good ways and in bad. I love to see some comedy, action, excitement and romance. And scifi. But Surface is a show that I hope will come back in many seasons because it is a great show and it is something that families can see. My kids have grown but my husband and I enjoy watching these types of shows. I appreciate your time and let me comment on my opinion. <br /> <br /> Thanks. <br /> <br /> Paulette Blackwell
