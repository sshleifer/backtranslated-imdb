The absurd art is alive and flourishing in the current Danish cinema! Well, at least in this movie. No one in this movie is entertained. They are all either annoyed or shocked, and if they are not yet, they will soon be! It is a story of scrubbing, murder, embarrassment, dignity and ultimately love and redemption. The chilling, awkward humorous style is idiomatic and will not appeal to everyone, but personally I just found having the right fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd. You take care of the characters from a distance, even if you don't like them closely and personally. But their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy with them even when they get away with murder. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is definitely the best Danish film of the last few years. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
