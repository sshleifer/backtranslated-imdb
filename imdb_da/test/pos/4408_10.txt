I must have seen this on the television as it was first broadcast some decades ago. I thought it was brilliant then, and as I can remember so much of it now, I might be right. While I've been living in and around London, I can't call myself a Londoner and don't know it at all - who does other than taxi drivers? When the viewer understands the premise; that here is a group of men trying to learn the seemingly unlearn state and rise to the status of demigod, the rest is pure joy. The characters are well opposite, their family relationships are just as diverse and so differently influenced by the film's events. Don't think it's a documentary - it's pure drama, and knowledge is one of the characters. I have never seen anything like this movie sooner or later. See it!
