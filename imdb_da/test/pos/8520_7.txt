Yes, it is Sean Connery who plays Bond again and looks more vibrant and, in part, for some time since the first time they made this movie, in 1965 when it was called "Thunderball". But the tongue is so stuck in the cheek, one wonders if Connery does not use a few observed tricks from his friend and more humorous successor, Roger Moore. <br /> <br /> Moore is my favorite Bond, but Connery makes a strong case for himself in this unusual outing. The only serious Bond movie not made during the classic Eon Bond series "Never Say Never Again" is an irreversible return to the well. Soft on action, however, it is strongly in character and smart dialogue. <br /> <br /> Bond, it's made clear right away, is a man in disfavor. No matter how many times he has saved the world, his new boss seems a bit of his cool lifestyle. "Too many free radicals, that's your problem ... Caused by eating too much red meat, white bread, too many martinis." "Then I'll cut the white bread, sir." Bond responds smartly. <br /> <br /> An early fighting sequence in a spa represents the movie's high point action-wise, with Bond and an attacker struggling through a kitchen, bedroom, and lab before Bond finally turns his opponent, ironically without anyone little help from these free radicals. Humor is used liberally in the film, rather wiser than most of Moore's excursions, although Connery seems to have more fun posting himself as a result of Moore's less selfish example. Was it because he was doing a good deal of gross? Or was it working for less stingy manufacturers? Either way, the manuscript serves its backward style, and the result is richer and more entertaining than Connery's previous two Eon Bond excursions, "You Only Live Twice" and "Diamonds Forever". The 1980s were not a good decade for Bond, whether it be Connery, Moore or Timothy Dalton. Leg warmers, video games and ugly sports cars are all proven, and Bianca Jagger sunglasses Klaus Maria Brandauer is seen on his first scene and does not benefit him. Forget first impressions. Brandauer's role as the top villain, Maximilian Largo, is one of the best in any Bond movie, with Brandauer enjoying play with his character's threat and craze. At one point, he allows Bond free roaming of his situation room with a martini to start, and his dancing eyes and crazy, engaging laugh make it a compelling company throughout. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie, except Connery, is the Bond girls shot with more attention to personality than usual in Bond movies, a will to filmmaker Douglas Slocombe and director Irvin Kirshner. Barbara Carrera was nominated for a Golden Globe for her role as villain Fatima Blush, as crazy as Largo and even nicer to look at. She doesn't keep the whole movie; You almost need her to focus on the others. Kim Basing's breasts and hams should have had their own agents for the screen time they get in this movie, but I'm not complaining. Basinger is a rare beauty that in this early role as Largo's mistress mixes incredible hotitude with a childish vulnerability that brings the Bond into me, and many others I suspect. (Her lips and cheekbones are also pretty cute.) <br /> <br /> It's not a well-constructed movie. It's a knockoff for a better Bond movie with a sloppy story, a horrible score and a flat ending. But it has Connery, showing that he was the final recording on the cinema's final secret agent, even though he steals a page or two from my 007, Mr. Moore. The end result is entertaining enough so I don't complain.
