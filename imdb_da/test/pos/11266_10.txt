I bought this video on VCR tape in a good will shop for US 50 cents. I've taken quite a few videos, I bought back for them to sell to others, after I have seen them considering the 50 cents cost as the rental. This is the only one who never comes back. It is an explosion of artistic talent, color and sound. I don't know if I should call it circus, dance or both. It's bigger than life itself. They will only be able to do well for a few short years in their lives. These are performing artists for the performing artists. If Gene Kelly and Burt Lancaster lived today and saw them alive, they would be surprised. I would lend it to others to see, but I know if I do, I will never get it back.
