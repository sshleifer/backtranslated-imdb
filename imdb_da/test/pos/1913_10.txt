Dolemite is for me an object of my deepest love. It has it all: a gang of karate battles prostitutes, Dolemite stomping his fist through Willie Green's (instructor Martin) belly, high pumps and 100 gallon dalmation-print hats. Moore's unique comedy rapeseed, actually toasts, is close to the hip hop roots. No wonder Dr. Dre mentioned "Dolemite" 3 times on his classic album "The Chronic." Add the best list of characters to ever grace a movie, like the horned preacher, hamburger pimp and of course "the one nobody knows until it's time." Credit for style must be given to director D'Urville Martin, a fella who probly does not get as much attention as he should about movie fan circles (I have been looking for a copy of his and Fred Williamson's early 70's films for years and can't find them). Many people are really down to this movie and say it is really bad, and it is true that you can see boom mikes popping up everywhere (see DP Nicholas Josef von Sternberg, for whom I think it was a very early action), There are many things that go to this movie. Number one, there is no other movie like that. Number two, you are going to see Rudy Ray Moore make one (highly sanitized; everyone who has not seen Moore's outrageous live act needs their imagination) movie version of his toasts plus he lives the life of his cartoon character superpimp Come alive. The action scenes are pretty bad, but the character's dialogue when they talk about the trash more than makes up for it. It's filled with strange little details (like the fact that Hamburger Pimp has a Dolemite T-shirt inside out - was this intentional or just picked up the guy, which shirt was on the set and put it on?) That keeps you coming back to see it again and again. <br /> <br /> At least I have. <br /> <br />
