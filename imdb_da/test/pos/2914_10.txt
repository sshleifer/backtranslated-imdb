Based on Mika Waltari's Book, this Second CinemaScope movie is ever made full of rich colors, beautiful music and panoramic views. The plot sometimes becomes confused in wording, but all in all, it has a strong social content: one is guided by one's emotions and that every action has a consistent consequence. But to really enjoy this movie, first watch the movie, then read the book. Though different, it sheds light on a lot of things that were not seen on the screen, giving the air some more of the depth of Sinuhe.
