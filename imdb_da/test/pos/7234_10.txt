This is the best movie I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot. I'm not even a Troma fan. I never heard of Troma before I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I had already given up hoping to watch a fantastic movie until I saw "Tromeo and Juliet". This movie is a dream come true. Shakespeare would probably be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic. There is sex, violence, humor and satire. It breaks many taboos. <br /> <br /> This movie is neither obnoxious nor stupid. It's hard to describe in words how clever, funny, exciting and witty this movie is. The music is fantastic and fits perfectly with all the scenes. The characters are very trustworthy and the play is amazing. I really used the characters. <br /> <br /> It's certainly not just for Tromas fans. It is for all people who have a sense of humor and clever and trustworthy entertainment as opposed to stupid and incredible mainstream movies who dare not do what this movie does. The bad reviews only prove that this movie is amazing and something extraordinary. You either love it or hate it. Like all true works of art, it is not understood and appreciated by all people.
