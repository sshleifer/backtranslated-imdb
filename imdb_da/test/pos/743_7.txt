The young ambitious nurse Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to work on a mental asylum out in the middle of the sky. In 3 days she meets strange events, even a patient in her bedroom sees her, but she still stays. The mental patients are all a little eye rolling (especially by the judge), but my favorite was the old crazy biddy (Rhea MacAdams). The story is okay at best, and the play is surprisingly okay, but after a while it gets a little. But it is still fun, quirky, strange and original. Note: The case inside the basement is hardly awful, so the title is a little banana.
