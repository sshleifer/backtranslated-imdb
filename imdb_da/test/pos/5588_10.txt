This cannot be considered a review on any movie, but only a comment on a movie I saw when I was young. I remember coming home on an evening filled with marvel at what I had seen. I tried to tell my parents part of the story, but they listened well without understanding what was so strange about two children stranded on an island that falls in love and grows together and has a son. As you must have guessed by now, I refer to The Blue Lagoon (1949), who has kept me admired and confused over the years (almost 50) and now amazes me with anxiety and disgust over who or what has prevented the film from Available in cassette or DVD or whatever. I've lived a chance to grab it one day and nobody knows anything about it. What a waste actually! Sorry if my English is not technical or scientific, but my native language is Spanish. I do my best to make me understand. Thank you, I'm Juan and I'm writing from Uruguay in S.America.
