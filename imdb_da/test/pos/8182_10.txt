The film invites comparisons with Shakespeare. Mandarin is beautifully written and spoken, and the plot is intricate and exciting. Gong Li has never seen better, never has the glory that is China been better represented on the screen. The balance between political unrest and personal intrigue, which Gladiator suggested, but never really delivered, is here in spades. Simply amazing.
