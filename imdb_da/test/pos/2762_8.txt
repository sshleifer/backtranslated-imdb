I have seen so many bad reviews on Supervivientes de los Andes that I felt compelled to stand for it (or at least I will try). First of all, of course, it looks dated, it was made in the 70s with very low budget, but it is part of that charm. I like modern movies but also dig the old ones for what they are worth. I'm not the one who feels the urge to watch or suffer movies with modern treatments and effects only; In addition, almost all movie birds can be old-fashioned films (which do not like films from El Santo or Plan 9 from outer space, whether it's the overall quality?). In pace, it is only a tool to cover (again) it is low, and I believe that the constant dialogues are in order for a better character and situation development. Of course, Alive has better FX, but I won't despise the old just because of it, and I don't feel totally attracted to English speakers in an event involving people from Uruguay, and that gives me a plus to the Supervivientes de los Andes. It is like, although Canoa from the 1970s and based on a true event would also get a better resume now because of technological advances, but I think I will stick to the feeling that offers, whether it be is production date. All of this is based on the impact that had on me for the first time I saw that it was on TV, and today I don't think it has lost any of the primary power. It has, of course, been a long time, and I have seen lots of better movies in every aspect of the cinema, but it does not diminish the true value. It's not a bad movie, and I put it over Alive without hesitation. Just give it a break.
