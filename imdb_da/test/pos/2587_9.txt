Working in a cinema as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to see virtually any movie that comes out. When I first saw the "Black Snake Moan" trailer, I laughed and thought, "Great. Another" Snakes on a Plane "Samuel L Jackson movie". But of course I would see it for the laughter factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the insinuation in the title, the images on promotional ads and the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the movie. Personally, I loved every second of this movie. It tells the story of an elderly man and a young woman who both go through rough times and are able to reach each other. The story is really moving and sends a big message about life and how we live. Of course, I can't recommend it to young audiences because of some graphic material, but if you're looking for a great story and true play by Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and even Justin Timberlake, I urge you to see 'Black' Snake Moan '.
