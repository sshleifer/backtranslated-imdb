We enjoy a movie as "Fame" because we imagine that we are there ourselves - music, dance and drama students who enjoy our self-expression. This film had humor, entertainment and should be an inspiration for young people to take on performing arts. Bravo "Fame". Definitely worth 8 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Chris
