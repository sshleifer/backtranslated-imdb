Many years ago, I did not love and respect Jimmy Cagney's movie almost as much as I do now. I noticed that many of Cagney's films performed with Warner Brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and his plays were far from subtle. But the more I saw these movies, the more I found that I was connected despite these aspects. In fact, I now think like and expect them! Old-time fans Hollywood movies probably understand what I say - teenagers and other young whippersnappers don't! Well, when it comes to entertainment, MAYOR OF HELL never does from start to finish. While the idea of ​​a shady character that Cagney played over running a reform school is ridiculous and while all the changes he made seemed to be so far, it somehow worked and delivered solid entertainment. <br /> <br /> The band with hard thugs was pre-Dead End Kids and instead of like Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall and Billy Hallop, similar roles are played by Frankie Darrow and Farina. Yes, I said "Farina". This black actor was already famous for his roles in the Our Gang comedies and was, believe it or not, one of the highest paid children's actors in Hollywood. Everything he needed to give up, in turn, was called an inseparable name and acted as a good stereotype "Negro". Here he was actually quite good, and the usual black stereotypes are a little more subdued than usual. But some will cringe on the very funny but horribly offensive court scene with Farina and his father, Fred 'Snowflake' Toones. With terrible names like "Farina" and "Snowflake", don't say I didn't warn you. <br /> <br /> Apart from this little complaint and a plot that is hard to believe, the movie is unique and fun. The kids do a good job, just as Cagney and Dudley dig in a truly despicable but exciting role as the evil hosts. Also, as an added plus, you'll see stubborn Warner actor Allen Jenkins in his first role in the studio.
