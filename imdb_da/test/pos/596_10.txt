I haven't seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with Sesam street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing those characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and master muppeteer. When I watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when I was younger and it seemed so much easier. For this bit of time travel, I rate this movie a 10. <br /> <br /> The baseline examines how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. They laugh and gags are classical muppetism. I'm glad these movies are still around for the next generation. I hope I never grow the power of the muppets.
