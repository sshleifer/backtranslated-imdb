My wife and I support all the positive comments below made by other IMDB members. Although this is not a box office smash hit it has a special charm quite own. Real and warm warming. <br /> <br /> We watched this video at the end of a long day. We were very tired and in bed. Normally in such a situation, my wife falls asleep within minutes, that is, unless it is an extraordinary movie, and one kept us both entertained right to the end. Maybe younger viewers in their teens and twenties wouldn't like this, but for the rest of us it's a true gem! See it!
