I didn't like "as good as it gets," but I'm a big fan of William Hurt and Holly Hunter's work, so I decided to watch this movie. And the most surprising thing to me was Albert Brooks' amazing work. Here in Spain he is less known and only as a 2nd division version of Woody Allen in the West Coast. He played a great deal, but Hunter and Hurt were also good, especially Hurt, in a relatively unusual role for him. Hunter played the role that reminds me of some of his part in "Once Around" (Lasse Hallstrom, 1991). Finally, the rest of the cast is also great. Robert Prosky, one of these well-known faces of the American cinema, ex-bond girl Lois Chiles, is quite well placed on the role I think of the always perfect Joan Cusack in his early years; and especially the short execution of Jack Nicholson. Maybe he has no good scene, but it is Jack Nicholson, anyway ... The best movie by James L. Brooks, great story (well resolved) and excellent cast for one of the best movies in the 80s
