This movie is a wallpaper, a series of portraits of Rome society woven together by music. It is a very musical film because of the numerous dialogue involved - and what dialogue is, is not important for the narrative structure. Some may expect a National Geographic story of "customs, dress and music" or a plot line that revolves around a few key characters - don't look for this. <br /> <br /> This is because it paints a portrait of a family of people, rather than telling a story about individuals. The reason is the story through space (India to Andalusia) and / or / time (we can't tell) about a people. There is no need for narration. You get a sense of a happy people, strongly connected in small communities where social interaction is very important. And a great sense of sadness in parts, by their rejection of society as a whole. So it is a paean to Rome culture, very beautifully shot, with a wide spectrum of Rome music and a plug in tail, which is the oppression these people have faced and still face.
