This movie fully deserves to be one of the best Hindi comedies ever made. Rajkumar Santoshi is mostly known for his cruel, hard-hitting social dramas, but it is easily the most effortless movie he has made. The plot is about two small town buffers Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan). They want to get rich quick and then move to the big city. They close the same plane separately - to awaken a rich heiress Raveena (Raveena Tandon), the daughter of a rich businessman Ramgopal Bajaj (Paresh Rawal). So the one who marries Raveena gets his hands on all her wealth. But when they learn each other's plan, there is an intense flood of one-man crew who marries Raveena. Hilarious gags and situations follow when the battle goes through. At the same time, Ramgopal Bajaj's identical twin brother Shyamgopal Bajaj will eliminate his brother and niece and join the family fortune. Add to this a selection of fun characters, including a Raveena's maid Karishma (Karishma Kapoor), a failing butler named Robert (Vijoo Khote), a leader named Bhalla (Shehzad Khan) who mimics yesteryear's villain Ajeet and a fun gangster Gogo (Shakti Kapoor), who looks more like a pirate and a huge comedy, is waiting for you. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time looking for LOGIC in the movie. Leave the business of your brains and just enjoy. The actors are so much synchronized with the script that there is no room for error. Dialogues (Rajkumar Santoshi, Dilip Shukla) are witty. Music (Tushar Bhatia) and lyrics (Majrooh Sultanpuri) are memorable. Picturing and choreography (Saroj Khan) of "Yeh Raat Aur Yeh Doori", "Ae Lo Ji Sanam" and "Dil Kart Hai Tere Paas Aaoon" are appropriate and will remain etched in my mind forever. <br /> <br /> The movie starred two superstars-in-the-making, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan (they eventually became superstars). Aamir Khan is impeccable in his first all-out comedy role. I greet his sense of comic timing. Salman pales in comparison to Aamir, but is still sympathetic. Among the supporting characters, Paresh Rawal distinguishes himself in his dual role of Ramgopal and Shyamgopal. <br /> <br /> The movie surprisingly surprised at the box office. I fail to understand why. I recommend it to anyone anyway.
