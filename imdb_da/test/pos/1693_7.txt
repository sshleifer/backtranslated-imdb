Apart from the fact that the women in the film are amazingly beautiful and all the camps are too obese, this movie really calls on chaos in the post-war period. <br /> <br /> Beautiful photography and a strong national expression of the Polish national character. <br /> <br /> It's very slow on points, but the whole pacing is so different from American and Western European films that it's quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Both major players do a very good job. On the DVD version you can see interviews with the main actors and crew members, and the leading actress Stanislawa Celinska has gained around Â£ 50 and lost all her beauty. But in 1970 she was an anesthetic.
