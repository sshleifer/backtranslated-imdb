I've just seen this card on PlanetOut Movies. <br /> <br /> Starcrossed was a very sweet, sad little movie about two brothers who are in love. There are some beautiful, subtle actions by both male leaders. Frequently, movies with this topic seem to be trapped in the controversy and shock value of the plot, forgetting that there is an actual story. Fortunately, writer director James Burkhammer does not, and instead the story plays with honesty. The sequences of the two boys who first fall in love are very sweet.
