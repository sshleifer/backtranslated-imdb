This movie launched my theory on books based on books: Instead of following the "You have read the book, now watch the movie" clique, if you are looking for a good book to read, try the one on which a movie you like was based because it gets 10 times better. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on its first release at the National Theater in downtown Eugene and liked it so much that I kept watching it again. It's a perfect fusion of the inspirational talents of one of my favorite actors, Jon Voight, with what became my favorite book, "The Water Is Wide" by Pat Conroy. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine better movies about the nobility's teaching and the ironic challenges in life. Two small warnings: <br /> <br /> (1) The video suffers from pan-and-scan and deserves a letterbox version. (2) The title must be restored to the book's name, a reference to one of the most touching, enigmatic songs ever written
