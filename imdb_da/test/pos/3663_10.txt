I loved this movie I just watched at the Philadelphia Film Festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends and this film was very genuine. I related to everything and savored every moment. The signs are credible, the story poignant and the final realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the exhibition. This film shows very well the mixture, but not the complete mix of 2 worlds (east and west). The support molding was wonderful and portrayed the life a tourist meeting in India quite realistic. The humor is subtle, and sometimes dry, making it so much more realistic as it is woven into the daily escapades of the characters. It is so easy to identify with each of the situations shown.
