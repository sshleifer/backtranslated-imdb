The monks are surprisingly a great favorite of mine. Yes, they could have been the original manufactured rock band; a gimmick that has surely reached overkill in the 21st century. But their music stops as some of the best 1960s had to offer. Last Train to Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm a Believer (I'm not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs written by good songwriters like Boyce / Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen / King and John Stewart. While they were not great musicians or songwriters, they had a sympathetic screen presence and lots of appeal and some of their own things were actually decent. Their T.V. show is dated in 2007, but I still see the show occasionally as a time capsule for life in 1966-1968; the magical and dangerous time in American history. But as we all know, as part of things to come to those like Kelly Clarkson, The Monkees did not want to be considered as produced and just pop up to their recording company. Despite their average talents, they wanted to write their own songs, produce their own albums and call the shots when it came to tours. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a disaster; especially since Peter Tork's choice of Jimi Hendrix as an opening act was nixed because of his stealing of the show and heavy sexual suggestions in his music compared to The Monkee's G-rated content. <br /> <br /> But the final nail in the coffin of Monkees (until 1986) was the infamous movie movie Head. Head was written by Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson while allegedly tall on Mary-Jane. The movie received bad reviews and made only $ 16,000 in the box office. Today, the film is a cult classic ahead of its time and delivers a message of what was on the youth's mind in 1968, Summer of Anger. The head really has no plot. Basically, one to four of The Monkees looks from scene to scene without any rhyme or reason. They go from eating for a dinner, to see Davy Jones being bashed by Sonny Liston, to a Western, being sucked in a vacuum, performing at a concert, and so on. The film basically gives oblique views on what was wrong with American society. Monkees bash commercialism, the war in Vietnam, American politics, censorship, establishment and greed. You have to read between the lines to see what the goals of the derision were. <br /> <br /> The monks spend a lot of time on the boxes in certain crossings of the movie, symbolizing how they felt their record company saw them; as nothing but toys to play with, as it was time to record another album. A scene in which they are superior 16-4 in the Western scene may be a symbol of them against the session musicians, songwriters, record producers and what not who controlled their career and the cannon they burn on them is their way of saying "Begone!" . <br /> <br /> The movie is really a psychedelic trip to watch. The flashy tie colors, the hypnotic concert and belly dance scenes and the obscure images are everywhere. The action is actually very good, but it is pre-tensioned as I like The Monkees T.V. show. A small soundtrack contains "The Porpoise Song" and three songs written by The Monkees themselves. The movie actually has some hilarious scenes in the apartment; although they may not be. Mickey Dolenz struck up a Coke Machine that didn't give him a soda or his violent punch-ups in the boxing scene (I mean, he was a wiry guy who probably weighs no more than 135) made me laugh. /> <br /> All in all, this movie is an absolute must-see for any Monkees fan. I think many people will feel that this movie is actually "over their head", but for those who are obsessed with the 60's and society at that time will find it a good time capsule.
