"The Chipmunk Adventure" is one of the greatest animated films from the 1980s. Alvin and Chipmunks have always been of interest to me, as they really made me rock and roll. None of the chipmunks have any bad traits. Alvin is really the star and has all the great looks. Theodore is the lovable sensitive. Then there is Simon (my personal favorite), the smart one who is often a party poker. I also like Chipettes a lot. There is Brittany, who, like Alvin, is one who always tries to be so popular. Then there is Eleanor, who, like Theodore, is sweet, sensitive and loves food. Janette is the only Chipette that does not resemble her counterpart; She is very naive and really clumsy. In Chipmunk's very first full-length movie, David Sevilla goes on a business trip to Europe and he leaves the boys with Miss Miller while he is away. While playing an arcade game, Alvin loses to Brittany and then says that if he had the money, he would drive Brittany around the world for real. Unknown to the kids, a man named Klaus Furschtien and his sister Claudia, who have tried to come up with an insidious way of delivering diamonds all over the world in exchange for cash, overheard this conversation and said they would let them drive around in world for $ 100,000. Alvin and Brittany accept it and go on the run. <br /> <br /> This adventurous movie has many great songs. "Off to See the World" made for a suitable theme song for the movie. Then there is "Get Lucky", one of my favorite songs in the movie. "My mother" is most likely the most juicy song in the movie, but it always makes me cry. "Wooly Bully" is the only cover song used in the movie (the rest was completely original). Then of course there is "The Boys and Girls of Rock and Roll", which in my opinion must be one of the greatest music tracks in film history. <br /> <br /> I used to watch this movie very often until my recorded tape of the dead. However, I still see the movie. This is actually a fun movie for people who are on holiday to a foreign country for the first time. It will give you an idea of ​​what kind of things you would expect from world travel. Absolutely one of my childhood films, and one that I would recommend to 80s fans and Alvin & the Chipmunks fans.
