Man with screaming brain is definitely not a perfect movie, but I'm sure it was never meant to be a starring vehicle for Bruce Campbell, which means it is a summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action and happy ending. Campbell is rude as a writer - there are many things in history that do not make much sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts just because a female brain has been implanted in it?) And some of the scenes feel like reversed by other, better incarnations ( The scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William are fighting for control of Williams' body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). However, there are lots of small details and non-sequitures that feel pretty brilliant as when William is at the height of his panic and screaming at a statue, "What are you looking at?" The movie looks like an original from the Sci-Fi Channel, probably because it was. The action is actually pretty good. I especially enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and listless, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her at certain moments that history never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard "bumbling assistant" role admirably enough, and Bruce is fun as the arrogant, sardonic, discouraging American jerk. (Now that he is writing his own films, he thinks he would play a role he hasn't already written into.) Crying brain man is a bizarre, obscene B movie that should be fun for anyone there can avoid taking a movie experience too seriously.
