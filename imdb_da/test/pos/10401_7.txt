Another hand-held scare means another splitting movie that fans still have to find out and make their own minds about. <br /> <br /> Imagine a cross between The Blair Witch Project and The Grudge, and you're close to the overall content of this movie. It is another videotape scare, but this time, most of it is edited together in readiness for a video document that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappeared. I certainly had a sense of fear as I watched this movie (making someone terribly better than our Asian friends?) But the creepy moments, the truly eerie moments, were unfortunately a little less and longer than I had hoped for. I also felt that I was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent "revelations" appeared all the time, so I certainly cannot recommend this as high as [* Rec]. <br /> <br /> That being said, it would be mindful of me not to recommend highly any film that goes on ectoplasmic worms, contains at least two subtle spooky ghosts and made sure I had to put the light on again for a while when the sun went down. br /> <br /> Check it out if you've enjoyed some of the other handheld genre releases late. And the final is a hair-doozy. See this if you like: The Last Broadcast, Pulse, Angel Heart.
