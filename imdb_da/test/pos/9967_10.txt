William Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice is about a Jewish money dealer and his ties to extract a pound of meat from the wealthy merchant Antonio, the culprit of a debt. The Jewish moneylender is, of course, Shylock, and he gets such a thrilling performance by Al Pacino that even outstanding players like Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynne Collins fall into the background. The film is set in the 16th century in Venice, and director Michael Radford relies on attitude, mood and realism to tell his story, reject lavish costumes or a modern setting with rock music to appeal to a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Radford slices the toy's three hours length to a manageable two hours and eight minutes and also provides some historical background. In the opening story, he tells us how Jews came to England, were exposed to increasing persecution and eventually expelled from England. They were forbidden to own property, could only make money by borrowing money of interest and were forced to live in a Venetian "goat", a precursor to darker events to come. In the film, the merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons) publicly jokes at Shylock, but feels no shame to go to the guardian to borrow 3,000 ducats to help his friend and suggested love Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) to court court of Portia (Lynne Collins) a wealthy heir. Although Shylock has been insulted by Antonio, he goes in to borrow the money without interest for three months, provided that the falsification of the tape entitles him to exactly one pound of meat from Antonio's heart. <br /> <br /> play is primarily a drama of hate and revenge, but like many of Shakespeare's works, there is also a stir on broad comedy. Here, the comedy involves three pairs of lovers: Bassanio and Portia, Gratiano, Bassanio's friend and Nerissa and Lorenzo, another friend of Bassanio and Jessica, Shylock's daughter. Portia has offered to the person who can choose the right treasure from one of three boxes made of gold, silver and lead. The Prince of Morocco chooses one of the gold, the Prince of Aragon, one of silver, and both are disappointed. Bassanio, however, loves her for herself and opens the lead coffin to find the portrait inside. Radford's adaptation gives a remarkable sense of time and place. Portia's residence at Belmont proposes one of these fabulous cottages complete with immaculate gardens and art treasures hanging in each room and contrasting with the grungy look of Shylock's town with its casseroles. When it becomes clear that Antonio cannot repay the debt, Bassanio returns to Venice and leaves Portia behind. When he arrives, the loan is in default and Shylock requires his pound of meat. Even when Bassanio, backed by Portia's wealth, offers many times the amount to be repaid, Shylock is discouraged for not only losing money but for a lifetime of outsider status. The Duke who sits in the verdict will not intervene when Portia enters the tire as a lawyer to defend Antonio. This is where the film reaches its dramatic heights as all parties come to court to make a final decision. <br /> <br /> The merchant in Venice is not just about an unpaid debt, but also about the alienation of Jews from Christian communities and their desire to belong. It has been one of Shakespeare's most controversial games, and analysts have long debated whether it is an anti-Semitic game or simply a game of anti-Semitism that reflects the prevailing view of the Christian community in the Elizabethan England. Although Shylock is a caricature, he is an ambiguous figure, and there are many signs that Shakespeare sees his faults as human failure, not Jewish. The Duke acknowledges that he is simply a man who has not complied with Tora's compassionate language. <br /> <br /> I am a Jew in the monologue. Don't have a Jew? dot us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, don't we laugh? If you poison us, don't we die? And if you fail us, should we not avenge? "Shylock shows a universal humanity that expresses equality of all men. Although we are horrified by the sentence he wants to perform, we can feel his pain accumulated over the years. Pacino's performance gives new impetus to the text and his often over-the- -peak persona is replaced by a milder and more discreet behavior that understands his cause. During an interview from the Toronto International Film Festival last September, Radford said about Pacino, "When you work with a brilliant actor, you have a good machine. It's a bit like driving a powerful car. You have to dare do it. "He's dared and we're all recipients.
