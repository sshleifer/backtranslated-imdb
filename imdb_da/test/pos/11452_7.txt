This is not the video of nasty Night of the Demon, as there is more than one. In fact, there is only one, but it is multiplied. <br /> <br /> After inhabiting Suzanne (Scream Queen Linnea Quigley), she passes it on to goth Angela (Amelia Kinkade) through a lovely long kiss. /> <br /> Next, we see Linnea showing us his quigleys in the bathroom. She shows a lot more when Jay (Lance Fenton) thinks he's in fun. <br /> <br /> Soon everything goes literally to hell, as organs fall one by one and possess. Judy (Cathy Podewell) and Max (Philip Tanzini) are the last two trying to escape. Max is not very helpful and gives Judy the opportunity to find his way. <br /> <br /> The makeup was amazing, and the only thing that kept it even better was the very long build-up to action. <br /> <br /> The old man (Harold Ayer) who appears in the beginning will be back and get his only desserts. <br /> <br /> Linnea Quigley may be the Scream Queen, but Cathy Podewell definitely showed the biggest congestion in this movie.
