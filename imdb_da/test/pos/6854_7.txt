I liked this movie a lot. The actors were great, especially Potente, which is different in every role; FÃ¼rmann, who can also play someone and Loos who spice things up (she is also a talented singer - she sings the song "My Truth", heard when a character cranks up the stereo in the lab). <br /> <br /> Anatomy is a good scary flick that emphasizes its characters. It is also very fun at times, and the set design is innovative. It is too bad that they had to make a sequel that is not near the original. <br /> <br /> On a side note, two other things are definitely worth mentioning. The DVD is not called, which gives a better experience of the movie. Also, be sure to keep an eye out after the final credits start rolling.
