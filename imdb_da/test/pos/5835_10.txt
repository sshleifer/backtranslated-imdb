Harrowing series about life in Oz - an experimental prison where they are trying to rehabilitate prisoners. There is gay violence, rape, torture, mutilation, killing, humiliation, tons of male nudity ... all in your face and power. It is also easily one of the best written dramas ever put on television and almost all actors are just good. As this was on cable, there were no restrictions on what they could say or show. There are lots of racist comments flying in here, but it's for all races. In fact, the white figures come out pretty bad (especially the arias) and the black figures come out better (the peaceful Muslims). Hispanics do not have a strong role, and there are no Asian prisoners at all. All the prisoners seem to be back-stabbers and willing to kill anyone at a moment's notice --- but you still think you're sympathetic to some of them. Even the guards, the counselors and the doctors in the prison have serious problems. I highly recommend it, but rent it - don't buy it. I have the whole collection and to be honest I don't think I'll ever see it again. It is incredible TV, but so cloudy, dark and depressing. Guess I have to sell everything online. <br /> <br /> I give it a 10.
