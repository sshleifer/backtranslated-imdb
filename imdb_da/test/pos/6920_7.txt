This movie is about entertainment. Imagine your friends that you love to spend time with those you know inside, get a little stupid and maybe take on a character or two. It's about this movie. An inventive script and excellently executed. It's not about satisfying the masses with this one, it's about having fun with a bunch of brilliant talented people. That's what I'm sure they all thought when they joined it. <br /> <br /> The above review sounds quite unfair and I think the person who wrote it was wrong because they saw movies. In a lightning moment there is great dignity in it if you usually see. <br /> <br /> A well done job I thought was a good movie. I wanted to see this before the North American norm some day. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it's not the best movie you'll ever see, but it has a hell of a lot of moments. I don't laugh for so long at an age.
