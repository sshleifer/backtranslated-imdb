This is a cute little French silent comedy about a man who bets another that he cannot stay in this castle for an hour because of being haunted. And as soon as the guy enters the house, it looks much more like a wildly fun house or perhaps the aftermath of LSD !! While there are ghosts and skeletons, there is a strange menagerie of animals, odd special effects and gags too. It is very difficult to describe, but visual images make the movie worth seeing. WHY understands that the self-suffering leader also had many "funny gags" that fell completely flat and damaged the film. His "camera tricks" were not that hard, but annoying and stupid. IGNORE THIS AND KEEP WAKE UP - it gets better. The movie is fast, fun and worth watching. In particular, I liked watching the actor and the pitcher of Max Linder - he was so expressive and fun! Too bad he's almost forgotten today. For an interesting but very sad read, check out the IMDb biography of him.
