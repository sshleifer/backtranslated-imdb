1 Let us suspend faith for a moment and let us stop letting out that we might, or should know, "how it is" or "should be" there in space. Human knowledge in this area is probably primitive, which says the Middle Ages cards are compared to today's satellite maps, so we really have no idea. 2 considering this is "just" a BBC TV docu simulation, it gets much better than many big budget Hollywood movie clips, and it's just incredible. All in all, a show worth seeing as it portrays CGI-enhanced and fictitious statement of what we know of the solar system by far. 4 probably fictionalizing and CGI-ing it all is the only way to make it tasteful to a large audience. Have you ever seen clips from REAL space missions and REAL space probes? The quality is generally average to poor, and the comparison would be between looking at a crystal x-ray (and what it tells about the human body) and comparing it to a CGI-ed cyborg movie ... which would be most entertaining? But the chest X-ray is really, while cyborg flick is just fictionalized SFX. 5 actors do a good job. Nobody, I'm telling my grandchildren, but very fair to be a BBC docu simulation.
