12/17/01 Everything I can do with this movie improvises on my impressions. I didn't get "changes," don't know the "score" and are not trained in the genre. I've always had trouble following chord changes anyway (trumpet player, yes), so I was pretty much limited to doing the basics "keep the tune in mind" and ad lib around it. What bothered me about this incredibly moody black-and-white blues piece was the knot it gave me in my head and heart to try to find out whether to go with the ensemble or choose a path along the melody. went with the melody as usual; I kept going wild over the changes - too deep, extensive, over my head, probably. Still, it was a gas trying to keep up. I admired the actors' games for the theme and story. I didn't see any things or heard things that others think: I didn't feel the bright skin gal was "trying to pass" as much as she was either ignorant of the color problem or tried to ignore it - initially: later she came back and fought. The burning light shining young man (his trumpet noodling mas ridiculous) was ambiguous, ambivalent and perhaps his best feature - distant. What did I think after the shadow curtain was closed on this provocative piece - is the foundation of such a thing? Is it a way to find "reality" by creating a stage, keeping it with expressive characters and giving them a melody and a theme? Is it more genuine or truthful than a well-designed script - without the benefit of editing and reviewing? Is improvisation heroic, "artists"? - Moreso than designed work? Where is there greater or clearer truth: in retrospective art / craft or in manufacturing and reforming? Well, I'm still lost on this issue. I loved the movie; It was lost to me in a cool blue misty evening, where I just had to go home and get out of my horn. Guess what? I broke into a twelve-bar blues riff, tried and true - couldn't make me afraid of the tune. The reality is just too scary. jaime says give them a 7 and more. I'm in pause.
