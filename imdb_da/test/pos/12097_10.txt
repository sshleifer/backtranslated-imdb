I listen to Istanbul, the intention, my eyes closed: In the beginning there is a gentle breeze and the leaves of the trees Soft failure; Out there, far away, the bells of water carriers ring incessantly; I listen to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed; So suddenly birds fly by, bird birds, high up with a hue and cry while the nets are pulled in the fishing grounds. I listen to Istanbul, the intention, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, the intention, my eyes closed. The Grand Bazaar is peaceful and cool, a rebellion in the center of the market, mosque yards full of pigeons. While hammers bang and clang on harbors carrying spring winds sweat; I listen to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed; Still giddy from past stories, a seaside mansion with sniffing boathouses is fast asleep. In the middle of the quilt and drone in the south winds, reposed, I listen to Istanbul, the intent, closed my eyes. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, the intention, my eyes closed. A beautiful girl walks by on the sidewalk: four letter words, whistles and songs, rude remarks; Something falls out of her hand It's a rose, I think. I listen to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, the intention, my eyes closed. A bird flirts around your skirt; On your forehead is there sweat? Or not? I know. Are your lips wet? Or not? I know. A silver month rises over the pine trees: I can feel it all throbbing in your heart. I listen to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> FOR YOU <br /> <br /> For you, my fellow men, everything is for you, nights are for you, the days are for you; Daylight is for you, moonlight is for you; Leaves in the moonlight; Wonder and wisdom in the leaves, Myriad greens in daylight, Yellow is for you and pink. Sensitivity of the skin on the palm, its heat, its softness, the comfort to lie down; For you are all greetings, and the masts win in the harbor; Today's names, Name of the month, Fresh paint on rowing boat is for you Postman's feet, Potter's hands Sweat on forehead, Bullets fired on battle fronts; Graves are for you and tombstones, prisons and handcuffs and death tolls Are for you Everything is for you. Sea Nostalgia <br /> <br /> Vessels sail with my dreams, over the roof, ships in a color, and poor me, long ago for the year of the sea this year, I stare and cry. I remember my first view of the world Through a seashell, I pried openly: The greenest water and the blue sky And the craziest of lumpfish ... My blood is still flowing salt. Where oysters cleave my skin. What a crazy speed jump was ours in the open sea on the white foam! Foam carries no evil, Like lips whose marriage to men is no disgrace. <br /> <br /> Vessels sail with our dreams Over the roof, ships in a color, and poor me, season for the year out. <br /> <br /> - Orhan Veli <br /> <br /> I couldn't have said anything better than what Orhal Veli Kanik said about Istanbul. About this movie is all I have, praise. A very nice and balanced introduction to a city and its music that linked Asia, Europe and Africa at a time.
