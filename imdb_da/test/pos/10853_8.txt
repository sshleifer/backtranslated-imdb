Tipping the Velvet (2002) (TV) was directed by Geoffrey Sax for BBC TV. The basic plan is a story that is expressed by the protagonist, Nan Astley, played well by Rachael Stirling. As a teenager, Nan works in his family-run oyster house. Everyone expects her to stay home, then marry a suitable man and settle in family life. Nan expects this too. Everything changes when Nan meets Kitty Butler (Keeley Hawes) a beautiful and talented performer who dresses men's clothes and captures her audience's hearts. The audience includes Nan, who is sexually attracted to Kitty in a way that she is not attracted to her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie follows Nan to London and through her ups (black) and her downs (horrible) as a lesbian and sometimes male imitator. <br /> <br /> As is typical of the BBC, every role, no matter how small, is done by an outstanding actor. The BBC has a depth and breadth of performing artists that are truly amazing. None of the supporting actors stand out in my mind - they were uniform good. Both Stirling and Hawes are wonderful, and their plays carry the film together. <br /> <br /> It's always sad to be reminded of how hard life can be for someone who doesn't fit the community's mold for what is normal. I know it's not easy for lesbians, even in the United States, even today. Imagine the obstacles to love and happiness for lesbians in Victorian England. We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.
