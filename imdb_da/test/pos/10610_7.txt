Set Bollywood to everyone with a little familiarity with the genre, and the images that are usually confronted are sticky, over the top musical tracks associated with costuming, making Vegas seem like a bastion of conservatism. This view is not helped by whiff of condescension, which permeates most movies that have contacted Bollywood from an outsider perspective. Willard Carroll's romantic comedy Marigold, however, takes a different thank you. It is not a nudge-nudge flashing look at the stupid people and their clueless antics but a sincere gratitude for Bollywood for its vitality, its lack of irony and self-awareness. It is obvious that the director has a tremendous love and respect for bollywood, while being confused by his kitschier aspects. And if you have a familiarity with Bollywood, you can appreciate what he's doing here to make a true hybrid of Bollywood and Hollywood movie conventions. From one of the opening shots, a recall of the Salman character as a child by the sea, and talking to his grandmother (played by Helen! - how many Salman movies start with the same prize?) To the flashback sequence incorporated in Films filmed by Marigold and Prem, anyone who has seen enough Bollywood movies will recognize these references. History also incorporates true conventions from both Hollywood and Bollywood? The fish out of the water meets the duty-to-a-family-at the expense of personal fulfillment. The structure of the film follows the typical Bollywood plot line of the more comical layout of the first half, allowing for a more dramatic resolution of the other. Still, the film's sensitivity is that of Hollywood, with its undervalued, angry humor and its story of a woman learning to believe in herself to reach self-affirmation. <br /> <br /> You couldn't have a movie inspired by Bollywood if there were no tracks, and this movie doesn't disappoint with seven of them. However, unlike Bollywood, the songs do not come out of nowhere and transport their characters to a European local or Goan beach; They exist as music tracks that are part of the movie being made, and recall how music tracks were justified in Busby Berkeley movies as part of a stage show. Or do they come from a situation where music already has a reason to be there? a sexy nightclub scene where Prem teaches Marigold to dance or a beach scene where there are musicians (including a cameo from the play singer Shaan) performing. Everything reflects the emotional state of the protagonists at the time of the film. Often the music will take a conventional song from a genre and put a twist on it from the other. So in one of the highlights of the movie where Marigold enters her, the song image is quite typical of her genre ?? the female star sings and dances among a line of women ?? But in this case, the blonde Ali Larter resembles a total natural Bollywood movie star, emotion and lip sync to the Hindi lyrics without subtitles. <br /> <br /> Also synonymous with Bollywood are lavish visual images, and Marigold fulfills this aspect beautifully thanks to some of the best talent working in Bollywood today. The film photographer is Anil Mehta, who was also a film photographer for Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The choreographer is Vaibhavi Merchant and production designer is Nitin Desai, both from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. You can really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam on this movie ?? In fact, the illuminated floor in one of the numbers was originally from Dholi Taro Dhol, who randomly has a nested marigold pattern. <br /> <br /> Of course, Carroll has a penchant for spotting merchant talent as it appears by playing the heart ?? one of the first films for both Angelina Jolie and Ryanne Phillippe. And in this movie he hits the mark again with Ali Larter. One of the main reasons for the movie is because of Larter. She makes a bitchy, unappealing character sympathetic and her subsequent transformation trustworthy, and she is smart, fun and sexy because she is smart and fun. She and Salman share excellent chemistry, and it is one of the film's greatest strengths. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan plays the role of Prince Charming here as filtered through his iconic role as Prem. This is old school Prem, but therefore expect a quiet, subdued Salman - those who cared for him in his usual stripping avatar may be disappointed ?? or relieved! It is a sincere and sensitive achievement from him who is only afflicted by bad setup of his English lines. <br /> <br /> With a refreshing lack of cynicism and pristine embrace of romantic love, the film is a love letter to Bollywood and Hollywood movies of yore.
