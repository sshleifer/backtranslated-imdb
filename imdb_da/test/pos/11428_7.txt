If you want to watch a movie starring Stan Laurel from the Laurel & Hardy comedies, this is not the movie for you. Stan would not begin to find the character and rhythms of these films for another two years. However, if you want a good travesty of Rudolph Valentino BLOOD AND SAND that had been done the previous year, this is the movie for you. All the stops are pulled out, both in physical comedy and on the title cards, and if the film is not held together by character, the plot is used for Valentino's film - kind of.
