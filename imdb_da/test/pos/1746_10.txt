Wow. I watched this movie and "Up" on the same day within an hour of each other at different theaters. I saw "Mr. Bug" first and was so completely disappointed with the "Up" follow-up. What a beautiful and touching movie! Movies from the 1930s and 40s to us today can be irking with their melodramatic plays and dialogue, but as animation, the same melodrama and groaning humor can be wonderful. And the soft "organic" lines of the 30s draw and the music just puts you in a good comfortable mood and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters: ladybugs, grasshoppers, bees, snails, stinkbugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, crickets, and more each with all their own cute little (but not indulgent) idiosyncrasies. The interaction with the human world, from nemesis (cigar smokers, high-heeled carriers, innocent kick-the-can-children) to the friendly and the unknown destroyers is realistic and fascinating. You're interested in the mistakes, AND Dick and Mary. The main character Hoppity is not a perfect superman who is going to "put things right" but a starry eyed optimist who leads everyone down the garden path (literally!), And every time you think it will end happily in 1930 's style comes along another roadblock ...! I was on the edge of my seat much more than with "Up". I went out of the cinema laughing and chuckling: something that hasn't happened for a long long long time!
