This movie blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison rebellion. After seeing this I see that I didn't know anything. The story is told through the relationship between the lawyer and the black prisoner. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolded courtroom drama became riveting. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. It is hard to believe that it was not documentary, it was so right. It was not just a fantastic piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter of American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper. I give it two thumbs up.
