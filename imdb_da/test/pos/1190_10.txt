Treat Williams reached a level of stardom with this movie and really wasted it. Don't be distracted from his bad movie choices since. This movie really stands out. "Hair" is a musical that really deals with the attitude, and probably more with the persona, of the 60's famous peace movement. There is very spectacular music done in a spectacular way. Unlike the music videos of the late 70s, 80s and 90s, the video flashes coincide with the music of the music. In other words, the video makes sense when it comes to the songs, so you know it could never have done it on MTV. The subject lives on drugs and are hippies, but it is mostly an anti-war film dealing with the meaningless tragedies in Viet Nam. One of the protagonists is an Oklahoma boy who intends to make a difference, believing in all the patriotic dribbles he has cut, and he is by a gang in New York that is more or less glorious hoodlums; their characters are very unique and would probably not make sense today, but this bunch ties together by burning their draft cards. What follows in some spectacular scenes and fascinating scenes involving not only the three leaders, but the other 3 gang members as well as a newcomer with a young child whose entry is easily one of the ten greatest entrances of all time in the cinema partly because she sings one of the greatest songs of that generation. Despite their mistakes, you will love these people, a cinematic triumph with a heart felt and a grand finale.
