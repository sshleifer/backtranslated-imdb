Great music, great dancing, a sexy star (Swayze) and actually sexual desire that is shown by a female character (a very unusual event!). You rarely see female characters that are motivated primarily by desire and that is a nice change. I also think the movie captures very well how it is to be a teenager who is clear in class and having ideals suddenly come up against reality. It is of course juicy in moments - it's a movie music - but all in all it's a real pleasure - a fun romance and also politically enlightened. This movie also has one of my favorite movie lines all the time: "I carried the watermelon."
