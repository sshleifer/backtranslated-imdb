I try to find a place to buy a DVD / VHS copy of the movie "Isn't it shocking?" I was 7 years old when I watched this movie and I lived in the city where it was filmed. A few things from my family were used in the movie as props, and a couple of my friend's homes were used in a couple of scenes. The film goes pretty well in the city and the surrounding community. I've only seen the movie once, and I want a copy, so now I can show my family movie. I have done extensive searches online with no luck and I wondered if anyone would have ideas about trying to get a copy of this movie?
