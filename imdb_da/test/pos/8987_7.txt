This movie starts out as a college T'n'A flick, but gets pretty ugly after the protagonist's sister has been raped by a bikerbike running a van. It has a pretty good pace, and James Van Patten does a pretty good job in this Cannon tax depreciation film. This was the first movie I ever saw on the Parkway Drive-in, here in Toronto. The main feature was "Alphabet City" and "Young Warriors was the added feature. Out of the 2 movies," Young Warriors "was much more entertaining and memorable. If you are a fan of blowing them up, exaggerated violent movies, this would make a good one addition to any collection.
