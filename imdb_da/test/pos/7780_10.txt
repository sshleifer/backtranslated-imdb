Love Jones depicts young young African-American men and women in a smart, positive and realistic way. I feel that all actors and actresses were magnificent and really did a great job of capturing the mood. Nia Long and Larenz Tate worked well together and I hope to see more work from the two. In fact, all the actors / actors would do a good job, it would be great to see another romantic comedy from them. This film is comparable to most well-written, romantic comedies. If you haven't seen this movie already I strongly recommend you do, it can certainly give you a different perspective on life and love.
