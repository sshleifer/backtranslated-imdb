Looks like the betting movie I've ever seen. not too much for intelligent perception, but then rich in emotional. Antonioni is comparatively wise for her movie. Malkovich is so organic, roles are so true, situations are so real. I've changed my world view after this movie theater. I am a novice literati in Russia - Tolstoy and Dostoevskiy - and I am sure seeing Antonioni is good and fun for russkies, because I and we understand his point of view. so i dont understand his smaller raiting on IMDb. I am sure we are speaking from Russia and our people, we like Antonioni because of his romantic soul and positive sense of the surrounding reality
