The movie is cheesy. Some of the players are over. Some of the actions are inexplicable and inexplicable. But ... <br /> <br /> This movie is in the state of 50 years of psychological drama. <br /> <br /> It's a moral game. Like the movie, where a "method" actor becomes the evil character he portrays on stage, Ed is forced to watch slasher films because he is the movie editor. It gives him a nervous breakdown that leads to a complete psychotic break. <br /> <br />
