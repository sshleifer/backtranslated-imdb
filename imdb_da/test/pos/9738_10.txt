I originally saw the Flash Gordon series at PBS, and thought it was fun and amazing, I overlooked the special effects of rocket ships with sparklers, and the big dragon monster with lobster claws, who cares about this is 1936, and it was a serial, so every week they would show a new chapter, buster Crabbe played flash Gordon 3 times in all 3 series. In 1939 he played buck rogers, in 1933 he played Tarzan the fearless. He was a very busy actor. Beautiful jean rogers played sexy valleys Arden.frank Shannon as professor zarkov and Charles Middleton played the evil man the relentless. he makes Darth Vader look like a boyscout.the series was very close to the Alex Raymond cartoon. Space travel was just a pipe dream at time.not to mention ray pistols and tv that one stands out as the best series ever. The successor flash Gordon's trip to Mars is 2 chapters longer, the next flash Gordon conquers the universe is only 12 chapters. and then there are natives of mongo .., hawk men, lion men, shark-m en.the function version leaves shark-men scenes. for the full effect you should see the complete serial. i heard George Lucas was inspired by flash Gordon when he made the star war. Gordon was from universal studios.and the music on the soundtrack is from many universal films such as Frankenstein's brother, werewolf of London, Dracula's daughter, etc. Even today, Flash Gordon continues to delight people young and old.10 out of 10.
