"Sharky's Machine" is apparently a Burt Reynolds vehicle designed to allow the star's space to span its talents, and he sprays the paintings, the movie plot with colors from other films and other styles, and offers a range of moods within a nutrition story. <br /> <br /> Made in 1981 at 119 minutes (long for the time period), the movie did well, with the box office grosses at $ 37,800,000. It was a lot to it: Burt Reynolds actor and director, a solid one-two blow; a William Diel novel adaptation and the southern part of Atlanta Georgia, at this time, a country for film production opportunity out of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Reynolds' Tom Sharky falls in love with Rachel Ward's Dominoe the hooker with a heart of gold is echoed here as it was in "Hustle" when he played opposite Catherine Deneuve, and that movie also had a corrupt Core politicians, but with the horrible ending not the Hollywood happiness of the "Sharkys Machine". <br /> <br /> The story is pure Detective procedure / actioner. Sharky a drug specialist fails a chest of a drug dealer who causes the killing of some innocent onlookers, and gets demoted, literally transferred to trainers, to deal with perverts and other misdemeanors, that 'upstanding' police are considering latrine duty. His new graves give him the chance to meet many equally senior officers who do the dirty jobs that no one else wants. When attention points to a particular pimp, Sharky sees some evidence and discovers that a particular prostitute Dominoe (Rachel Ward) - Dominoe is being foreclosed by police forces and political forces, and Sharky sets herself up for a 24-hour surveillance force to see her . During the time he sees, he learns that current governor-elected Hotchkins (Earl Holliman) visits Dominoe, like a beautiful Italian gangster Victor (Vittorio Gassman). Before the police can build a case with the evidence, Billy, Victor's brother, shoots a cola snorting gun (Henry Silva) through the door of Domino's apartment apparently killing the beautiful domino, but when Sharky discovers that the murdered victim was actually a roommate Tiffany (Aarika Wells) Sharky confronts Victor and tells him to arrest him. Sharky is caught by some ninja-killed led by Smiley (Darryl Hickman) and tortured to get information to lead to Domino, but Sharky overmanages them and arrests the governor and in a heated hunt kills Billy after killing Victor. <br /> <Reynolds wants to exhibit the hardened policemen's inner work to fall in love, but police history plot, tasted with noir element and Reynold's film development capability tends to smooth the dynamics of relationships. <br /> <br /> We will learn something about some of the men, and this leads us to justify why they work against their pensions in vice, instead of fighting real crime. This element of the movie seems outlined during Reynolds' off-handed direction and performance. <br /> <br /> A Reynolds movie is always unique. He likes to hire stars, either character actors or others, and then let them improvise, sometimes with varying results. <br /> <br /> With his crew member in "Sharky's Machine" he gets some nice moments, and sometimes some overblown is grandstanding but always a sense of ensemble and kindness. With Reynolds as an author, it works. <br /> <br /> Reynolds seems the actor / writer to be smirking for himself and the viewer as saying that it is all false but fun. <br /> <br /> Big line: On the stage with Victor, when Sharky throws the calf down, "You're walking around like yourself, and you want to know the worst part? You're out of state." This seems to be the biggest offense the officer can throw at a criminal. <br /> <br /> Reynolds made the film in Atlanta at his career point has shot himself reading the phone book and would certainly have targeted and demographic. /> <br /> The movie marked the appearance of Rachel Ward, nominated as Star of the Year in 1981 by the Golden Globe. <br /> <br /> Reynolds has always had presence and power and has chosen to make movies close to home, Georgia. <br /> <br /> I got my DVD from half.com to $ 7.99, and unfortunately it doesn't contain any comments or feature making, which is a shame. Maybe the next generation has them. <br /> <br /> The movie is still very fun, and both Reynolds and Ward are great players in their prime.
