Chop Shop, the second feature of Ramin Bahrani, is a rare breed. It's an American movie that tells a story not found in American cinema, the story of a minority living in poverty. It is a work of simple beauty. Shot on location in Queens, New York in the shadow of Shea Stadium, Chop Shop is new realism to the core. With a cast of non-actors, it has more in common with Vittorio De Sica's classic Bicycle Thieves than anything made in the United States. There is no score or soundtrack, all music and sounds are diagetic. Seeing it feels like watching a big foreign movie, it takes us to another world because it is so rare to see. But this other world is not post-Second World War Rome or Istanbul or New Delhi, it's modern New York City. Bahrani tells the story of Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), better known as Ale. He is a 12-year-old Hispanic child without parents or family unity to take care of him. He lives in a small room upstairs in the auto shop, which he also works on. He shares the same bed with his teenage sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales). None of them have made it to second class. Ale, though young, is tough and mature. He serves as the head of the small family. He picks up his sister with a job, and he does everything he can to make a buck when he's not working in the chin. He sells bootleg DVDs on the streets and candy in subways. He searches for scrap auto parts and sells them to the many car dealerships on the street where he lives. Alejandro is heartbroken when he learns that his sister is working nights as a prostitute. He gradually becomes uninterested in complying with the law. He begins to steal, first car parts and later wallets. Like Antonio, the desperate protagonist of bicycle thieves, we cannot blame Ale for becoming a thief. It's just survival. Ale and Isamar are hiding in the hope of buying a food van for $ 4,500. They see the habit as their way out and there is much optimism. But as is usually the case in neo-realism, we know that this will only lead to disappointment. <br /> <br /> The exact performance of Polanco is what gives legitimacy to Chop Shop's realism. Here is a 12-year-old character who must be credibly independent and vulnerable naive. Whether he is driving cars to the store, selling movies and Snickers bars or playing with his sister in their sparse space, it's authentic. Chop Shop is a horrible reminder that not all American children grow up in a country of opportunity. Ale lifestyle is what many middle-class white Americans consider 'third world'. They draw attention to poverty and deprivation in foreign countries while sipping their coffee and reading the New York Times on Sunday morning, but blind themselves to their own streets. Once you've seen the Chop Shop, you'll think differently about the kids who taste candy on the subway. <br /> <br /> More reviews at www.mediasickness.com
