When the circus comes to town and places the lion cage directly over Bugs Bunny's home, Bugs ends in the area just between freaked out and intrepid. Despite the title "Acrobatty Bunny" it is only at the end when Bugs and the Lion perform acrobatics. But even before that, it is quite fun what Bugs do to escape being eaten; somehow he always manages to use the second character's weakness against him, and then pull any appropriate object out of thin air! Bugs later ended in the "Big Top Bunny" circus. I liked this better as the latter got drugs down a bit by giving the antagonist an Eastern European accent (I know it was during the Cold War but still). I recommend this one. <br /> <br /> And at the end we can confirm that it will never be Aloha Oe for this cartoon.
