I first saw "Signs of Life" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written ensemble production with amazing performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is closing. The rest of the cast, which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker, gives remarkable clarity and content to their characters. The direction is subtle and effective. I have seen this movie several times over the years and would highly recommend it. A beautiful piece of film cabinet.
