For the 1980s, this is a very dark film. At this point, filmmakers began to operate, provided all movies require smarmy comic relief (which of course is extremely present), flashy action scenes (even more overdone today) or steaming sex scenes. /> <br /> Hutton and Penn are overwhelming in their roles when childhood friends beat Soviet spies. Penn especially is brilliant as an inappropriate drug dealer Daulton Lee. <br /> <br /> What you have here is a true thriller / drama. There is no eye to talk about, but the story is so convincing, and it is so amazing that (hopefully) most would not miss it. There are a few fun scenes, especially the one in which Penn tries to get his Soviet welfare officers involved in a major drugrunning agreement. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
