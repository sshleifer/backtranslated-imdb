A curly police officer suspects a French Duke to be the infamous thief ARSÃˆNE LUPINE. <br /> <br /> For the first time, John & Lionel Barrymore spent a movie in this exciting crime drama. Yet so different, they are the perfect counterpart to each other. John plays his role with suave sophistication (when not in disguise) and Lionel is earthly and ordinary in his depiction, each of which has a wonderful time trying to accomplish the other. Helped by a generous script, the result is almost a draw, with the viewer the clear winner. <br /> <br /> Although emerged from the two male stars, Karen Morley is intriguing as the mystery guy John finds naked in his bed. Tully Marshall gives a colorful performance as a silly nobleman with much to lose to the criminals. Henry Armetta & George Davis are very pleasant as two seriously inappropriate security guards. John Miljan delivers a solid presence in his small role as a police advocate. <br /> <br /> Movie Maven recognizes an unredited Mischa Auer as a guide in the Louvre during the climatic scene dealing with a trial of the Mona Lisa.
