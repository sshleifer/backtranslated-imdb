* SPOILER ALERT !! DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOVIE GAME! !! <br /> <br /> I was originally planning to watch this movie last weekend, but my plans ended up not having time to watch it. So I and my friend made plans to see it after school today. Boy, are we glad we did. The movie starts in Italy with a planned hoist with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as "Napster" [Seth Green, you get the nickname later], Handsome Rob [Jason Statham ], Left Ear [Mos Deaf], and John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) are planning a heist to steal 32 gold stones. This leads to the entire opening, which is a good 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a boat hunt that opens up the movie properly. As they drive away in their get away van, Steve Frezelli bets on the group, steals the gold and kills John Bridger, who is largely the group's (pensioner) leader. Fast foward to a year later when Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is one of the best safe crackers anyone can ask for. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for his father's death when he called him out of retirement for the horse) says they have found Steve (who's gone to hide) and wants to come back to him for what he did . Initially she falls, but later agrees, and holds together again, along with getting the wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to perform the perfect hoist while creating one of the greatest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This movie is a perfect blend of action with fun bits thrown throughout. There is an ongoing joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, who creates Napster, and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a como) stole it while he fell asleep, and eventually Lyle will only respond if you refer to as "Napster". There is even a fun line in the movie of Seth that goes. "He said in an interview he called it Napster because it described his hair as it was bleached. He called it because I * snatched it when he stole it!" The beginning and ending sequences are pure geniuses and everything in between fits perfectly. The only negative I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton's play was a little weak. He wasn't a big, bad guy. He acted as if he was being paid and just doing the absolute minimum (which is a fact when he was forced to make this film because of contractual obligation). But although this problem is the only real grip with the movie, the movie is still very entertaining and I definitely recommend seeing it. And even if you are not interested in the current movie, you should see Seth Green shine in comedy role. He is perfect. Rating: **** out of *****
