I saw Le Conseguenze Dell'Amore at the 2005 Rotterdam Film Festival, it was the first of ten movies I saw there. <br /> <br /> Le Conseguenze has left the most powerful impression of the ten films. From the first shot, you know that the movie is something special. The beautiful cabinet left me in awe of what can be done with a camera. The music is also on par with the pictures, which complement the colorful and stylish architecture-like images. <br /> <br /> Toni Servillo plays the protagonist of the movie, Watch. He is a tax expert wrongly living in a hotel. Every week he brings a suitcase with money to a bank, and the story plays around this. <br /> <br /> He is always very controlled and shows almost no feelings to anyone; Looks calculated and well dressed. He has a habit of ignoring people who have no bearing on him. For example Sofia (played very nicely by Olivia Magnani) who works as a barmaid in the hotel where he lives. Although she has been working at the hotel for two years, he never greets her even though she greets him. In one day he confronts him with this, and the next day he sits in the bar, instead of his usual place by a window. From here, the story really begins and unfolds in a strong tale of love, sacrifice and mafia. I don't wanna ruin the rest of the movie. Watch this movie if you love stylish movies like those from David Lynch, The Godfather, etc. Don't watch this if you're an action buff.
