All interested in Texas must have this DVD. It's just a great movie about real Texas with amazing scenes. It took a bunch of Texans to do this right. Hollywood would never have gotten it. There are so many subtle things that Tubb put into the movie and maybe not even thought about, but the show does. <br /> <br /> Guest cameos are not seen as cameos at all. Each star fits perfectly and does not distract the film. Many of the guests spot blend so perfectly that when the credits roll you will go back through the movie to find the sign. Strait's role is dead, it couldn't have been better done in real life. <br /> <br /> The other half of the movie is quite different from the first one, it gets a little "hokey" but it's okay. Somehow the story works. "Hokey" stuff is like a post-school special, but it looks credible and natural. <br /> <br /> I've never heard anyone use the Sonny Pruitt line before, except the locals I grew up with. It was icing on the cake for me. Definitely a collective, right up there with Pure Country, Sugarland Express, Jr. Bonner, Texasville, The Last Picture Show, Giant and of course Skin. <br /> <br /> Gig'em Aggies '86
