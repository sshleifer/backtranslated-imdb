Manna From Heaven is an easy comedy that uses exaggeration of human fables to entertain the audience. Throughout the film there is expectation that goodness will surface in every situation. The result is that the filmmaker finds himself with this stupid grin on his / her face, peace in his heart and high expectations of human kindness. Watching this movie was a most enjoyable experience. (I would venture to say uplifting experience, but some would say it sounds corny !!)
