My friends and I saw this at the San Diego Black Film Festival. It was good. Stormy is a strong black woman, and Nana reminds me of my grandmother. <br /> <br /> Clean is fine !!! Seeing him taking his clothes off was definitely worth the access. Can anyone forward me his contact information? <br /> <br /> My friend thinks Flex is the best of the two. She has been a Flex fan for years, but then she can be a little biased. The cousins ​​were funny and as small as Nana described them. LAUGH OUT LOUD. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to seeing this movie again when it comes to theaters.
