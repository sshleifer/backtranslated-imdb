The Decalogue 5 can be regarded as a violent accusation against the death sentence according to the fifth commandment: "Do not kill": do not randomly put the concept of a state fully in line with the provisions of an unjust law on the same plane as the figure of a killer " the law cannot mimic nature, it can correct it, "says Piotr, the defense councils, a real catalyst character," the punishment is a form of revenge aimed at turning evil into evil without preventing the crime in whose name the law claims? in the name of the innocent? ". The dreadful and detailed sequences of the last half hour of a man condemned to death provide value for the disadvantage of the deterrent function of the death penalty for the purpose of intimidating all potential criminals. "Desperate suffering does not require desperate remedies," Kieslowski says in his message and teaches us how unjust can be a disobedience to a commandment from God that judges the punishment in the same way as crime is judged. There are three different moral attitudes here: Mothers' sincere sense of rebellion, aiming to awaken the hostile environment in the surrounding environment; the strong sense of VICTIM's chronic indifference tends to laugh at the demands of others; COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENSE's meritorious behavior is always ready to combat adversity in favor of human life. The struggle for life is ruthlessly vivisected all the time; The characters are thrown into scenes of suffering and distress, in a cityscape accented with green tones and seen in its own reflections through the windshield of a taxi. Everything in "Decalogue 5" produces a terrible sense of alienation and isolation: descriptions of a blurred undergrowth of violence and stupidity, scenes of precarious working conditions, monstrous appearance of buildings immersed in an anonymous destruction of aura, futile wanderings through unpleasant environments. Jazek, the protagonist, is forced to fight with an opponent stronger than himself: A city completely wrapped in deep indifference, apparently hostile, deaf to all his dumb calls for help, while a faded picture of a little girl in a first nightgown continues to gnaw his soul. He steers his steps to an interrupted route of condemnation, seen through the 18 mm deformations. The wide-angle camera lens aims at distorting all details, changing reality, making it fade into distant and alien echoes. Kieslowski does not provide attenuating circumstances seasoned with melodrama's honey-tongues in favor of the defendant, different from some Hollywood stereotypes such as "I Want to Live" (by Robert Wise). He does not slip on the banana call of useless pathetic scenes to radiate Jazek's guilt and soften the brutality of the crime and is not at all interested in nearby psychological motivations to justify any expulsion of extreme or violent behavior and refuses to include any useless judicial case . In other words, in Kieslowsky's view, "a crime is always a crime": according to the "par condicio" principle, he puts the prosecutor on the same plane as the condemned man by using many signs or symbols to represent a society seen in the most scary light. And we cannot remain indifferent: Although we do not agree with him, Jazek's scream of anxiety touches our heart with compassion as Terri Schiavo's hurting eyes do.
