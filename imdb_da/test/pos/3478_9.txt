When I was 10 (currently 14), I never promised to watch a movie I knew would not have a good ending. And until a couple of weeks ago I had done well, except for Shakespere for English class ... etc. I still only looked at things that ended with happy. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, who was sweet, not good, but entertaining enough to watch. After seeing this a couple of times during the two or so years since I first saw it, I grew to like it, especially the music. So I searched for her and found IMDb ... I saw "Inside In Dancing" and assumed she had made another dance movie, and over looked it. It was later a picture search (by Rory, looking for Gilmore Girls poster for closet) I picked up a picture from this movie ... I searched for a trailer, I found the trailer and when I saw the hospital and heard Rory say "You have the future "I remembered my promise and realized that it would not be a good movie for me. But it was just backwards until we were in the video store and there it was for $ 5 spent so I went ahead and bought it. After seeing it, I just wanted it out of my head because it was so sad. I still wouldn't go near it until I had cerebral palsy as a vocabulary. Then I just had to see it again and this time was all I did, laugh, even in the mournful parts I no longer felt depressed because I realized that all this movie was happy and uplifting ... I love It, and it is now one of my favorites, I; m, that's the worst comment you've ever read. But watch the movie, it's worth it.
