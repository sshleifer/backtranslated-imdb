Jamie Foxx is definitely Ray Charles. His performance is simply genius. He owns the movie, just as Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid owned "Great Fire Balls". In fact, it's hard to remember that that part of Ray Charles is being traded and not played by the man himself. Ray Charles is legendary. He is well established as a musician and the music is deep, complex and innovative ~ even more innovative than I realized before I saw this movie. The film will make new fans of a young audience who may come into it and know a little about his music. Ray Charles's life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes far beyond being just another movie about a musician. I confess that I knew very little about human life until I saw this movie. I was impressed by Ray Charles' courage, strength and innovation as a man and a musician.
