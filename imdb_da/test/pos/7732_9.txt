Just lovely. It is long. No climax. Don't wait for something to happen. Great for a rainy day. About a man in a mid-life crisis taking his family to a remote area of ​​the Greek islands. I saw this in my teenagers and still love it 20+ years later. However, I have not been able to find it in video stores. Molly Ringwald is a cute average teenager who wants to go home and then turns into the place. There are no phones, no television, boredom, which when struck with silence such, the human state must be bored and then reflect. And every character does it. Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who would like to be sexually involved in John Cassavete's character, but he can't do it well. Gina Rowlands, is the wife who loves him but is about to give up their marriage. He is demanding and frustrating for everyone. There is another character in the film, a Greek that speaks to Molly Ringwald inappropriately about sex, but things that she is curious about. But he is annoying and horny and I did not like this character. The film's location is what makes this movie so good. It wouldn't work if filmed elsewhere. I recommend this movie and give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.
