It's such a beautiful movie! It shows not only war, it also has friendship and love. Slam's life is filled with grief, every aspect of his life falling apart. I can only imagine how he would feel when his friend made the ultimate sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I see a little resemblance to Pearl Harbor, which is also about two pilots falling in love with the same woman. But this film is much better made because this does not portray the woman as being unfaithful and easy. The friendship between the two men is also much more convincing and well-built. I definitely recommend this movie to all people.
