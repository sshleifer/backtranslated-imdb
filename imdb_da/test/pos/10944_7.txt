Well, don't expect anything deeply meaningful. Most of the battle scenes are pretty decent. The two leading ladies are quite endearing, but their lack of HK action background sometimes shows. Maybe the end is missing something, but I enjoyed it anyway. The cheese humor won't suffice to appeal to someone who hasn't seen a bunch of HK movies, but if your down with that kind of thing and have a few hours to fill with something meaningless, you can do much worse than this. (OK, so you could do better, but .......) <br /> <br /> Certainly on par with most of the Hollywood blockbuster action drifts. <br /> <br /> 7/10
