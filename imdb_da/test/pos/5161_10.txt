There is no plot. There are no key signs. There are no moving cameras or close-ups. In fact, this film does not follow any of the conventional storytelling techniques used by mainstream movies. But Roy Andersson's Du Levande is a remarkable piece of film history. It is a touching look at the human psyche. <br /> <br /> Consisting of a series of vignettes, Roy Andersson gives us an intimate insight into what makes us all people. In perfectly framed static shots added with the perfectly fine, yet quirky, music, Roy introduces us to a wide variety of characters as they assume their daily existence. Some who are bordering on tragic, others hilarious, we are on a Nordic journey like no other. It is a journey into the small things that make us human. Instead of over-the-top storytelling or visual techniques, everything is stripped down to the absolute minimum, so our only focus is on the characters themselves. It focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us who we are; our dreams, our desperation. It is through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals. <br /> <br /> The leached colors and lethal-pale makeup of the characters only seem to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike those we all live. There is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this movie, but you leave the cinema with a sense of life. Much more accessible than his previous movie, Songs from The Second Floor, Du Levande, is a truly inspirational piece of cinema.
