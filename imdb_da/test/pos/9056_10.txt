I tend to be free of film festivals and not enjoy slap-stick comedy, but I have to say that this picture was amazing. I immediately recognized David Krumholtz from the TV show "Numbers" and Lorraine Bracco, Roseanne Arquette and Karen Black were at their usual best. This is comedy at an incredibly high level with visual, spoken and satirical interludes that kept the audience and I laugh through a rather deep root. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Mr. Parness to deal with a delicate but genuine subject in a way that can be enjoyed but fully absorbed by his audience at any level of intellect. The plot remains intact throughout the film, and the comic relief adds the message without being put on so thick that it is distorted. The blend of segways is beautifully made and the overall product is wonderfully tasteful. <br /> <br /> I can clearly say that this movie is one that will go a long way and should be seen by the audience of all ages; the problem is real and it is also the powerful effect of this production.
