I watched this movie on a special screen. At first I thought the movie would be like a typical Amanda Bynes movie, but I was wrong. The movie is based on the Shakespeares book "The Twelth Night" This film tells the story of a girl living to play football. Once the girls' teams are cut, she has to go a long way to get on the fire team at another school to avenge herself on the selfish fire team at her old school. On the way she gets caught up in a long interconnected web of love, lies and deception. This movie is this year Mean Girls. I think it shows some amazing new actors' abilities, and there are some great stars to join in this movie.
