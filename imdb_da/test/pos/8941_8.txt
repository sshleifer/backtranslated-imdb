This movie had a distinct Woody Allen mood about it, so if you are not a fan of dry humor, dark humor or backbone humor, you could probably find something else to do. If you are, however, this is adorned with some beautiful phrases and a fluid, natural dialogue. The story itself is quite engaging, not quite like a train wreck, from which you cannot release your eyes but close. I think this is best possible. The intrigues are abundant, the twists are enough to fully engage the senses, and the characters are actually lovable. <br /> <br /> I was having fun with this movie. <br /> <br /> It's considering a 8.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend :.
