I thought I had experienced any wrinkle that the crime / gangster girl had to offer, but the Garrett-Marcin-Hammett combination pulls some real tensions and surprises here, thanks to Mamoulian, the atmospheric photography of Lee Garmes, plus remarkably sharp movie editing and flawless special effects. Brilliant plays also helps. Coop gives one of his most convincing performances as the reticent hayseed-turned-fearless bootlegger (the kind of character progression he was supposed to repeat in other roles like Sergeant York). Miss Sidney (image center) in her first major role is also an eye-opener. The principles are greatly supported by Paul Lukas, Wynne Gibson and Stanley Fields as the heavyweight, and even from Robert Homan's hard-as-nail detective. The film has, of course, been realized on a comprehensive budget, which is brilliantly deployed in its realistic, crowd-filled sets.
