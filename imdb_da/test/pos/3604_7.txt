A lovely and comfortable film full of mediteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful Greek island) that holds many of the novel's properties. I think Greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing I did not like at all is that the protagonists, like "Mandras" and Pelagia's father were not Greek actors, but foreigners. I think the actors were trying to express the Greek lifestyle, but for me it failed, and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation, when they tried to use Greek words, was terrible, and it was bad for the movie's plot. Irene Papas was really good in her role, a typical example of a mother living on an island during the 40s who has lost her husband and is trying to live a child alone. John Hurt, the father of Pelagia, also acted well. He reminded me of a Greek in many of his reactions.
