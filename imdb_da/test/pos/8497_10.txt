First of all, it is pure joy to hear the legend performing so wonderful and timeless music. This movie and soundtrack is a tour de force. Ray Charles is unique and amazing. I really loved the movie as it was inspiring and entertaining all the way through. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx has become one of Hollywood's leading actors, as evidenced by Ray, and he should receive an Oscar for this role, which is unprecedented. In fact, anyone working on this movie should be given recognition. I really liked Kerry Washington, who played the extraordinary wife ... of course Ray Charles married well. Regina King is a fine actress as well as the extraordinary Sharon Warren who plays a struggling young mother. Frankly, I would say that the whole project was arranged in an orderly manner. The whole cast was perfect, fantastic manuscripts and amazing settings ... great props for Taylor Taylor and the crew to do such a fantastic job of bringing Ray Charles life to the screen so flawlessly. This is my picture of the year, certainly one of the best biographical films ever made.
