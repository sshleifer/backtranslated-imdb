I really enjoyed this movie. It is rare to find a star that can pull the physical aspects of any sports / dance music movie convincingly and do a first-class job. In this movie you will find two stars rising to the apartment. Both women provide warm, touching and sometimes humorous performances. The film also touched on a number of topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. And yet the supply was not heavily handed over. The production values ​​were also top class for a small budget film. I saw this at the Philadelphia Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and went back to see it another time. It was a real crowd pleaser. Everyone I spoke to seemed to enjoy this movie.
