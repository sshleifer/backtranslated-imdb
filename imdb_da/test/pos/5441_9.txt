Robin Williams is a genius. One of the best comedians in the world. He turns out really well in this one and blasts jokes left and right as talk show comedian Tom Dobbs. From the foregoing it looked like it would be a sidetrack laugh. And it was funny. But there were many serious parts in the movie that I didn't expect. I would describe it as a drama / comedy. But it's still worth the money and I still found almost everything I expected. Robin Williams is at his best with the famous Christopher Walken. They play a very good team in this movie and I was actually shocked to see how well the two were able to work together. I recommend it to anyone looking for a light hearted movie.
