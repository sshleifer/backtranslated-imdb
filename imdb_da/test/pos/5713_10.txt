John Leguizamo's one-man show is both more fun and more involved than most movies you want to see. A variety of devices, such as slide projectors, are used to enhance history, but it is essentially good old-fashioned performance art. In particular, check out his hilarious rendition of "I Will Survive". * Highly recommended.
