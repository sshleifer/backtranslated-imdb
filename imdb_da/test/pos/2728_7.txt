As everyone knows, 15 Park Avenue is the story of a schizophrenic girl and her half-sister. Schizophrenia's manifestation is still considered a disease that people often feel may disappear if ignored. There are also those who, but so far retrieved, may seem when it is shown in the film, believe that the disease manifests itself as a result of some kind of supernatural influence. I think Ms Sen deserves a great praise for "15 Park Avenue". She has made a good trip not only to the public but also to those who deal with schizophrenics ... family members, social workers, psychoanalysts. The movie actually helps remove many myths and misunderstandings about the exact nature of this psychological disorder. I am told that the film is largely based on its own personal experiences with a person who is very close to her who suffers from this mental disorder. In this respect, I am sure none of what has been shown is blown out of proportion ... on the contrary, it is a true representation of facts. The performances are good, on the whole, as one might expect. Concern Sen Sharma, Shabana Azmi and of course Rahul Bose, are very good. They appear to be very "real" characters ... trustworthy enough to identify with them at times. People may think terribly queer, but I think there are moments where you can also identify with Meethi! I suppose we all have a touch of "insanity" inside us .... maybe some more than others. These are the people who are designated. After all, don't we all have our secret fantasies and dreams? Impossible, at times? Would we be called as "off our rockers" if people could glimpse into those areas of our minds? Would a person with low self-esteem be considered a schizophrenic because he / she shines company ... prefer instead to live in his own world because it is the only room where there is a sense of security? <Br /> <br /> The condom, like Meethi, is excellent !! Her performance is so effortless ... she lives her part. She has shown the ability to venture the audience to forget the division between reality and acting! An example is the part where she is worried on stage, shown on television, about Saddam Hussein's arrest. Her reaction seems so uninhibited and intense ... as if she's really heartbroken in this tragedy! Her brand of Indian English is also so spontaneous and natural. <br /> <br /> But the same cannot be said for at least a few of the other players. Kanwaljeet and Waheeda Rehman, amazing actors both, seem dissatisfied when they deliver their dialogue in English. Their diction is less than perfect ... stalked and touched, the fact that they make a lot of effort becomes more than obvious. Their dial-up version breaks and tends to break the smooth flow of unfolding the story. <br /> <br /> The violent rape of Meethi (Konona) seems a little unnecessary. Any other event would have been just as good, I feel. The point here is that something triggers the extreme manifestation of the disease. As the psychiatrist explains, one cannot say with any conviction or certainty that the rape incident was instrumental in bringing the latent propensity to schizophrenia to the fore. So why are we exposed to the scene where Meethi lies bleeding and unconscious. Was Mrs Sen trying to make a social statement on the politics of our country, where the masses of the masses are silent by a handful of people who are going to violence to become power ?? If so, the scene of the rape is justified, but not strictly related to the main body of the film. The end seems somewhat abrupt. Is the audience expected to find a solution? Where does Meethi disappear? Will Ms. Then have us feel that maybe what the psychiatrist is saying about, whose reality is more real and thus credible? In other words, does she try to say that we are not incalculable when we judge who is on this side of the fine line between coziness and insanity? I'm not very sure. <br /> <br /> A thoughtful movie on the whole and worth seeing. But if you are the kind of person who likes things to be neat and tidy ... everything cut and dried, with a waterproof solution to every problem that comes up ... This movie is clearly not meant for you!
