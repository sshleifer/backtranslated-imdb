On the way to a country house to hear a new game, a theater producer, his secretary and the dramatist are read off in the mud. They go to a nearby house, only to end up in the playwright's fiance. If you can't guess that murder and chaos are taking place, you haven't been aware. <br /> <br /> This is a good entry into the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very fun a liners wandering through it. The cast is excellent throughout and they are more than willing to feel good about the good material. <br /> <br /> I would love to say that this is one of the best of the genre it should have been, but for me something happened that made me score, to only seven out of ten. I can't tell you what it is, certainly not. Maybe it's the feeling that I knew where it was almost from the start, or maybe something else, I'm not sure what, but there was something I couldn't shake that made me like this movie despite wanting to love it. It just needed to be great and somehow fell. <br /> <br /> I said suggest you see it. After all, it is a very witty movie that fully entertains, despite the fact that it just has to be amazing.
