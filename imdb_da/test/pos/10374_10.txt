Aunt Cora had always been tactless, and her well-run family ignored the remark she made after her brother Richard's funeral: "He was murdered, didn't he?" They remembered it the next day when Cora was found brutally murdered with a hatchet ... For some reason, the POIROT films this year have been far from faithful to the original book. I was disappointed with the changes made in CARDS ON THE TABLE - my favorite Poirot book. AFTER FUNERAL is my 2nd favorite Poirot book and I was afraid the story would be destroyed. It wasn't! The film was almost aside faithfully all the way through to the murderer's motive! All the actors were wonderful, but my favorite has to be Monica Dolan, who performs well like Miss Gilchrist, accompanying the late Aunt Cora. Without a doubt the best Poirot movie ever!
