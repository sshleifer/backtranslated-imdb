I just watched this movie at the Berlin Film Festival Children's Program, and it just killed me (and just about everyone else in the audience)! And don't forget, this movie belongs to all the time 250! Let me tell you that I am by no means associated with the creators of this movie if that is what you believe in reading this. No, but it's actually it! Never remember the "Kid's movie" mark on it, "The Climber's" on almost all accounts is a classic (as in "Biblical")! The story relates to 12-year-old Ida (magnetic: Julie Zangenberg) who is destroyed to learn from her father's terminal illness. Special surgery in the US would cost 1.5 million and of course, no one can afford it. So Ida and her friends Jonas and Sebastian do what any good child would - and suggest a bank! Sounds corny? Don't Forget: It's not America, and the "Climbing Boot" is by no means the tear-up Robin-Williams multiplex-plat-du-jour, no one takes seriously anyway. Director Fabian Wullenweber set up to make a great budget-action comedy for children and boys, he succeeded! Let me put it this way: This movie rocks like no kid movie and few others did before. And there is much more to it than just "action". After approx. 20 minutes of the figure show (well given), it is accelerated to a monster that: <br /> <br /> - puts the "mission impossible" to shame (the numerous action sequences are masterfully set and look really expensive - tag it, mumi!) <br /> <br /> - Dwarf almost all other movie-voltage-wise (no light-the-only-kids antics here) <br /> <br /> - easily tighten a tight story with enough laugh getting jim carrey looking for career opportunities <br /> - nodding to both Damon Runyon and Karate Kid within the same seconds <br /> <br /> - comes up with so much evil humor as the side of pc that i can hear the american classification card wet their pants from here <br /> <br /> - actually being tender and serious and sexy at the same time (ohmygod, what do i say they are kids! they are kids! - let's see it last scene!) Stars Stafan Pagels Anderson, who since last year "Miracle" is everyone's favorite children's actor <br /> <br /> What a ride!
