I haven't seen this this year, but when I was about 6 I first looked at VHS and I must have seen it at least 10 times. now as I said it was a while so I could turn up the plot, but I remember that some Colombian terrorists took a prep school hostage claiming the main "missmaster" father to be released from prison . Now I could just check the plot here on IMDb, but I'm pretty sure it's right. In any way, a group of boys at school decide not only to sit and wait to die, so they decide to fight back. This film has always been stuck in my mind. There are so many pictures that I have not forgotten as Joey's (I think?) death scene or billy spit in the terrorists or one child (no idea of ​​his name) false asthma attack. just a good movie. It may be movies like this that have given me my tolerance for film violence, because if I remember, the movie is pretty graphic. boys are knocked down by helicopter guns, a special forces fire hand is blown by a grenade (not sure about it, but I seem to remember something in the end) and the most bloody is the leading terrorist being shortened in the gory detail . good action, good humor, good acting, wonderful movie experience. I have to see this again after all these years!
