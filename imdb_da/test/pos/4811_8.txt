I recently seen An zhan. Not because it was a Hong Kong movie, but because I was looking for a change from the movies produced here in the United States. In my humble opinion, I think the movie could easily compete against the action thrillers produced here, except for the traditional idiocyncracies of Hong Kong films. The one still bothering me was the character of the chief inspector. I still don't understand why there should be a complete idiot-comic-relief-type character even in the serious movies coming out of Hong Kong, but I can live with it when the movie is so good. The signs are trustworthy, even if the situations they are in are not. The story is fast and really sucks you into it. The real cincher scenes for me were the two bus routes that the thief character takes. Overall, a really solid movie.
