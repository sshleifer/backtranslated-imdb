This review is written by someone who has read it (several times) and knows what they are talking about! First, I have read other comments and noticed that some of the objections were really pretty stupid. People who have read the book and other Jane Austen's or, for that matter, any good book, will know that sticking to the book is crucial that you have to trust a writer with what they do. If the viewer does not like it because it sticks to the book well, it turns out that they do not understand Jane Austen and of course not a true fan. First, if the viewer really loved the book or Jane Austen in general, seeing it for four hours should not prove difficult. Secondly, their community has looked great for appearance, and so large, fancy hairstyles would show how rich you were, which in their day was a key factor in getting together in "good" society. I have to admit that the female costumes were not brilliant, but there were few bad ones, and the men made it for themselves. Also, this prejudice for the marine men who are not in their uniform is in fine words very stupid! Today people do not go out with their uniform away from school or work because they have casual clothes and it was just the same in the 19th century. Also as it goes the actor is very good, it is subtle, because that's how Jayne Austen writes! and the scene at the end is beautiful. You can't compare the movie with the 1995 version as the technology has improved a lot since it's ridiculous to compare them to it. The actor who plays Ann is too old, but her air to act and how she does it makes it. <br /> <br /> People seem to prefer the 1995 version for some reason I can't understand! It doesn't stay in the book at all and so flat, the end is sentimental, they change big scenes, the only good actors are the leaders, and those I give you did a good job for what was given to them. Clearly, the people who really like it are (I'm sorry) stupid as they don't understand persuasion and then need to be exaggerated. The 1971 version is beautiful, romantic, written by an excellent scriptwriter (same as Inspector Morse), had very good actors and it is really a movie you can see many times, and every time you can be happy about it.
