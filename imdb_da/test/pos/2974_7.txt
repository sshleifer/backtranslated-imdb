My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my dad ever did (get us in). This is "our movie" and the music is "our songs". Michelle sang is "our" song. Yes, today it is a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we turned 16, why not these kids? The movie errand boy impregnates the poor girl, so the kingdoms the dad steals him away from her at the end after she is born in poor conditions. She stands alone with the child. It's a love story and a "growing up" story. The music is amazing and the story is one that a person can relate to. Must be one day this will be released on DVD.
