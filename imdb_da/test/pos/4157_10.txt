This film is an impressionist, poetic influence on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the unrest and fear that may be associated with emigration. These are aspects that are not often considered in films about emigration to America in particular and to any country more generally, and the film shows live and convincing nervousness and enthusiasm if the ignorant is that the poor, illiterate, Sicilian immigrants have expected their emigration to the United States. <br /> <br /> They have some amazing, unrealistic ideas about the United States that are conveyed on the trip over. One is that the rivers run with milk, a picture depicted in the film for poetic, impressionistic effect. The film is without sound, and the silence seems to reflect the turmoil of the ignorance that locals have about life in America, or if it is not unaware of it, a vision that is markedly colored with superstition and imagination. <br /> <br /> That said, the film depicts jolting realism, the boat trip to the United States, and the intake process that the arrivals on Ellis Island had to go through. The boat trip is imagined as something boring, which was probably much of the time. The quarters where the built-in residents sleep are depicted as extremely crowded with beds separated four or five inches apart and lacking much light, which was certainly the case under the deck. <br /> <br /> Again the film is not supplemented with unnecessary music or too bright light and the effect is to create a rather realistic idea of ​​what it really was for people who emigrated to the United States. The villagers must not be worldly, but they are quite reasonable, and the interaction with the elders of the Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) emigrants with immigration officer insisting on certain results is rather bittersweet, insofar as they are not diluted or softened for the benefits of a syrup. conclusion, and the message of Sicily's realism is seen with the extensive rules governing life in the United States. Immigrants and their history are very interesting and the combination of cold-eyed realism and the magical imagination of people's imagination makes it a compelling vision of the beliefs that Sicilians or some people have, with little formal education moving to the United States. The action is also barebones; It is not at all demonstrative or flashy, but seems to be more realistic for it. That said, all the main artists, especially Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato), are the clear leader of the group excellent. While he never smiles, his character acts much higher, and it is clear that the other members of the group, his two sons and the aforementioned Fortunata, the boy's grandmother, trust his leadership skills and respect his clear leadership. Amato imbues his character with great decency and sincerity and it is a testament to his abilities that his character seems so good and secure, while his character detracts from very little. <br /> <br /> An oddness of the movie is an adventurous meeting with a mysterious English woman (the excellent and appropriate mysterious Charlotte Gainsbourg) who speaks Italian and throughout the film we wonder why she is going to the United States or what connection she has to the otherwise unanimous Sicilian emigrant group. Ultimately, this is finally revealed and the revelation typically happens realistically and does not work very melodramatic or flashy. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Emmanuel Crialese, who has a firm grasp of the realistic, sometimes superstitious worldviews inhabiting his characters and presenting it competently and safely. In fact, it is wonderfully sure given how scary realism and superstition could have combined in the movie. It is a worthy study of the immigrant experience.
