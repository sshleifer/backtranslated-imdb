Of course, seeing a few boom doesn't matter, does it? Lord, Rudy Ray Moore and D'Urville Martin really put this together, didn't they? I laughed a lot, which often happens in these types of movies, but I don't know what to laugh at because I laughed at so many other things. I'm not saying the movie was bad, but I would say that a little more editing would have done wonders. I'm a big fan of Blaxploitation, so I don't think it was terrible, but I know that "Human Tornado" was several times better than this. I think those who can do it through this movie might need a Colt 45 or two afterwards. I mean, it really doesn't help you notice the boom when you see it again.
