I can't believe I've never added my two cents about this movie yet! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies all the time. Many critics and filmmakers talk about John Carpenter's "Halloween" to set trends and be "his best work". These people have not seen this version of "The Thing" because it is right up there with "Halloween". John Carpenter's work shines in this movie. He took a movie that was already made, and instead of "recreating" the movie, he made the book the first movie was based on! Brilliant. <br /> <br /> The cast of each man was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, made me scare, made me guess, made me laugh, got me to ask questions, even until today "who goes there?" in that movie. This movie had no Hollywood sweetie pie or funny-type ending, and what a bold move not to have in 1982. Another brilliant move. <br /> <br /> I was screening for this movie when I was vacationing in Southern California. The audience at the screening went wild! I wear these memories for years, it was so much fun! We all thought there was no way in the green earth of God, this movie would not be a hit. But with receipts from receipts it was a dud because of "ET, The Extra Terrestrial" and "Poltergeist". Two very good family-oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came out. <br /> <br /> This movie was what I, as a horror movie adult buff, was looking for, a horror / thriller with an adult script and real adult actors. No children playing adults. Not a little Miss "big-breasted" scream-queen of the day ran around screaming for titilation BUT real guys with real trouble delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear. Heck, being a feminist, I didn't even MISS women in this movie! And good for Mr Carpenter by not putting in there, it really wouldn't have made sense! (Unless "Thing" was actually feminine! Something to think about!) <br /> <br /> I saw special effects of the time I had never seen before, I saw makeup that made me sit a few nights . That's what today lacks horror / thrillers. Today, the directors turn out. Today the studios stick out. Too much CGI and not enough faith, too much CGI and not enough history, not enough imagination. You leave the theater and for a week - or less - you forget the movie and move on to the next big movie opening. This will stay with you. It's one of the brands for an excellent movie. On many reviews I have written how to pay $ 10 for a movie horrible. For movies like this, you would pay it and not feel weak. This movie is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> I find it horrible that they make this movie a "cool" movie. I find that the audience is wider than many would make you believe, and although it wasn't a commercial success in 1982, this is an example of how to release a darn-good movie on the wrong date, Make a darn good movie look bad. After John Carpenter's movie, many people copied many techniques, make-up, special effects and stories from this version of "The Thing". I am now excited to go on record and say that this film is one of the best movies all the time, much under character. Please see it intact, see it in the mailbox and hear it digitally. You will also talk about it for years.
