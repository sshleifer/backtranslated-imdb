Firstly, I hate Sci Fi stuff, and even though this movie got a bit of Sci Fi at times, it is quite right, because it is at least focused on Andre Toulon. In the last 3, Others seemed to have been mentioned, but the stories never really focused on him, which made me angry. What also makes me angry is that the amount of 0 has come on the electoral roll. Give it a resting person. If you saw this movie and liked it, vote for it. Please. What I loved about this movie is that it went back to where it all started. When Others first learned the secret to life. I would recommend renting this if you have seen a puppet movie before and liked it. But don't rent it if this is your first time seeing one from the PM collection, mainly because you might think that all of the doll masters are as "stupid" as this one.
