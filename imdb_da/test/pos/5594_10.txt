Yikes! and we all thought Joan Crawford was THE horror Mommy Dearest ... Well Laura Hope Crewes as mother in this stinging 4 character movie delivers (and police) the goods in this cracker of a marital Mommy missing ..... THE SILVER CORD is a Genuine sensational pre-code drama from RKO made in 1932 released in '33 from a 1929 game. So amazing, honest and honest, every amazing verbal exchange between a son's wife (IreneDunne) along with others fiancé as these two younger girls go together in war - pleasingly voiding the utterly horrifying mansions of mother to her eldest son who played by virile Joel MacCrea and her younger 'beau' / son paid by the delicate and beautiful 25-year-old actress Eric Linden. I think this movie played to many howlingly appreciated audiences in big theaters in 1933 and giving the viewers in 2005 a very fruity melodrama lively in crackling dialogue, not afraid to call Mother just as she is. This movie would have been impossible to do after censorship code came in after 1934. Other viewer comments on IMDb support my response, and you will find almost all lucky enough to see (and tape) THE SILVER CORD will agree it is a unforgettable and crisp script in an excellently produced movie. It would have played as VIRGINIA WOLF from 1932. Laura Hope Crewes must have kissed the sound phase of RKO for this role in life. Even more than her soft ride in GWTW. Irene Dunne is as handsome and relaxed and trustworthy as ever and is fighting for her husband once again and it is worth seeing The Divorcée made in 1929 as a companion to THE SILVER CORD. Joel MaCrea is definitely in the same league as Cary Grant and Randolph Scott in the beautiful and lovable bets. I had never seen Eric Linden in a really functioning role before (he played the leg amputee in the hospital horror scene in GWTW) and here he is spectacular and youthful with an excellent role as Robert, the younger and more sensitive son. Some levels of verbal barbs again him would not pass the Code Office if done later. This is a great movie, and if the viewer forgives some of his time and sits on a sparring battle of unparalleled pungency for a 1932 movie, you will be well rewarded. First, I thought some of the throat patting the mother's melodrama was dated until I realized that it was a set up of the excellent manuscript to make the viewer laugh at her as if she were a weak little old lady. ..... DOES NOT. .... but neither are the other two women in this power plant playing on film, and thus the amazing retort dialogue. The ocean-liner seen in the reel is the LEVIATHAN monster ship, the United States won from the Germans in World War I, which was so big and unmanageable that crews were nervous wrecks trying to fight it on the Atlantic. It is notorious to plow the head up a colossal wave in a storm and shoot over the comb at such an angle that the spine along the bottom broke and the ship split vertically between the funnels. It limped to the gate with rattling steel panels and flashing rivet holes ... and mentally broken crew and passengers. It was blown up in 1935 after being cursed and plagued by horror mechanical problems throughout its existence. Not such a war premium after all. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the dialogue in THE SILVER CORD is enough excitement for one night: eg: "Mom! The doctor said there was nothing wrong with you, he actually said it would take a dynamite stick kill you ". Whammo!
