A bigoted soldier kills a man to be Jewish and tries to pin it on a soldier. Not as good as the novel it was based on ("The Brick Foxhole"), where it was a gay man killed ... but Hollywood wouldn't touch it in 1947. That said, it's still a lot good movie. Anti-Semitism is handled very well, but it's hammered into the audience that bigotry is bad ... Well duh! But this was 1947. The picture is well-liked by the whole cast (especially Robert Young and Robert Ryan) and the tone is very dark ... as it should be. Very atmospheric too. A deserved big hit in his time ... worth a look.
