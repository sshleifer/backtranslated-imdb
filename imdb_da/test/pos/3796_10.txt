I rarely write reviews, but this movie just requires more attention than it gets, as it contains the most hysterical kidnapping that has gone comic wrong sequence ever filmed. <br /> <br /> I only saw this once and found it to be the funniest movie I had ever had the privilege to see. I laughed from the beginning to the end. It's such a shame it's not out on DVD or video. You can only compare her movie with that of it's a Food, Food, Food, Food World or Promise her anything. Only this story is almost as complex as Mad World. <br /> <br /> In the near future, I hope this movie will be released as it would be a shame to lose such a comedy gem among the dregs we have today.
