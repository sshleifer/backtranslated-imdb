It seems that some previous reviewers may have had their expectations set too high into this movie. I found it to scan the satellite channels for something (not knowing what) and happened upon it. I thought by the title that it could be one of the countless soft core porn lights that regularly appear on the movie channels, but I was pleasantly surprised. Although there was some male frontal nudity (actually more than your typical soft-core title - go figure!), This was not the focus of the movie. It was just fun. <br /> <br /> Don't be deceived by my taste: My latest screenings have included Before Night Falls and Europe, Europe (both geat, IMHO). But I also enjoy total mental shutdown when watching a movie. Virtual Sexuality did it for me and that's not a bad thing!
