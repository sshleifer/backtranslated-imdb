Went out for this movie after I read Tom Clancy's "Red Storm Rising" novel. Timeless masterpiece of 13th-century Russians is invaded by the Germans. Movies were made in 1938 under the order of Joseph Stalin to warn Soviets of Hitler and Germany. The battle scenes are wonderfully done, showing that you don't need computer animation to make a great match scene. Probably Sergei Eisenstein's greatest work. See also 'Battleship Potemkin'. Any history buff or poli-sci major should watch this movie. 10 out of 10
