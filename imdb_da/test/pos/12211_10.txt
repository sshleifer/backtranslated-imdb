I would like if they took the surface back. I really enjoyed the show with my family. I felt the reason development and history were first rate. As the other person said, everything seems to be reduced to the lowest common denominator. Nothing but bland, politically correct junk survives. Just look at the internet to see how many people were watching the show. It's also not nice to let us know what happened to all the characters on the show. This is the same as the time travel show I think was called 8 days, but should have been called backstep. Did the Olympic Games kill the surface? I know the authors strike killed another of my favorite programs many years ago called the biggest American hero.
