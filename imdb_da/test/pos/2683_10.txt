In short, this is the TV comedy series with the best cast ever, and the most sympathetic too. Each of them is a first? Hand comedy actress. I know only one TV series that was better (ie, "Moonlighting"), that one had Willis as a management, but it only had Willis, while King of Queens has a pompous actor who is as fine as one can enjoy. Kevin James, Leah Remini, Jerry Stiller, Patton Oswalt, Nicole Sullivan, Victor Williams, Gary Valentine, and even all the others of them. I am spontaneous and continuous and like it. The advancing age did not destroy the fun, anyway. <br /> <br /> In a few words, the series is intelligent and original, miraculously spared by the current stupidity and garbage. It is politically incorrect and does not correct the minorities in the usual disgusting way. <br /> <br /> The comic is very tasty and tasty. I read, mostly approve, a few IMDb writers, and sometimes they write about their favorite shows, although these authors are numerous, I have not found any of them the least mention of my favorite TVs -shows (- but it is true that the critics one likes are not those with whom he finds himself in complete approval but those who at least offer a common basis for disapproval)? There are mainly WILD WILD WEST, MOONLIGHTING, QUEENS, FANTOMAS, 80s TWILIGHT ZONE, Bradbury's TV show and SANDOKAN. Most of them I've seen when I was 13 拷 拷 14 years; About a few of them I've written and execrably.
