I really enjoyed it both times, I saw it. And both times I went away and thought about it, and "history of history" a great deal. I agree with another reviewer because the movie is not centered on the sci-fi aspects you might expect from a film from the alien-on-earth, but rather about the human condition. The signs in the psychiatric hospital give a good insight into it, and how they go from hopelessness to hope. This film touches on the sadness of humor for sympathy with the final "is he or he is not". The last question was well handled, and although some might argue that you do not know what is happening at the end and the question goes unanswered, I feel it is done in more detail than something that is not desirable, says the film Ronin (with Robert De Niro) where you never find out what is in the box and feel very frustrated because of it. I highly recommend K-PAX. 8.10
