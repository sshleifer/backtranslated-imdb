This intelligent, moving and beautiful movie is a study of how people react to tradition (reminds me of William Faulkner's novels). The people feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are expected to assume, and seek a way to live within those roles rather than throwing them out completely. But as history develops, the two wives, caught in loving marriages, contract. Given the strength of their friendship and love, they give each other the courage to give up their roles. They have found that they live in their traditions, not at all life, it is a kind of living death: without passion, without true connection to others without fulfillment. Although they know, there will be a price to be paid for their rebellion and freedom. It is a price that is much less dear than the victim required by a pleasant and predictable existence. <br /> <br /> The play is wonderful, it is wonderful. Close to perfect!
