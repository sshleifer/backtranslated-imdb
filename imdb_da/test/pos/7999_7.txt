Batman Returns should be considered quality when talking about superhero film. In my opinion, the predecessor, Batman, is by far the largest and most thought-out of the cartoon genre. To say that Batman Returns was disappointing, he or she hasn't followed the movie fully and considered Danny Devito as Penguin. Devito and Walken offer some memorable moments. The story of Batman is supposed to be dark, and Tim Burton has fulfilled how the cartoon depicts Batman. Batman Returns provides comic relief, action, excitement and imagination; and it should not be considered "crap", although we are all entitled to our own opinions.
