I've been using this movie in my college ethical courses for over 10 years (also Woody Allen's "Crime and Misdemeanors" - another great, multi-level ethical study). <br /> <br /> It's fiction. I do not focus too much on the unrealistic features of "Strangers" because all fictional films are obviously fake on many levels. I love the movie as a gay comedy, tell you with many ironic twists and visual pleasures - even though it's "incredible". The story is told so well that I don't even think about criticizing its plausibility (although I have to admit that the tennis match seems to be the weakest part for me - too much Hollywood fluff and not enough tennis competition). <br /> <br /> Some issues presented in the film that promise realistic moral education and ethical discussion: <br /> <br /> 1. Ethical inaction: some weaknesses in Guy character are calculated by Hitchcock. A primary ethical insight into the film is the danger of inability to articulate one's moral attitudes. Guy can't effectively block Bruno's crazy suggestions at first. An interesting question is why and how does Gut behave passively, inefficiently? One possible answer is his depression because of his intense and complicated divorce process. <br /> <br /> 2. Miscommunication: Guy makes another failure at the beginning: On the train, to get away quickly, he agrees that Bruno's ideas are all good. But Guy's literal meaning is the opposite of his bent, sarcastic meaning. Bruno takes the literal meaning as an agreement for crossed murders. Guy takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder agreement. To some extent, almost at first, Bruno can partially pretend that an agreement has been made to advance Guy into a web of compassion. Bruno manipulates Guy; Guy's linguistic ambiguity on the train gives Bruno a chance to put an ethical "cattle team" on Guy. Bruno's manipulative Guy can also take on other meanings. . . . <br /> <br /> 3. Secret: Some have wondered about a sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno. Initially, it seems ridiculous, especially since Guy seems to be heterosexual in his relationship with Miriam and Anne. But remember that Guy is also ineffective with both women. Guy appears (stereotypically - it's 1951 remembers) effeminate, especially compared to Bruno. Guy, the strong athlete, is weak on the inside. Bruno is also contradictory (playing "against himself"), which appears to be physically and physically strong, but then shows some "effeminate" features (Bruno's fashion and footwork; he emotionally shakes Guy in different situations; he receives manicures from his doting mother Bruno kisses and desperately directs her mother's hand, other more subtle homosexual stereotypes that have cryptic meaning from Hitchcock's point of view). I wish I could hear Hitchcock clarifying his intended meaning here. <br /> <br /> 4. Dishonesty and Mistrust: Guy makes some colossal blunders of storing truths about Bruno from family and police. Guy fully fails to understand that error grabbing can quickly be better than a cover-up or a delay in confession. Again, Guy is driven by inaction, insecurity, fear - and perhaps a self-hatred that is closer to Bruno's own self-suffering than we usually see or admit. Both Guy and Bruno appear their own parables of impotence. <br /> <br /> 5. Lack of evidence: Guy feels a problem that measures the evidence to free himself. While you quickly go to the police would solve a major problem, Guy shuts himself with his own doubts and uncertainties: the absence of desired alibis; The inability of the alcoholic professor to testify on behalf of Guys the obsessive need to appear politically untouched; and other personality factors that make Guy feel defenseless. He is as dysfunctional as Bruno - just not that dangerous (yet Guy could be partially blamed for Miriam's murder). <br /> <br /> 6. Diseases and Mental Illness: An interesting question is how legally responsible is Bruno for the murders? The more ethically incompetent Bruno is like a sick sociopath, the more guilty Guy can be as a health that has not stood up and morally acted to prevent the crimes. Guy's failure is like a man who does not call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide and death follows. One can argue that more than one crime is committed and that Guy is an emotionally hobbled accomplice. These and many other features of the film make "Strangers on a Train" a gem of a moral game, a diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections.
