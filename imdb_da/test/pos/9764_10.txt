This movie is a sleeper - I've seen all the mini-series ever on TV, sometimes, and one is the best. Wonderfully cast, excellent act, and the characters are well developed. Helen Morse fits in perfectly with Jean Paget's part - strident, in control, sharp and somewhat warring. She jumps well out of Joe Harmon, cowboy / taciturn / "It'll be okay" kind of guy. I was sorry that the film did not stick to the book as there was no romantic interest between Noel Struan and Jean Paget. For those who do not know, it is taken from a true story of English women marching around Malaya for 3 years by the Japanese, who actually did not know what to do with them. Very few of them survived. Neville Shute spoke to one of them and this is her story. This movie deserves to be in everyone's collection that loves WWII stories.
