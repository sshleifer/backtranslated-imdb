Sometimes you stumble upon a movie that surprises you, and that's one of them. On the surprise scale, it would mean you sharing a hot tub with Jessica Alba, while a band consisting of Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Phil Lynott and Keith Moon play music at night. The reason why this movie will surprise you is that for the modest budget they had (Â£ 8,000) and that this was done by a bunch of buddy who just wanted to try it, they have produced something very flat and look easy 100 times more than its budget. <br /> <br /> The reason is simply a play of mercenaries carrying a dangerous prisoner through space, coming under attack and being forced to collide land on a nearby desert planet. After some checks, not only does the planet exist according to star charts, but they are not alone as it seems, and something very unfriendly begins to pick them one by one. It sounds like very standard Sci-Fi image selling elements of foreigners. Predator and Pitch Black, but it takes them all together and makes them feel fresh and original. <br /> <br /> The location in this is great when you use Balmeddie Beach in Aberdeen to the maximum and you really feel like you are a foreigner world. The seemingly endless dunes and clear light effects give it a very gloomy feeling, you really think the crew is stranded in a foreign world. The action sequences are also fantastic, the opening attack on the cargo ship is a good showcase of what special effects can be achieved on a budget and in the fire fighting as well as in the fantastic final that shows all the film's inventiveness. <br /> <br /> With regard to the mercenary's team radiates cast itself. For a low-budget independent film, the casting here was made via local media and they seem to have chosen some possible stars for the future. The local builder Mike Mitchell, while not a natural actor, embarks on his role as the camp's Arnie-Esq leader. From the rest of the casting there are two different performances by Patrick Wright as second commander McNeal and Scott Ironside as the coarse and clear engineer Vince. Both have some of the best lines in the movie, and Scott injects a good bit of humor into the movie with his performance. Patrick gives a well-rounded performance as the cool as the ice in command. <br /> <br /> Director Mark Stirton can be very proud of what he has achieved and show that Scottish cinema does not have to be all 'Kilts and Ceilidhs' or 'Slum and Drugs' Scottish movies can be fresh, inventive and most of all a lot of god fucking fun. This film is Scottish (with a north-eastern flavor) to the core and praises the actors and directors to keep the accents intact, increasing the charm of the play. Although the budget constraints show from time to time (the only fault I could find) that can be expected. This movie, its cast and crew deserve all the success they get and saw some more. I want Mark and his crew to succeed, and theirs is a career to watch. <br /> <br /> Rating - 9/10 The first Scottish sci-fi is bold, fresh and inventive a real triumph. <br /> <br /> Movie reviews, news and meaning like no other plus kick ass bi-weekly podcasts. <br /> <br /> www.fightrunner.co.uk <br /> <br />contact@fightrunner.co.uk
