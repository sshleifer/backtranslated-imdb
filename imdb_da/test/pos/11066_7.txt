"Saratoga Trunk" is a 1945 movie starring Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper. It is based on a 1941 book by the great Edna Ferber. Unconsciously, she may have been away with the wind on her brain; parts of the story reminded me of GWTW. Seen in the 1890s, Clio Dulaine is an illegitimate child returning from New Orleans from France with a mulatto servant (Flora Robson) and a dwarf servant, Cupidon (Jerry Austin). She has given herself a Countess and claims to be a widow. Her mother accidentally killed her father and his family blamed her. Clio takes over the old farm with the idea of ​​embarrassing her half-sister and wife of her father, which she does by putting great emphasis on herself. Her plan is to marry some very wealthy who can give her the security and respect she wants. Then she tracks Clint Maroon (Cooper), a Texas gambler, and falls for him. The two have a fleeting relationship - and he has no money, so she can't marry him - so he leaves Saratoga Springs. Eventually the Dulaine family has enough, and their lawyer gives her $ 10,000 to get out of town. She does. She goes to Saratoga Springs and goes after the owner of the railway, Bart von Steed. But Clint is always around. Bergman is beautiful in dark hair and wears period costumes, and Cooper is drop-dead beautiful with the incredible 300 watt smile of his. How she could resist him is beyond me. And the love scenes - who, what chemistry! The support supports are excellent, Robson and Cupidon create interesting characters, and Florence Bates gives an excellent performance as a socially prominent woman who takes Clio under her wing, knowing she is a great fake. The movie runs a little long, and some of the actors may seem old-fashioned today, but it is an absorbing story full of atmosphere and vivid performances. The ending will not come as any surprise. However, it is a fun journey.
