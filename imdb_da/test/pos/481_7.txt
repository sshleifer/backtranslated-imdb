If you want to see a fantastic performance by Mikado, played perfectly for expert timing and panache, don't see this version. If you want to see a hammy version with Eric Idle strutting around in the 1930s English gentlemen private club community, this is the one to see. It's great fun and a good introduction to Gilbert and Sullivan, but after that hurry out and rent the Canadian Stratford version. You will see the difference between good and good. Nobody makes G&S better than Brian McDonald and the Stratford group.
