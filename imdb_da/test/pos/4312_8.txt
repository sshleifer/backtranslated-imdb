It is a good watch if you have time - about three friends who come into an infertile struggle and have serious problems. They find themselves fighting some shady people and cannot cope. much, very disturbing portrait of Japan, the conditions of modern life ... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboiler <br /> spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on English subtitles. Of course, I don't know Japanese. The only other Japanese movies I have seen were kurosawa, which is a different and far higher than this modern genre. so can't really compare. otherwise, it compares better to most Hollywood "blockbusters" to the story plot and structure. <br /> <br /> taptieg24
