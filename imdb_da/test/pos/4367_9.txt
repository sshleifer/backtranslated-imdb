Beating Isherwood's somewhat dark and utterly brilliant novel in light comical hulls could easily have been a recipe for disaster, but somehow it wasn't. The story moves at a very fast pace, and the black and white imagery is beautiful, as does Harvey and Harris, who are hitting their way through an obscure Weimar Berlin. Fun!
