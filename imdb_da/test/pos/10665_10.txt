Battleship Potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece. The direction of <br /> <br /> Eisenstein is really a sight. The film chronicles a ship of dissatisfied <br /> <br /> sailors who are tired of being abused by their superior officers. <br /> <br /> Finally, the sailors finally have plenty of abuse and send <br /> <br /> officers pack. During this period there was a shortage of films <br /> <br /> in the Soviet Union. The government wanted to get their message <br /> <br /> out to the people so they started a National Film Company and one of <br /> <br /> members was Sergei Eisenstein. The films were shot on minimal budgets and the lack of film stock forced Eisentein to be careful <br /> <br /> and selective with the footage he shot. Finally, Eisenstein <br /> <br /> had to reuse recordings to make an image length image. <br /> <br /> The most famous of the action files in this movie is the much <br /> <br /> talked about massacres on the stairs. This scene was spoofed in bananas <br /> <br /> and most recently in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables. If you want to <br /> <br /> learn filmmaking, I highly recommend watching the Battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> It's one of the essentials. <br /> <br /> A +
