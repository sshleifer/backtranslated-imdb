I didn't know what to expect. I only watched a rainy Sunday afternoon on pay TV. Right from the start it came to me. The music and the settings and the characters were excellent. I hadn't heard of any of the actors, but they were all unique. A wonderful thriller. Now that I have read other comments on this movie, referring to previous versions and the book, I will try to find out more about this amazing movie
