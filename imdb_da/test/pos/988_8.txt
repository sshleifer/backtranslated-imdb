This is a masterful piece of filmmaking, with many themes simulating and occasionally boiling over in this wart and all the investigations of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime, spanning the air bombardments in London and the outer tranquility of a Welsh coastline - the boundaries between friendship, lust and love , dedication to art and experience in relation to practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and selfishness towards heroism and self-sacrifice and more. A mature, subtle script that suggests and sometimes causes dramatic focus, the underlying tensions are well served by perfect performances (except for the odd inappropriate smile Keira Knightley tends to, but perhaps under the leadership this time as the other characters themselves often mention it). But above all, the exquisite visual composition of every moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie recording, is a wonder and joy to behold. It is just as beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the story more engaging than any of this master's work. A very rare type of movie these days - it keeps the attention and touches the emotions without giving up artistic integrity and yielding to manipulative superficial shortcuts.
