I am collecting movies at the Super 8, and I managed to see a full length of this last week at E-bay. It looks like at least for the moment, it's the only way to watch this movie in a country with NTSC video. I've seen it available on Region 2 DVD many times, but never Region 1. <br /> <br /> I just finished seeing it a few minutes ago and I'm surprised by that. It is a powerful testament to freedom and to finding your own place in the world. Photography and music were wonderful and I really felt empathy for some of the personalities. <br /> <br /> I liked the idea that I was probably the only one in the US who saw "When the North Wind is blowing" tonight! <br /> <br /> Long Live Avakum !!
