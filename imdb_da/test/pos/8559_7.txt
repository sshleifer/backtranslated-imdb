H.O.T.S. is not for those who want hardcore porn. Instead, this film is a precursor to many 80-year-old cult-class college / frat films such as REVENGE OF THE NERDS and PORKY'S and a post-cursor to the world-famous Animal House. A good time if you dig a lot of big 70s / 80s Playboy type chickens and cheezy slap-dick comedy - but nothing too remarkable if you want to use it as whack material ... <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. is an "unauthorized" sorority of sexy outcasts fighting the popular and trendy Pi girls. This one has pranks, an aunt Jemima-ish house keeper, and even an overheated robot that makes it relatively fun to see if boobies are your "thing" ... Well ... I like tits so much (or enough more ...) like the next guy - but with all the bad sh! I haven't seen, I couldn't help wishing a few hardcore scenes to make this really worth it. I knew it wouldn't happen, but I still want H.O.T.S. had a little more sex and a little less cheeze. Not so remarkable as NERDS, PORKY'S or ANIMAL HOUSE, but it's worth looking for fans of these types of movies ... 7/10 <br /> PS / and PS ... and I forgot - this one has a clerk shower -Dragon Danny Bonaduce in probably the best role in his career outside his "reality show" ...
