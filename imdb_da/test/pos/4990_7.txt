"Comanche Moon" had everything that went for it. Initially, Simon is Wincer's back, a man whose name is synonymous with high-quality television western. Unfortunately, the problems with the "Moon" are something, although the most talented director could not solve: A poor script based on a missing novel. Forget about historical accuracy - as any novel's reader can tell you is the greatest travesty in "Moon" that doesn't even match the information from the original "Lonesome Dove" masterpiece. So many wonderful, rich moments in the miniseries and, to an even greater extent, the book is completely lacking in the "Moon". Considering the fact that most viewers of the "Moon" probably come with at least some kind of "Dove" background, the lack of character-driven and emotional backstory is actually painful. <br /> <br /> That said, "Moon" is an example where the custom version could and should have been modified to make it more suitable for the screen. For example, the short story "Moon" focuses largely on the Comanians themselves. For his credit, the miniseries try to service the Comanians, but eventually it gives them just enough that the viewer just makes sense that they lack an important part of the story. Similarly, Val Kilmers Scull also loses here - the role should either have been expanded so that Kilmer (and Rachel Griffiths, for that matter) actually had something to do, or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller, supporting parts. Instead, Kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching his head in his bizarre final action. <br /> <br /> There are strange moments throughout the movie that just don't make sense to those who haven't read the book (a killer parrot? what?) - besides, there's not a single scene that shows us that Call And McCrae is something close to the amazing Texas rangers they claim to be. Not one of their moon expeditions (or "Dead Man's Walk") successfully, and Call and McCrae just seem to blind their way through a meaningless mission after another. <br /> <br /> Frankly, Larry McMurtry should never have the job of writing the script, and only because of the praise of the other cowboy movie, Brokeback Mountain. McMurtry can write good novels (although there is some doubt about the consistency of this statement), but he has never even established himself as a scriptwriter. This production would have benefited not only from bringing back Director Wincer, but the original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to the screen. Witcliff does not even have a rock loading material for his screenwriting credit, but no one can deny that he did a great job of spotting the original "Lonesome Dove". All in all, "Comanche Moon" is almost a brilliant production, aided by a fantastic throw, which unfortunately just isn't enough to do. Steve Zahn's portrayal of Gus McCrae - or rather his depiction of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae - is dead. And while some have criticized Karl Urban as the Woodrow Call, saying that his performance does not mimic the quiet, stoic Woodrow in the original movie, all I can say is blaming McMurtry because McMurtry is the one - both in "Moon" "novel and now the miniseries" - made Woodrow from socially inappropriate, outrageous, but naturally leading to an emotional character whose lines are just boring and whose character motivations are only clear if you have seen them depicted much more adequately in the "sequel". <br /> <br /> Still, the cast that sparks in the "Moon", to the extent that I left the miniseries with the same sense of melancholy, I felt seeing the original "Lonesome Dove" - ​​this time because I realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on the screen for a long, long time to come - and frankly, this cast could have done so well in a reputable, full blown network TV series. <br /> <br / > All in all, apart from wasted opportunities The cast, the bi-gesture travesty, is that the original Lonesome Dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters who would have been fascinating, quite fascinating, to see translated on the screen. Unfortunately, all that has been thrown aside in favor of McMurtry's boring, inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant prequel.
