When CHINA SYNDROME was released, many high-critic and pro-key supporters burst this movie, especially as the three leading stars were all known for their liberal politics and their obvious mistrust of nuclear power. But it took only two weeks and an almost disastrous accident on Three Mile Island to close these critics. <br /> <br /> Fonda and Douglas are the LA news crew, witnessing a potentially unpleasant accident at the Ventana nuclear power plant. Douglas film event through the soundproofed glass of the plant; but the television station will not fly the recordings and fear a massive trial. It is thus up to Fonda and Douglas to come to the truth despite a massive attempt by the plant's owners to cover the accident. <br /> <br /> But a conscientious ship monitoring (Jack Lemmon) has uncovered some flaws in the plant's pump support structure. He believes these errors were the cause of the accident, and although it would be extremely expensive and long-lasting if repairs were not made, the next accident could be apocalyptic. But he can't get anyone working with him to believe in his story. The result is a nightmare climax that draws various political, technological and human interests together in a disturbing package. Although, of course, it is quite politically liberal in nature, the CHINA SYNDROME, well directed and coded by James Bridges (THE PAPER CHASE) is also fundamentally a message film about the inherent dangers of putting technology and nuclear power together. Basically, nuclear power can never be done safely because people can never be perfect. That's what the movie says; and in a very entertaining and exciting way, it says excellently.
