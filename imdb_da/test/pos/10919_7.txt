In & Out was a fun comedy with good performances by Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Matt Dillon and Kevin Kline. The idea that Kevin Kline was gay was a lot of fun. If I were him, I'd hate to say I'm gay at my own wedding with his family, friends, and he's going to be a wife there. Very rarely would it ever happen. I also loved when he danced when the voice on the radio spoke to him. I would say that In & Out was a silly comedy with many laughs and giggles. This is a recommended comedy, and Kevin Kline had a good performance as a gay guy. Trust me, you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
