I saw it last week during Bruce Campbell's trip. I thought it was great. Almost everything I would expect from a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie. Its campy and very fun. Ted Raimi was also fun and extremely greasy. The reason is crazy, an American businessman goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a crazy scientist who saves / brings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half the brain of an ex-KGB-turned cabbie. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent. The film has the whole great Bruce Campbell folding stick and humor. The movie is a little predictable, I knew that once the wife was killed, she would share a brain with her murderer. But I didn't go to watch this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar winning script, I went to see it because it was a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie and I wasn't disappointed at least. I strongly recommend that you see him on his travel or wait and see it on the sci-fi channel next month. Even before the movie, he said the Sci-Fi channel cut some of the movie out to make it TV-friendly. If you're a fan of Bruce, I highly recommend it.
