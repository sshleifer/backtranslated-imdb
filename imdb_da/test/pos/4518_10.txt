Kite Runner should win an Oscar! It's perfect in every sense, the story, the manuscript, the play, the cinematography ... You'd never guess it was filmed in China. The story of two childhood friends and what follows in their adult life will leave a lasting impression. The depiction of life in Afghanistan under the Taliban is far too real and terrible. I haven't read the book, but I've seen comments that put the movie down because "the book is always better". It does not matter. Nobody put "Gone With the Wind" because it wasn't true for the book! In fact, it won the Academy Award for Best Picture and several other Oscars. I think this movie is brilliant - BRAVO for the author and the director, and the actors!
