Almen√°bar has again given us a top quality film. This director is great and he has proven that he is as talented and effective as crossing genres. <br /> <br /> The excellent character of the film, through dialogue and personality quirks, but with more subtle details as well as (Ramon's father's gaze), allows the audience to identify with the protagonists very closely, making the meaning and emotional effects of The events that take place are all the more profound. The visuals are sometimes simple, sometimes fantastic (the dream to the beach), and I think Almenbarar's film really benefits from composing the music too - it matched the film's varying moods flawlessly. <br /> <br /> More than just a film about euthanasia, which in itself is an important issue, this movie handles the duality of a man who at times really seems to enjoy life (albeit in a rather limited way ), and yet one who is unworthy of his desire to die. The movie's overwhelming sadness is characterized by well-tuned mood buds, which seem to all of them more fun because they provide a welcome respite from the melancholy you will certainly feel. While clearly benefiting euthanasia, this film does an excellent job representing the myriad views of Ramon's friends and family. The most point was Ramon's father when he said, despondent: "There is only one thing worse than losing a child. That the child will die." Excellent writing, acting, director, filmography, music - 10/10.
