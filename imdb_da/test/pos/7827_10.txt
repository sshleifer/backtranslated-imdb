When I first saw this show, which was announced to be on Australian television back in the late 90s, I ignored it and it was just exploiting the Kevin Costner movie 'Bodyguard'. But then I caught an episode and I wish I had seen it from the start. The collaboration between Sean Pertwee and Louise Lombard was so well-acted and the structure of each episode was extremely entertaining. It was not a blown-up TV show that you could tell you used most of its energy to get things to explode so they could cut it in the business to lure the audience and then not deliver on any other level. The show went into the lives of the two main characters and that was what made it interesting. The stories for each episode were also well written with interesting guest stars, who were good actors. And of course there was a lot of action and intrigue which is always good. But it was great that there was humor and it flowed naturally from the signs, it didn't seem to be constructed. It was British but in a good way, and if this show was made in America it would no doubt be on DVD now. I do not know why British television production companies are not interested in publishing this show on DVD. It was a great show and deserves a DVD release.
