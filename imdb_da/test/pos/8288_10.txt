I loved this movie when I was a kid. I saw the theater. Randy Edelman made a good composition of the soundtrack. David Sevilla is Chipmunk's father and recording director. Chipmunks consist of Alvin, who is best known for playing the accordion, Simon, who is a bright and handsome chip monk & Theodore, who is the youngest and always hungry. There is a lady known as Miss Miller who looks for chipmunks and has 3 daughters known as Brittany, Jeanette & Eleanor, all of whom have the same character as Chipmunks. My favorite songs from this soundtrack include "Diamond Dolls", The Girls of Rock & Roll, and the touching "My Mother." Alvin really wanted to see Europe when Dave had to go there for business. which led them to drive each other to do the right thing.
