This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It is a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts, but for the most part the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a good job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly continued to go for his pastor, his parents, and the Nashville postman told him no. Buddy Holly did not give up what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I saw this movie. I've been to the Surf Ballroom where he last played but didn't pay much attention to it before I watched this movie. It's an amazing movie with lots of fun, so come on your feet and watch this movie.
