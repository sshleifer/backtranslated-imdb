Super original. Really good movie! James Franco and Sienna Miller really go so well on the screen. I hope it will come out soon. I first saw this movie on a screening. Because of my age and sex, I was asked to stay for a "talk". We all got to comment on the movie, and many didn't like it. I really loved it and I don't know why so many people didn't think it was so good. Go see it when it comes out and decide for yourself! One thing that you might want to do if you want to watch this movie is to go into it without knowing it. I didn't know anything when I went to the screening except, it was called "Camile." It's really worth seeing.
