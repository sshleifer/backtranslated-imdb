This is a harrowing movie, and it moves relentlessly. Yet, it is quite unique among war movies, focusing solely on the civilian experience where human loss of ordinary people undergoes wartime. The two young married musicians undergo a slow, violent breakdown process in the hands of both sides of a civil war. The film gives a deep view of the modern world, and one that I believe is particularly recognizable to many Europeans. With brave, intense performances by Liv Ullmann (never better) and Max von Sydow (also). For my money, the most indelible movie ever created Bergman.
