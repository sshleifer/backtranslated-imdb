As the first film in this series (SLAUGHTER, 1972) I think it would be a mistake to just label this as a "blaxsploitation film". Certainly, slaughtering is a tough, gun-toting, black man, but it's more of an action picture of any color on the leading man or the evil - and a very good action picture on it. <br /> <br /> For the second and last time, Jim Brown plays the title character. The movie begins with one of the most beautiful scenes I can remember in a movie. As Slaughter and his friends enjoy an outdoor party, there comes a biplane and starts spraying the group with machine gun fire! No, slaughter is not so hard that he then shoots down on the plane with his .357! But Slaughter is crossed and no one is sure why this hit had happened - but Slaughter is coming to the bottom of it! Now, it turns out that Hitt was tried in retaliation for the last movie. In it, Slaughter takes the Mafia and kicks lots of ass down in Mexico. Now, in a terribly bungled and clumsy attempt, the boys kill in the plane and damage quite a few people, but miss slaughter. And because the job was bungled so badly, the bully (Ed MacMahon !!) orders the pilot and the gunman killed by his brutal assassin (Don Stroud - in a very typical sort of role for him). Stroud is fantastic - scary and nasty to the core, but Ed MacMahon as the manager?! Wow, that's an interesting twist! <br /> <br /> Butchery is now blunt. He figured out who the two guys were in the plane, but when he came to them, they were dead. So to help him get together in his own private vendetta, Brock Peters (who plays a policeman) tells who mobsters are who ordered the battle and got slaughter to agree to help do some illegal undercover work. Then, slaughter and his pimp friend break into mobster's mansion and steal a list of payouts to central government and policemen. And of course, there are many shots and bloodshed in the process. Stroud is not letting Slaughter get away with this and kidnaps Slaughters girlfriend. Now it's a standoff - Slaughter has the list, but if he doesn't give it back, lady is dead. Being a tough but gallant man, you can just guess a lot of what's happening next time. The action is very good in the movie, and Jim Brown is threatening and tough. The only negative I noticed was that while MacMahon played this unpleasant boss at the end, he simply folded - and too quickly. When Slaughter catches up to him, MacMahon becomes a wimp and all previous nastiness disappears - and it's too much of a clich√© and inconsistent. Nevertheless, despite this little disagreement, it is an exciting film that is NOT for the children because of all the violence and breasts.
