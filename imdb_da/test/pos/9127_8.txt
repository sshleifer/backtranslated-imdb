LE CERCLE ROUGE is a very good movie, although it suffers a bit, as there have already been similar films. Too many ways remind the film of past heist films such as RIFIFI and GRAND SLAM and many others. So, while director Melville and the actors did good jobs, it seems to be a case of Déjà vu. Because of this I had difficulty giving this excellent movie a higher score. <br /> <br /> The one unusual aspect of the movie is how the bad guys meet. Instead of the usual means, Vogel escapes from prison and just happens to meet with Corey, a career criminal just released from prison! Both are a good match, but having them both works in parallel too much of the movie until they meet was a smart touch. Apart from that, as expected, much of the film relates to the careful details of the planning and execution of the crime. I also appreciated how the film showed the bad guys in such a cold and detached way - something relatively common in French crime films, but rare among American films until recent years. Overall, extremely well-made and worth looking ... if you don't mind that it seems a bit repetitive, you will see some fine plays, direction and a lot of tensions.
