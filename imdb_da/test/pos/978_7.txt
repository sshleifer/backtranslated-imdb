This movie was fun! Especially if your between 8 and 15 Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes make a credible team of 8 degrees come back to an adult who really deserves it. Paul Giamatti makes a big adult that you really want to 'get'. My 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it. Parents: No really bad words or sex to worry about. Recommend it to the right crowd.
