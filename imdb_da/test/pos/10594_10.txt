I have never before seen a movie like this, not so much fun. I laughed my fate ass and saw it repeatedly. Infact I see it now. Chad from CKY is also hot. Anyway if you never liked it, blow it out your ass, you have no taste. The movie implies that Ry (Ryan Dunn) has just beaten his girlfriend to Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon DiCamillo) for help finding out what she did with "Hellboy" (Rake Yohn) and with the help by Raab (Chris Raab / Raab Himself) they just do it. <br /> <br /> The Fenderbender scene and stage with Cactus on Record Bin was fun.
