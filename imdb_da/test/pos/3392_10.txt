Even for a 17-year-old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in her childhood years in this series, it came to DVD a blessing at all times. North and South is really a series of friendship, love, honor ... you are called your own list of emotions you get from seeing this series. I still remember the first time I got a glimpse of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I even wow this looks exciting. Too bad I have never had the chance to see book one and two on television in Holland. When the book was broad cast as a late night series in the Netherlands in the summer of 2004, I just knew that I had to see the other two series. For most people book three was a big disappointment as far as I know. Well, since I've seen a book on a DVD, I have to say that so far it's the best of the 3 books. For all the young people who just see the fancy movies like The Patriot "Oh America for Freedom" there is a more realistic view to see for them here .....
