"Checking Out" is a very witty and honest portrayal of a bizarre family that happens to be Jewish. Judaism plays almost no role in the film, but American Jewish culture and behavior is being thoroughly sent out ... it's a loving way. I want the film to deal with the religious perspective on the topics it explores because I think it would have been interesting. <br /> <br /> I've never been a Columbo fan, so I wasn't familiar with Peter Falk - he's very funny to see. It's great to see Judge Reinhold, Laura San Giacomo and David Paymer again - why aren't they working anymore? They are all fun. The script is amazing with many memorable one-liners I want to be sure to use with my own family. Watch out for Gavin McLeod (Captain Stubing!) As a doorman.
