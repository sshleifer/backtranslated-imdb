Gentle and brilliant movies seem to have been overlooked as a triviality ... and to be fair, the story is a bit foggy and light as drama .... but I feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first effect of a New art in a foreign and skeptical society has a radiance and naturalness that takes the long romance of the century between cinema and the audience better than any movie over the years. Extremely sympathetic performance from Jared Harriss (who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charisma ... hopefully without bad Richard's love of hellraising and haminess) .... and charming creepy cuteness from costar Yu Xia combines to make this a true heartwarmer . Radiant location photography (including glowing beautiful scenes by the Great Wall) and the sensitive direction of Ann Hu give film added impact. In short, a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow that flickers to life ... and makes magic in the dark.
