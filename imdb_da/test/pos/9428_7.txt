For the sake of propaganda during World War II, Sherlock Holmes was moved into the present day. One of the results is "Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon" starring Holmes, Basil Rathbone, along with Nigel Bruce, Lionel Atwill, Dennis Hoey and Kaaren Verne. It is Holmes' job to provide a scientist, Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) and his arms design to the British government before the Germans can get him. However, when the man reaches England, his problems have just begun. Can Holmes decode the message as Dr. Tobel left before he fell into the hands of evil morality, saving the weapon and possibly the researcher too? This is an effective Holmes story, set in the atmosphere of Switzerland and blackout England. The series worked fine today. It was not without problems, but these problems had nothing to do with the time period. If the idea was to make watson an idiot? Nigel Bruce's characterization - aided and supported by scripts - has always been the fake note. I much prefer the characterization of Edward Hardwicke in Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series - he is attractive, intelligent and a credible companion to Holmes. In the Rathbone series, Holmes is often degrading and treats Watson as the bumbling fool he is. However, in this movie, Watson has a chance to be quite helpful in several parts. I admit to being a complete sap for Rathbone's recitation from Richard II - "... this blessed plot, this earth, this England" - I can't imagine how much it meant to the British watching the movie in 1942. Sherlock Holmes Really served its purpose.
