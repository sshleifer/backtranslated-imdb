I hate to admit it, but I didn't find it to be one of Hitchcock's best, but nonetheless a raging, climatic thriller. In a remake of Hitchock's 1934 movie with the same title, Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) ?? the man who knows too much - and his wife Jo McKenna (Doris Day) is on holiday in Morocco with their son Hank (Christopher Oslen) when it comes to a mistaken identity and caught on the web by a murder plot. The conspirators go in extreme lengths to prevent them from disturbing their plot: kidnapping their beloved Hank. I found it surprising that Doris Day, as I usually associate with Rock Hudson comedies, was thrown into a Hitchcock movie. When I looked at it, I soon realized that it was more of a family movie compared to Hitchcock's other works (example: Psycho) and she had sung the ability to pull off "Que Sera Sera", which she did beautifully. She was well cast as herself, and James Stewart had chemistry that helped make the couple credible. <br /> <br /> Compared to the great director's other works, I think it's not so good, but it's still very entertaining family thriller / mystery. There is also the added bonus of Que Sera Sera, who turned out to be a smash hit for Doris Day. Well directed, well acted. A nice movie.
