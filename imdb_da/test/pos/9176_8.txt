'Hitch' is a wonderful surprise: a romantic comedy that actually has romance and comedy. Most romantic comedies for me range from mediocre to horrible because they are not fun or romantic. "Hitch" takes actors like Will Smith, Kevin James and Eva Mendes into a fun, easy-to-use feather trip that actually made me laugh, and yes, a little "aww, how cute!". <br /> <br /> Meet Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), aka Hitch. He is a self-proclaimed 'Date Doctor'; he helps hopeless guys like Albert (Kevin James) win as Allegra (Amber Valletta). Unfortunately, Hitch has to deal with Sarah (Eva Mendes), a gossip colonist who is bent on breaking Date Doctor ... <br /> <br /> "Hitch" is actually quite fun, and even standard slapstick scene work simply because the cast is so energetic and clearly have fun. I have to wonder why Will Smith hasn't made more movies like this. His sharp, quick fire is perfect for this genre, and his chemistry with Mendes and James is wonderful. James is a real discovery; I've never seen his show 'The King of Queens', but he's fun and fervent, and he once again proves that fat white men can't dance hip-hop (Smith's answer to his attempts is fun). Mendes is warm and jumping (not the way geez) as Smith's perfect match, and Amber Valletta is sweet as Allegra. <br /> <br /> 'Hitch' is not perfect; It's a bit too long, and things get too "dramatic" close to the end (though it is redeemed by the happy ending filled with fun dancing). But it is a good refreshment from cookie-cutter romantic comedies that hold the cold theaters.
