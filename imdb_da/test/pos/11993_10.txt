One of the most interesting things is that this 1988 movie is strongly adorned as an "in-name only" sequel. There is nothing wrong with that except this: The return of Chevy Chase as Ty Webb. This connects the viewer with this character (from the original Caddyshack in 1980) and makes the fans think or want Caddyshack II to look like the first. There are rumors that Rodney Dangerfield would return. He brought a great deal of the first movie, so his return would have put Caddyshack 2 over the top. Jackie Mason is the `new 'Rodney for this movie and does a decent job even though their comic deliveries are different. Dan Aykroyd was great, but not in the film enough. He should have been involved in the melody of how much screen time Bill Murray got in the first. Robert Stack (Airplane!) Be in the "new" Ted Knight / Villian role. (We miss you, Ted!) Danny Noonan should have been back. So many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later. Bushwood shouldn't have gone through the overall makeover it did. Instead, the characters involved, instead of the club itself, should have been the main focus as if they were in the first. When you watch this movie, keep in mind that it's not a great sequel, and you may think it's another good or bad 80's comedy. Fans of the first have to see it, but don't be shocked when the comparisons between original and part II are so far apart.
