My first exposure to Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli production company was when an English-doubled version of Spirited Away was released about 7 years ago. What a wonderful creative and unique movie experience it was! So on that note, I managed to get my cinema employee friend to watch this new movie by Miyazaki with me, especially because he loves all things Disney (this movie's American distributor). Once again I can only say "Wow!" What amazing visuals about the way water is depicted as the sea ... and what about the title character's transformation from a goldfish to ... and seeing how some characters' demeanor is changing ... well, see this movie if you want to know what I'm talking about. Oh, and the voices are used for this American-duplicated version: Tina Fey, Betty White, Liam Neeson, Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. Good choice everyone. Is everything reasonable? No, but it is part of the childish charm that permeates all the way through. There are lots of fun scenes about Ponyo and the boy and many other people they encounter. Oh, I think I've written too much, so I only recommend Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo.
