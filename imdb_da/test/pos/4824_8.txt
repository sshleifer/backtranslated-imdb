I saw part of this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel, but missed the end. I bought the DVD to watch the whole movie and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> A young mother and her two daughters move into a house in a backwoods area, which they inherited from the man who died of a disease. It goes down a lot, but the three women make the most of it. The youth daughter (Scout Taylor-Compton) is warned by a local boy about the zombies coming out at night. She ignores him, but since he has a sweet friend, she goes with her group. Meanwhile, the younger daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) makes a friend in a zombie girl, her age named Mary. It turns out that Mary and several other children died in a mine in 1913 while working as child labor. Now that they are zombies, they attack and kill anyone who is not a blood related. <br /> <br /> This movie was directed by J.S. Cardone, whose previous films include The Slayer (1981) and Shadowzone (1990), two films I didn't like in the smallest bit. That's why I was surprised that I actually enjoyed this movie. The film is deliberately paced that I liked. This allows you to get to know the protagonists, most of whom are sympathetic. Children's zombies have been used at least since George Romero's 1968 classic Night Of The Living Dead. Still, I found the tool-using child's zombies in this movie interesting. It seems that Cardone finally found the right script and cast. Only the stereotypical scenes from teens who smoke, drink and make out in a parked car were boring for me. Taylor-Compton also looks into the Halloween remake. Moretz performed in The Amityville Horror (2005) and the horror movie Room 6 (2006).
