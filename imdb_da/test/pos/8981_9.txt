It doesn't happen very often, but once a man can make a difference - a big difference. George Criles 2003 Best Seller, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, is a fascinating and eye-catching account of the most unlikely difference maker imaginable. A relatively unclear congressman from the second district of Texas, "Good Time Charlie" was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian law. Likely and promising (even for a politician), Charlie Wilson served his constituency well as Lufkin's good people only wanted two things, their weapons and being alone. It's Easy Street filled with his lovely belt beauties known, appropriately enough, as Charlie's Angels. <br/> <br /> When asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive young helpers, his response was a classic: "You can teach them to write, but you can't teach them to grow breasts." No argument there. <br /> <br /> But even the fastest rapscallion has a conscience that lurks somewhere downstairs, and for Charlie Wilson, the unthinkable atrocities committed in Afghanistan have moved to pattern his entire political missions to fund the complete humiliating defeat of the Russian military and possibly even helping to accelerate the end of the Cold War as a result. Fat chance, huh? <br /> <br /> Under the skilful direction of Mike Nichols and a clever, crisp manuscript by Adam Sorkin, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that chronicles the rear scenes of three colorful characters of "Charlie's Team". The "Team" screen consists of three fantastic players with four (4) Academy Awards and nine (9) nominations between them. Charlie is beautifully depicted by Tom Hanks in a solid, slightly underestimated way that is among his best work this year. He is helped, anchored and abedded by Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston socialite played by the ever-slimming Julia Roberts. Hey, why else does the bikini scene have the world know this? After all accounts, Mrs Roberts looks good and keeps herself, but the manuscript never gives us another hint why Kabul and country are so important to her character. Perhaps the two Afghan dogs usually know her side - but we as the audience never do. Regarding the third member of the "Team", Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene, he looks like Gust Aurakotos, a smart, street-wise (ie not Ivy League candidate) CIA contender who knows the score - both in the agency's board and in Wilson's bedroom. <br /> <br /> In order for the Mujahide to succeed, the most important help the US can offer is the ability to shoot down the dreaded MI-21 helicopter gunships that rain the sky. It takes money, lots of money, and finally the "Charlie's Team" celebrates in the congress hidden to fund the $ 1 billion advanced weapons effort to arm the Afghan rebels. This includes top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated kittens. Nasty, ugly stuff. <br /> <br /> The fact that this kind of illegal activity with billions of dollars can and does take place behind the congress doors is really alarming. Any American should watch this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business-like political scene rarely seen outside our own government walls. Oh Mom, I wish it wasn't so ... Although the original result for "Team Charlie" was an unconditional success, the unimaginable, unexpected final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops of the Taliban and others. Since the funding was completely "hidden", the young generation in this part of the world has no idea of ​​the fall of the Soviet repression, and the end of Russian barbarity was the direct result of US intervention. Yes, when Russkies left, our help also - zip to schools, zip for infrastructure, zip to maintain meaningful relationship with the Afghan people. As a result, the overall consequence is an unimaginable disaster - it's like the precursor to "Mission Accomplished." As Nichols movie so nicely points out, "The ball you've started can keep jumping even after you've lost interest in it." Mike Krzyzewski knows this, Eva Longoria Parker at that, little Lateesha in Lafayette knows this, but The typical American politicians do not. So we go from good boys to evil because we couldn't let the world know we were the good guys. Talk about a Catch-22 (another Mike Nichols movie). Charlie Wilson may have said best: "We & # 39; ll end up game." <br /> <br /> Again.
