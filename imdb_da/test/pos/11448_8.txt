The 80s produced a lot of horror, little horror flicks, most of them within the slasher subgenre - thus putting this movie in front of most of the rest of their ilk. The devil's night is a cross between the ultimate gorilla movie, The Evil Dead; and haunted house-cum slash flick Hell Night. Films like this usually have a fake / deformed lunatic as the leading bad guy; But here we have bloodthirsty demons, who are always more interesting than a lunatic if you ask me. There are also a lot of comedies in this movie, and the first third of the movie can easily be created for a straight comedy movie. But when the characters enter the central location; a creepy funeral known as the 'Hull House' movie morphs into the horror movie as you would expect given the title. The baseline is as simple as you would expect to be, and we follow a bunch of kids who decide to put on a Halloween party within the funeral home. This turns out to be a bad idea, but when it turns out that the house is occupied; and the demons begin to reside in the children's bodies! Their only salvation lies on the other side of the underground stream ... but finding the gate to the ground is not as easy as it sounds. <br /> <br /> The centerpiece of the movie is the Gothic mansion where the action takes place. This creaked old house creates a fantastic horror movie location; the fact that it used to be a funeral home only adds to this. Director Kevin Tenney shoots well at the house and a particularly good job has been done to establish that the house is in the middle of heaven and that escape is difficult. The comedy against the start of the film is generally a lot of fun, and I hoped it would be laughing when the horror started. The film has its comedy moments when the kids enter the Hull House, but it's never too much fun, and it is obvious that horror is the film's main goal. Not that this is a problem; But the demon's night could have been much better if it had melted these elements properly. The characters are basically what you would expect from this kind of movie; But the play fits the movie well, and it is clear that the young cast had a good time to make this movie and it translates well to the screen. The effects are good because they fit the film well and since most of the death sequences are performed well; It is a good effort that most people will not be bored with seeing this. This is not a classic or should be watching movies; but I can highly recommend it as it gives a good time and will appeal to fans of stupid horror feet.
