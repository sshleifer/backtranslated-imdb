Unlike Bond and other detective films, Alfred Hitchcocks used to be an ordinary man who would be in trouble, and then with his sharpness and courage (and luck) would come out of it. Jewel Thief is based on the same principle, and so it is Vijay Anand's tribute to the excitement. The tribute as it may be, but it stands its own ground and establishes Vijay Anand as a great director himself. It is the story of a common man Vinay who one day realizes he has a double called Amar which is actually a jewel thief. Suddenly, Vinay finds himself in the middle of a hatchery, and to save himself, he goes on a wild goose hunt to find this Amar, one step ahead of him. The thrill kills almost the entire movie, and as the plot unravels you are hit by the brilliance of the scheme. Like Hitchcock's film, Jewel Thief boasts a large climax shot within Sikkim's large palace. <br /> <br /> Everyone and I mean everyone; Dev Anand, Vijay Anand, Ashok Kumar, Vajyanti Mala, Tanuja, SD Burman, Kishore Kumar, Majrooh Sultanpuri, etc. Etc. Are in their best forms. This is one of the best thrillers ever made in India.
