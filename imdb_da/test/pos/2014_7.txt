"Rock star" is not on the way to any "staircase to heaven" category as one of the best rock movies at all times, but it makes you 'jump' from time to time because of its high level of energy. The film's theme is on a die-hard rock fanatic who actually becomes the leading singer of his favorite band. The story is based on the true story of what happened to heavy metal band Judas Priest. If you think this movie is filled with a witty script and intellectual orientation - then you've come up with another thing. But what shook me all night long was the fine actor of Jennifer Aniston as the rock star's devoted girlfriend. I couldn't say the same about the rock star itself; Mark Wahlberg was much better than a porn star than a rock star. I enjoy the 80's retrospect travel movie intake. It reminded me of my teens where everything "smelled like a teen". I think the movie is worth seeing, but for you to have a better time watching it, be sure to bring some "girls, girls, girls" with. *** Average
