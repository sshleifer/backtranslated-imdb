PUBLIC ENEMIES are a kind of recall to the early 1960's gangster biographies such as PORTRAIT OF A MOBSTER, FOOD DOG COLL and KING OF THE ROARING TWENTIES. Although made on the cheap, the film has a great deal of energy and it appears everywhere, especially by Eric Roberts and Frank Stallone, is quite good. Theresa Russell may seem too glamorous as Ma, but she has some very good moments. There are two action scenes worth noting: a shooting in a hotel and a machine gun fighting in the middle of the street between Barkers and the FBI. Both sequences are nicely finished, and in comparison to other low budget gangster junk like DILLINGER AND CAPONE, this movie shines.
