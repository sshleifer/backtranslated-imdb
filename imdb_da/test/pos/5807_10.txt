Now I have to say I had the chance to see this show here in Philadelphia, PA once in June 06. And I really loved it. My favorite Madonna look was the 1990 Blond Ambition tour. It's for me "MADONNA". Now that she is a mother of 3, she needs to change some things to fit her motherhood. And I totally agree. It is a classic Madonna concert. I wish that "live to tell" was not edited. We saw that the fall of the body falls from buildings at 911 we can see a woman on a cross ... in any way I look forward to the release of this tour on DVD and hope that it is the whole show unedited and with a bunch bonus footage. she is an artist of all time.the best out there ... and still on top and going strong. long life MADONNA!
