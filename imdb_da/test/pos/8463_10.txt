Have you ever wondered where the episode "Tuttle" came from in the middle of the first season of M * A * S * H? Now the cat is out of the bag: they got it from this Soviet movie, a satire on how silly the czar is because of a pen's slider (which makes the term "lieutenants, though ..." to "lieutenant Kizhe" who has no meaning ) and nobody is honest or gutsy enough to contradict him and just tell him the truth - Kizhe doesn't exist and never did. So they make an imaginary life for him and eventually kill him. And 40 years later, David Ketchum and Bruce Shelly borrowed this great plot and essentially gave us the same story, only on the other side of what had become the Cold War, showing that people in high positions might be just stupid, Whatever their loyalty may be!
