Having only seen five episodes of the show before this (I have looked at the repetitions on BBC Two), I have not really had much experience from the League, but as a fledgling fan as well as a massive fan of British comedy, I can say that This movie is fun. Seeing Mr. Lipp (who I hadn't seen on the screen before the movie) Briss and Geoff on the big screen was a great comedy experience. Being on the screen is something that the league takes full advantage of, with its head jumping up (it comes as a surprise to who it is) and cruel murders of random medieval style are fighting all the way. <br /> <br /> Geoff is easily the funniest character of the three main characters of this movie because he has the best one liners and overall behavior, as in the series. One of my only disappointments with the film did not hear Geoff shouting "Well now I have this gun" once more (although there is a structure in one part of the movie.) The film itself is general, to use the phrase everyone else does , Pythonesque and it is very similar to movies like "Brian's life." Appearance from Tubbs and Edward was welcome, but Papa Lazarou's line "Hello Daves" blew me more than anything said of them (Lazarou is probably my favorite Vasey character after Tubbs and Edward.) It has a pretty exciting end to one of those The main character is killed, and I can only hope this is not the league's last evil screen Vasey venture. With Gatiss mentioning the possibility of another series or movie, I am now very excited. This is a movie I want to see again, partly because the projector died at the end, leaving 10 minutes or so of the movie, but primarily because it is inventive and fun. I'm not really bothered if it's not as good as the TV series because I loved it. <br /> <br /> One thing about if you've never seen the league, you'll still love it, but Dave knows what you want to think about the people who do these things. When Tubbs or Edward might put it, it's a local movie, for the locals and a valuable thing. <br /> <br /> **** out of ***** (4/5)
