If anything, William Girdler was an opportunist who wanted a piece of action on what was popular over time. I mean, a blaxploitation flick in Louisville, Kentucky .. who would of thunk it?!?! I can only imagine the enthusiasm he must have given Pam Grier, quite a warm thing, to steal in his image. If you're pretty familiar with the genre, Girdler's Sheba, Baby doesn't necessarily go too far from the formula. Despite a friendship change, the film still deals with a ruthless businessman named Shark, who muscles on loan companies and uses stooges to threaten them for their signatures. <br /> <br /> Grier is Sheba Shayne, a former Louisville policeman working in Chicago who returns home at the request of his father's partner, Brick (Austin Stoker, Assault on Precinct 13). Sheba's father despite Shark's bullying tactics (... his man in town is Pilot, a wannabe gangster equipped with stooges who are not so threatening, rather buffoonish in nature, so thin shining they employ hit men outside the city to shoot on the Shayne Loan building), will not give up his company and this ultimately costs him his life when a warning through the use of brutal force causes him to be killed. Sheba gets her revenge on all those responsible for her father's death. In other words, Shark's ass is grass. Can you dig it? <br /> <br /> Seing Grier with a magnum is enough to sell this movie, the news of the Louisville setting is part of the package. You even get to see a speedboat hunt, Grier in shootouts with mobsters (.. not necessarily the most polished cheek one could be accustomed to seeing in Chicago or New York during this time in blaxploitation), lots of blood spurting from bullet-riddled organs broken apart by gun-fire and colorful characters (.. like a wimpy loan shark in the pimp dress named Walker and Pilot, which is one of the least scary mobsters you will likely see) shown below the movie, most have the accident come in contact with a very sour Sheba. The plot itself is nothing special, but Grier is always worth watching, and Girdler orchestrates lots of action sequences to keep his audience entertained. A modest success for Girdler, and one of his more successful films.
