It must be said that Monster Man is a big mess in a movie, but somehow several different genres and a clich√© plot come together to make one of the most comfortable modern horror movies I've seen for years! The two biggest styles that the movie mixes are a 'Road Trip' style teenage comedy and a 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' style redneck horror vibe, and while getting in the way of the other quite often; Director Michael Davis manages to keep things moving thanks to the fact that the constant shift in tone means we are never quite sure where the movie will be taken next time. Things start worrying as we are introduced to two characters, both annoying in different ways. Adam is a wussy virgin, while Harley is a great big-mouthed "A-hole". They both run across the desert to attend the wedding of some chickens they both liked in high school. After a couple of strange events, they pick up a hitch hiker, and then they find themselves being chased by some lunatic in a monster car for reasons that are unknown ... The idea that someone is being chased by someone else in a larger vehicle is hardly original but the way the monster car is used here is one of the movie's greatest assets. The truck itself looks ghostly, because it is so fragile and rusty, and the fact that it jumps around the screen makes the unfolding work exciting and exciting. After a while, you start to get used to the characters, and when Aimee Brooks breaks, things start to look up. Teenage Comedy Page of the film actually works pretty well as Justin Ulrich is always present to deliver some entertaining lines of dialogue, and the scenes between the dorky virgin and the hot hitch-hiker are interesting enough. Only when you think that the film could not get anything more sensible, then it takes a trip to the strange in the last third. Without spoiling things, one has to say that Monster Man has the kind of end that couldn't be seen, and along with the twist is a great surprise. Some people may feel ripped off by the sudden turn at the end - but I actually thought it worked quite well, as it suits the movie, as nothing here really suits ... Overall, it's not a "good" movie on anyone way - But if you're looking for a silly entertainment, Monster Man has to hit the spot!
