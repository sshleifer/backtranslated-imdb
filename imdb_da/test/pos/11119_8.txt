Fame was released in the United States one year before I was born; I was too young to remember the original version of Fame - and yet I heard and read many things about it. As the fact that it created a television series and its soundtrack was led by Irene Cara, Giogio hit Moroder, 'Fame'. <br /> <br /> Fame was undoubtedly the first of its kind to portray and showcase the world of performing arts in the form of a feature length film. The lives, battles, obstacles, pupils and some of the teachers underwent were increased by the viewers. <br /> <br /> The show was great, but one that particularly watched me was Gene Anthony Ray, who played the troublesome yet promising Leroy. Angry, frustrated and firstly rude, his character later became less angry and frustrated and more engaged in his studies - not only with the practicality of the performance, but also in the theoretical. Irene Cara was good as the Coco scene with her taking off the blouse while a pervy director filmed that she was pretty uncomfortable to see - as well as Paul McCrane for his amazing portrayal of a vulnerable but closeted homosexual trying to cope with life and enroll a performing arts school in New York after being kicked out of the military when he told them he was gay. Ralph, played by Barry Miller, was interesting, but at times his character spread on my nerves. The choreography was excellent, there were some good dancing numbers involved and the "hot lunch" scene in the cafeteria was worth seeing. Another scene that was amazing was when the "Fame" song was played, and all the kids began to rush out into New York Street and danced wildly and without care in the world. It was a street cream like no other. The only star ever to really benefit from this in the long run was and is Debbie Allen- she later became producer, director and star - although she mostly worked behind the scenes on shows like Everybody Hates Chris and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Paul McCrane later joined Peter Weller in the movie 'Robocop', where he played a villain and ER as the judgmental Doctor Romano. <br /> <br /> British director Alan Parker shot this really well, he promised the artists to dance, act, sing to their heart content without intervening and influencing their styles. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, we see the various phases that students encounter during their 4 years - from their auditions to freshman years right up to New York High School For The Arts. Fame is one of those films that is aimed at or targeting a particular audience that is not. It is definitely not the ordinary mainstream film-loving society - it is certainly not for everyone. I have one because I have an interest in art - not technically in terms of being a performer, because I am not one, but as a person who appreciates that creativity and artistic expression can be disgraceful through hard work, commitment and passion for what you do with their talents. Therefore, if you are an aspiring dancer, actor or just someone who is creative, you may be interested in a movie like this - although the events in Fame are something like what it is in a real-life performing arts school / school, so It is a completely different matter altogether. <br /> <br /> The 2009 remake of this movie was released recently and honestly, it almost falls by comparison. <br /> <br /> Regarding the original Fame, almost 30 years on, but yes it's a little dated, but it's still a great movie, anyway. It's not a direct classic, but as an 80-year-old cult classic, in line with other 80's dance hit movies, such as Footloose and Flashdance, Fame hits the spot. Isn't it a case that all the dancing movies begin with the letter 'F'? <br /> <br /> Gritty, fluid and exciting, this one is worth seeing.
