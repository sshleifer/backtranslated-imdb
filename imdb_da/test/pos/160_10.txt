Not for squeamish, but the number of twists, inventive applications of situations using vampire mythology, beautiful visual extremes, along with interesting and quirky characters make this one of the most amazing horror movies I've ever seen. It falls into complete madness along with characters, but never seems to be exploitative or horrible for no purpose. There are abundant amounts of blood globes accompanied by some unpleasant sucking and squishing sounds, but also subtle moments where you laugh aloud. As he tends to do, Chan-wook Park keeps you at the center, leaping in time and plot and situation that you have to fill for yourself, forcing your commitment to history and characters. <br /> <br /> And there's a lot of literal leaps. Hold the vampire myth's vein (pun intended), they have superhuman strength and can almost jump high buildings into a single bound (to coin a sentence). The first time our heroine is carried by the troubled vampire priest's tops of buildings, it has all the magic romance of Lois Lane and Superman - but this romance is becoming more and more disturbing - but driven by a strange and conflictless love affair 'not with pure scare. The action is amazing, especially OK-wine Kim, the beautiful actress in the female lead, who at 22 shows a range that is remarkable. The character borders on a kind of black widow film noir type. She usually is innocent and commits to subdue the demon with full conviction. This is a really smooth and nervous performance. <br /> <br /> If you love real art in horror, or are a fan of Oldboy - don't wait for the video, watch it right away.
