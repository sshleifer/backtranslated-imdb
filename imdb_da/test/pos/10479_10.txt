"Babette's Feast" and "Horse's Mouth" are the two most insightful, accurate films about what it is to be a real artist. The key lines of "Babette's Feast" are not, as some other commentators have said, "an artist is never poor", but two lines that come before and after: <br /> <br /> "I could do them happy when i gave my very best ... All over the world a long cry sounds from the artist's heart: give me the chance to do my best. "<br /> <br /> I spent nine years producing experimental multimedia music theater in San Francisco where I made money for productions involving dozens of singers, actors, designers, etc., and the artists I supported stretched every penny in their efforts to do their very best. They were like Babette: they were desperate to get every dollar needed to do their very best job. Babette's art is fine French cooking, and for her to perform her art at the very best cost 10,000 francs. When, after years of political exile from France, she is isolated with two caregivers on a shady Scandinavian coast, she suddenly gets a 10,000-franc storm, she does what every real artist would do: she sees that she unexpectedly has the chance to do her very best, and then she does it. She spends all the money so she can do her very best work as an artist. Twist in the movie is that we do not know that she is such an artist until she actually cooks and serves the meal. Until then she appears to be just a working classical French lady who boasts a little with the craftsmen, and is very serious (her husband and son were murdered in Paris violence in 1871). <br /> <br /> For such an artist, it is secondary whether there is an audience of art competent to appreciate it. Therefore, the author puts this dinner in a community of people who could not understand what they are receiving. Babette did not put this meal as a gift to the two spinners or to the religious community. It was not her goal to achieve a reconciliation or spirit of good feelings among the members of the small religious sect. In fact, she never leaves the kitchen to talk to any of them. After the meal, she sits alone, sipping some wine, and not paying the least attention to how the guests responded. She relies on satisfaction with finally having the chance to have done her best as an artist. That is why it is so satisfying and so important for history that the general unexpectedly arises - for as Babette knows immediately, a general will know what she has put for him and will appreciate it. Because there is a kind of tragedy in a good work of art that is shown to an audience who lacks a person competent to appreciate it. She is happy, very happy that he came, in fact he is the only guest she ever mentions throughout the dinner, the only one she singles out for special treatment - not one of the spinners. But she didn't plan the meal by knowing that such a person would come to receive it. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has had the chance to enjoy a very first class Parisian dinner that I have (my father was Naval Attache for Paris in the 1980s and I had my honeymoon in France) dinner, and Babette's satisfaction with doing so, and the joy it brings to diners, is absolutely convincing. If any art has the power to counter the recipient with a sense of joy, it is a fine French meal prepared and served in France. This film calls for the transformative effects of great art on the recipients. Before dinner, the members of the small religious sects are frightening and elaborate on old anger. The old hymns fail to restore a good fellowship; People ignore them, talk over them. But the shared experience of sensual great art - for people to enjoy the taste of food and wine, though they have no idea that they are experiencing great art - the content the people put them in a forgiving mood, unite them, and by making them happy, encouraging them to love one another and thus have a god-like sacred effect to bring peace. This is the requirement of the modern art movement today - that art can replace traditional religions to make humanity more peaceful. Unlike these commentators here who say that this film speaks for the power of Christian faith, it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can cure wounds that Christian ritual cannot. After all my years in the art world, I have to say that this claim - the art of peace that religion cannot - is overwhelmed and void. But it is a beautiful objection, and this is the second main theme of this beautiful film. One final note: At Babette's arrival at the spinner's home, a special French general called the Galliff as the person who executed Babette's husband and son in 1871 and introduced a military rule that she had to flee. At the end of the film, as the general tells the story of the grand meal he has had in Paris many years before (before 1871), it turns out that the same Galliff hosted the meal at the end of some military maneuvers. . As the general tells the story, French General Galliff praised the chef of the meal as the greatest woman, the only woman he would risk his life for. Of course, the woman was Babette. Thus ironically, the same French general who said he honored Babette over all other women was responsible for driving her away from France forever.
