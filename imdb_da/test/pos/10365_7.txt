This production was quite good. The usual amazing scenery, interesting, quirky characters. It was just as odd that you didn't have Captain Hastings, Miss Lemon and Poirot's office / residence, so prominent in the original PBS / BBC mysteries. <br /> <br /> In the original series, much took place in the office. Hastings reads the paper, while Poirot "exerts its small gray cells." Miss Lemon pitching in when needed. Poirot without Capt. Hastings would be like Holmes without Watson ... he can certainly solve the crime, but it's not that interesting. <br /> <br /> And what would a Poirot mystery be without Hastings, with its impeccable manners falling into a beautiful, unattainable woman.
