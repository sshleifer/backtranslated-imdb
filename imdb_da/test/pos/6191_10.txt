Nice description of the situation in the United States, it explains various forms of Islam, not just showing terrorist and extremist. Islam can be other things that kill, show why some people become terrorists and how to be Muslim without being extremist. It is a great series that Muslims and non-Muslims should see. Now we hope that other series or movies will be made to change the idea that all Muslims are terrorists, and all Americans want to destroy Islam. It gave me an interest in discovering exactly what Islam is, and what the United States and the European Government are doing to help cohabitation between people of other religions.
