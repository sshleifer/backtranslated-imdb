HUNT FOR JUSTICE is a Canadian TV drama that made it to DVD, and it is grateful to those who are hungry for education dramas that inform us of the facts of the current story that are somehow buried in the media. The film is not a Hollywood production, it relies heavily on court recordings, but it also introduces many of us Louise Arbor's heroism's action to the trial of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. <br /> <br /> Louise Arbor (veteran Canadian actor Wendy Crewson) is a Canadian judge appointed by NATO as Chief Criminal Criminal Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The film begins in 1996 when Arbor travels to The Hague to address the political hurdles that prevent the right to kill war criminals in the war to kill Yugoslavia has led to the courts of Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, a war that has serious evidence of crimes against humanity in the form of genocide, extermination camps and other violent attacks. The progress of bringing the criminals to justice is hampered by generals (including a play by William Hurt) who fears a major world war if action is taken against the same. Arbor, with the great help of his translator Pasko Odsak (Stipe Erceg), her staff, including Keller (Heino Ferch) and the unexpected help of the British captain John Tanner (John Corbett), decay forward and focus the impossible task of bringing all responsible parties to justice on three specific events. Two of the top three suspects are trapped, but during their trials, each end meets. This leaves only Slobodan Milosevic himself, and Arbor and her colleagues are successful in bringing the war criminal to court in 1999. <br /> <br /> There are several touching pages that are employed in the story of this well-documented story, stories That Do the point of history more personal. Some may find the film footage of corpses and prisoners and death camps too strong to look at, but they are needed to bring home the purpose of the movie. Wendy Crewson bears the power to drive the message home - the announcement that war crimes must never go unpunished. There is much current story to be learned from this movie: Authors Ian Adams, Riley Adams and M.A. Lovretta has condensed the information and also made it dramatic. Director Charles Binam√© balances docudrama with story progress, never forgetting that he has a story of intrigue to tell too. HUNT FOR JUSTICE is worth seeing! Grady Harp
