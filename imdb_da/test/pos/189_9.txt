This is a great movie. The action is some of the best I've seen. Tatyana Samojlova is of course very beautiful, and she automatically draws you into the movie with her credible plays. The Cinematography was much ahead of its time. When I looked at it, I could see parallels of filmography used today. This is really a groundbreaking movie. Due to film and acting, the audience can feel the change in tone from the beginning to the end, as the tone of the environment in the film changes. It is a very touching and powerful piece. My friend told me it had to look and I totally agree with her. This is one of the movies you see and never forget. Everyone should watch this intensely moving movie. This should be added to everyone's "Movies to watch before ________ (whatever)" list.
