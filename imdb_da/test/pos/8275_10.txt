HAVE A NUTRITION: Dave Sevilla, the grandfather and leader of the Chipmunk brothers Alvin, Simon & Theodore, has gone to Europe on business and leaves the boys at home with Miss Miller as their guards, much to Alvin's chagrin who wanted to travel to Europe. While playing against his female counterpart, Brittany, Chipette's leader, consisted of his younger sisters Jeanette (the female counterpart of Simon) and Eleanor (the female counterpart of Theodore) in a hard arcade game around the world for 30 days, catching the attention of two. evil foreign siblings who need to smuggle money and diamonds around the world, but need a way to do it, which will not draw attention to their bow fibers, Jamal. The two evil siblings, Claudia & Klaus, overcame the villain between Alvin and Brittany and decide to use them as shipping girls and girls for their loot (more Claudia's idea than Klaus's, the latter initially restarting to feel that it is too dangerous for children). The 2 siblings offer an offer for boys and girls - travel via hot air balloons to 12 drop off points to leave dolls (reminiscent of the kids) containing diamonds and / or money to indicate their arrival with the promise that the one who winning the race will get an indecent amount of money. But when the two different sets of talking siblings sing their rounds, they are stalked by the hammer's henchmen - but who is Jamal? Is he friend or enemy? <br /> <br /> OVERALL: Cozy, light-filled farce based on the television series version of Alvin & the Chipmunks from the 1980s. Beautiful animation is a highlight, lacking the red humor that keeps crawling in today's family film and engaging songs (Boys & Girls of Rock & Roll is a partition). Eagle Eyed fans will probably notice that Brittany's character design has been tweaked from the animated series, giving her a smaller round face while adding a seemingly permanent redness to the cheeks (as Jeanette & Eleanor also shows). <br /> <br /> Keep an ear next to Nancy Cartwright, Bart Simpson's voice.
