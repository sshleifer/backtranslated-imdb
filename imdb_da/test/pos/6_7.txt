I was fortunate enough to watch this movie on pre-release last night, and although I didn't expect to actually enjoy the movie for the most part. The resources and the sea effects were amazing to see and certainly provided with the edge of the tense moments, probably the more so to know that there are guys who make this live. The weaker parts of the film are largely about using stereotypical scenes. I'm not going to spoil the movie, but it really follows the lines An Officer and a Gentleman, and those moments give it a little cheesy aftertaste. As I said all over this movie is pretty good and worth checking out as long as you can get past the clich√©s.
