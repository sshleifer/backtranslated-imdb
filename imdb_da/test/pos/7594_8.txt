There are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie, although it is a bit predictable. Drew Barrymore does a very good job of being the excluded geek in this movie - excellent casting choice. What I found a little hard to believe is that the popular girls finally accept her - in my experience, the amount of memory is longer than that, and knowing how AWFUL Drew's character was (ostrich feather?) At the beginning of the school year would have kept them miles away, no matter what rumors her brother drums up. (And "Kole Slaw Food" really makes HIM all that popular? I doubt it). Regarding rods for Drew's character to win big as a reporter - yes, I would have hoped she could have gotten a story long before the prom. Slightly constructed. Having said all that, it was a cutsie piece of fluff that will be entertaining as long as you don't expect too much.
