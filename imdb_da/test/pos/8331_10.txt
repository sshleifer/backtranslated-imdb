Great "documentary" of how scientist believed dinosaurs behaved, caught with some of the most spectacular CGI since "Jurassic Park". Performed seriously as a prehistoric episode of "Nation Geographic". Grab your attention from the first frame and never let go. My favorite part was when Diplodocus fights from Allosauros. <br /> <br /> 10 stars. This is about science.
