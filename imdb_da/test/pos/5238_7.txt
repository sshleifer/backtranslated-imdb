Sweeping and still impressive early Talkie Western for groundbreaking days; Other simultaneous films in the same vein include THE COVERED WAGON (1923), IRON HORSE (1924) and CIMARRON (1931) ?? of which I have seen, even though I have the latter on VHS. At the same time, it was filmed in the "Standard" fullscreen and in an experimental Widescreen process called "Grandeur", but only the former has been released on the Fox DVD; one can only convince how it would look in a larger relationship, but the cautious frame? Not to mention the amazing filmography ?? is clear enough even in the "Standard" version. <br /> <br /> Young John Wayne is surprisingly commanding (a role that did not lead to the expected stardom? in 'B' Westerns for the best part of the next decade before John Ford came to his rescue) with STAGECOACH [1939]!); anyway, he and Marguerite Churchill (from DRACULA'S DAUGHTER [1936]) make a good couple ?? despite its somewhat boring character. Supporting characters include a variety of file types: veteran westerner, comic-relief sidekick (with a sense of sound with the mouth!), Burly and uncouth villain (played by Tyrone Power Sr.!), His two slimy cohorts (a Mexican and one sister, the latter also fills as Wayne's rival for Churchill's hand), etc. Also among the members of the wagon party is a stingy swede (full of optimism for the promised land, but who is permanently laid down by his irascible mother-in-law) and later Wayne Regular Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The episodic tale solves itself in a series of alternating cornball, lyrical and action-packed vignettes ?? as we see the potential settlers fighting the elements, the Indians and themselves; However, the film has a completely authentic feel to it that slips over its basic dated and static quality. Also editing is something noticeable (especially in the second half)? a bit odd as the DVD edition of the movie is only 108 minutes long against the complete 158-minute "Grandeur" version!
