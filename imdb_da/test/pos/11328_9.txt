The reason "in the mood for love" is simple enough: a married man and a married woman (but not to each other) slowly develop a romantic relationship with each other. The movie's tempo is numbingly slow and precious, which actually happens between the two. But Hong Kong's background in the early 1960s and director Wong Kar-Wai is a sharp feeling to capture the beauty of the setting as well as the key characters making this movie a joy to watch. Actors Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are both excellent, and Wong Kar-Wai has done an extraordinary job of capturing the feelings of the past and nostalgia (something as many films and directors are trying to do, but usually fail). There are so many small details that add charm to the movie (a trademark of the instructor) and the colors and movies are what send this otherwise simple story over the top as a fantastic cinematic achievement. 10.9.
