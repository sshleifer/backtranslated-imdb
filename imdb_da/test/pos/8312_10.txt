This film was screened at the American Cinematheque's Egyptian Theater in Hollywood on April 7, 1999. It was described in the American Cinematheque chart as follows: "TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY 1951, Warners, 90 min. Steve Cochran's a former king who never has been with a woman Ruth Roman is a dime-a-dance lady who is not for the use of juvenile men, a hotel room, a dirty policeman, a shot - the perfect jumping for a refugee on the known love story. unknown noir is Felix Feist's masterpiece, packed with revelatory set pieces. Cochran was never more vulnerable, Roman never sexier. Imagine GUN CRAZY written by Steinbeck - it's so good. "<br /> <br /> I've just seen this movie and I agree with every word in the above description.
