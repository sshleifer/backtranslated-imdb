For all the people who believe the dialogue is worth something and appreciate a farce that is smart enough to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It's not a "whodunit" for people who can't follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid). <br /> <br /> Cornell teaches in Southern California, near tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife differs from him, he drinks a little and is blessed or cursed by caustic humor that he freely disposes of his students. He has recommended a friend for progress, and a bright young student has submitted a manuscript to him as an independent project. Cornell doesn't even want to read it, so it gives an "A" and pushes it to the side. He leans back with a drink in his office, he stares out the window as the bright young student falls past the window on the road to meet the sidewalk in a split meeting. <br /> <br /> Hal will talk and they chat, drink some more. Cornell realizes that he should now read the manuscript. When he goes home, his wife waits for divorce papers. He drinks something more. She leaves, and he goes to a faculty affair, just to find her there. He drinks even more. And when his wife learns that the student is dead, she sleeps and he learns that she has had an affair with the student. This, of course, asks him to make some more serious drink. The next morning he wakes up to find himself in one of his students, a freshman named South (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> He feels worse than a hangover, goes to the doctor and learns that he's been poisoned, it's irreversible, and he has 24-48 hours to live. He doesn't have much time to figure out who killed him, and there are under-plots, motives, relationships and surprises at every turn, although everything makes sense at the end. All his discoveries and exchanges are adorned with sarcasm, peat and eager observations. Let's just say that this movie will make new meaning to the word "publish or perish". <br /> <br /> There is no bad idea in this movie. There are recurring images and the symbolism is used with careful intervals. Look for the cracked glass and images are distorted through glass. Some of the camera images are revolutionary in 1988, and some of the violent acts are carefully and skillfully choreographed. The music is discreet and appropriate, although it sometimes makes it its own statement, in lyrics. The visions in this flick are impressive. <br /> <br /> If there is a mistake, the opening 20 minutes moves a little slowly and almost puts you to sleep. But the pacing picks up quickly, with just the right amount of exposure between the action segments. <br /> <br /> There are no explicit sexual encounters, although there is violence and some bad language. <br /> <br /> This is a writer's movie and is best appreciated by those who have a sense of humor about their own success or failure. I think if you take it seriously, you're already in big trouble.
