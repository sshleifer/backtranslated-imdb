A remarkable film that led to the surface of all kinds of emotions I had when I was very, much younger. I loved it and Elton John music. I remember watching the movies when I was a kid and for some reason (limited edition?) I never knew anyone else who saw this movie when it was released. <br /> <br /> The dreams that inspired me from decades ago have never left me, and when I watch the movie again recently, it all became busy, however, I recognize that my children (in their 20s) do not have experienced a similar emotional rush. One generation thing? <br /> <br /> Why isn't it on DVD?
