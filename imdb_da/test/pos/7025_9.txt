I didn't understand what that line meant ... I do now. I'd rather not see Dirty Dancing either. I had rented it out but never saw it - and today I did. And I thought it was a really fun, great movie that makes you go up and dance. Okay, it was cheesy at times ... but it's still a good movie. I can't believe Jennifer Gray was 27 in this movie - my friend and I thought she saw no more than 18 or 19-20. I suppose this is due to her acting talent. And she looked real at times. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can tell he is in his thirties and seems a little old. Nevertheless, still very good. I love 80s songs so it really struck a chord with me, and the love story (yes, I'm a romantic) was so wonderfully finished. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Exceeded my expectations!
