Corniness Warning. Like many other IMDb users already, I am not a corny, cheesy person. If you don't want to read this kind of review then go. <br /> <br /> To tell you the truth, you hear it from a man who laughed through the Titanic and almost broke his parents' wallpaper <br /> <br /> --- Spoilers --- <br / > <br /> One day I went to the theaters with two friends to see Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, last year in August. The boring trailers rolled into one so quietly started. It was for Radio. The moment I saw the trailer, I just had to watch this movie at the opening weekend. When that weekend rolled together, Scary Movie 3 was also out, so many teenagers were there waiting in the queue on Friday night. It turns out the movie is out of stock, and the young people were so desperate to watch a movie they sold and also sold Good Boy and Radio. I couldn't get a ticket and the following weeks I was busy with important things. Ca. 5 months later my friend rented Radio. He let me borrow it and I saw it in my room. I tell you now, it's the only movie I've ever seen that made me ever cry. When Radio's mother died, it just came out automatically. The next day I went to Blockbuster and bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> Well enough of my stupid personal story, let me tell you about the movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as a mentally challenged man named Radio. Ed Harris co-stars and this movie is directed by Mike Tollin. Based on a true story, Radio is a teenager who has a life of spending most of his day alone. He walks around with a shopping cart that takes everything he can and always carries a radio around. He has his own collection. At the end of each day, he goes home to his mother. He never went to school for later in the film. One day, Radio passes by the local high school while the football team is practicing. A football flies over the fence and radio picks it up and continues on. Ed Harris plays Mr. Jones, football coach. They meet and this is Radio's life. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Radio and Coach Jones use quality time together, both teaching each other. It is beautiful to see how the movie goes to the highest joy, the lowest decline, and just to see that Radio lives its life. You will laugh, cry and live the radio's life with him. This movie has a special place in my heart along with Toy Story and others. This is a must-see for the whole family, alone or if you are one who just wants a good drama. Radio is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Radio is never forgotten by me. Never. As Ed Harris's character said very close to the end of the movie: <br /> <br /> "We do not teach Radio, Radio teaches us." <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> Eliason A.
