Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, both unfortunately missed, again showed that they were a team dedicated to their craft to bring fun moments to the screen. This movie is just another example of this. <br /> <br /> This time out, they play two brother-in-law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board. <br /> <br /> Of course, their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named Gil Godwin who just enjoys harassing these boys. It's fun how Lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to Matthau, and how the latter dances a riotous rumba with the boat's owner Rue McLanahan. <br /> <br /> Too bad that other dance participants Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor are given so little to do, but their parts require it. Matthau falls for Dyan Cannon, aboard with his innate gold-engraving mother, the usual monstrous Elaine Stritch. Not known to them, Matthau also has no money. The widow Lemmon falls to Gloria De Haven, looks lovelier than ever. <br /> <br /> The movie belongs to Matthau and Lemmon and will serve as a tribute to their famous career.
