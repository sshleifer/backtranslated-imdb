This is possibly the most perfect movie I have ever seen - in acting, adaptation and direction. It is independent and of a kind, so it is not meant to be better or worse than other fantastic movies, just that it can stand in itself as a perfect work of art. <br /> <br /> Watching confused horror fans and going out was fun!
