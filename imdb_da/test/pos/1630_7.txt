I was at the prizes of the movie last night in Rome. I'm not an expert in the book, but there are many changes from the book to the movie. The pacing of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were trimmed otherwise it would be a 4 hour movie. Many things were also changed to give the film a fast pace. I think what's important is the feeling of the movies, and it works well for Hanks, Brown, and Company. <br /> <br /> There are some things in the book that seem to be very impossible in the movie form. I don't give any spoiler except to say that the end of the movie is handled in a slightly different way. The way Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who watch the movie may be interested in reading the book to get the full details of the story. Some minor details are also cut from the film. Although they filmed in Rome, they had to recreate interior images. Since I went on a tour of Rome the day before the movie I can say that the interiors are authentic in appearance. Kohler is not in the movie and not much is shown about CERN. Hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes that involve the Vatican archives. Of course, they didn't have access to this area and I'm not sure if anyone actually knows what the Vatican archives look like. Eyelet Zurer has a break in this movie as Victoria Vetra and does a good job as eye candy for Hanks. <br /> <br /> This film should be better received by critics and the public, but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and cast before the movie, this is just a movie.
