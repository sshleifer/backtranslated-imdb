Just to clarify, Matthew Poncelet was not a real person, but a character combination of 2 killers, both convicted and sentenced to die for a murder of two teenagers. <br /> <br /> I read the user comments and they respond as if Matthew were genuine. The character is based on a mix of two killers, Elmo Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie (who murdered separate people), and the murder itself was based on the one Willie committed. The conflict between both Willie, who has another present and both parties swear the other, has also killed the killer into history. <br /> <br /> Prejean's approach is unique because she not only earns the judges they wait for their death and helps them take responsibility for their actions when she also reaches the victims' families to help them Knowing that the prison did, actually feels annoyed at what they did - effectively helping both parties. <br /> <br /> Anyone posting here seems to have strong beliefs about the death order. It is not my place to say that it is right or wrong - in theory death kills with a kind of karmic sense, but denies a person their freedom for the rest of their days, even if it is expensive, gives me more meaning - Stuck in a small room 23/7 (with an hour of exercise) for the rest of their days being reminded of the cruel thing they seemed to be a more appropriate punishment - they are technically alive but refused to live. Say someone killed someone so they could get out of charge, the person they killed required (as Susan Smith killed his bad kids by pushing her car into a lake). I find it appropriately ironic that they would not get the "freedom" they yearn for and should now spend the rest of their imprisoned days. <br /> <br /> Prejean's point comes through history very well. She has my respect - she manages to find that balance - she doesn't support a killer, she directs them to accept what they did. If they did not feel any kind of remorse, they would not ask for spiritual guidance. <br /> <br /> Finally, Ona note when Poncelet apologizes to Delacroix's parents for killing his son, the parents of the girl, who also murdered something about why he did not apologize for her death. I think Poncelet was supposed to refuse to kill both children throughout the film. There is doubt about Prejean's mind that he did both killing - there's a friend who was sentenced but not to death - my thinking is that Poncelet killed the Delacroix boy and the other man murdered the girl - therefore Poncelet took charge what he did. Had he been responsible for the girl's death, he would probably have apologized for that too.
