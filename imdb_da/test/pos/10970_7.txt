1959 was a landmark in the film world. Several great directors of the classical age released career classics who were among their best. Just a look at the titles is instructive, Hitchcock's North Town Northwest, Billy Wilders Some like the Hot, Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo, Douglas Sir's Imitation of Life. Add a couple from the previous year, Orson Welles' Touch of Evil, Hitch's Vertigo and Nick Rays Wind over the Everglades, and you have a pretty good summary of what was possible in the classic Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> At the same time, two films appeared that suggested a whole new way to make movies. One was Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless, the other was John Cassavete's Shadows. The two films had certain things in common, largely impromptu with non-stars, handheld cameras, low budgets and a particular youthful, jazzy swagger. However, in some ways they could not be farther apart. Godard was still a believer in the director as an arbiter of style. He knew more about movies than most Hollywood producers, and Breathless was full of iconography of the classic crime film. Cassavetes, on the other hand, was an actor and a refugee from New York's underground theater scene. His first film shows him a little impressed with the cinema and a great belief in actors. Godard's film constantly refers to his own work of art, while Shadows aims for a particular form of naturalism. It does not reach it, primarily because naturalism is a myth, especially in cinema. But it feels strong, kinetic, but lilting like the cool jazz on the score, certainly the most important inspiration for the movie style on the screen here. Ultimately, it does not hold, mainly because Cassavete's actors here are amateur beatniks, in which Cassava's style requires strong, imaginative actors. His later work with Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazarra and Peter Falk knocks it out of the water. Because of the instructor's technical inexperience, some dialogue had to be rebuilt later, defeating the freshness of the improvisation. It is still fascinating to see both the great moments (like the scene where Leila Goldoni talks about her disappointment in losing her virginity) and see a groundbreaking artist who finds her way.
