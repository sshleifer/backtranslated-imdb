A little "movie in the movie" case, or as the theme is virtual play here, which is reality or even more frightening, which reality is the "real". Like any Cronenberg, there are organic things like pod and the wonderful idea: the organic gun, a weapon made of bones and tissues that shoot teeth. If there are some slower moments, the sets, designers and ideas are there with some thoughts about revolution. Dislikes because the way the movie happens is quite unusual and sometimes disturbing, but it is definitely worth it.
