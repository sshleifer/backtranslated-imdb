Cowboys and Indians are an excellent movie. Writing, acting, directing couldn't have been better. This was a story asking to be told, and this group of talented individuals and teams did a great job of doing so. Stories like this are not pleasant, but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist worldwide. It is my hope that when this film is seen, attitudes and prejudices will change. A movie that can do that is a rare thing. Andrew Berzins is an excellent writer and his talents and expertise in this field shone through in this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you for telling this story !!! <br /> <br /> Ruby
