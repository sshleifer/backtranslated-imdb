Sui generis. People, I don't want to lie to you; Merhige is one or two hit wonder, but what a movie (it almost apologizes to SUSPECT ZERO). Neither will I let myself understand it completely; half of what does it, what it is, is trying to guess what the hell they are doing on the screen because of chiaroscuro. <br /> <br /> Richard Corliss says, "It is as if a druid cult had real three Bible stories - creation, birth and Jesus' torture and death on Calvary." It is not a bad description, but it seems more to be than the apparently one to one religious correspondence. <br /> <br /> There is an environmental theme close to the surface - note towards the end (after the landscape barrenness) there are large pipes that do not separate them on a construction site. Oh no, he's going to say, look at how people are shouting at nature. You rarely see a dead metaphor in action, and with this much hyperbole, but to see it acting out, it is more piggy than the language that implies. <br /> <br /> And if you just want something to sync with a death metal soundtrack, it has the necessary atrocities. But as for myself and others like me, it is an important art movie that should deserve a Criterion collection. Just up there with Murnaus FAST. <br /> <br /> ~ Ray
