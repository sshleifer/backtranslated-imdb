When gilmore girls started in Germany, I didn't want to see them, because it was just something that wasn't unique to me. It was a series and I didn't know anyone in it either. Later I understood that Edward Hermann is part of the throw overboard (a movie I absolutely love). I had to see it once with a friend and never stopped since. It's just fun. You have a feeling of having sex before you are married and it is okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy things all the time. I don't do these things all the time, but when I do these things, I feel a little like a gilmore girl. Even my boyfriend began to see them, and it says something. from season to season it became better with scripts and stories. They have an open mind and by being different from all other shows, you will be like them.
