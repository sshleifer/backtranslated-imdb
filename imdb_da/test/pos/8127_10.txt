I seriously enjoyed watching this movie for the first time some years ago, and when it is re-posted somewhere (which fortunately happens from time to time in European cable TV), I experience the same thing that I have moved, entertained and end up wishing there were more movies like this. <br /> <br /> It's about Leo (Kevin McKidd) and his group of friends living in city London, Leo as a gay guy, following a friend of a hilarious New Age Men's Group and falling for straight guy Brendon played by dashing James Purefoy who doesn't show up just after all. The cast as a side sign is just as great Tom Hollander and Hugo Weaving, whose side story alone is worth seeing the film, Simon Callow as head of the Men's Group, which becomes a great as always achievement. But it's really hard to pick some people out here, for every character, the women like Jennifer Ehle, Julie Graham and Harriet Walter are also exquisitely traded. Perhaps Kevin McKidd may look a little pale in relation to his cast, but it does benefit his slightly poor character. The idea behind this movie is a simple one: there is never only black and white, classifications are difficult and can not always be the time test. <br /> <br /> Leo identifies as gay, but ends up falling to a woman who also turns out to be his teenage girlfriend and Bronte's long boyfriend. Brendon is just starting out, but learning that gay can be more than just an opportunity for him and being bisexual may not be that bad. Darren and Jeremy (Hollander and Weaving) are gay and love it, and even the people of the movie, like Angie, Leo's roommate, get their fair share of love and fun moments until the end of the movie. The comedy bits (especially Tom Hollander, who is just funny) are funny and on point, and the emotions are credible, as confusing as they might seem to read this summary. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie is its really positive performance. Whether you are gay, straight, bisexual or simply not sure, this movie lets you feel that it's just okay, NOT to be safe, and that "don't be sure" can be worth living out! Sexuality is portrayed as fluid in this movie, and none of the protagonists seem to have a real problem with it, except for all the gay / straight fight games that you are sometimes fed into other gay films. I can only wholeheartedly agree with the movie's subtitle that what you feel safe in a day when you think you identify as gay, regardless, can look very different on another. I have never seen (what to call it?) Bisexuality or perhaps just the absence of the segregating need for sexual classification is portrayed in such a warm and true way. <br /> <br /> This movie dares to go where few movies go, gay or even movies, by not playing on labels and stereotypical sex assumptions and trusting it. It goes further and assumes that there can be a sex life after known ratings, and I think the times are more than ready for it and other movies exploring postmodern themes like this! <br /> <br /> And for everyone who doesn't care about it, heck, it's just a fun comedy worth watching on a rainy evening with some popcorn on your hands. Try it! <br /> <br /> Loved it!
