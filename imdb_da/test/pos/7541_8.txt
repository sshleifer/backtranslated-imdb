Choose your destiny: The horrible thicken in the fourth form, play practical jokes involving axes, or ... ummm ... well-developed girls in the sixth form who recently discovered cigarettes, gin, sex and how easy men can be derived. The problem is that a set comes with the other. They are all here at St. Trinian, the remarkably light English school for girls led by Millicent Fritton (Alastair Sim). As Fritton is pleased to point out, "In other schools, girls are sent unprepared to a merciless world, but when our girls leave here, it is the relentless world to be prepared." Miss Fritton sounds like a message about Julia Child and Eleanor Roosevelt, and certainly has Sims droll and deadpan comic genes. <br /> <br /> St. Trinian's Belles of St. Trinian is a bleak, chaotic comedy from the team Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, usually on the brink of economic disaster. However, salvation may be present when a rich Sheikh sends her daughter to the fourth form and receives a proper English education. Sheik is also a horse owner, and one of his prize bikes, Arab Boy, is trained near the school for a race. It is only a matter of time before the fourth-form girls make up a racetrack and bet heavily on Arab Boy, with Fritton adding to the pool what funds the school has left. (Much of the fourth shaped girl's money comes from the gin they make in chemistry, and then bottle and down the rope for Flash Harry (George Cole), a Cockney fixer for distribution. "It has something ... I don't do it knows what the lady says, "Miss Fritton says about sampling those things," but send a few bottles up to my room. ") Miss Fritton, however, has a brother, Clarence Fritton (as of some coincidence, also Alastair Sim), a bookmaker who has not only tied a bundle on another horse but who also has a daughter. And he has put the perishable Arabella in the sixth form to keep him informed. Soon the sixth form has kidnapped Arab Boy, the fourth form has taken the horse back, Flash Harry has teamed up with Frigon, the sixth shaped girls are determined that Arab boy will not leave the second floor of St. Trinian's, Clarence and his homburg-weary gang have arrived, parents are up to the parents' day and the Ministry of Education has come to the person who is a real correct inspector. The total war breaks out on St. Trinian's. It is difficult to say what is more dangerous, the African spears or the flour bombs. <br /> <br /> Alastair Sim as Millicent Fritton turns into a turn of force performance. Miss Fritton is a tall woman with a grand bosom, fond of long dress with embroidered blonde and Edwardian hats with lots of feathers. She takes everything in step, even a fourth past pounding on something in chemistry class, and after hearing an explosion a few minutes later, the results. "Oh dear. I told Bessie to be careful about the nitroglycerin!" She is firm in believing that St. Trinian is "a gay arcade of happy girls." Sim was one of Britain's great eccentric actors. Apart from the sheer chaos of all the little (and not so small) girls who do terrible things, he delivers much of the film's pleasure.
