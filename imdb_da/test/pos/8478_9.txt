Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) is also an extremely talented pianist and singer. Ray is also a smart man. Ray started his career in the late 1940s before finding his distinctive style. Ray is certainly popular with the nightclubs with his music. Things change when he meets an ambitious music producer (Curtis Armstrong). Who knows, Ray got what it takes to be a strong performer, and he also meets a woman (Kerry Washington) he also loves and marries along. Ray's album becomes a hit when he mixes soul music and gospel together. Which makes Ray a controversial man in the 1950s to the 1960s. Ray has love for all kinds of music, including Country. But Ray is not always the perfect man he seems to be. When he had many failed relationships with another woman while he was married. But he also had to fight with racism, people who crossed him, his music ideals and of course his drug abuse. Which made Ray's life extremely difficult for him and also to fight for his childhood tragedy. Which Ray has always been guilty of. <br /> <br /> Directed by Oscar-Winner: Taylor Hackford (against all odds, the devil's lawyer, Dolores Claiborne) made a fascinating true life story of the always interesting of the late "Ray" "Charles." Foxx won an Oscar for his touching performance of the late entertainer, Foxx brings heart and soul to film and humor as well, but this movie has lots of rich performances by a top cast including: Regina King, Clifton Powell, Bokeem Woodbine, Aunjaune Ellis, Warwick Davis, Terrence Howard and Sharon Warren as Ray's mother, this is probably the best movie of Hackford's career to date, and the movie also has lots of songs for Charles's best music. <br /> <br /> DVD has a sharp Pan & Scan (1.33: 1) transfer and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound Disc 1 has an informative commentary from the director, and the DVD also has the original theatrical and extended version, but you look better at the theatrical version instead, because bonuses The capture is in bad shape at times and you have to click on a logo to see these deleted scenes. Disc 2 has deleted scenes with optional comment from the instructor (as seen in the extended version), featurettes and more. But featurettes are disappointing cards for this DVD. Since the film is extraordinary good. This film was nominated for four Oscars, including Best Costume Designs, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Picture. This is a great story of true life, told, but of course, Charles's life was even more controversial and outrageous than the final movie. Still, it's pretty damn close. Manuscript by James L. White. From a story of white and director: Hackford. Oscar winner for best sound. Do not miss it. (**** Â½ / *****).
