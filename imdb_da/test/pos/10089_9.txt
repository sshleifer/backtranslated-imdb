Disgused as an Asian fate, "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is actually a complex character-driven psychological drama that engages the viewer in the problems of an apparently normal family. I was really surprised at the depth of this movie. Director Ji-woon Kim's decision to focus more on telling a story rather than giving cheap scare has proved to be a real one. Creating one of the most brilliant new horror movies. <br /> <br /> "A Tale Of Two Sisters" counts the story as the name of two sisters Su-mi and the younger Su-yeon, who after spending time in a mental institution returns to their father and apparently abused founder. From then on, we see how the sisters handle their grandfather's gradually increasing aggression and irregular behavior. Saying what would happen next would be to pamper the whole experience. So I just want to leave it on it. <br /> <br /> The reason is very closely written. With the characters beautiful fleshed out. Ji-woon Kim's focus on a small throw gives a much more detailed view of them and their relationship with each other. In addition, each of the four main casting has a very different role and character type. From the protective Su-mi, the weaker Su-yeon, the visibly uninterested father of the tribal's hectic and later mortal behavior. There is a great sense of mystery, with much of the plot that is not revealed at the end, and even left the film still a good interpretation. Even after seeing it, the viewer is forced to see it at least once more so that he can better understand it. <br /> <br /> The actors perfectly match their roles. It is especially difficult to create strong, emotional scenes in psychological films, but it is a great joy when you succeed in creating them, and this is an excellent example of such a feat. builds tension for the movie's horror scenes. While few in number, these moments are strong and quite reverently scary. The cinematography and the score are also very much to create an atmosphere that fits a psychological film. <br /> <br /> "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is a demonstration of how the horror genre is actually so much more than a simple thrill ride. With the strong focus on character and mystery, this is a complex movie that can easily seduce you to see it over and over just so you can understand it better.
