A touching story told with soreness: scary young Jewish girl in World War II America befriended a escaped German POW hiding in her clubhouse. They discuss their life and faith (he is anti-Hitler), she cheats him food, he becomes her only friend and ally. All of this reminded me of the much better theater movie "Whistle Down The Wind" where Hayley Mills befriends Alan Bates judges, but you certainly can't fault it here, which is smooth or the notion that is sterling. Mature in his pre-teen year, Kristy McNichol carries most of the picture and never hits a false note. Suddenly, when the prisoner is discovered (and Kristy is also aware of it), the film becomes very hard. Her father was shocked and ashamed that his child would advocate "the Nazi", lying in her with a silent anger I have rarely seen before (he tells her "you are dead to me", which must be devastating for a little girl to hear). The final scenes do not cheat; There are no large reunions, no hand-held climax. The girl must face the world and thus learn a bitter lesson about neighbors, friends and family. An exciting movie.
