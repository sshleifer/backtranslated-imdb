This movie has a decent story in my opinion very good fighting scenes, but I was a little disappointed at the end of the movie. I think it was a better way if sounding denier known karate too, or if she knew how to use some weapons, her character has become more interesting too, and she was a decent opponent to cynthia.i believe when the director filmed the final 'fight' between cynthia & denier, he would finish the film earlier so he did not care how the end would be. All in all, I think fans of cynthia rothrock will be very happy to see this movie. It's not like 'yes, wife'! or sworn to justice, but it was entertainment enough and cynthia looks great in this movie so my rate for this movie is a solid 8/10
