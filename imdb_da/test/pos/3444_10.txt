Watching this movie, or rather movie, in my early teens irrevocably changed my idea of ​​the possibilities of human interaction and the scope of potential experience. This monumental exploration of individuals and their historical setting reveals how complete and intense all human beings exist. The people are portrayed as they are for themselves: their experiences with the smallest to the greatest internal and external phenomena are detailed with the greatest art and perception. Edgar Reitz shows a fabulous recognition of human motivations and longings. When these phenomena are set against the immense time allowed by the length of work, one cannot help but consider the power and liveliness of happiness, defeat, desire, love, sorrow, melancholy, that each person feels. When I watched these movies, I saw my future experiences how my life would inevitably twist and oscillate because of both intentional and unintentional events. I got a sense of the length of being and what it meant to reflect on past lives, memories and contexts. A masterpiece and a revelation. I just wish the BBC would see it again. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows where to get a copy, they can contact me
