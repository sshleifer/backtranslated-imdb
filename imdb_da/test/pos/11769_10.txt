What a good little movie, lots of good roles from some random stars. Basically, there are those horror farmers who get caught in a comic adventure. In places, the movie makes you believe that everyone will end up being dead! Which adds to the comedy. When the character of John Lithgow (3rd Rock) appears again - it is impossible not to imagine the trip it may have caused, as a total paradox. The movie is full of twists and turns that keep you guessing until the end. The Billy Bob Thornton Astronaut Farmer) is brilliant, actually looking back, the sign is pretty similar in that he holds the family of groves together. Everyone involved in this movie should get a big thumbs up. <br /> <br /> As I say, the final scene is a dream; however, a nightmare at the same time. I love it when Hank Azaria (carter) finally says, do you think we should do it every year? I felt myself wishing they would. <br /> <br /> I don't want to say that this movie is good for everyone, but as a lover of stoner movies, I give it 10/10. - My advice has a common clarity; save back and enjoy!
