Almost every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview movies are superimposed on the concert recording in places. This is true and is the biggest mistake in this movie. However, it is not so often, or so bad, that one should not watch this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you should see this. Apart from seeing Black Sabbath in the Sevnties and the early 80s, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 as they also headed the OZZfest like this video. The concert was great, and much like this, why I rented this in the first place. It's just about the best geezer rock out there. Check it out.
