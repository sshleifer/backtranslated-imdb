I was just lucky I found this movie. I have used Walmarts $ 5.50 DVDs because I see many movies (and rarely see television). I graduated from high school in 1968 - so I have family and many friends who served in Vietnam. This movie really illustrates the pain I have seen in my friends in dealing with what happened to them over there. I wish more people would watch this movie - I think maybe more people could understand what happened to our Vietnam veterans by seeing these excellent actors in the depiction of a family damaged by that war. The story felt realistic - it's not the mushy, but made me feel what they were going through. I think it helped Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez play father and son - it made their relationship more credible
