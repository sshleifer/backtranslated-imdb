"Throw Momma From the Train" is a simple dark comedy with lots of laughs. Billy Crystal plays a frustrated writer on the brink of collapse; Danny DeVito plays a man in one of Crystal's writing classes. Krystal's ex-wife is a * favor * to put it nicely, and Crystal hates her. DeVito who senses this, offers Crystal a deal one night: DeVito will kill Crystal's wife whose Crystal kills DeVitos nag by a mother. Of course, Crystal refuses, but later, corruption deep in his heart makes him say yes. And as things go out, we see what happens when you try to throw someone else's mom from a running train. <br /> <br /> This story is an interesting character study; a story of evil, greed, revenge, ego, trust, doing what is right, but most of all corruption. We see that Crystal's white collar writer gets stressed with events that collide around him, and because of DeVito's constant creep, he says "yes". But we know deeply in his subconscious, he would say yes, and he is happy that he told it to DeVito. This movie is a bit of a dark spear on Hitchcock's immortal movie "Strangers on a Train" and it plays a tribute to the movie early when there is a theater playing "Strangers on a Train." We see DeVito watching the movie, and a light bulb in the head pops up. He gets an idea. Throw Momma off the train! <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal gives another compelling and strange comic performance as a hassled writer on the brink of collapse. He has been so knocked down by everything around him that his inner feelings come out and he agrees to throw DeVitos momma off the train. <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito managed this movie very well. He just uses the right pressure on comic darkness to create a world of corruption and disease. Everything is demented, but not to an extreme as in some other dark comedies. It has just the right darkness that shone through in "The War of the Roses." Not only is "Kast Momma From the Train" a simple story about corruption and morality, but it is also an interesting character study. Definitely worth catching on TV. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 Stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
