With the exception of the main character, the actress did not persuade me, but the story was quite good: It is about a love affair between a gay boy and a young Mormon missionary. As you can imagine, such a relationship is quite problematic. The film is very American and as such has some metaphysical undertones to counteract its criticism of religious intolerance. But some stories are hilarious: one of the protagonists asks his gay colleague: "Do you believe in God?" And he answers, "You mean: other than Madonna?" All in all, the movie is not one of my all-time favorites, but the script is really good and I really liked it: it's entertaining and opposed to (religious) prejudice and intolerance. I think this is an important message in our times. Since I rated movies that I liked less with 9, it's clearly a 10 for me. Some people may find this exaggerated, but I think this movie deserves it.
