Wow, What a wonderful movie production! Mr. Im doing it again! <br /> <br /> His last work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great movie, but this one is even bigger. Selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year series, this 66-year-old instructor is getting better and better at what he does with a Korean culture. <br /> <br /> Simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up, who was considered a marvel at the end of the nineteenth century. The basic film about this film tells Jang, Seung-up and his historical background. He was orphaned, but in his teens he was occupied by a noble man called Kim, Byung-Moon. This Mr.Kim becomes the mentor of Jang as well as the lifelong friendship and continues to support his great talent, which he initially knew. With Jang's great efforts and natural talent, his fame grows faster and faster as the strength of his country. Korea falls down. Jang's personality highlighted in the movie is very complicated and one of the best actors in Korea, Choi, Min-sik goes deep into Jang's soul. Suffering eyes reveal the struggle for the life of a great artist. He is very serious sometimes, but suddenly he turns into a wild maniac. He drinks like an alcoholic, and sleeps at any time with courtesans. He himself said in the movie: "Without alcohol and a woman I can't draw. (An alcohol and women are my only inspirations)" At the top of fame, to develop his own style, he travels around the country and never gives its pride as an artist for the authority or money. I don't want to give out all the details, but I think you've probably got some ideas about the movie. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing about this movie is filmography. It's just so breathtaking how they caught every beauty of landscapes. Yes, every scene is like a work of Jang's painting. And the script is also perfect. It is primarily about a deeper meaning of what makes a true artist. For example, Kim recommends to Jang in the movie that 'before you have a brush, you must set a goal in life'. This is a very moving and inspiring line, and there are many more. <br /> <br /> Go Watch this movie if you want to be in the Canne Festival. <br /> <br /> Chihwasun will be the greatest movie ever made dealing with the life of a painter in movie history.
