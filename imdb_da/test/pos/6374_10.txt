Each show is excellent. Finally, a show about something other than why it sucks to be married or looks good people are talking about why they are like normal people. Shame it was canceled. <br /> <br /> Mike Scully and Julie Thacker, formerly of the Simpsons, wrote or performed some of the funniest episodes of that series, and very similar style of humor sails in here. Take officer Steve Cox and believe Troy McClure. But it comes with its own unique humor and let's see it, a teenage girl will just love it on the faces alone. What about television that cancels most good shows and we are spoon-fed with such abominations as my mother almost slept with or what it is called? Please learn a lesson. Not everything should be about cuteness or romantic travelers or especially reality shows on how to demystify every aspect of life. Some people may actually like to laugh and not have to think afterwards. Now my grip is made for the day. Now back to the Simpsons. When is it on? Oh yes! Continually.
