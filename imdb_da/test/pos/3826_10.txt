I watched the original external borders in real time when they were first broadcast and then watched the entire original series over and over again in re-runs and finalized on DVD. I find the new external borders much better than just a remake of old restored episodes suggested by some of the more young commentators. With seven (7) year programs versus only the two (2) years of the original series, manufacturers and writers have certainly added significant new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer-running and highly-produced (cable) television series. Plots are intelligent, scientifically accurate projections of the unknown opportunities for the sometimes frightening and imminent future. While most Hollywood producers and directors are outrageously watching Sci-Fi distinguished from Horror and Fantasy, this series returns to the origins of Science Fiction in the logical, moral and philosophical projections of current new technologies in their potentially dreadful near-term realizations. This series does very well and remains unique in its avoidance of "shoot-em-up" video game samples mentally by much of the current generation. It has brains, history, a message and good entertainment. It is an adult series without unbearable teenage know-it-all fantasies. Hurray! <br /> <br /> Now, if we can only get the MGM to release the entire New Outer Limits series on DVD instead of just the six bad teaser disks and the first season now only available.
