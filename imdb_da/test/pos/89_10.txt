This is a piece of biographical beauty and it shows more of Quebec's culture to others than probably any other work that comes from la belle province. It takes everyone into a cultural experience of the first person, to the point that you want you glued your hair in place and lived, breathed and ate everything Maurice Richard. The book makes it as good as the short one, and I am glad that I always used to study French in high school, it was necessary to read in both languages. I thought it was brilliant to have Roch Carrier tell this story. His molasses-thick accent brought much realism to the story. The animation was also good, very surreal, which draws attention to the fact that this is a whimsical daydream that wants better days gone by. As a symbol of culture quebecoise this is again unsurpassed. You can almost smell the tourtiere cooked slowly over a wood burning stove. This whole movie deserves endless praise for making people proud to be Canadian and encouraging all of us to appreciate the finer things in the family and our roots. I'm from Ontario and this movie made me fall in love with Quebec. Maurice Richard helps win dancers.
