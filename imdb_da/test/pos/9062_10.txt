Quirky, vulnerable, raw, honest and a treat to see. I'm not here to give a summary or a summary of the movie. I just want to congratulate this little movie with the big big heart. I tip my hat to the filmmaker and it is excellent cast. If you want to know what's going on in the movie ... then you should see it. Michael Parness, author / instructor, has handled a very sensitive and emotional topic, suicide, with great compassion, comedy and empathy. I see a good career ahead of Mr. Parness. This movie works. Right from the monstrous opening sequence to the bid, honest moments between David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. As with any movie, we must suspend some dissatisfaction, but I found with MAX AND GRACE, I was easily transported and completely convinced it is "surreal moments". I only wish they would have pushed some of these moments even further. Mr. Parness has "drawn" some wonderful performances from this already talented cast. For example, Guillermo DÃ­as' performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical as well as fluid. Colossus Ralf Moeller, formerly Mr Olympiad, as a scared patient ... perfect. I can go on and on ... This independent feature has the power of a large budget Hollywood movie, but you forget the STARS on the screen as you float with this wonderful written story. The real star here is the brilliant manuscript. I'm looking forward to seeing more from Writer / Director Michael Parness.
