A milestone in film history, 'Bronenoset's Potyomkin' is one of the handful of beautiful films out there that really deserve to be called a classic. That was the image that made Sergei M. Eisenstein an actress for filmmaking at the time. And today it is still remembered as the wonderful piece of cinema, it has always been. <br /> <br /> 'Potyomkin' is a movie that needs to be seen as a unit, not to be picked on. Don't just watch the rock shows where they only present the 'Odessa Stage' sequence and then move on to the 'Citizen Kane' or 'The Godfather', see it all in the glorious 75-minute race to truly understand and enjoy it. Don't expect all infinite details to be perfect, but I think the play of the '20s silent era makes' Scooby Doo' a master of underestimated realism, some plot points may seem illogical, and some of the fighting sequences look dated But it is still an extremely enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The most memorable moments in the film are the fate of the battleship, Vakulinchuk's body, falling off the ship, the sailor under the tent at the end of the pier, the mother holding her dead child, the pram on the Odessa steps and the lion rising to roar as further bloodbaths follow. For each new pair of eyes looking at it, 'The Battleship Potemkin' comes back to life.
