I have been an avid chipmunk fan since the late 70s - early 80s. When this movie came out, it was a must see. And after seeing it I just went and bought it! The movie is great, I love the animated action it brings, and the music is great (yes, I bought the audio track on CD ...) A recommended video for everyone to watch and enjoy!
