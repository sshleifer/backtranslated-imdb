Down Periscope is not a "Great Movie". But then again there are very few flicks. So, if you're looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom, it's a "big movie" without the capitals. No sharp sexism or graphic violence spoils this light comedy about a lot of misfits assigned to an antique submarine. They are able to fail their tasks, so a general can get their extra star. They must take over the entire US fleet with their nuclear submarines. But they are underdogs, and it's a comedy so you can guess the outcome. But you mess with the underdogs and that makes it a very entertaining movie. See and enjoy ******** (eight stars there)
