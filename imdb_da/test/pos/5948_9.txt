The two new OSS 117 films have a kind of humor that is both intelligent and dumbed-down at the same time as I find very entertaining. It reminds me of the classic Pink Panther movies with an almost as good leader as Peter Sellers in Jean Dujardin. And unlike Steve Martin, who totally destroys Clouseau, Dujardin is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> Comments to the films that are anti-Semitic are, of course, a case of complete lack of humor and thus understanding. <br /> <br /> Whether you want to enjoy or hate this movie, it really comes down to what kind of humor you have. I can't wait for the sequel!
