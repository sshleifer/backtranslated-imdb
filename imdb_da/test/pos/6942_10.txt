In the nineteen and thirty-two, when it was announced that the Dismisalen was to be made, there was a disagreement. This was an event that still left open wounds in the hearts and minds of the Australian people. After some changes (listen to the well-timed phones that rang to pamper the names), the refusal went to air. It was nothing short of brilliant. The wires were perfect. Max Phipps as Gough Whitlam leads the way, closely followed by John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and the evergreen John Mellion as Sir John Kerr. The time was created well, people's feelings were well-finished, and the political elements were not two dimensionally made for the melodrama as in so many American series. The rejection was a faithful restoration of a time in Australia that some would rather forget and which we cannot forget. It didn't take pages and it pointed out both sides and the errors. It leaves someone who wants to maintain anger and change the constitution, which still allows everyone to happen again. The rejection is now available on DVD in Australia. See it, learn from it and learn about our modern history.
