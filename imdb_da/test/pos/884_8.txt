Although I watched this movie in Korea, in Korean, and therefore didn't understand the language, pictures probably say more than enough. From what I can do about this is the story: Two amazing swordsmen become friends in their service as the king's guard. One of them opposes the king's ways and begins to kill important men. The other must chase him. This film is visually great. The sword fighting is great. And the film has a gripping end. I just hope that this movie will be marketed to the Western cinema goers. And of course, be released on DVD.
