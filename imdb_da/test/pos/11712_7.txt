Burt Reynolds instructed this action movie and (surprise!) He is actually a really good instructor. This movie starts well when Burt's bust attempt at a drug trafficking is botched, and he's buried in the vice squad. The ensemble cast has some beautiful fun scenes when Brian Kieth always eats something, Bernie Casey has more classes than all his colleagues combined, and Charles Durning loses control of his team. <br /> <br /> The next policemen stumble upon an affordable ring-girl ring that may have something to do with a variety of murders. Sharkey uses days to beat Dominoe's (Rachel Ward) apartment, and begins to really bid her away. <br /> <br /> Only when they get close to the crime leader, Dominoe dominates. I won't give away any of the surprises in the plot, but the first hour of this movie is great. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script is very clich√© and incredible after that. <br /> <br /> Why would Burt Reynolds confront the crime commander with his great secret? Sure it makes the guy sweat, but it causes many more police to be killed. And it is unbelievable that Dominoe and Sharkey would love after they know each other for a day, much less while their lives are in danger. And finally, what happened to all the police running into the building with our heroes? Isn't there a SWAT team? Also, the film never tells you how all the evil ones are connected and why they should kill so many people. <br /> <br /> There is a very effective torture scene on a boat near the end of the movie, which is probably the only real nail-biting scene in the movie. It's a shame that the climax is a typical shoot-em-up. Nevertheless, this movie is quite entertaining if you like crime and action movies. Don't think about the plot holes and you will have a good time.
