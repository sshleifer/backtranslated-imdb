"Chips" is an excellent mix of music, light comedy and drama with a picture perfect performance of Peter O 'Toole and effortlessly romantic supportive performance of Petula Clark. O 'Toole is able to show the shy, uncommunicative teacher who wants so much to be loved by his students and can only express his love when he married Katherine (Clark). She brings him the world "What many flowers" and he changes forever. He becomes Brookfield's beloved principal, through tragedy, but knows that he could only reach his goal through Catherine's love. The songs (with the exception of the music hall number) are all "thought songs" that come from the character's feelings and thoughts, and the more you listen to them, the more beautiful they become - "Go through the world with me" and "You and I". O'Toole's finest moment is the final figure he gives to the students (that was the reason for the Oscar nomination). As a teacher, we question what "book" learning ever comes through - but as Chips says, we taught them how to behave with each other, and that is what really counts. Beautifully filmed, perfectly orchestrated by John Williams and one of the most moving films about love and how it can change you. "Did I fill the world with love?" the boys sing their school song. Eventually Chips realizes he was able to do it - but only because Catherine was there.
