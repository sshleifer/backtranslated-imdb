Like most people, I'm tired of the number of clich√© movies that Hollywood does. There seems to be no creativity in Hollywood. Businesses only want to spend money on remakes are successors who have an audience built-in. <br /> <br /> This movie is a welcome change. It could be classified as a romantic comedy for its genre, but don't let this movie hit you. This is a very original movie that is not like most things Hollywood produces. <br /> <br /> If you read this, you already know the basic plot, so I won't bother going over it. The only movies to be considered for comparing this are "Interstate 60" and "Art of Travel", which are little-known gemstones that take a different path than most of the Hollywood waste. It is well worth seeing if you are tired of seeing more of the same. <br /> <br /> Dean
