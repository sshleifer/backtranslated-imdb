Newly pregnant Knight bolts from man for non-specific reasons, apparently self-related. On the way she is anchored with Caan, brain-injured former football star, and Duvall, wacky but abusive cop. The type of film that could only have been created in the 60s. Worth looking for its non-formal plot and premature notions of future stars. Disappointing resolution does not take too much of the rest of the girl, showing an interesting piece of life.
