A rather charming portrayal of the European Union, which begins to function among the young generation as representatives of this group, learns to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, ​​where they all study on international scholarships. Central to the story is Xavier (Romain Duris), who may have lived a fairly conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group helps them deal with landlords and other issues. He learns about life and love quickly. Duris has a healthy appearance and gives a good performance. The rest of the throw also plays well. Occasionally they all fall into English when they want to make sure they communicate, uncertain of all their apartment-mates' ability to understand French or Danish, or what the languages ​​may be. Cinematography remarkable including fine views of Barcelona and its famous Gaudi towers.
