I felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a love for Eleanor Bergstein. The main players (Campbell Scott, Jennifer Beals, Yancy Butler, James Goodwin III, Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron) were very well-chosen and played their parts with expertise. It was a very uplifting movie that I wanted was available on tape or DVD. A rare gem.
