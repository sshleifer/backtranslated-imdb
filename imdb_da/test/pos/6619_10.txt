Back in the day I was one of the RNs in the Emergency Rooms, these skaters would occasionally land. They were not treated well and some of it was brought on by their asocial personalities - but we all knew they were a talented pile of "wonderkids" even then. They deserve better care than they received I am afraid. They had "attitude" in spades. I'm so glad I caught this documentary on the IFC tonight - it'll be again at 1am and I'll see again! <br /> <br /> A little attention was paid to them until the rich dying child was able to talk to his parents to drain the pool - and the film really emphasizes that as a start time ... was a fantastic time and deserved to be registered. Stacy Peralta is due to all the praise of him, and for a long time the Z-Boys can enjoy their memories and contributions to the real sport of skateboarding. As for the few "sour grapes" reviews contained here, there was always, and there will always be "wannabees" and hangers that never more than dream ... Z-boys live it and breathe it, it was. br /> <br /> Nice to see the vintage movies and even the single girl, "Peggy" who was so talked about being the only female to win their respect. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the IFC, I get to really take occasional drug-free hikes in my youth and revive the heart pounding excitement again.
