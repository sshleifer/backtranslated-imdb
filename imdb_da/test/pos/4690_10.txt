Used to see this when I was very small, so used to watch my videos. Now I look at the DVDs, I love this. Ray Winston is 'The Dude', the rest of the throw is all good, and even with the change of Robin Hood it all works. Great stories, twists and the way it was shot - to the untrained eye (not my education is trained) can be interpreted as being ropey, but it adds to the audience's film absorption. With the green hills and contrast of the lush sunlit forest to the dark corridors and dungeons in castles - it's great. Personally the final interpretation of Robin Hood legend. I can't stress how much I think you should look at this, if you get a chance, then you should see it.
