Robert Cummings, Laraine Day and Jean Muir star in "And One Was Beautiful", a 1940 movie starring Billie Burke. In an hour and 15 minutes it seems to be a B movie. Cummings is a playboy, Ridley Crane, whom many women want, including two sisters, Katherine and Helen Latimer (Day and Muir). Katherine is the more grounded of the two who like to repair cars, and Helen is the blonde social butterfly with the beautiful dress. Ridley returns to town, and by believing that he is not partying, Helen decides not to attend. When the party is given by a family friend, their mother (Burke) sends Katherine in a fastened dress. Ridley is there and the two connect. But Ridley is more superficial, and when he sees Helen at a dinner party, the two pick up where they left off and go to a club. He gets terribly drunk, and Helen first refuses to drive in his car because he won't let her drive. After walking for a while and breaking her heel on her shoes, she enters Ridley's car as he drives past. He passes out and she accidentally takes the wheel to hit and kill a bicycle. <br /> <br /> Ridley can't remember anything so Helen lets him blame him for death. The heel of a woman's shoes is in the car, and Katherine sees her sister limiting her shoes - plus something in Helen's way makes her aware that Helen doesn't tell the truth. Ridley is sentenced and imprisoned, and Helen marries a man she doesn't love and leaves to South America. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie, although at that time it was not an A-list cast. Cummings plays a role that Robert Taylor would have played (it's an MGM movie) - he's handsome and very gracious, though he doesn't have the dazzling look of anyone like Taylor. Laraine Day is a favorite actress of mine, a MGM lent constantly because they didn't know what to do with her. Why am I wondering - a wonderful actress with a good face and a voice she tense many movies. This one is no different. Her Katherine is determined, sympathetic and absolutely lovely. Jean Muir is a miserable actress. <br /> <br /> So who was the beautiful one? We all know, although the MGM did not. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended gem.
