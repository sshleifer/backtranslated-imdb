You know the films that are obviously horrible, but you can't help but love them? Well that's what Evil Ed is, possibly the best horrible movie in the world. The sound is rubbish, the duplication is shit, the manuscript is nonsense, and the special effects are cardboard. However, I cannot help but love this movie expensive and I have recommended it to at least 50 people over the years. Sam Campbell (or the guy who plays him) should be on the Actor's Studio series as he is so memorable. Perhaps the biggest movie villain is not named Tony Montana. Seriously, if you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed. Keep a light hearted approach to watching this movie and you'll soon judge it a ten afterwards.
