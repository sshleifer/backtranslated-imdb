Naruto Anime TV series has so far created 2 feature films, and a third comes our way this summer. The first released in the summer of '04 was a fun adventure with the main characters of Naruto in an exciting adventure. But one must be a blind, deaf and a chicken to deny the film's fault. While the first one was most enjoyable, there were many things that could be improved. However, Naruto Movie 2 takes all these aspects and distinguishes them. <br /> <br /> The action was, above all, incredibly cinematic. The lighting, setting and style were three times as effective as the first movie. In the first we got basic action, well animated and choreographed animation, but no eye popping, but the cinematography of the movie was unusual, the use of shadows and lights combined together to make the action all the more intense was very effective and added to the power of the battle . <br /> <br /> The animation was very good. It rivaled Disney, but since this is a movie about television characters, there was nothing unusual about the character design or detail of the actual characters, but the animation was incredibly fluid and realistic. I think they even used twice the amount of cells in every second because there was nothing quite crazy about the animation at all. It was incredible fluid. <br /> <br /> The music ... I think this is where this movie fails. The original composer / conductor for the TV show was used for the film, and I don't really feel that he was doing well for a job. The music reminded me of many pieces that were used in old SNES games. The composer is very good, but the syntheses used for the film could not convey the melody very well. But they did not fail the film at all and added as a good accompaniment to the action. But apart from a few violin / string pieces towards the end and some chore work, the music did not constitute any boundaries or action as anything special. The story was fun. It was a fairly typical story for Naruto and was very similar to the first movies, except that again it took everything that had been wrong with the history of the first movie and improved it. The characters were much more interesting, and the way the story progresses was what I watched throughout the film. It continued to make you think that the movie would end for a moment now, but then it would go on, but instead of feeling dragged out, the actions and characters seemed to make everything feel fresh and exciting. This movie is a goodun, but well it may be, it is definitely one for the fans. I enjoyed the movie, but that's because ... I'm a fan! But I can see, as with Final Fantasy's Advent Children, it doesn't stand out as a movie, but only works as a fantastic service for fan service for half an hour and a half. Although I think this movie works as a good introduction to the series for current non-watchers, it won't give a full effect to anyone other than those glued to Naruto screens. But in spite of all this, it was a fun movie to enjoy during this depressing period of disruptive fillers.
