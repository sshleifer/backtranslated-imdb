This is a movie I love about everyone else. I try to revise the main movie sites in Oakworth and Oxenhope whenever I can, which helps restore the magical qualities that this movie seems to make so unique - reminiscent of a gentler and gentler age with its countless claims that people Really doing it family life is not just a one-time use and that life is really worth living (although we sometimes doubt it). In short, a movie that soon brings tears to its eyes, perhaps helped with the deeply evocative music - some tunes are jaunty (like Perks' tune, played on a trombone, sometimes with spoons), the appalling tune when the family first set off for Yorkshire without knowing what's ahead, and the joking little tune is played on a solo clarinet (or is it an oboe?) that precedes sudden changes in wealth. <br /> <br /> This is just as much a movie for adults as for children who appeal to the eternal child in all of us - a key that re-activates the deep and seemingly lost values ​​and feelings buried inside us who are usually swept aside by the demands of modern everyday life. This is a film about basic human goodness and decency, where we viewers are back to doing what we want, and there are welcome humorous times that are sometimes added to good action, such as the arrival of the aunt or a more earthly level of the bedroom. the scene on Perks' birthday - "Okay Bert - as it is your birthday!" I have to know every scene, every line in this movie, and yet so great is the magic that every time I see, it's like opening a box of delights for the first time, enjoying every moment - sometimes humorous, some times ... well very different. As Peter says in the movie, "It's perfect - more perfect than you know". And then it is !!!
