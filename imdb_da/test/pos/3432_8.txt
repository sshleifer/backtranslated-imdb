Very funny movie with some of the best Swedish actors. It's all filmed in black and white with the true 40-ish feeling. Most of the movie you are on board a train going to Berlin in 1945 among a mix of characters from refugees to 2 gay boys and 2 nuns. I really recommend this movie if you like to laugh.
