Let's first call this movie what it is: <br /> <br /> 1. It's a good movie with a message. <br /> <br /> 2. The action is just okay, dialogue a little better, the production value is quite good. <br /> <br /> 3. Rugby scenes ... just barely enough. <br /> <br /> But here's the trick: This is not a Hollywood design, and it doesn't try to be a wildly precise portrayal of the sport. Instead, it's a pretty good representation of mostly real people, in real life, and a real story. Well, they could have done a better job, actually repeating the sport, but my voice: it does a pretty good job on what it stands to do. <br /> <br /> (And fwiw, I can't think of many football, baseball, hockey or football movies that are true to the sport either. C'mon ... Bull Durham?) <br /> I'm not a rugby player (I was a wrestler) but I graduated from Highland, attended '86''90, and occasionally trained with Rugby guys. My brother-in-law David, however, was one of the original founders of the Highland Rugby Club in 1976. (His younger brother, Billy, played the next year as I remember. If you are interested, there is a Highland Rugby site at highlandrugby.net addressing the team's history.) <br /> <br /> When I was there, the club had existed for about a decade and had long since built a reputation for excellence. It is a fact that they focused on "broad" education topics: devotion, honor, discipline, effort and not tactics. I thought the rugby guys I knew were a little "off" in the head, but I think maybe I was just a little jealous. They were the hardware dedicated to the belief system Gelwix promoted. <br /> <br /> Regarding the "cultural mix" issues that have been raised, it may be interesting to note that while I was there in the 80s, one of the major schools in the city was closed - South High School - and its students distributed among the other 3 primary SLC schools. To be honest, Highland was pre-80s pretty white. I have a picture of the team from (I think) 1977, showing a * all * white club. South High, on the other hand, was a much more racially integrated school before it closed: I had a couple of friends from the South who joined the team, a Tongan, a Samoan, and as I recall there was a bunch of eye nation players joining '88 -90. I don't think anyone asked the credibility of the team to adopt Maori (or other cultural) traditions: if there was one thing that was obvious about these guys, it was that they went on the trip. <br /> <br /> And as for the team's strength over the best college age in the world: yes, it is true that the United States Rugby on average is not taken as a whole, does not represent particularly good at the best elsewhere. There are exceptions, but hey - it's a simple fact that Rugby doesn't have the prominent or exposure needed to develop the many traditions of excellence in the United States that arise in other countries. <br /> <br /> That being said, Highland judges its benefits: <br /> <br /> - * * * * Every year the United States Rugby National Championships qualify for the 25-year history of the organizations. <br /> <br /> - A victory record of 392 wins, 9 losses. Read it again ... winning trainer in any American sport in history. <br /> <br /> - regular international tours. <br /> <br /> - some convincing wins against some legitimate international teams. <br /> <br /> Are they the world's best? Maybe some years, probably not most ... but they are pretty good on a consistent basis. And it is disrespectful for the game to blow them off when the Highland Rugby can be the best ambassador to the sport in the United States.
