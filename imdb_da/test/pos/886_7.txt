Having seen an example of this movie at my local mall where there is the opportunity to buy foreign films, I thought it was very entertaining. Before I looked at the movie, I went on to IMDb to see what reviews and comments it received. I was worried when I noticed the low numbers and the negative reviews. Despite hype, I watched movies and to my surprise I found it incredible. <br /> <br /> The story was good (just pay attention), and the characters and their relationship in the movie is amazing. I have not seen such a good combination of leading characters for a long time. I really felt for both characters and felt a strong band. Like reading previous posts about this movie is not "epic" enough or lack of martial arts I could not disagree more with. This movie is what it is, it's not Braveheart and it's not Enter the Dragon, but it's still a wonderful movie that does an excellent job combining the history of both action and action. While Sword In The Moon is not perfect (which movie is?) It is still wonderful and moving. Just wait until the end stage, with music and movies together, its breathtaking. I just hope more people can watch this movie to give it a fair vote.
