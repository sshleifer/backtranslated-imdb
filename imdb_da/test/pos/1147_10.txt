Marine's depiction in this movie is spot on. The action scenes are some of the best ever produced in the accuracy of the content. The uniforms and weapons of both the American and German troops were perfect. Berber's costumes and weapons were also quite accurate. This movie could easily be used to teach military during the period and has been used by the USMC Academy for this purpose. The scenes depicting Roosevelt shooting and the rifles he used were beautiful. Obtaining so many period weapons in such good shape is testament to the attention to detail and presentation this film should be noted for. Millius is a genius.
