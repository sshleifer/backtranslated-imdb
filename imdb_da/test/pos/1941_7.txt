I think it's a pretty good movie, but one thing makes it very interesting to me. It is obviously obvious when you look at it: The main characters of this movie are the inspiration for the bullies at The Simpsons. Layne is Jimbo, John is Kearney, and Tony is Dolph. There is even an episode of The Simpsons where Jimbo uses the line "I sprayed her with a stick." <br /> <br /> The Jimbo-Layne connection is the most obvious with the knitted hat and long hair and voice. Kearney has the shaved head, unlike John, but is the big, stupid. The Tony-Dolph connection is quite obvious with the long, cut haircut and even the second class status.
