I feel lost, so brilliant is this movie. Kieslowski is a writer, a philosopher; and while he is an outstanding filmmaker, his greatness lies in his writing; and "Red" is his paradigm. This film is a metafictional study of the artist's discernment in the creation of his fictional world; about how an artist can try to restore life - even his own - through his art, although he cannot escape the knowledge that, no matter how he engages in his story, it is still fiction and he is still out of his recreation The world, still burdened with its unreality and the reality of the life he has been trying to recreate artistically. And, on the whole, all this is not at least at the expense of a wonderful story of the mysteries of love and destiny and the characters that give this story, this pre-destined fate. If I had to choose, I could nominate the greatest movie ever made.
