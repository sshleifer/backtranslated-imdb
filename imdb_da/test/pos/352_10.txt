As others wrote, I'm a deadly hardcore fan and I loved this game. <br /> <br /> This game starts a bit boring, but believe me it's worth it. As soon as you start, your hooked! The levels are fun and exciting. They will hook you up until your mind changes to mush. I'm not making fun. This game is also orchestrated and beautifully done. <br /> <br /> To keep this spoiler free I have to keep my mouth shut about the details. But please try this game! It will be worth it! <br /> <br /> History: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (It's so good!) Hardness: 10 NOTE Grabber: 10 Average: 10
