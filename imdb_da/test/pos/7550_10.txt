Unfortunately, many fantastic movies on IMDb, like this one, have their score "adjusted" by IMDb. This is really a great and exciting movie by the finished director of Bonnie and Clyde, Little Big Man, Night Moves, Mickey One and The Chase. <br /> <br /> If you click on the User Rating area, see that the actual median for four friends is 7.6. However, IMDb has "adjusted" (dumb down?) The rating for 6.4. <br /> <br /> Per IMDb: "IMDb publishes weighted voting values ​​over raw data averages. Different filters are used on the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts to" voice stuffing "of individuals who are more interested in To change the current rating of a movie than to give their true meaning to it .... The exact methods we use will not be published. This must ensure that the policy remains effective. " In other words, we will not disclose our methods so you cannot question how we arrived at the score! What a shame to see fine thought-provoking movies like Four Friends fare no better than lame formal comedies because of IMDb's "filters".
