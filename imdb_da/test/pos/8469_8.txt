It was a day in 1891 when Scottish inventor William K.L. Dickson surprised his boss, Thomas Alva Edison, with his remarkable work in film development. After many experiments, Dickson could now record real-life scenes with his camera and reproduce them through his invention, the kinetoscope, as if a period was preserved in celluloid. Soon, Dickson's Kinetoscope will be a huge success as a new form of entertainment where many people are eager to pay the nickel charged to watch people dance or acrobats perform stunts through the "peepshow" of the kinetoscope. The invention, however, was not complete, in order for it to capture the real life that we know it, films were needed. Then Dickson kept experimenting, and this short experiment, Kinetophone's first movie, was the result. <br /> <br /> In this experiment, the code name is simply "Dickson Experimental Sound Film", director William K.L. Dickson is standing in front of a shooting cone for a wax cylinder (earliest method of sound recording), with his violin on his hands, playing a song called "Cabin Boy's Song". The idea was to record the song in the cylinder while the camera recorded its movements. To show that this was a movie, two of Edison's "Black Maria" lab decided to do some dancing in front of the camera. Contrary to what the author Vito Russo claimed in his book, The Celluloid Closet, this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality, as it is, of course, a reference to the environment of loneliness in the lab, like the lonely sailors like the "song" of the Cabin Boy "was dedicated to (the title Russo suggests," The Gay Brothers "is actually anachronistic as" gay "had no gay connotation in the late 1890s.) Unfortunately, Dickson was unable to achieve the desired effect and Kinetophone could never really produce the synchronized sound with pictures. While having the barrel with the sound and celluloid with the pictures, the synchronization of the two elements was not exactly effective, and the sudden appearance of Auguste and Louis Lumière's Cinématographe asked Edison's team to Focus on projection systems and finally Dickson left the company. Fortunately, Dickson's cylinder with movie sound was rebuilt in 1998 and film editors Walter Murch did a restoration of the experiment as intended. Finally, "Dickson Experimental Sound Film" could be heard with synchronized sound, just as the creative inventor had thought. Although not a successful experiment, this excellent film is a testament to the vast genius of the kinetoscope's father. 8.10
