A few weeks after I watched this movie it began to remind me of John Carpenter's Mouth of Madness (not for the story!) For the atmosphere, the fast-paced elements of surprise and the dreamy sequences. On the other hand, this movie mixes very well the picture and the music (note the fourth chapter of the movie)
