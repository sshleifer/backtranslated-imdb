When I was in 10th grade, my companion and I were late in the house and flew around the cable and began to watch this movie. We saw it because it looked a little fun and because it had breasts. But then the end came and we were just speechless. I think after a moment to look at the credits, he just kind of hostile "Oh buddy ....." It goes from stupid 80's teenage comedy to nihilistic realism so fast that it makes you vigilant. I've been trying to rent this movie for years and haven't been able to find it - and no one has ever seen it except for me and my friend - so it works. But now it's available! I strongly suggest renting it and brace yourself.
