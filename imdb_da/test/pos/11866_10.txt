A very funny movie. Michael Douglas' "does" is worth seeing this flick for if for no other reason. I want to see him do more of these low life roles. He was fantastic, as were all the executives. <br /> <br /> The movie struck me like an American Roshomon, just fun and easier to see because it was in American and didn't need any stinky subtitles! <In a fun movie with a laugh every minute or so, two of the best at John Goodman (not one I'm crazy). - He tells the pastor about Jewel to do something he liked and says, "I had to dry the smile out of my face." The visual shows that he doesn't smile and clearly is a guy who never smiles, but surely doesn't know it. 2. The scene at the end between Goodman, who all fit Jewel in his policeman and hit with the acclaimed traveler hunched over a table ... and the two then protest that they are not homosexual for another character happening on stage - this alone deserved a special Comedy Academy Award.
