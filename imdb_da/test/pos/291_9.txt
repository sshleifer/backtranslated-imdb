This is a classic war movie. One of the best, a sharp picture party of flashing lights, harsh dark backgrounds and helicopter blades morphing into ceiling fans. Martin Sheen is a mercenary who sent up to the river to murder the general gone away, a sadistic dictator played convinced by the great Marlon Brando. Also for the trip is Robert Duvall as an over the top DI with a penchant for "napalm in the morning" or at least the smell of it. Dennis Hopper is an edgy photojournalist overlooking the war and about his leader. Also in this amazing movie you will watch and forthcoming stars like Laurence Fishburne, R. Lee Ermey, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall and watch Harrison Ford also ... the lens is Francis Ford Coppolla, which delivers a movie with perhaps more intensity and drama than the recognized Godfather movie. He highlights war in the most basic form, which is mostly something you cannot see; you can only feel that boat continues up the river feeling the war tightening is totally unbearable. The feeling of this is a rather claustrophobic feeling and really creates unusual moods from the viewers. Honestly no movie has ever made me feel it. <br /> <br /> Criticism is hard to find. The biggest nausea from some is that Brando earned tons of money for a ten minute role, but in all fairness this is unjustified. It was money deserved, a role that physically restricted him when he was an unwell man, and a role he really made his own. I can't see anyone better for the role. And if you get the Apocalypse Now Redux version, there are some extra bits of the big man, and I think Redux makes the movie environment better. <br /> <br /> Final impressions are that if you are lucky enough to get the Redux version you will be blessed with a completely satisfying movie with a cool 49 minute extra recording. If not, you will still not be disappointed. This movie is up there with the best, and deserves a great recognition and a solid place as one of the 50 best movies ever made ...
