I saw Beyond Rangoon about 20 times, it was so good. Only when I saw it did I see the story of Laura Bowman, but later after several exhibitions I realized that this was also a parallel documentary. It happened in my mind, a story of Aung San Suu Kyi, and women's struggle to remain strong in the face of uncertainty, danger and sadness. I would also add history and politics to the list after further viewing as I learned a lot about Burma's past and present and could only guess the future. This movie is not just one you want to see, it is also one you will definitely want to own a copy of. It is a movie that could easily be seen by the whole family, but not for children under thirteen. However, the educational benefits of this movie cannot and should not be discreet.
