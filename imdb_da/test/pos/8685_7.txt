Algernon4's comment that Mrs Paget's "ultra-modern dance in (this movie) is the most erotic in the history of the film" is certainly a lavish exaggeration. It's not even Debra Paget's most erotic dance. Her near naked gyrations in Fritz Lang's "The Indian Tomb" make this number seem to be pretty tame. To be the most erotic in the history of dance. Well! Where do I start? Salma Hayek's performance as Santanico Pandemonium in "From Dusk to Dawn" (1996); Jamie Lee Curtis in "True Lies" (1994); Jessica Alba in "Sin City" (2005); Rose McGowan in "Terror Planet" (2007); Sheila Kelley in "Dancing at the Blue Iguana" (2000), blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me wrong. I love the sequence and have included it in my "Cheesecake Dance" series on Youtube. I just think that making a claim as "most erotic in the history of the movie" really involves a very fragile limb.
