Really a great movie ... I stumbled on it in the video store and rented it because Aaron Eckhart (in the company of men and your friends and neighbors) was in it as well as Paulina Porizcova ... The lovely former SI swimsuit model gets naked in the movie, but it's just one of the many reasons to rent it ... It's very exciting and character development is great ... Eckhart is one of the most underrated actors and he steals this movie .. It is very dark and violent, but I enjoyed immensely.
