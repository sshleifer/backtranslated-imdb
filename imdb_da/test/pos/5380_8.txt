Any major once in a while you stumble upon a movie that exceeds even your wildest expectations. Considering the IMDb value of 4.0, I didn't really expect much with Satan's Brotherhood. I hoped it might be fun at least as The Devil's Rain or any of the other early 70's, like satanic horror movies. I couldn't have been more wrong. What I got instead was an ambitious and intelligent movie with a throw I really enjoyed. Speaking extensively to avoid giving away anything, the film's style and structure is much more experimental than the straightforward narrative so prominent in the early 70s. Satan's Brotherhood doesn't strike you over with plot points and explanations. There is much left for the viewer to fill in the topics. As a seer you know that something is wrong, but in the longest time you are just not sure what it is. The unknown helps create a long creepier atmosphere than most similar movies. The finish is effective with its surreal image. I sat in astonishing as the final credits began to roll. Those who want a big slam-bang finale will be disappointed with the simplicity of the end. A smaller movie would have tried to pull up all the stops and would probably be unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the movie where it is easy to forget the director, Bernard McEveety, had primarily worked in television before Satan's brotherhood. There are a couple of scenes that are so well created, illuminated and shot that even the most accomplished directors could learn something or two. For example, I have seen enough movies over the years to realize that in some cases directors may have trouble recording widescreen shots indoors. Not here. The scene where the men discuss their action plan at the sheriff's office is amazing. We see all five men at once ?? each does their own thing as in real life. In a smaller movie, we may see all the men at once, but each is motionless and waits quietly to deliver their dialogue. It is a small scene, but it looks so natural and is so beautifully shot that it is one of my favorite moments of Satan's Brotherhood. Finally, I mentioned the action in my opening, so without going into a long-term speech, I just want to say that Satan's Brotherhood has Stroter Martin and LQ Jones. Any movie with these two guys is almost an automatic winner with me.
