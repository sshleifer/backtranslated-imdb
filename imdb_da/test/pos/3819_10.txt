I first started to see the outer borders back in 95 when I was 10, and it just blew every week with each episode, each episode had a twist and every week I couldn't wait for the next. How the authors managed to do each episode as well and do it differently every time during 7 seasons is beyond me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, alien and human encounters, and an insight into more of the paranormal and how it affects the people. What really makes this a good show is the characters in each episode, they really show emotions and are really good actors. What you also want to see every week is an actor / actress you want to know from a previous show that is pretty neat in its own way. <br /> <br /> If you want to relax and sit back with a good Sci-Fi show, then the outer limits are for you
