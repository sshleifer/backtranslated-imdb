What makes this low budget production one of my favorite movies? Not fun, I saw it already 10 times or so and didn't get tired. Is it the tender melancholy of the whole thing? Is it similar to classics like "Niagara"? I thought about it for a long time. And figured it out: I think it is: there is no hero who is only human. Some are trying to be good. Some quit trying to be good. Some are hopeless cases, but still carry the spunk to be human inside. It is the story of a disastrous night in a motel at the end of the world. In a way, the disaster is nothing but the end of a chain of coincidence. On the other hand, this night reveals the logical consequences of the lives of these people because they are in a particular constellation cut off the rest of the world. It has something of a Dostovsky story.
