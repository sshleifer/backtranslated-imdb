It may actually be the finest movie in 1999. No, I'm not talking. This documentary directed by Chris Smith captures the very spirit of artistic coercion. Smith does the clever thing every documentary filmmaker has to do: he keeps invisible and refuses to judge his subject. <br /> <br /> As the viewer sees Mark and his efforts, no matter how fun aggressive they can prove to end their films. He refuses to compromise and suffers repeatedly as a result. But because we forget, remember Speilberg, Scorsese and others started just as humbly. And what a great topic he chooses. Mark, his family and friends are all fascinating characters, far more than any character created in last year's fictional film products. This film oscillates on the dime between comedy, tragedy, touch with sympathy, and leads us to inspire every viewer with a desire to create, despite talent problems, getting out of their mouths and doing something. <br /> <br /> The film is about maverick artists and their passions. It's also about families, no matter how dependent and disfunctional they can be, and how unique and beautiful the organism is. Mark proves in the film to be completely devoted not only to his dreams, but also to his family - and to him. <br /> <br /> Why this movie was not nominated for this year's documentary, is beyond me and criminal (it is believed to be justified last year). This movie must be searched and appreciated.
