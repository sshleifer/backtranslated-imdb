I was surprised I liked this movie. But it reminded me of a 2004 version of the first Friday the 13th. There were a number of cheesy items, but at the same time there were many cool ones. The story was good - predictable if you saw more than one or two horror movies, but full of one-liners to make it worthwhile. There are some memorable scenes worth seeing. A few questions I had with the plot had to do with the sign's continuity. For example, in the opening scene, the scarecrows (which were people on stakes whose blood was drained to grow the crops) looked so real, but later in the film they looked more like false scarecrows wearing blue-colored masks. There were more gaps in the plot, and the play was mediocre, but at least it sounded like real people are talking in contrast to Hollywood movies, where the dialogue is really fake when you think about it. The culmination of the last scene when the protagonist says "I'm not a Baker, I'm a Connell!" and lops head of scarecrows is satisfactory, as his friends have mostly been killed by these creatures at that time.
