If Family Guy offends you or you simply don't get humor, unfortunately this show makes fun of you and the masses of all religious, boring and politically correct people in America. So set aside your morale and have fun with this show. FG is a fun opener for reality in today's society. Anyone who said this show is for a young immature audience is very wrong. With all the references to old movies and politics 10-80 years ago, I couldn't imagine any young ignorant child who found it fun. Family Guy is definitely a mature open audience who is not afraid to criticize American society. Hats off to Seth and the entire crew that could make this show happen.
