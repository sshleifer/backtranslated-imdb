Take every part of the movie that was "contemporary" day away and stick to flashbacks. Then you would have had a great story. Faith and Ulv's history and their relationship was the best part. Diaz and Eccleston were wonderful. Brewster was joking to sit through. Surprised to see Blythe Danner as a mother. She was great. Also look for Patrick Bergen as father, always as he (Sleeping with the enemy). This is a very hippy, saved world, kind of movie. You don't care much about that, but I recommend seeing it for Diaz's performance alone. She has excellent selection and needs more. Eccleston is as always convincing. He is wonderful!
