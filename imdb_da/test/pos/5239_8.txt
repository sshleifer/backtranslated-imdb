I really liked this movie. It has John Wayne in his first starring performance. Even then, you can tell that Wayne has a true presence, though he doesn't really mature in the icon he is known for until Stagecoach, 9 years later in 1939. It's about settlers from across the country heading for the new west to colonize it. Wayne's character Breck Coleman joins, but for his own personal reasons. The main roles were capital actors and had never made a movie before, making the movie even more amazing. they managed to create credible, distinctive characters, and there is a quite oddball mix here. Cimarron would come out a year later and had a very similar story, although I didn't like it as much as this movie For me, The Big Trail is a strong 8/10.
