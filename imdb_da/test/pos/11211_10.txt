I am very grateful to the little college town of Abingdon, which is near Bristol, TN. and home to the famous Barter Theater, where Gregory Peck once acted - managed to get an art film Togather and show this movie there. Abingdon is two and one hour hours from where I live, but the trip was worth it in every sense of the word. UZAK / DISTANT is a fantastic, brilliant, crushing, emotional, captivating film. As a Turkish-American, this movie was not only a testimony to what life in Turkey is; But on a larger scale, the world tells how it is to be Turkish, whether you live in Istanbul, Berlin, Montreal, New York or Omaha. It can be two hours in length as opposed to five minutes, but it is actually our Bob Marley song. There are so many amazing scenes in this movie. It is very difficult to choose just a random couple. But for me, a story scene takes place in a cinema in Beyoglu (downtown Istanbul). The title play played by Mehmet Emin Toprak, who unfortunately died in a car accident shortly after the completion of this film, follows a very attractive young woman down a staircase to the cinema's main age. She goes into "Vanilla Sky". As Tom Cruise's picture is reflected from a glass, we find that Turkish men are competing with Tom Cruise for their own women's love, even though Tom Cruise is not in Beyoglu. The scenes shot over the Bosphorous coasts are also quite obvious as they symbolize the beauty, but desperate empty floors, which is a painful life factor in Turkey. In this movie, the gap separates lovers and families. A simple, empty package of Samsun (Turkish brand) cigarettes and a dying mouse jumps out of the screen, which seagulls made in 1982 Serif Goren-Yilmaz Guney movie "Yol." Many of Guney's films, including "Yol", "Suru-Shepherd" (1978 - completed by Zeki Octen) and "Baba-The Father" (1971) have been considered by many as the best Turkish films ever made. Without Guney's sometimes overwhelmed social-political anger (especially in his last film, the 1983 prison drama "Duvar-The Wall"), "Remove" captures the essence of Turkish life quite remarkably. This is a huge achievement for a director who, in my opinion, can already be proclaimed Turkish equivalent to directors such as Tarkovsky, Bresson and Ozu. I can't wait to see his other movie!
