This is one of the most enjoyable teen movies I've ever seen (and the one I wanted to be released for video). It was released the same year as another great comedy where Tim Matheson played a role "Animal House" (which is probably why it was overlooked). <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable parts of this movie would surely be the soundtrack that could have and should have been a formal label release. The soundtrack has a lesser-known 70-play, called High Inergy, whose song "We are the future" played a marking role in the film's Prom scene. I remember buying the group's album "Steppin 'Out" as a child especially because of the girls' appearance and not necessarily for their musical talents. <br /> <br /> The final song is one of the best ballads I've ever heard, and I can still hear it in my head. I wish I knew the group's name so I could look for it somewhere in cyberspace. <br /> <br /> If you liked movies like "Over the edge" and "Rich Kids", I think this is one you will also enjoy.
