When I write these comments, I see a DVD of this movie I just got from a mail order reseller and I find it very good with strong characterizations, trustworthy situations and well-founded action scenes. <br /> <br /> It has been a good 45 years, maybe 50, since I saw HELL under, but the only scene that made a deep impression on me was Sterling Holloway's death scene, which several other commentators have mentioned here. I haven't gotten that scene yet on this show, but I can guarantee what other comments have said: when you see Sterling Holloway's death scene in this movie, you'll never forget it. Judging by the strength of the film so far, I fully expect the scene to be reminiscent of it - as undoubtedly one of the greatest death scenes in film history. The movie is worth watching for that moment alone, but even without it, it would be a prime early submarine drama.
