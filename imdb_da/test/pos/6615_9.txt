This is one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen with "dark days". I have skated for maybe an hour all my life and I still love this movie. Peralta and his excellent editor captured the feeling and atmosphere perfectly, helping with some incredible archive films. Tony Alva is one of the coolest people there is. Love the knee-high striped sports socks, you rock Tony! <br /> <br /> Not only is this movie a visual celebration, but the soundtrack must be one of the best in history if you are in the 70's rock. Buy the DVD, you won't regret it.
