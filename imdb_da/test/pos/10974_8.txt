No bullets, no secret agents, a story that is entertaining, fun and trustworthy. Met some of the producers / actors in this movie at the theater. They seemed so interesting personally as their characters on the screen. You may not be able to hear about this movie on TV with ads with high-dollar ads, but it's definitely worth checking out. I spent $ 8 on a movie ticket on a lot of other movies that weren't this entertaining. Looking forward to future projects of this production company.
