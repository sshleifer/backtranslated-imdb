It was so long ago (1960), but I have never forgotten this series and often wanted it to be seen again. So taken with that, I replied with Mr Rathbun, then President of Standard Oil, who sponsored the presentation at PBS. He sent me a picture of the wallpaper (actually a ballot) that was used behind the credits. <br /> <br /> For the opening theme of Bayco's "Elizabethan Masque", my family and I gathered around our black and white television to drink in Shakespeare's words spoken by a group of excellent but relatively unknown players (at least to American audience at that time). We were introduced to such actors as Sean Connery, Dame Judi Dench, Tom Fleming, Patrick Garland, Julian Glover and Robert Hardy. I have still had their performance since then. One of the most interesting things was the way in which the actors continued to age in their respective roles when Shakespeare's "King" games were presented, perhaps for the first time in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell these actors how much that series meant to me. <br /> <br /> If the "Age of Kings" could be revived on VHS and / or DVD, it would be so good for us who yearn to see it again and those who missed it the first time. <br /> <br /> GOOD NEWS! PBS has just released a DVD of "a Kingdom"! SEE ALL JULY 2009 CATALOG, PAGE 19, OR CALL THEM TOL FREE. I ordered myself!
