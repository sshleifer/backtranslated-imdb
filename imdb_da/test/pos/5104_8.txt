Yes 1939 / Robert Donat-Greer The Garson version was the best ... Perfection..Donat won Oscar in a very hard year. Gift in GWTW & James Stewart as Mr. Smith. were 2 of its competitors. .wow it was a hard year .. Most critics in NY hated this version. so.didnt see in the theater! Finally, this A.M. on TCM & enjoyed. Peter O'Toole was excellent and happy that he was Oscar nominated for this one, and esp happy Oscar finally gave him a special award this year ... Petula Clark was good as Mrs. Chips but her character, I feel badly written ... some good songs esp. You and I ... sung by Ms.Clark and later recorded by many others, including T.Bennett / S. Bassey & Carmen MacRae .... the b & w version was more authentic .. but this is a good movie beautiful photographed in color and panavision ... enjoyable to see and bravo again, Mr. O'Toole!
