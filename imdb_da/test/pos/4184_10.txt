I just can't understand why people are surprised that this movie doesn't make sense. It was never meant to make sense. (Duh! The authors were totally wasted on Frodis at that time.) It was just meant to entertain and mocha, and it makes it both wonderful. The monks are good actors. They would not have been employed if they were not good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best in pure psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believe he was so stupid in real life. Don't tell me they can't act because they absolutely can. <br /> <br /> They can also write. Yes, Jack & Bob get the only credits, but in reality they got a big helping hand on the script from Monkees, who was also in the smoky room. <br /> <br /> (It is absolutely impossible to destroy this movie) The head is very symbolic. Among the more memorable elements is the black box that was actually based on 2 things: the Monkee image to which the boys were bound, and the real black box on the Screen Gems party where the band was held between. There is so much more symbolism in the movie that I just let you see it and find out. <br /> <br /> The music is amazing. "Circle Sky" is one of Papa Nez's best tunes ever, and "Porpoise Song" & "As We Go Along" want you excited. If you'd rather be scared, then "Ditty Diego", "Can you dig it?" And "Long title" be satisfying, good songs as they are. And then there is "Daddy's Song", undoubtedly a tribute to David's Broadway days, and the editing / color scheme for that sequence is amazing. (At least for '68.) <br /> <br /> Oh, for those of you who don't see a 'PG' movie, you miss. Especially since Head was originally rated R in 1968. The rating was lowered about two years later! <br /> <br /> Now where was I? Oh yes, "We talked about faith, faith and conditioning ...."
