My favorite movie all the time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola, and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more convincing. Coppola at this time was King of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to dare to try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through pure arrogance he went to Phillipines with a partial script and thought he wanted to know what he would do when he got there. Like Captain Willard, he thought he wanted to know what to do when he came to fellow Kurtz composition. And like Willard, he didn't know what to do when he got there. This is a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed, and the river is a perfect metaphor and backdrop for history. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it does not provide any answers or conclusions. Because of this openness, it makes some viewers who like their movies much more obvious. <br /> <br /> This movie challenges categorization. Some call it a war movie, which it is not at all, it really is more a personal investigation of man. The best picture about Vietnam is 'Plato' in my opinion, and if a viewer seeks a story about the Vietnam War, one must first find answers. <br /> <br /> Coppola should be commended for taking on the bureaucracy of war, which he effectively communicates with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and Playmate review. Kilgore's purity is an unforgettable character, and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic. It is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending that makes it a movie that is not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to see, but also rewarding. I could offer my explanations on each scene, but it would be completely meaningless. This film is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to instant gratification. <br /> <br /> A small footnote, definitely if your first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, see the original version first, is the 'Redux' version, I think, more intended for hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and improved 'version of the movie
