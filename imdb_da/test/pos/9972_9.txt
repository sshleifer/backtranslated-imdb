The inherent problem with any set of 'The Merchant of Venice' has never been the pseudo-controversial anti-Semitism, but the fact that there are two story lines wildly different in both tone and content; a scary romantic comedy and a hurting tragedy. While mixing genres was all the rage of the sixteenth century (and mocked by Shakespeare in Hamlet), it rarely lacks the congratulations of modern audiences. As a result, most directors are forced to emphasize a story at the expense of the other, and it is not surprising that the decision is in favor of Shylock. <br /> <br /> Like so many of Shakespeare's great tragic heroes, Shylock continues to fascinate after 400 years because he is so difficult and complex in character. Compassionate, proud, angry, revengeful, weak, arrogant; His behavior simply tolerates analysis and continues to be argued over. He is flawless, not because he is a Jew, but because he is human. Modern writers rarely cover their fate with such richly structured contradictions, and it is to everyone's advantage that we have Shakespeare to draw for inspiration. <br/> <br /> Shakespeare languages ​​are wild and wandering, saturated in several meanings, words of play and metaphor. To be understood, it must be angry and tame by an actor with strength and knowledge to do so. When an actor fails, the words are poured into a stream of incomprehensible words, but when he succeeds, the English language jumps to life with an immediate and vibrant life that breathes away. Al Pacino is such an actor and here shows an incredible clarity and checks that if there was any justice, sweeping every price in the offer. He meets the challenge of presenting the Shylock head and delivering an extraordinarily subtle and nuanced performance. It would be a crime if we never had the opportunity to see what he was doing with King Lear. <br /> <br /> The support supports are remarkable. Jeremy Irons gives an original touch to the well-known Antonio, presenting an older, quieter figure, showing the eerie contradictions between medieval riding and ugly prejudices of time. Joseph Fiennes is a revelation as he matures beyond the superficial eye-to actually have a character for once. Lynn Collins is the only disappointment. Many of Shakespeare's women are underwritten and demand that an actor really work hard to bring them to life, and Collins' Gwyneth Paltrow imitation seems a little flat and unsuitable for the darker tone Radford seeks. <br /> <br /> The design team must be recognized to create a unique and thoroughly credible view of the late Renaissance Venice. The city has not seen this scary since 'Don't look now'. With full utilization of outstretched places and natural light, the film has a authenticity of appearance that is greatly enhanced by the dark and timeworn costume design. Everyone is again worthy of recognition. <br /> <br /> The financial beneficiaries of film like this must be praised. With a budget of $ 30 million, they need to enter such a venture in full and secure knowledge that they will never make money and yet invest anyway. We can all be grateful for that, as the result is a remarkable adaptation that will surely be a benchmark for many years to come.
