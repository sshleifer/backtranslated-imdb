The ASCENT is a very worthy addition to the recent re-releases of the Soviet Union. Director Larisa Shepitko's 1977 film explores the moral ramifications of fidelity and honor in German occupied Russia during World War II. On foot and in snowstorm, two members of a partisan Soviet group leave to find supplies and are trapped by Nazi soldiers. The film's focus is on how each person handles or internalises his moral alternatives. One chooses dignity and integrity while the other chooses to work with the enemy. But in the end, he cannot comply with his selfish decision. The film uses a lot of slow, wide-angle pans that switch to extreme close-ups, highlighting the spiritual dilemma of each person's souls. This is not a good movie, but it effectively shows an intense moral dilemma against a hard and frigid Soviet desert.
