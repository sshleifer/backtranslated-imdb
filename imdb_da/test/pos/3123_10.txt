I don't think I really have any spoilers in here, but when I describe a few fun scenes, I check the box that says "may contain spoilers" just to be on the safe side. Now ... <br /> <br /> I hardly know where to start. At the moment, you know the baseline of history - horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) are taking the lead in driving a Mormon carriage West to their "Promised Land" and encounters a variety of trials and interesting characters along the way. Claw family. <br /> <br /> Everyone can enjoy this movie. You don't have to be a fan of Western to like this. First, Johnson and Carey are two of the fastest characters you'll see in any movie. Carey is especially animated and outgoing, almost like a big kid - while Johnson is a bit calmer and wiser, like an elderly figure. I get a kick out of the stage where they sell the sheriff one of their 'gentle horses' to ten crowns; then inform him that the horse has "some special things - you can say wrong" ... Travis elbows Sandy, who lets loose with a scream, sends the sheriff's new horse on a wild bucking pass with him in the saddle. The look of his face when the horse finally dumps him and the gallops away is invaluable. Pay attention to the music ... even if you never thought you would be a fan of the sons of the pioneers, listen to "Shadows in the Dust" as the lorry is moving in motion with some of the people walking between the wagons. It's a really beautiful song - too bad only half a minute or so in the movie. I'd like to hear it all sometime. <br /> <br /> One thing that impressed me a lot about this movie is that much of it must have been almost as difficult to make as the real situation it portrays. Teams of six horses pull wagons up steep mountain paths that stretch to make the top - it was not a simple and light film. It must have been risky for the actors, the stunt people and the animals too. Fording Rivers too, this movie has lots of authentic-looking action involving the motion of the carriage train. It should be mentioned that both Harry Carey Jr. and Ben Johnson were extremely competent riders, both with many years of experience in riding, yelling and making all kinds of cowboy-type stuff. Carey grew up in a ranch where his family employed many Navaho Indians and he actually learned to speak Navaho before learning to speak English. No rhinestone cowboys in this movie - "Travis" and "Sandy" were the right thing through and through. <br /> <br /> Look for the scene when Miss Denver throws out her forehead with water from her cart and hits Travis's horse in the face ... the horse begins to succumb and eventually throws it away. See the look of Sandy's face when Denver tells Travis, "I'm sorry you fell off your horse." Another favorite scene of mine is when Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy) enters a tiff with one of the Mormons. They work back to get their gear ready, and after Sandy gets disgusted by the other guy, the two come into a rear bump fight, which quickly turns into a rolling-around-ground fist fight. Even after the eldest (Ward Bond) stands them up and separates them, the two warriors continue to try to get to each other. The Mormon (called 'Jackson' in the movie) gets a final kick in Sandy so high it hits his shoulder. It's a really fun scene from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I don't know what I can say more about this movie than it has a good story, very exciting characters, beautiful scenery and lots of action balanced with humor and some drama. Oh, it's been colored, at least in the version I saw; not the most beautiful color film you will ever see, but I think I prefer black and white. I give this one a ten and I don't give many 10's out. One of my favorite movies without a doubt. And judging by the other comments, I have plenty of company in that assessment.
