In school, I was taught how some shots were called, and there were constantly mentioned two directors: Orson Welles and Sergei M. Eisenstein. I didn't care about it then (I was a kid!) But now I know why Eisenstein is a genius, and it's a shame to see what was possible in 1938, when we almost half a century are stuck with countless blank movies ! Some say this movie is not Eisenstein's genius (then they have to see it again and again until they can say something bad) or even worse, it is just a propaganda movie for the Russians. Let's say it is, it's actually pure propaganda for patriotism, but isn't it "save private Ryan" or "longest day" then? I could sum up so many movies in where America is up to the top, so why not Russia, and besides any war fought for itrs patriotism, why else would they raise flags? Aleksandr Nevsky is a must for anyone who cares about filmography, as almost every shot is a sublime picture. Perhaps it is all monitored, but I wonder why this is not included in the IMDB's Top 250, where there are so many overrated Oscar scrapes.
