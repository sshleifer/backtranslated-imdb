I find it sad that just because Edward Norton wouldn't be in the movie or have anything to do with it, people automatically think the movie sucks without seeing it or giving it a try. I really hope Norton didn't do this. He is a fine actor and anything but he scared people away from a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I found it entertaining. It didn't mind blowing or something with crazy special effects, but it wasn't bad. It was fun to see. But yes, definitely not a bad / horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
