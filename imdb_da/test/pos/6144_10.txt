I watched this movie for one night, I could not sleep, I loved it and tried to find out when it would be again, probably the best movie I have ever seen at that time, and even now the cast is full of people I had never seen before, but it seems to be a real life story based on NYC. This is the kind of movie that elevates the viewing experience because you see it, hear it and feel it from the moment I saw Wirey drinking a beer and watching the game I imagined how it should be to grow up without a father so many lines from this movie, I use daily as "the personal alone time" in the bathroom that drinks a 7-11 drink, GREAT MOVIE
