Having seen Undisputed 2, I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine. The Lord: Border Patrol is a decent flick (not Van Damme's best, but certainly not his worst.) There are some bad acts from the CEO's support cast, but it makes sense. <br /> <br /> The story and plot have all been done before, so it's not new. I mean it's Van Damme. We do not expect much of a fantastic plot, do we? Then we can talk about what we all want to look at this movie at least: the fighting. <br /> <br /> Without giving anything away, I thought how the fighting was shot and shot, was well finished, far better than a few of the CEO's latest films as Second in Command, where the entire end-game is HORRIBLE. With Florentine behind the camera, and if you've seen Undisputed 2, he knows how to photograph and enjoy it. A couple of the games in The Shepherd reminded me of the CEO's older things that we all want to see. The battles were good and I said "hah, awesome" a couple of times. But I was hoping for just a little more considering how well I thought undisputed 2 was. Something I found exciting was the CEO's daughter in the movie, I thought "wow she's a little warm" came to find out, Bianca Van Varenberg, JC's real daughter. I have never seen her before, so it was a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie isn't half bad. Yes the story has been done before, but at least JC tried to make a good movie. Next time, however, add more hand to hand combat! I think he still has what it takes to make another big budget movie ... his acting has improved since he made DTVs and he is really in good shape at 47. I don't know about you But I am one of those who believe that most of his DTVs are actually good except Derailed. All he has to do is get back to "bloodsport" form and make a martial arts movie ... and I think people will respond well even though he's not jet Li. This movie is definitely worth renting. =)
