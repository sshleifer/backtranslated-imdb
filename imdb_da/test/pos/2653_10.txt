There really is no way to compare this movie to another movie because no one has ever done anything like this and no one ever wants to. And it should really be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At least it deserves to be seen with a good sound system. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science fiction and wanted to watch a "room" movie. Remember that this movie was made before the first moon landing. <br /> <br /> There we were waiting for it to begin. But surprise! There was no cartoon, no upcoming attractions. The theater owner of the Cooper Theater chose to play "The Star-Spangled Banner" with the lights still up for some reason, so we all stood there, never did it in a movie sooner or later and then sat down when it ended. Then the theater went completely DARK, and the strange overture began with the blank screen hardly visible. The overture ended and my seat began to VIBRATE when the blue screen of the MGM lion appeared alongside the first deep bass notes, and then my senses were overwhelmed and also heard "Sprach Zarathustra" for the first time in my life. The tour had just begun. <br /> <br /> (I strongly recommend that you see this opening, this movie in a DARK room with your subwoofer turned as high as possible to get the effect I felt in the theater.) A while before we got to outer space, and the movie that followed was anything but a science-fiction movie. INTERMISSION came (a good thing, very undervalued and unused these days), and we looked at each other in wonder, caught our breath, and then the trip resumed, wilder than before. <br /> <br /> I saw it 7 more times in the next year, always in a really full size theater, just like all theaters were before multiplexer. I could have been "tall" once, but I didn't go to see it again and again because I was "tripping". I went because I knew I saw a work of art. It was so dusty; the sound you could feel in your bones followed by scary silence; the sights unforeseen and unthinkable; Greetings for HAL turn to terror. And of course, WTF Kubrick was really trying to get over to me? Year and year and many more views later, I understand that too, I think, as I ever want. Read other people's comments if you are looking for someone to explain it to you or search the internet, you will find "explanations", it is not my intention to write these comments. <br /> <br /> What I hope to do is encourage you to watch it patiently, enjoy it's beauty that you will enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know of (f. eg Gayne Ballet Suite or Blue Danube); Enjoy it as if you wanted a wonderful meal, sipping it like a good wine; Look and listen for the tracks and the hidden symbols that are there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick Wanted to share some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where you were. a man came from and where you are going. <br /> <br /> If it's too much work for your brain and you can't see and hear and consider the beauty and mystery of Kubrick's movie, then excuse my bleakness but your life is just as meaningful as that tapir or a premonolith monkey. If you want mindless escape, it's not for you. <br /> <br /> But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries and sensuality and can have an open mind, this movie will add something to your life.
