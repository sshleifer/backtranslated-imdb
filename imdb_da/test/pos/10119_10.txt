Cuba Gooding Jr. is back on top! Jesus did a good job in this movie! I LOVED this movie. Its one of them feels good movies that make you run out and volunteer on a mission or something. Anyway, I would recommend watching this movie in the heart! Well worth the price of admission. And for Cuba Gooding Jr. just give him his next Oscar right now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
