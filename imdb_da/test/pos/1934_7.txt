One of the last films, DIRECTED by Lionel Barrymore, "Ten Cents a Dance", is Barbara Stanwyck as a dance hall girl "Barbara" in her sixth role. Stanwyck looks quite "plain-jane" in this one and opens with her and gets chewed out of the dance hall manager. Then comes the rich guy Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez) who wants to sweep her off her feet. (Cortez and Stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s.) Then she meets Eddie, who is very different from the dotted Carlton. The author, Jo Swerling, had worked on some biggies (Its a wonderful life, boys and dolls and the wind), so I was surprised that the characters and script in it were so common. The story begins to become more interesting about halfway through, and is very similar to "The Bride Walks Out" from 1936, also starring Stanwyck .... T.B.W.O. is much more clever, but also more tame, due to the slave of the Hays code ...
