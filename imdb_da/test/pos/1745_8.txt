While Disney has been the animation study for the past 70 years, there has always been rivals for their supremacy. When this review was written in 2009, companies such as Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman were found with animated films that could be said to challenge Disney dominance. Back in the beginning, in the late '30s and early' 40s flourishing as Disney served cinematic banquets such as Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the competition was provided by the brothers Dave and Max Fleischer. Despite the fact that they released two very commendable films, they never quite hit the corner of the market ?? many attribute their downfall to the commercial error in Mr. Bug Goes To Town, released the same week as the attack on Pearl Harbor (which gave the American public something more important to think about than going to the cinema to watch a cartoon!) That this movie is faded in relative haze is a travesty. <br /> <br /> In a spot of overgrown gardens in the city, a lot of bugs are in danger. People use the land as a shortcut, discarding litter and cigars and other dangers right on the back of the bug when they go. Honey-shop owner Mr Bumble (pronounced by Jack Mercer) fears that the future is bleak and wondering how he will ever be able to raise his daughter Honey (voiced by Pauline Loth) in safer surroundings. A highly conscientious creature, Bagley C. Beetle (pronounced by Tedd Pierce), offers to give her a safer place to live if she wants to accept her hand in marriage, but honey is much more interested in her childhood sweetheart, the perennially cheerful and optimistic Hoppity (pronounced by Stan Freed). Hoppity thinks everything is being solved for the better, but is left to look foolish when Bagley Beetle and his pair of comic sidekicks manipulate the crisis to their own end. Only at the end, when their patch becomes the foundation of a great new skyscraper, the errors shift loyalty back to Hoppity as they look to him to bring them a new safe home away from man's devastating influence. <Br /> <br /> What really works in this movie is the lovely characterization ?? All bugs are cleverly designed and designed for maximum audience appeal. Bumbling Villains Floating Flying and Smuggling Mosquitoes (funny names if you stop thinking about it) are particularly memorable. Just admirable is the storytelling drive ?? Even the youngest of children can enjoy this story, while skillfully spreading a message to older audiences about how human carelessness can affect wildlife survival. Time has inevitably dated some aspects of the movie, and when you see it, the audience must accept (and forgive) these occasional signs of age and wear. But on the whole, Mr. Bug Goes To Town An accomplished, fun and very beautifully presented animation with a worthy message to start.
