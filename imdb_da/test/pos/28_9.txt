An amazing cinema experience. I really enjoyed watching this truly magnificent movie in the theater when it came out. There is nothing to add, except it is a terrible shame that Mr Albert Finney is still not accepted by AMPAS (American Academy). After roles in movies like Tom Jones, Murder of Orient Express, Under the Volcano (to name but a few - for these he was nominated for Oscar), the Dresser is surely his highlight, yet ... <br /> <I know , Oscars is just popularity competition, but if Americans like British actors and actors ("and Oscar go to" Jeremy Irons, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Glenda Jackson, etc. deserved the prize!) Why they always left Mr. Finney with empty hands? On the other hand, they gave it to John Wayne and Marisa Tomei (in cousin Vinny). I do not know, should I laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the two leads in The Dresser, you will not forget what the art of acting is. Watch this movie and enjoy it! I recommend it to anyone who loves art. I give 9/10 to this excellent movie (1 point is missing for non-biographical material, after all it's just "a theater") <br /> <br /> Note: My criteria are much stronger than this on IMDb (only 10 for the cinematic masterpiece that should / could last forever).
