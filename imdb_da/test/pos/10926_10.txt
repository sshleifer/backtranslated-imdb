I've seen many short films in my day. Often I find them either too compressed (throwing too much information for the viewer in the short time they have to run), also "artsy" or lacking a clear vision. I can't say any of these things about Starcrossed. In this review I will do my best to avoid dramatic spoilers, but I also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this movie is fraternal incest. As with any short film, the story is pretty simple, straightforward and easy to digest. It is clear that the film is trying to shine a light on one of the most profoundly modern taboos of modern society. This movie succeeds in every respect. In the fifteen minutes of running, I found myself feeling emotional. With only a small dialogue, the viewer is quickly drawn into the most personal moments and thoughts of these star-crossed brethren. From the opening scene in their early childhood one can see the very close relationship the brothers have. As the film progresses to today's next scene, the outstanding actors and honest, profound ideas remind the viewer that love can come in the most unexpected and hard way. As the relationship progresses, any disgust that the viewer initially feels can be quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress as the viewer suddenly realizes that there can be only one possible solution. And the successor to this decision is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Anyone with an open mind would do well to watch this movie and record their message. If nothing else, it boldly and honestly challenges the viewer to rethink some of our deepest beliefs on the shameful and secret taboo of incest. Although the film is only fifteen minutes long, it permeates the viewer long after the credits. This is perhaps my favorite short movie I've ever seen. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
