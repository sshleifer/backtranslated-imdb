Italian soft X Exorcist clone. <br /> <br /> Woman buys statue of crucified thief. The said thief comes alive and turns out to be the devil with rape fantasies. Ivan Rassimov plays the devil brilliantly. Mostly because of his evil appearance. And because he was never doing nudity. Good on him. <br /> <br /> The lead actress did a decent job. Her wide-eyed innocence and the fact that she looked so naked helped. <br /> <br /> This has a similar plotel element to most Italian horror movies. The girl's parents are dirty rich and depraved. See it for details. <br /> <br /> Laura Gemser's husband, Gabriel Tinti, also appears as a random stud. His part is largely inviting, but as a cheap beer it did the job. <br /> <br /> Error the director for his mistakes. This could have been a horror / sex classic.
