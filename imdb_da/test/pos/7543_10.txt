There are other films about boarding schools and antics of students and staff, but "The Belles of St. Trinian's" towers over all of them! The reason is thoroughly summed up by other posters, so I do not cover the same base. I just want to say it's a shame that it's finally out on DVD, but in a format that can't be used in the US! :-( <br /> <br /> Enjoy, colleagues in New Zealand and Australia! And if anyone reads this has something to draw on such issues, you can help get it published on DVD with Region 1 encoding! is also possible to be notified via e-mail when (I will not say "if") it is released on DVD in the United States? Thanks!
