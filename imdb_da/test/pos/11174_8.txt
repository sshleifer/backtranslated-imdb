Lucasarts has pulled another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of good games. If further proof is required that they control this genre of games, then it is. Before actually being played, there was some concern about how the authors should keep pace with the gags after the first two games. Fear was abundant that it should be a little thin. <br /> <br /> Play the game and see how quickly these fears are overlaid. From the initial video with Guybrush in the dodgem boat (!), To final stages of the funfair, the jokes continue to come. I was a big fan of the first two games and the other Lucasarts works (Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max, etc.), and failing to deliver the quality. You will not be disappointed. (Well, I wasn't.)
