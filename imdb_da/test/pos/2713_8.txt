The voices are the best aspect of this television movie, although it has better average production values, but much surface and slightly modified biography. Richard's discovery of "We have just begun" and Karen's marriage problems admirably ("Superstar" montage was a good touch), but nevertheless leaves the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, Tony Peluso's guitar solos contribution, etc. Gibb is cute Karen persona, but it does not include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the true Carpenter's personality. Anderson is in good shape as the creative and take-charge Richard, and Fletcher makes her mark as the loving but indulgent Agnes. The most exciting moment of the original is the use of "Goodbye to Love" in the background of a commercial exhibition of an anorexia hotline.
