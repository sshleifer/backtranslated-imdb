It was enough to look at this television movie that got me interested in the debate about whether "Anna" really was Tsar Nikola's daughter Anastasia. Since I have seen it, I have made a point of seeing different documentaries and also bought a book. Despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released, I sometimes still think she was. Such is the power of Amy Irving's performance in this 2-party, which is somewhat liberal with the historical facts, but wrapped in the brim with tearing drama and Irving's convincing performance. <br /> <br /> I was not consciously aware of Irving before this, although I must have seen her without realizing it in "Carrie" (another favorite movie). In "Anasasia" I never felt for a moment that "it's just a movie". For me, this woman was ANASTASIA, and when the party ended up with her in the railway wagon meeting members of the royal family, I knew that hell or high water I had to see the second part. I just wanted to see how she would prove she was, as she claimed to be, and as the story progressed, I felt a heavy hatred of Rex Harrison's character, though I greatly admire him as an actor. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie again in the guide, I convinced my mother that we should see it, and subsequently thanked me for doing so, as I was almost as eager as I had looked at part 2. Then I bought the video and can totally recommend it. "Anastasia" is one of the rare television movies that you simply have to watch out for the sheer pleasure of watching the best spectacle I've ever seen on TV, and it doesn't matter whether you believe in the game or not.
