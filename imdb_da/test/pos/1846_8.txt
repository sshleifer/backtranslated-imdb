This particular movie was one that I wanted to see in theaters, but never came to it. When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001, I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD shortly after. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake did a wonderful job with the script and are delighted to listen to the audio commentary included on the DVD. They did a great job creating characters that you really care about. I really felt a whirlwind of emotions that looked at this movie, including sadness, anxiety and joy. The film also does a great job of showing the meaning of the family (a rarity in movies today) that reflects director Bonnie Hunt, based on the comments she made on the DVD. David Duchovny showed me here that there is life beyond Fox Mulder, which gives a wonderful performance with some beautiful scenes. I strongly recommend that you give this movie a view. I'm really grateful for the creators of this movie. They have given me a wonderful piece of cinematic view that I would recommend to all my friends. I've seen many movies over the years, and it's very rare that I get away with such a sense of satisfaction after watching a movie. I will look again and again in the coming years. Back to me reminds me that there are still filmmakers out there who know how to make their movie audiences more friendly. Thanks!!
