In fact, when a Stranger calls for a really good movie. I had never seen the original, and so when I saw this, I thought it was unique. When a foreign call was announced on the television, the trailer left the end. Well, I never saw the trailer, so when I saw this movie, I was surprised at how good it turned out. I went one day and decided to buy it, and now I'm lucky because I thought it was a very comfortable movie that is a nice little movie to own. It gets a lot of unfair treatment, and if you are interested in this movie at all, don't listen to all the negativity. Camille Belle is not so bad for an actress that everyone makes her appear to be, and she did a good job in this movie, so all your haters come across yourself, light up and actually try to enjoy this movie for it is; A fun, teeny bopper, popcorn flick. If you haven't seen it, do it, it's a lot more fun than many of the other slashers are made recently ...
