This blaxploitation classic about a kung fu mama traveling to Hong Kong to avenge his brother's death offers everything you learned to expect from the genre. Playmate Jeannie Bell (with a huge afro) really kicks ass and usually loses clothes very quickly. If you don't take it too seriously, the movie is fun to watch. Stan Shaw gives a solid performance, Jeannie Bell is a little less convincing. Pam Grier she is not. <br /> <br /> That's where Quentin Tarantino got his idea for the "Jackie Brown" light switch scene. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of Don Julian is a gem and is often used in rap songs.
