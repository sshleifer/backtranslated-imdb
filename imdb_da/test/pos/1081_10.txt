Over the years, I seemed to have missed this picture of Ronald Reagan, and because of his recent transit to the big screen in the sky, it was recently shown on television. This is a great low-budget B & W movie from the late 1930s, but it is very interesting to see how criminals used their talents to steal money from insurance companies with false claims during this time frame. I was amazed at the role of Ronald Reagan (Eric Gregg), "The Killer's '64, played on this picture with a great veteran movie star Sheila Bromley, Nona Gregg, Nightmare Circus 73, who was a great supporting actor. who showed Ronald Reagan as a very young man to reach the stars of his career in Hollywood at that time.
