SPOILERS Edgar Rice Burrough's famous character was adapted thousands of times to the screen until one's thirst is off, especially during the thirties and eighties of Hollywood. Its productors made Tarzan one of the most successful cinema characters. Several years later, Hugh Hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the monkey man, and it is a more natural, more wild and more down-to-earth Tarzan that he gives away. Hudson avoids the clich√©s you normally give to Tarzan, like his famous scream or his friendly pet, the Cheetah. Not only are we far from the designed and invented character made by Hollwood, but we are also far from the film used to make his stories. The film was partly made in Africa (more precisely in Cameroon). The film introduces two obvious parts: The first to take place in the jungle, where Tarzan lives among his adoptive friends, the apes, and considers himself as their master. But he ignores his real origin. The other in England, where Tarzan discovers the English community. Ian Holm points out the connection between the two parts and Hudson avoids anything that could make the movie fall into the ridiculous thanks to a clever manuscript. In fact, Holm Lambert learns basic rules of manners to behave correctly in English society, and the outcome works. Moreover, in the second part, no one ever laughs in Tarzan and he is even really appreciated. As for the end, it is good, it is both a bitter and a happy end. Happy because Tarzan comes back to the jungle and again meets his adoptive close relatives. But also bitter, because this homecoming means that the Greystoke line will not be secured and condemned to disappear ... Christophe Lambert finds here, his first (and last?) Major role. Unfortunately, he will never live up to his performance in this movie and he will play in poor and eerie action movies. Nonetheless, as I said earlier, a beautiful manuscript, a rare quality performance, some stunning scenery (both the jungle and the English country, and we get a beautiful movie. It's also an excellent recovery from a popular novel. only barely (6/10)?
