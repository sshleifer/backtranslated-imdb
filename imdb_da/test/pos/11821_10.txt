I had seen The Cure when I was a kid and I loved it then. Now years later I got a copy of a copy almost accidentally and saw it again. Being a child, you do not really have the ability to get things for yourself that you want, it is usually a prerogative for your parents - but when I saw it again now, I felt sorry I didn't do more for to get a copy of this movie since, and consequently almost forgotten it until today. <br /> <br /> This is really a beautiful movie. It tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a hard-witted, misfit child - who takes his signal from his horrible, violent mother - and his neighbor, a slightly younger boy who has AIDS. <br /> <br /> Right, you say. Another of "them". A tear A bucket film. A moral tail. Yes, I know I hate them too. Only one is not. It's one of the very few movies among the many I've seen that pulls out of a very rare trick: it conveys a really sad story (and indeed a moral story), but without a moment when it feels cheesy, forced or in any other way "hollywoody". It shows a true relationship between two real boys who interact as real children do. And through this interaction, the older boy, Eric's good-natured character, begins to shine through his "hard guy" persona as he assumes some kind of big-brother care for Dexter, his HIV-positive younger neighbor. Together they go on an adventure to find a cure - as Erik seems to be just around the corner - so all this stupid aids will go away and they can be friends forever. <br /> <br /> Production is top notch. But of course, what really carries this movie is the notion of the two leads - Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello. Especially Mazzello, who is simply fantastic - he conveys a sense of weakness needed for a scary boy, but at the same time he manages to make Dexter a truly energetic and determined character. He shines on the scene where the boys confront Pony: his impulse to protect his older friend lunges him forward, drives him to say what he says - and only afterwards is the line depicted on his face as he realizes that he even said is true: his blood is married ... Renfro also has his moments, especially the scenes with his mother: he perfectly portrays how this macho, street-wise kid is left completely frozen and numb when faced with his violent , stormy mother, and can't get a word to contradict her as she forbids her relationship with the sad boy out of her fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also gives a memorable performance as Dexter's mother, who eventually becomes a mother figure to Erik as well. <br /> <br /> I first watched this movie when I was back in school in America, and loved it - not even a movie about this kind of movie. But the construction of the children in this movie was so real, I could easily relate to them. Ironically, the teacher who had shown us this movie (a wonderful woman I am still in contact with her) in trouble for what some busy parents complained about having the stage when the two boys are watching a Playboy .. Pathetic. Seriously, Americans will ever come across this ridiculous phobia, I don't know. There was a hardly discerned play of a playboy cover in the movie and is therefore not shown in the schools ... how sad. Children should watch this movie. It is more inspirational and educational than all the "official" post-school specialties put together. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. I know I'm falling, but still ... The result. It is well. I am a musician and as such I know Dave Grusin from his records: he is a well-known jazz pianist and turntable. Until this movie, I didn't really know that he also made movie results, even though I later checked that I had unknowingly seen several movies he was working on. Really a wonderful job there. <br /> <br /> All in all, a solid Ti. I would recommend this movie to anyone. And I'm definitely going to see it with my younger siblings - they can use to watch a movie like this among all the standard special-effect hysteria they usually see.
