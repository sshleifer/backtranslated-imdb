My first Ichikawa for many years, and the first of his war films that I have seen, was this gripping and brutal from the get-go itself. In the very first scene, the nominal hero Tamura is told that he cannot continue with his unit, which he has returned from the hospital. He apparently has TB ?? But he is not ill enough for the hospital to give him the amount of war damage they have. But his old entity also won't take him back; his CO gives him a grenade and tells him that if he feels really hopeless to blow himself up? That is the honorable thing to do. <br /> <br /> Phillipines, 1945, and the situation looks really hopeless, for PFC Tamura and everyone else. Nobi is an odyssey through hell, or rather rather ?? dead forests, dead rocks and dead and dying Japanese soldiers just hope for an end, through peace or death. Ichikawa's film is photographed in a stunning B&W application that serves to highlight both the Tamura desert and those he meets on his journey toward his death, and to show how really small and bare they are all in the mountains and the shoals tremendously? This little affair of people will end soon, the earth seems to say, but I will survive and hardly notice it. <brura> <br /> Tamura travels back to the hospital but is (not surprisingly) rejected there and spends the rest of the movie trying to stay alive, becoming human and getting out of danger. He does not manage to do it really well in any way, the hunger slowly and eventually commits some righteous repulsive actions. Finally, he joins with two other desperate men who have lost or survived their units, and have brought cannibalism and, in their weakened state to other armed men, find that the only way to live is to break with everything He believes in. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is so brutal, uncompromising and intense as any war movie I've seen. There are moments of humor and tenderness, but they are fleeting and do not stick to the memory of the scene with the man of mountain top who almost begs Tamura to eat his flesh ?? The recurring black cartoon with Tamura to exchange his ragged shoes for a fallen buddy's better leather. The breakdowns that humans will endure to survive. The likelihood that this is a war, all wars, all humanity, as long as we continue. A masterpiece, which I probably won't see again for a long time. Looked through the beautiful Criterion Collection DVD.
