One of the better films coming out of the 1980s, this based film tells the story of a disturbed high school student murdering her girlfriend, leaving her naked body on a river bank, and later boasting about her friends. What is just as bad is their inability to feel anything about it. <br /> <br /> Disturbing but incredibly compelling look at the pointless and apathetic children who have no respect for their parents or any kind of authority that seems almost doomed to life of rebellion and recklessness. This drama hits hard and is impossible to forget. The young cast has an honorable job - even Keanu Reeves is in one of her earliest roles better than usual. Of course, there is no reason for Layne's (Crispin Glover) character to be as crazy and out of the wall as he is, but it's just Glover who is himself. Veteran Dennis Hopper has a particularly good role as a payer who, despite his own sordid past, is sad of the attitude of this group of children. I would like to point out that Daniel Roebuck is chilling performance as the young killer; He is an under-rated actor and apart from Hopper, he is probably the best performance in the movie. <br /> <br /> I saw "River's Edge" for the first time long ago when it first appeared on cable TV movie channels; However, I didn't get it all; I saw it in its entirety for the first time a number of years later, and now I have seen it again for what is probably the final time. <br /> <br /> Some highly influential moments include Madeleine's (Constance Forslund) collapse where she forgets that she might have to leave her children like their worthless father did. I also liked the scenes where Matt (Reeves) turns out with his disturbed younger brother (Joshua Miller) and when the teacher, Mr. Burkewaite (Jim Metzler) regrets that the girl is dead and that none of his students seem to break. <br /> <br /> I will never forget this movie, not as long as I live. It's too sad for that. <br /> <br /> 10/10
