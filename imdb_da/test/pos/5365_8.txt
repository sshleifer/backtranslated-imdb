I saw it at the 2004 Stony Brook Film Festival in NY and it was very warmly received. In this pre-WW2 movie, a couple of German rocket scientists work on the Scottish Isle of Scarp as a war weave on the horizon. The signs on the island are invaluable in their creation and their depiction. Shauna MacDonald is particularly memorable <br /> <br /> After speeding up the "Scootish" accents, the viewer feels at home with those folks who watch entertainment as the Germans work to connect their isle to the mainland via a rocket-based mail delivery. As inappropriate as it seems, this movie was based on a real story. All in all, a memorable movie that will stay with you for some time thanks to its casting, its history or its nature.
