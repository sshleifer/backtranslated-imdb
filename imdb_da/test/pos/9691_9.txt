I would give this movie an 8.5 or a 9. I thought it was just up hilarious I don't know how you couldn't believe this movie was fun, but the only thing that disappointed me was that there was a little bit too much very brutal thing because personally I think when they fly bikes and things like it is much more fun, but I am sure there are people who believe that the other things are very funny, so it is not mine defiance, yet good movie, watch it and then should definitely go and buy it too, if you don't like this movie, that's fine because I'm sure there are many people who believe that This movie shows how downgrading our society is, or what it is, is just my personal opinion and you have yours. Also the jackass box set is definitely something worth downloading or buying or whatever you do to get your videos
