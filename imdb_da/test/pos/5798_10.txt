One of the main aspects of "Malenkaya Vera" (called "Little Vera" in English) is that it was the first movie from the Soviet Union that featured a sex scene, albeit a short one. The title is important: Vera is the Russian word for "faith" and identifies that punk Vera (Natalya Negoda) has little faith in the Soviet system. And as the film shows, there is not much faith in being held in it. The opening scene shows the gloomy industrial city of Zhdanov, almost a hell of the earth. When Vera's girlfriend Sergei (Andrey Sokolov) moves into her family, it leads to some unexpected events. As in many Russian films, people's names describe their characters. For example, there is Viktor (remember that "victory" means winner). All in all, this is a good look at the Soviet Union as it collapsed - and we can see why it collapsed. Really good.
