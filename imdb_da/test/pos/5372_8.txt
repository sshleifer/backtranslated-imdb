Ben (a fine Charles Bateman), his young daughter K.T. (a sweet Geri Reischl), and his new girlfriend Nicky (the extremely attractive Ahna Capri) is on her way to a birthday party for K.T. They expect unexpectedly in a remote southern city where no one is able to leave, and with the exception of Ben, K.T. and Nicky, you can't come in either. First, the children disappear and adults are murdered at an alarming rate. Ben helps some locals - Sheriff Pete (LQ Jones), Tobey (Alvy Moore) and Jack (Charles Robinson), the local priest, trying to solve the mystery. <br /> <br /> This early 70s devil-themed horror movie actually takes place "The Exorcist", combining a "Bad Day to Black Rock" type plot of a rural town with a large large skeleton in its closet with horror elements , for interesting results. It actually sent a few chills down my spine this view, as it unnoticed moves along its spooky path. The moody and solemn atmosphere is established quickly and lasts for the duration; The ever-growing sense of panic gives it a real kick. Some memorable sets of pieces include the bizarre opening of a toy tank that turns into a real and squashing car surface, not to mention Nicky's twisted nightmare, vibrant and stylishly realized by director Bernard McEveety and crew. Jaime Mendoza-Navas' music is subtly scary and gives it the added sense of annoyance. <br /> <br /> The stubborn and professional cast does some fine work, especially the always-engaging Strother Martin as the talented Doc Duncan and the producers / actors LQ Jones and Alvy Moore. <br /> <br /> Just the fact that the whole plot lies just below the noses of our heroes makes it much more frightening. Jack the priest begins to lead them in the right direction, but will they be in time to stop things? It is an enjoyable little cooler that is worth visiting again; Just speaking for myself, I was able to appreciate it much more after giving it another chance. I can now say that yes, it is actually underestimated, telling a good story in an interesting, unconventional and effective way. <br /> <br /> 8/10
