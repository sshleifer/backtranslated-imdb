This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella or Bambi, but it is a very cute, fun, romantic, well-decorated Disney animated feature. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are lessons included here for the kiddies and some very suitable kiddie cheeks, but there are also plenty here for the adults. <br /> <br /> Although it is something of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still has some elements exclusively belonging to AristoCats. O'Malley is "tramp" and Dutchess is "lady", but Dutchess has several kittens, and they all try to come home. <br /> <br /> Phil Harris is our tomcat O'Malley. You can recognize his voice as he also designed the Baloo Bear's voice in Jungle Book and Little John in Disney's Robin Hood. Eva Gabor makes her silky sweet voice to Dutchess. <br /> <br /> Directed or worked by Wolfgang Reitherman, each Disney animated movie worth mentioning until his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> This is among my favorite favorite in Disney animated feature film and belongs to any Disney collection. The 2-Disk Special Edition is due this summer (2007). <br /> <br /> This bets a 8.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br />.
