This movie is a fun little private eye detective story that they are not made any more. It's all there: Tom Conway is the suave detective named Falcon, Goldie Locke (what's in a name) is his wisecracking bumbling sidekick, Louisa Braganza is the girl in distress, and of course there's the damn girl, the professor with the secret formula , the bad guy who wants the formula, and the police inspector who is after the Falcon. There is a murder and the Falcon is implicated. The landscape is night clubs, expensive hotel rooms, a luxury train, the suburbs and beautiful cars. Go see this little gem when you see it go by in the afternoon TV!
