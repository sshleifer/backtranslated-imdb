(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby "B" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and throw himself out of any problem he meets, but he has not been able to charm his way of passing the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mother and father are very disappointed that Bartleby has not been accepted to college. His parents believe that if Bartleby does not go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation to be rejected by all the colleges they have applied for. To satisfy their parents, Bartleby comes up with an idea to start his own college with an internet site. They convert an abandoned psychiatric facility to the South Harmon Institute of Technology. They become the only students. However, the site says we accept someone. On the first day of the school, they unexpectedly have a large number of accepted students who were also rejected by all colleges. With a million dollars in tuition money, Bartleby has to make his fake college a functioning one. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as College Dean. The fun begins when they design their own curriculum, make their own rules and party all night. <br /> <br /> (My comment) The principle of starting a college without teacher staff is a bit off the wall. Since it was a fake college, Bartleby didn't really need a staff. The movie reminded me of the classic movie "Animal House", the college setting, the fraternity, lots of gags and beautiful young women. These new college freshmen had a different idea of ​​what the college experience was all about. The film not only has a lot of humor, it also has a good message for life. People must reach their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not settle for what other people want them to do. The finish was a little unrealistic, but it's just a movie. The film was made for the young crowd to have some fun. (Universal Pictures, Run time 1:32, Rated PG-13) (7/10)
