The movie is not perfect in any way, but in spite of this it is very fun and fun to watch. I am the first to agree that Victor Fox is not so attractive and his music and style is rather cheesy. I also agree that the movie has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy what cares? Should any movie make sense? Should any movie be perfect? No. A person could be furious with admitting that they love this movie. Again, then what? It has beloved characters, it is well shot, the play is mostly good, it never becomes maudlin or dramatic, it is quirky. Look at how many people I love dreaming about Jeannie. Is it perfect? Heck no! And although this is very different, I say, check it out and you will be in a good mood when you see it.
