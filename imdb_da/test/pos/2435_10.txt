This entertaining, sometimes victorious look at Hollywood detective genre from the 1940s and 1950s stars, Robert Sacci as a former former policeman retiring, uses his life savings to pay for plastic surgery to transform his image into his idol, Humphrey Bogart, then creates shop as a private eye under the name "Sam Marlowe". Robert Sacchi is, moreover, one of the rare few Bogart impersonators who got the lice right; more to that point is body and facial language there. For a while, Sam's only client is his hostess who wants him to find his undersized girlfriend, and his only conversation foil is his secretary, simply called "Dutchess" (Misty Rowe), who in his own words "looked like Marilyn Monroe and made as much sense as Gracie Allen "and has a passion for banana split. Then he meets Elsa (Olivia Hussey), the plain, sweet, virgin daughter of a retired prop master who has been murdered for no appreciable reason. During the investigation of the murder, Sam maps over: Gene Tierney lookalike daughter (Michelle Phillips) of Anastas, a monstrous, rude wealthy Greek shipping tycoon (Victor Buono turning in an affordable Sidney Greenstreet) suffers from another wife (Yvonne deCarlo, who manages to play a number of emotional feelings without saying a word), his two smashed henchmen (Herbert Lom, channels Peter Lorre and Jay Robinson, makes a fairly accurate Lionel Atwill) and Anastas "vicious, amorous Middle Eastern potentat (Franco Nero ), which comes complete with a glamorous and loyal faithful mistress (Sybil Danning), who would give something to acquire Alexander's Eyes, two large, perfectly matched star sapphires, and when Elsa is murdered, Marlowe's interest in resolving the case becomes personal, and he sits down through a maze of Los Angeles landmarks, including the Hollywood Bowl, the scatological and esoteric attractions of Hollywood Boulevard and Santa Catalin on the Island in the pursuit of the rocks, determined to come upon them before any of the two wealthy competitors. Throw in cameos by Mike Mazurki and assorted others, the traditional stupid-but-sympathetic allies of the police force, and an abundance of nicely drawn characters that give dimension to virtually all players, and despite an unfortunate title song you have to mine mind, a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience.
