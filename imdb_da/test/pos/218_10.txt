I remember first bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams, back in the early days at Comedy Central. Back in those days (the 90s) their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MST3k, complete with the bearded host. <br /> <br /> Capt. Frank Drebin (played by the quarried dead panfilter, Leslie Nielson) is a process that was first created by the merging of various stereotypical police TV show players (think Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch the Show), cooked in a flask filled with familiar police tv show plots and scenarios. This is distilled, 3 times to produce the most pure policeman each made. Forget about Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz (for now. Save it for later). Frank Drebin is in most cases clueless, a horrible driver, a terrible shot, macho, yet sensitive and vulnerable. He is a leader of the police investigation method (a.k.a - ask Johnny Leathery Old Shoe-Shine Boy). This doesn't make him a bad policeman. Cops get lucky too. Capt Drebin (note he is a captain here) has perfected it. Along with his partner, Nordberg and the rest of the power, the police are parodyed during the six golden episodes. <br /> <br /> The show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialogue and quoted subscriptions. Most of the sight gags are a bit dated and stupid. The magic never came from sight gags, however. The core was an invisible and fair conversation and activities in the foreground with crazy things in the background. The films can best be described as 90 minute compilations of the best gags from this series. Think of Monty Pythons and now for something completely different ..... <br /> <br /> If you liked Airplane 1 & 2, Naked Gun 1,2,3 or Top Secret then you will definitely enjoy this . <br /> <br /> I always liked the series better than the movies, even though I saw the movies first. Why? 2 words: No. O.J.
