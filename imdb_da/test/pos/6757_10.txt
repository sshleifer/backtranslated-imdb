A brilliant animated piece that was far ahead of its time, and certainly far ahead of anything that was released in mass production at the same time in history. The influence of this work on Tim Burton's "Nightmare Before Christmas" is immediately apparent. One can only imagine how Starewicz slaved over every beautifully detailed frame of this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> There have been very few animated films of this caliber. It's a shame that more people haven't seen this gem. Currently, IMdB now requires comments to be at least ten lines long, so it's the tenth line. This should be something new - but I really have nothing else to say!
