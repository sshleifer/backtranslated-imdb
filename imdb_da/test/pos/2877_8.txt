So WWE did it. They have poured into movies, their first being See No Evil, starring their own Kane. I caught this movie and went in and didn't expect to be a good movie ... It just seemed to clich√© and didn't look like anything new. To my surprise, it wasn't actually half bad. A viewer mentioned above that it is good B-horror movie fun, and honestly it is the best way to describe it. Now the question was, I asked myself, how was Kane able to stop ... Well, let's just say he made an absolutely bad ass out of the character "Jacob Goodnight". He sold the role really well, and seemed really looking threatening. But what can you expect from a person who is nearly 7 feet tall and weighs about 320 in solid muscle. The action was decent, and the story was of course nothing new, but we all know that. The management as well as the cinematography were done very well, and the hotel scenery looked really fallen down and well done. Considering this was directed by a porn movie director, I was totally surprised. I would recommend this movie if you are looking for thoughtless gore and killing and just some parenting fun. Think of this movie as a modern last Friday the 13th movie. And save the room for the finish too, cuz it's a good one. And stick to the credits too ...
