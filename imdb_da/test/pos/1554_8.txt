I also watched this movie at a film festival, but unlike the previous poster I found it both interesting and original. In a sea of ​​terrible traits, shorts are often twice as bad that they make small budgets and bad actions. A.W.O.L, however, is a tight little thriller that belongs back to "The External Borders". The performances are solid, not what one would expect otherwise from Morse or McGinley, and the controls are sharp and on the money. I personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous posters' comments with the movie I saw. A.W.O.L is quite appropriately written by Shane Black, who, as usual, plays with the genre, both paying tribute to the stories pulping while blinking to the audience and never taking care of themselves. All in all, A.W.O.L shows to be an extremely well done and fun movie.
