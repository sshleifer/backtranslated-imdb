This movie has some rather shocking scenes and topics considering that it was made in 1971. Clint Eastwood, Geraldine Page and Elizabeth Hartman do outstanding work in the movie, like all the cast members. <Br /> <br /> Seen during the Civil War, the film begins when a wounded Yankee soldier, Johnny, portrait of Clint Eastwood, gets refuge and help at a girls academy in the south. <br /> <br /> The school's director, Mrs Farnsworth (Geraldine Page), one teacher-Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman) and a small group of adolescent girls have been without a man in their midst for maybe too long. <Br /> <br /> While their loyalty lies with Confederacy - their feelings and physical needs certainly lead them in the opposite direction. Johnny immediately uses his masculine charms to try to win the women over to his side - and keep them from turning him over to the patrols. <br /> <br /> However, emotions that have previously come from incestuous behavior, an unfaithful father, brutal rape and youth inexperience combined with jealousies - turn things upside down with some unexpected consequences for both Johnny and school's residents. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
