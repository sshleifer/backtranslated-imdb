A bright youth interested in "serious" music (admittedly a vanishing race - who will play the enemy when no one can play the violin? "- could find this an interesting fiction about street kids and great musical stars. Heifitz was The greatest violinist of his generation And the film gives him a rare screen danger to show his technique, the kids, especially Gene Reynolds, are fine, and overall, the picture is a prime example of the first class student fare at the end of the 30s. The great '39 list, but it's a good way for an intelligent family to spend a rainy afternoon with AMC or Video Store --- good luck at Blockbuster !!!
