This movie, with only two characters, takes you closer to these two people, the interrogator and the prisoner, than most movies take you to any character, but well crafted. The sheer confusion, terror and pain that Madeleine Stowe's character undergoes is very disturbing as Alan Rickman's sadistic yet charming interrogation. <br /> <br /> This movie is far too feasible and builds on a shocking climax, the impact of the movie as a whole you sit in silence at the end. It will haunt you for a long time.
