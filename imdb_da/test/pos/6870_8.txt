It's a shame House calls aren't better known. Is it perhaps because the romantic leads are middle-aged, shopworn and gun-shy, rather than oversexed teen stars? Could be. If you are over 35, you probably get this comedy. If you are over 45, you will really get this comedy. If you are 25, wait until you are older to see it. <br /> <br /> The unlikely pairing of Matthau and Jackson just works because it's so unlikely. There is a wonderful line of Matthau that sums up what happens between the two of them - "I like old bread because you don't have to explain who Ronald Coleman is." (If it's not the exact line, it's close ...) <br /> <br /> The premise of a sub-par hospital run by incompetent calls is true. Art Carney's portrayal of a senile chief surgeon is absolutely brilliant. It is impossible not to laugh aloud at his delivery. Subplotter, if you can call them that, is also fun, as between Matthau and Jackson's teenage son. Everything hits the right tone. <br /> <br /> Okay, that's the bit where Matthau has to wear women's clothes that are a little over-the-top and a lightweight brand. But still - it's Walter Matthau in a row! It is fun!
