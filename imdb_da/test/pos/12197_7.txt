If vampire tales are your cup of blood, then this Goth party based on Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles will prove to be a satisfying experience. A true consortium of undead in a modern setting, "Queen of the Queen", directed by Michael Rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness and of the unfortunate souls living there for eternity. <br /> <br /> The Vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), bored with a world no longer spanning him, has been "sleeping" for many years; but suddenly the sound of that world hears from his expanded slumber change and resembles what he hears, he wakes up to investigate. What he finds is a world filled with new sounds, a new kind of music - driving and piercing - sounds that attack the senses and make him feel alive and welcome. And he knows he has finally come to the point that it is time for him and him to come out into the open and see the world on their terms. In that end, he is at the forefront of a band - a singer and performer unlike what the world has ever known. He presents himself as a vampire and quickly assembles a course that goes far beyond London (where it all begins) and will eventually take him to Death Valley, California, where he plans to give a concert that promises to Be more than anything that anyone has ever seen or experienced. <br /> <br /> Lestat is powerful, no doubt, but there are those of its kind who do not welcome the fact that he has revealed them, one of which is Marius (Vincent Perez), a vampire powerful in himself - the vampire who actually made Lestat so many years before - and they gather, come together and make their plans to meet Lestat at the concert. And they don't go to the music. But there is also something else: At one point, Lestat has unintentionally awakened their 'Mother' of them all, the most powerful of all the vampires Akasha (Aaliyah), who is making her presence known to everyone and especially to the one she has chosen to rule by her side as her king: Lestat. And at the concert, be sure Akasha will be present without fail. <br /> <br /> Don't make mistakes, it's Lestat's story, and Rymer presents it amidst an atmosphere rich and with some exquisite moments, even though his films have less bite to it than say, "Interview with the Vampire" or " Bram Stoker's Dracula. " He puts a good pace, and there are some scenes that give some real tension, but in general, the film is not as drenched as it could be, or as much as one might expect. In the end, the amount of meat that is burned is actually over and above the actual blood rent, although there is more than one taste of gore and more than a fair share of lips and mouth dripping with the red stuff. There are also some good F / Xs available, especially in the sequences that accentuate the vampire speed as they move and seep through the air faster than the naked eye can discern. It's a decent job at Rymer, but he could have put more teeth into it if he had played the alienation suggested by Lestat; As it is, you get a sense of his emancipation, but not enough to get you fully involved. In "Interview with the Vampire", Tom Cruise brought some charismatic stardom to the role of Lestat, but Townsend is even more effective, with a look and attitude that captures Lestat perfectly. He plays him with a sense of acceptance, and during closer examination you can even find a hint of remorse and longing. It is a good performance and one that sells its character convincingly. Like Marius, Vincent Perez also does a good job - he is actually one of the film's forces - though his character is a bit ambiguous; However, it has more to do with the way he was written than with Perez's performance, which is quite good. <br /> <br /> Also in remarkable performances, Marguerite Moreau, like Jesse, is a young woman of curiosity about her own good; and the beautiful Lena Olin as Maharet, Jesse Tante, who ultimately plays a decisive role in the outcome of the drama involving Lestat and Akasha. And like Akasha, Aaliyah is an absolute nineteen presence. What more can you say about her other than she is a gifted performer with tremendous talent and beauty. And tragically she has left us too much. <br /> <br /> Support support includes Paul McGann (David), Christian Manon (Mael), Claudia Black (Pandora), Bruce Spence (Khayman), Matthew Newton (Armand), Tiriel Mora (Roger) and Megan Dorman (Maudy ). With a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre, Anne Rice fans will especially be happy with the `Queen of the Damned ', a movie nicely crafted and provided by director Rymer and his engaging cast. By focusing on the drama of history - and the way it is presented - rather than concentrating on just giving some cheap tensions, Rymer has managed to expose a real horror movie that is certainly a bit over and one that only May be your appetite for more of the same. And that's the magic of the movie. I rate this 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
