The women are a sweet movie about women of all ages (but mostly 30+) and their problems in life. Not just men and adultery, but also about relationships with friends and family that make time to connect with others, trouble with the image, compromise your values, outcomes in life and find out what will really make you happy. <br /> <br /> It's also about being true to yourself. Many times people will give you advice, but not really follow it themselves. Sometimes they have created a delusion for themselves, and do you really have to follow the same path or respond to your feelings now? I really liked this movie. Granted, it tried a bit like Sex & the City at times, but it certainly helped me to suffer. The difference here is that it is like the discoveries after the stage in life that the Sex & City stars were in. Here most are married or past the point of trying to find a man. Now they are trying to find happiness in their marriages and lives. Of course it is not an Oscar challenger, but it is entertaining and serves its purpose. And for the men in addition, there was an equal proportion of men and women in the cinema (most of them were with their wives / girlfriends), and the men actually laughed. :)
