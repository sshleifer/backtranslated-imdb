This Western was set in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first wireless wireless lines laid by Western Union. While the friendly guy Dean Jagger (sporting lots of hair) did his best to get it done, there was a bad guy just waiting to regret this for his own selfish reasons. So it's up to either Randolph Scott or Robert Young to save the day. This is certainly one of the better 1940s westerns I have seen, and it has almost got an 8 - it was so good. But for the life of me I have no idea why Fritz Lang was assigned to lead this movie - he didn't know anything about western. His forte was drama - and I suppose this movie is a drama of a kind - just put in the old west. Strange, yes, but it seemed to work okay, though I wonder how this great German director felt to get this job. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the movie, it is unique - with vibrant color, great location shooting and very good acting. Randolph Scott, as usual, put in another relaxed and realistic performance. However, I was surprised that Robert Young was also thrown into the movie, but it was a good casting decision - he had to be a Harvard trained Austrian. When I saw that Barton MacLane was also in the movie, I pretty much assumed he would be "baddie" and my thoughts were well-founded when he made a career without playing jerks! Regarding the manuscript, it seemed mostly common, but the final showdown between Scott and Barton MacLane was much better than I had hoped for - making this movie end up on a very high note.
