It is assumed that this is called southern Gothic. It's stars, Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci and Justin Timberlake. Timberlake does good work, much to my surprise, I didn't expect it from him. <br /> <br /> When you are lost and you can't find your way home - it's the black snake moan. <people in this movie are certainly lost in many ways, psychologically and emotionally damaged, betrayed by those they trusted and loved and filled with great pain. Samuel L. Jackson plays a blues singer / musician - whose wife has messed around with her brother and now left him for his brother to interrupt a child he had hoped to have with her. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricc's character is a woman who was sexually abused when young - this has made her a self-destructive nymphomaniac; allows men to treat her badly. <br /> <br /> The story lies at the intersection of the lives of these two characters. It's a love story, but not a sexual love story between them - the older black man and the young white woman. <br /> <br /> It's different from most movies Hollywood grinder out. <br /> I strongly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
