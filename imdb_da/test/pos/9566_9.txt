This movie is not a comedy, it's an exposure. I have always hated dog shows, given the ridiculous get-ups people put their dogs in and the idiotic names they give them. Therefore, the reason for my uncontrolled cackling while watching this movie. I get a kick out of something that is taken so seriously even though the winnings are small and insignificant. It's like miniature golf, or jumping furniture championships or the need to put some unclear world records. The play was much more refined in this movie than waiting for Guffman, and it is mainly due to the more fluid characters that seem more comfortable with their specific actors in this movie than the previous one. Eugene Levy was great, like Michael McKean and Fred Willard. However, it was the dogs that eventually stole the show. But then again, who would like to see a lot of people in a movie about dogs anyway.
