Kevin Kline offers a brilliant cartoon in the 1997 comedy IN & OUT. Kline plays Howard Brackett, a small city history teacher, eagerly seated to see the Academy Awards this year because one of his former students (Matt Dillon) is nominated. He is nominated for his performance in a movie where he plays a gay soldier, and when he wins, he thanks Howard in his speech to inspire him because Howard is gay. Now this floor is Howard because he has no idea why the guy would say it on international television. Howard is even engaged to being married (to Joan Cusack, in an Oscar nominated performance), so he has no idea where Dillon; s Cameron Drake got the idea that he is gay and finds he has to defend himself at all in school but is shocked that no one seemed terribly shocked at what Cameron said at the Oscar. Howard has a birthday party where he gets birthday presents as the soundtrack to YENTL and ends up explaining to his guests why Barbra Streisand had to make FUNNY LADY. His parents (Wilford Brimley, Debbie Reynolds) are shocked but promise to support their son even though he is gay. He also gets a visit from a reporter from the city (Tom Selleck) who wants to make an article about him because he is also gay. The moment Selleck plants a big kiss right on Kline's lips is a classic. But all these little things, Howard has actually questioned his sexuality and wondering if he really is gay ... much to the poisoning and frustration of his fiance, Cusack, who is over confused. The scene where she leaves a bar in her wedding dress and stands in the middle of the street, screams about the lack of single straight but in the world is a classic. But what I like about this movie is the way Kline invests fully in the role and was not afraid to look silly or look gay. There is a fabulous scene, probably the most famous from the movie, where he buys a record, how to be a macho, and the guy on the plate talks about how real men do not dance and a disco tune comes on (I will survive if memory Servant), and the narrator on the record says no matter what you do, but Howard can't help himself and he ends up shaking his wrinkle all over the room. It is hysterically fun and Kline plays it with sincerity and gusto. The movie is not pro or anti gay ... it's just a cool and fun character study about a man trying to figure out exactly who he is. Wonderful movie.
