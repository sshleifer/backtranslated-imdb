I can't believe there are people out there who didn't like this movie! I thought it was the funniest movie I had ever seen. I've been b / c I'm Mel Brook's biggest fan ... I know almost all the words and become very discouraged when they censor them when played on a family channel. :) This is one of my favorite movies, so I don't know why anyone would disagree! thanks for kristina
