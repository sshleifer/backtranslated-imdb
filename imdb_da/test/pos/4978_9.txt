I really enjoyed this movie. I have a real sense of justice and 'an eye for eye', and this film delivers it in spades. Glenn Ford is offered a very low price for its ranch of the large ranches in the valley; then one of his ranch hands is beaten and shot 'to help him make a point of selling'. When the ranch's hand dies and the sheriff refuses to do anything, Ford seems to be reluctant to do anything and warns his men not to take things into their own hands. But that's just what he has to do. I knew this movie was on fire when he entered the salon and confronted the guy (Richard Jaeckel, one of my very favorite boys' character actors) who had killed his ranch hand; After a gentle dialogue with him, Glenn Ford strikes his face and shoots him dead. A kind of just added bit of justice, he kills this guy with the gun that had belonged to his murdered cowhand. In short, we are being treated to Ford for letting his ranch burn so his men are entitled to prevent the crew from the other ranch; then Ford and his men stamped all the horses and cattle of the ranch of the great evil guy; Then they come up and burn the outhouses and the big fancy house to the ground. Talk about getting even more time. Lots of actions in this movie. There's more to the story than this, but I'd just recommend seeing the movie. Glenn Ford was a person who appeared again and again, what can happen when you mock someone, and I really enjoyed seeing him get justice in the old fashioned way.
