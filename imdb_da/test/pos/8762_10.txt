Beautifully constructed, "Traffic" tells the story of drug use and trafficking from multiple points of view. From a policeman, from a police view, from an abuser, from the smuggler's point of view and from the farmer's point of view. In a carefully constructed storyline you get the impression of how everything is interconnected. From beautiful on-location shots in the poppy fields of Pakistan, to downtown Karachi, to the airport in Frankfurt and London, to the subdivided buildings where smuggling takes place, one sees the massive dimension of drug consumption.
