King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm) in Romania is a vampire, but a vampire of light who does not want more than to live in peace and harmony with humanity. But his son, Radu (Anders Hove), is a cruel creature to his heart (which is quite obvious as soon as you see him). Three female students have come to study local folklore, but find themselves drawn into the vampire's legends at the wrong time: Vladislav has been killed. <br /> <br /> Who can say anything bad about a movie with a cameo from Angus Scrimm? I can not. I mean, I had some low expectations after seeing other Full Moon images ("Puppet Master" and "Demonic Toys"). But despite the really bad animated effects of the demons, this movie was actually really well done and very fun to watch. Lots of blood, a good plot and backstory (the Bloodstone story was surprisingly refreshing) and even some new angles on vampire myths that you think would be dead now. (Maybe I'm wrong, but it's probably the first movie to have rosary beads fired by a gun.) Aside from vampires and blood, you get a share of nudity (free but welcome) and I had to Notice the excellent score of the composers (not sure who deserves credit, but those involved are Stuart Brotman, Richard Kosinski, William Levine, Michael Portis, and John Zeretzka). This is Horror 101 all the way. Heck, you even get two followers, which are signs of a real horror movie. (Of course, some bad movies also get followers - did I mention "puppet master"?) Romanian theme was well done, and the film even seems to be made by the Romans if I guess their name is correct. And the score - the music - really stood out for me as a good change in tempo, a lot of mood. I like Richard Band, but I'm glad another composer got a shot because he nailed the atmosphere upside down. If you like vampire movies and want a little variation (one of the Eastern European variety), it is worth seeing.
