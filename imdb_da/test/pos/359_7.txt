As the penultimate of Chaplin's Essanay film, CARMEN is a parody of Cecil B. Demille's drama with the same title. It is equally clear that Demil's acclaimed film did not impress the comic king as much as he later admitted in his autobiography. Parodies were not a new experiment for Chaplin. He had already made several of them, HANS PREHISTORIC PAST and his new job, and would continue to do so until the end of his career in film (eg in A KING IN NEW YORK). <br /> <br /> Chaplin makes a very good portrayal of Don José, and Edna Purviance is as good as Carmen. Neither act as we are used to; Charlie is not the lovable tramp, and Edna is far from an innocent little woman, but neither was Chaplin's intentions. A BURLESQUE ON CARMEN is a somewhat strange Chaplin film, very different, but contains good material. <br /> <br /> The main story, although very differently structured, is as in the original drama. Don José is very much in love with Carmen, but is not alone in this field; "Carmen, Carmen, the beautiful Carmen, (loved) by all men under the age of 96," but he has the great advantage of being an officer, and there we are; This is the famous story of rivalry, love, greed and honor from a humorous perspective. Thanks to Chaplin's and Purviance's notions, and the wonderful, wonderful music of George Bizet that I greatly admire, it could actually have been a near comedy masterpiece, it's time taken into account. It could have been. But unfortunately, although it is a good, quite good comedy, I do not feel it is fair to blame people who claim that A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is far from being a masterpiece. But it is important to remember that this has nothing to do with lack of talent, but rather a result of business conflicts. When Chaplin refused to sign the Essanay contract after the end of her last movie to the company POLICE, they took revenge by editing all the scenes Chaplin had originally edited from CARMEN. Thanks to this, the movie is somewhat confusing and has several pointless scenes that are more annoying than fun, and the movie turned out to be a Ben Turpin feature - Turpin played Remendados - than a Chaplin card. Of course, Chaplin was in despair when he discovered what Essanay had done and had to stay in bed for days. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, a BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is highly recommended to Chaplin fans and to admirers of beautiful music.
