This was a good movie. It had an interesting story that was done quite well in the later part of the movie. The story reminded me of God's city. But this is done in a more nicer way in comparison. It had what I really loved: an expression of surrealism. Some pretty interesting filmography (through the wooden camera) I'm not sure if it was culturally correct, but it certainly expands you with views of South Africa. The actors were good (for 1st hour, most of them anyway), I especially liked Estelle character, which made this movie quite enjoyable. What was interesting, though, was that it makes you ask about your own life. Do you really do what you really love? Or do you accept the norm, the convention around you. Definitely worth a watch.
