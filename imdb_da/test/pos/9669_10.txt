Ignore the comment before min. The show is comics, the most underrated show ever. 3 reasons why. Reason 1, flashbacks are fun, who cares that they have nothing to do with the story, they make me laugh so hard it hurts and isn't it the idea of ​​a good comedy program? People who think this is not fun just have no sense of humor. Who cares if they are random, it is a tsv. Show you can do whatever you like with it, and people say it's not realistic, even a cartoon it's animated. Reason 2, The jokes are just generally fun, Seth McFarlane and the other authors are soooooooo fun, everything from Star Wars references to making fun of celebrities, I love them all. And the reason 3 is the lines of history just brilliant and fun, they put all the jokes up with their crazy nature and wackiness, just the more fun. I caught this one late night on BBC2 and I have never gone back, I have all 7 seasons, plus that kind of movie stuff (Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story), I have several t-shirts, posters and my collection still growing. I've never had a collection of any TV show before, but it was so much fun I had to get everything. <br /> <br /> Just watch season 3 and trust me, you'll be hooked for life, the funniest show ever created, and I hope it never ends!
