I watched this movie on TV back in the 60's and it still looks good even after brilliant performances like a DI by R. Lee Ermey, Lou Gossett and even Frank Sutton (in a comic vein) at Gomer Pyle USMC. I wasn't in the service, but my brother had a drill instructor in the Air Force and it was scary. Others in the family who were marines told me that Ermey and even Sutton were beautiful on the spot in their roles. The only thing missing in "D. I." is the language. In 1958 they could not yet use profanity on film, but Jack Webb encountered pretty damn hard without it. I think it's his best role ever. In Dragnet he was quite stiff. I admit, but not as bad as George Raft, but he only used it to work in "D. I." You never forget the funeral of the dead flea! The romantic part was just to stretch the film, but didn't really disturb the basic plot. Don Dubbins was pretty good, but he never surpassed this movie in his career. As for patriotism, Jack Webb was John Wayne's cross. He carried it a bit too far in some Dragnet episodes, but not in "D. I." After 40 years, I hoped that the film could stand up to "Full Metal Jacket" and others; And it did!
