I can't praise this movie enough. It had a lot of handheld, first-person shaking camera that I love (and some hate because it makes them sick), like REC, Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie in its kind, but I didn't even notice because the movie was so interesting. By simply showing the footage of a paranormal reporter's work, the movie keeps pace, making it a real-time experience for the viewer. <br /> <br /> While I would never call this movie, the "scary horror ever made", I have to say it's certainly one of the best I've seen. The fear factor here is constructed of details in the pictures, camera errors, events related to each other, which give a very mysterious and frightening tone to the film. The fear is more in what is not shown, but back to our beliefs. The finish is perfect and be warned that you might have nightmares afterwards. However, another view is recommended. <br /> <br /> Watch this one alone in the dark, don't expect anything and you'll have fun.
