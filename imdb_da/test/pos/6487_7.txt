Community member Susan Fletcher (Hopkins) and her rich father Simon Fletcher (Henry Stephenson) are concerned that their young nieces Joan (Betty Philson) and Katie (Marianna Strelby) live a Bohemian lifestyle in Greenwich Village with their artist Uncle John (Milland) after the death of their parents (Susan's sister and John's brother). Simon has quit trying to convince John to allow him and Susan to take care of the children and have resorted to using private detectives to capture him in either unrestrained behavior or unemployed and therefore cannot properly care for the children. Susan finally decides to take matters into her hands and goes to Greenwich Village herself and acts as an actress to try and get information and / or persuade him to see reason. What she discovers, however, is that she not only likes the free and artistic lifestyle of John and his friends, and that the girls are brought up well, but that she quickly falls in love with John. Inevitably, her true identity is discovered, and she is faced with the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the parental announcement to hear with whom. I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be very short Driving time (70 minutes) was the perfect length to spin this simple but endearing story. Miriam Hopkins, one of the great 1930s-1940s actresses, is delightful in this movie. Her energy, style and healthy beauty really lend themselves to creating a welcoming character, even though you know she is pulling a fast one on the people she quickly turns to. This is the earliest movie I have seen Ray Milland in, and he was actually young and non-patrician in appearance. (And apparently three years younger than his fellow star) His energy and carefree way in "Wise Girl" was a refreshing change to the behaviors he affects in his usual darker films. Honestly, although I am usually not a fan of children's actors, I really enjoyed the two young girls who played Susan's cousins. They were endearingly precocious and were really the jewels in the movie. Unfortunately, I can't dig up other movies that any of them were later in this one, which is a shame as both show a large amount of natural talent. The "Wise Girl" was a film made three years after the Hollywood Code, was embedded, and to some extent, it was abundantly clear of the fast and happy end, and the cake in the sky raised and lightened as the characters lived. The alleged Bohemian co-op was actually a beautiful cul-de-sac where the artists lived for free or for trade, and everything is tied very nicely throughout. Fortunately, this was an easy enough movie and the characters were charming enough to make allowances for their fluffiness and short-comings, and I could just take "Wise Girl" for what it was; a good old-fashioned love story that was as entertaining as it was endearing. Unfortunately, movies in the romantic comedy / drama branch today are significantly less intelligent and entertaining, or I would not find myself going back to the classics. 10.7
