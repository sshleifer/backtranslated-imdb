Thirst <br /> I found out that this movie was beautifully crafted. The cinema was well above excellent. I though almost any frame could be frozen and you wanted yourself an exquisite image. The use of color stands out most. In many cases, the camera slid through the stage and the work was flawless. Park Chan Wooks direction was amazing. He unconsciously believed me in his removed universe. There were several touches of verbal and visual humor (of a dark nature) that just added another depth to the image as a whole. The actor I wouldn't call excellent, but it suited the movie and worked well enough. <br /> <br /> For me, the only place where this movie was missing was in history. Sometimes I don't want to lie, but it didn't make sense to go between signs. Sometimes the story flow was lumpy. All in all, I was disappointed with the subdued narrative, and I felt it ran a little too long. <br /> <br /> But I still recommend this movie, for its vision, its visual flourish, its dark humor and at the end of the day it's an interesting movie, even though it's incomplete. 9.10
