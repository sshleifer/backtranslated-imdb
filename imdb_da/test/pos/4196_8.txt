"I'm ... proud of Head," says Mike Nesmith. He should be because this film, which has either been cheated by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels. Yes, it is unconventional. To many frustrating. It's almost as if the producers are giving you the film and tempting, "You figure it out." <br /> <br /> You already know that The Monkeys TV show was an ongoing marketing success that relied on business acumen and not small public deception. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first than entertaining. That The Monkees broke out of the box for a short time to do "Head" is a testament to the group's popularity and importance in the pop culture, despite where your head is on. Get one thing right: "Head" is not The Monkee's TV show. So what we have here is a "psychedelic documentary" about Western pop culture from a source that has authority on the subject. "Head" is a movie that could only come from them "inside the box". In 1968, The Monkees cast and crew were seasoned and tired professionals who had seen their share of promise and disappointment. The film was a deliberate attempt at market positioning. So it did three things: Make a movie like Monkee's show. Most importantly, to retrieve the group to a non-entertaining one for it's old managers - and that's better than before. Make a movie that exposed American attitudes to information dissemination. <br /> <br /> "Head" is really about media manipulation and its net profit: deception. The mass media must inform, educate us about the events in the world as a whole, and ultimately ask us to make opinions about these events that can shape the idea of ​​positive action. Thus, we assume the information we absorb in order to be complete and impartial - otherwise, how can one create a dignified conclusion on an idea presented by a book, newspaper or television show? In one of the street talks in "Head" a guy admits, "I haven't seen a newspaper or television this year." Is he less or better man? Even the drug parallels are a soft auction of "things are not as they seem." Remember the old joke, "Everything you know is wrong"? The script starts with The Monkees' public recording of his own "produced image" and runs with the football - literally. Is the football scene in the movie a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind "Head"? Is the movie a power-of-conscious exercise? Is the movie the culmination of pot smoking marathons? There are too many coincidences that occur in the film that suggest otherwise. My guess is that "Head" is the culmination of motivation somewhere between planned and unintentional. For the most part, the insiders responsible for "Head" seem to enjoy themselves in the news that takes place in the movie, but there is anger in the chaos that characterizes the late 60's and anger in the way the media, especially TV had changed culture in negative ways. Drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late 60s and are still, but the producers of "Head" want you to know that bad "information" is a far greater danger. Wars have been attributed to hoaxes and lies. What perfect way to spread disinformation than via TV? The mysterious black box is repeatedly seen as an obstacle to The Monkees and apparently all of us. In a scene, Peter is hungry in a salon with a melting ice cream cone and is asked by a colleague Monkey, "What's wrong?" "I bought this ice cream cone and I don't want it." The film suggests that the media's first purpose is NOT to inform, but to sell a lot blindly. "Head" goes on: put the idea into a person's head and delight him. <br /> <br /> The film authorities know it and the danger is real. "Head" is either a movie that creates itself "as we go together" or is a conscious statement. Maybe maybe not. Maybe it's just "Pot meets advertising" that critics shot in 1968. The jokes are at The Monkees and us. Beware of what you ask for, you can get it. Cheers: A real guilty pleasure. Very funny. Intelligent. Please the fans. Find the drug, it's there. Effortless strange. Bizarre collection of characters. Good tuning. Length is appropriate. Lots of good one lines, including my prophetic favorite all the time: "Your era's tragedy, my young friends, is that you might get exactly what you want." <br /> <br /> Caveats: Dated. Drugs. No plot. No linear delivery of any thinking in particular. At least twenty-five stories linking in stop-and-go fashion. Then it can easily be frustrated. Can seem pretentious to some. People who cannot stand The monks do not have to see, although in itself there is no reason to avoid it. The psychedelic special effects can kill your scary tube or your acid burned eyes. <br /> <br /> Match, cut.
