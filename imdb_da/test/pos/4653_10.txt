I would love for members of the cast and crew to sit down and make a sound comment on this movie! All the different places they went to film this movie! Have to make some very good anecdotes! Fans of this movie would love to know: <br /> <br /> What kind of permission would they have to film in specific places? <br /> <br /> Was there any memorable outcome? <br /> <br /> Were any scenes deleted? <br /> <br /> What were the challenges faced and the crew facing? <br /> <br /> Have any actors had stunt doubles? <br /> What was it like working with other members of the player? <br /> <br /> Were any of the scenes ad libbed? <br /> <br /> What are members of the cast and crew up to now? <br /> <br /> What locations are still there and which locations are no longer or is it another company? <br /> <br /> Read this trivia about this movie on this site and other websites. But there's just no comparison to getting it right from the horse's mouth! <br /> <br /> Come on, guys! Come and make a comment! Never go away from a challenge! Go for the gusto!
