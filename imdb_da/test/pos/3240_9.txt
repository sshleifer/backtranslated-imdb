I got this movie with my BBC "Jane Austen Collection" (5 DVDs with old BBC customizations) and didn't like it first. It is quite different from the others, and it is missing, or I thought, one of the qualities I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful sense. The nightmare scene where Mrs Richards apparently sews her fingers together was particularly disturbing. <br /> <br /> I still don't like to see the finger-sewing scene, but I love to hear Mrs. R. say, dreamy while she sews, "my only acquaintance ... tore my dress on." This movie is now my current Austen favorite. I've seen it 7 or 8 times so far. The action is, in my opinion, incredible. The way I notice good acting is when I find myself looking up from what I do (sewing, but not my fingers together, hopefully or boondogling or whatever) to see the character delivering its lines. It is expression of expression, casting of posture that gets the words alive - that's what makes it good, as far as I'm concerned. I see almost all parts of "Northanger Abbey" because almost all actors play their roles with such charisma. Peter Firth is amazing as Mr. Tilney, the perfect blend of bathian crap and real masculine heroes - you're not sure of the end whether he's after Catherine's money or not. I love his touch of (Welsh?) Accent. Mr. and Mrs. Richards is charming: the combination of their behavior - especially Mr. Richards' high voice, lending counteract his whites and wisdom - makes them so real. General Tilney, as the hard-dyed father, possibly a killer, is also fascinating. And Captain Tilney, the sparkling rake that so well enjoys himself ... and the money-grabbing sister and brother whose names I can't remember at the moment - the two are so perfect at once smart and chic. <br /> <br /> The second reason I love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all Jane Austen adaptations. I know this was one of Austen's weak points (that's as far as I'm concerned): Although all her novels are love stories, it's hard to feel that her heroes and heroes are really in love at the end. And if they're not really in love, then what's the point? All the other adjustments I've seen (except for the early Olivier / Garson one) have beautiful cold fish kisses at the end if they kiss at all. I don't even like sex in movies at all, but it's really necessary to have a heartfelt kiss in the end. And the final kiss in Northanger is a doozy. The over-the-top approach to costumes, music and lighting works very well, as far as I'm concerned. And the manuscript is extremely wise - the way we are educated in Gothic romance, highlife in Bath, Cathy's normal upbringing, etc., is very well done, as they usually are in BBC productions. I also like the part when the little black side does cartwheels. And Marchionesse thinks I was a perfectly suitable and very smart exhibition unit. Some people have protested that this version is the opposite of what Jane Austen intended to do in Northanger Abbey - she meant making fun of Gothic romance, not promoting it. But I don't think she meant putting "Mysteries of Udolpho" etc. Down. She did just the point you should distinguish between reality and fiction. And this point is made when Mr. Tilney asks Catherine in her mother's room. In addition, General Tilney was a villain, albeit a prose. It was supposed to happen, for sure.
