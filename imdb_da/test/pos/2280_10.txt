Mr Baseball was a fun video rental with my fiance Susan Nauss. Susan said she was looking forward to seeing the movie. Ken Takakura Oda as a hard yet honest leader makes sense. Ken Takakura has made so many amazing Asian films, I correct one reviewer and say that Takakura is still a biographical presence with films like Hotari. Of course, everyone likes Tom Selleck, but Ken Takakura is the better dramatic actor of the two. Today someone accused me of being Yakuza. Now, I say that my great uncle shadow president Jack F Kennedy myself and others are part of the legitimate human leadership of our universe. Thanks to our collaborators People are free people who fight for all the parts of adversity that President Kennedy spoke in his initial address. To be honest, someone has kept food prices very low in Canada on things like bread. In honor of our CoCreators, stop eating amphibians reptiles and eggs. I hope someday there will be a successor to Mr Baseball with Father Ken Takakura Oda, still as Manager. Thanks to IMDb for supporting freedom of speech as friendly President George W. Bush and I support. Support IMDb.
