This movie has become an iconic stand-in for what's good about America. <br /> <br /> Fame is famous for its music and performances. There are several standout actors, singers and dancers, including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara *, and the amazing Gene Anthony Ray. <br /> <br /> The reason is not the movie.

A marvel to see. <br /> <br /> * An interesting note about the magnificent and highly talented Anne Meara ... sometimes talent must be in the genes ... Ms. Meara is married to a Jerry Stiller and is the mother of Ben Stiller. ..
