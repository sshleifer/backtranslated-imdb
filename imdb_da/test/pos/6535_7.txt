Aaron Carter plays the pop star (J.D. McQueen) in this movie (surprise surprise). This is a typical movie where the leading lady (Jane) has a big crush on the JD McQueen pop star (as well as many other girls), but she is the lucky one to spend the days with JD and form a relationship with him that is more like a fantasy. J.D. must go to a public school to keep up their math class in order to make their summer trip. The problem is that J.D. not good at mathematics. He finds the smartest person in school (Jane) to guide him. Jane teachers and fall in love with J.D. J.D. on the other hand falls in love with, but J.D. turn up and have to correct everything to win the girl and make the summer trip. The movie is definitely worth seeing. Aaron becomes a great actress !!!
