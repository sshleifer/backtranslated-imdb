This is valuable. Everything is enlightened is sweet and sublime fun from the first delicious dialogue line. Oh, how have I been waiting for this to arrive in Austin. While Elijah Wood is charming as Jonathan Safran Foer (the real author of the novel Everything Illuminated), it is Eugene Hutz (playing Jonathan's Ukrainian tour guide and translator, Alex) who really steals this movie. Alex is a hip-hop lovin 'Ukrainian breakdancer who, along with his grandfather, helps Jonathan find the woman who saved Jonason's grandfather's life during World War II. The Ukrainian landscape has never looked so agile. I'm thinking of packing it all up and moving to the former Soviet state. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film, however, changes when Jonathan and Alex finally meet the woman they are looking for, and suddenly this adorable comedy becomes a heartbreaking historical drama of a Jewish village destroyed during the Nazi occupation. Everything is enlightened is about history, heritage and wisdom that can be achieved by uncovering the past. It's perfect.
