TV News Produces Jane Craig (Hunter) meets Tom Grunick (Hurt), an upcoming news presenter, at a seminar, and their mutual attraction takes them back to her room. However, romance is short when it appears that Tom, in his own words, is "not good at what I am successful at" and Jane realizes that he personifies everything she hates about where the television news goes. Rub comes when Tom reveals that he is joining her Washington news agency. <br /> <br /> Jane and Tom's first attraction therefore get another chance, but can Jane put her professional sense of man she finds attracted to - and should she? Aaron Altman (Brooks) is Jane's very intelligent reporter colleague and confidential. Despite his obvious talent, Aaron's career is standing as he lacks trust and human abilities - and the classic good looks - to be the success of his new, less skilled and less intelligent colleague - Tom. He is also worried that his good friend Jane may fall in love with Tom, despite his better judgment, as it becomes increasingly clear that Aaron has her own romantic feelings for her. <br /> <br /> This key romantic plot is set within a television news office where moral dilemmas and ethics are struggling with swiftly and where appearances and dramatic effects become more widespread and important. <br /> <br /> This is where most of the bit comes from with thoughtful comments and scenes. One of many moments is a scene where Tom meets the Network's top anchor, Bill Rorich (a comedy for Jack Nicholson), for the first time, and the camera focuses on their handshake. In a movie full of lines and dialogue, long and short, you realize a lot about these two men's character from this one-shot shot of two hands. The dialogue between characters is among the most intelligent and witty you will ever find anywhere on film and in such abundance. Brooks gets the best part of them according to his character, but even the shortest conversations that are random and perhaps overlooked by one or more of the characters they are moving through a crowded room should be listened to. <Br /> Hunter is a turn-force in this role, which she was rightly (and not only) nominated for an Oscar and which she would probably have received if it was a role in a film that is not part of what had become a closely related industry - and against a strong performance from another actress in a more traditional feel-good rom-com. <br /> <br /> Brooks is also excellent as it is constantly frustrated and even though he owns the look and delivers the personality required by his character, he does not always convince him that he is just as dimmwitted the character he says is or should be. He shows a latent intelligence that allows him to get the most out of his apparent limitations, which can be plausible, but I don't think Hurt is pulling it out completely. Except when he tells us that he "stinks" or "doesn't get it," Hurt comes across as a bit wiser than that. Otherwise, it is an effective performance in a role where his character is compromised by his intellectual limitations, but Brooks and Hunter overshadow a little Hurt's performance. This is the only negative thing I can say about the whole movie, and who is to say that someone else would have done better or get better when sitting next to Hunter and Brooks and their performances in this movie. <Br /> <br /> Support is ably provided by eg. Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles and Joan Cusack, and there's also a bit of a role for Christian Clemenson's subsequent Boston Legal fame and the shortest bit-parts for Joan's brother John Cusack whose face you don't even see. <br /> <br /> James L Brooks has given us many great TV shows and movies, and this movie should rank with the very best of them. It may not have won any Oscars, despite seven nominations, but it won many other awards and turned Holly Hunter into a star.
