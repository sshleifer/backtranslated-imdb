From FIERCE PEOPLE's opening scenes (an interplay between tribal and photographed by the anthropologist of the young, Finn Earl, demonstrating why this South American tribe Ishkanani is so hard), is the direction of the movie: we look at a dark comedy comparing life in New York - the streets of unconscious peoples, or is it a more serious message movie? But as history develops this fine line between entertainment and philosophical consequences becomes increasingly apparent. Griffin Dunnes direction of Dirk Wittenborn's adaptation of his novel may be a bit careless at times, as it rejects rational plot development, but in the end there is a strong enough final impact on patching up the holes he created. <br /> <br /> Our narrator Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) lives with his cola-dependent masseuse / sexually occupied mother Liz (Diane Lane) in New York and is waiting for the summer to join his anthropologist father field trip to South America (a father he knows only from letters and videos) when a drug abruptly changes their lives: One of Liz's wealthy customers Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland) rescues the family outside and out and moves them to his ten-acre estate , a sign of wealth and power. Instead of being Osborn's private masseur, Liz and Finn can stay in the mansion with the "dirty rich" Osborn's daughter, Mrs. Langley (Elizabeth Perkins) and grandchildren Bryce (Chris Evans) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Osborne and his doctor lead Liz on the desiccation path and Finn bonds with Osborne and his grandchildren, and despite the difference in poor versus wealthy living conditions - for a while. Events happen to change feelings, and Finn is attacked and raped by a masked attacker, a turning point for the film and Finn's view of the Osborne family. Osborne reveals his past to Finn and together they discover the truth about Finn's disturbing incident - and also about the violent disease of the wealthy class. <br /> <br /> The movie uses many clips of tribal activity during the movie, drawing some disturbing parallels for some of the more challenging scenes. For this viewer, who works well, but when the director chooses to place tribal individuals in full regalia within the Osborne property, the concept is confused as if the audience is forced to "get it". The various subplots between the Virgin Jilly (Paz de la Huerta) and the Finn and the introduction of an overweight warrior artist Whitney (Branden Williams) push the edge of credibility to emphasize the line between the rich and the 'lower class', but the performances at Sutherland, Lane and Yelchin is strong enough to forgive us the film's demise. Not a good movie, but one with many worthy ideas sprinkled around the screen of a project that often feels lost in its fight for direction. Grady Harp
