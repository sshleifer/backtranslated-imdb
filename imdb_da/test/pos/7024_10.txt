One of the greatest films to come out of the 80s, Dirty Dancing was a low budget movie with high budget returns. With a soundtrack that gets you up and dancing, to a love story that we all want us to live (at least if you're a woman), it's a movie you want to see over and over again. <br /> <br /> The music that drives the movie is optimistic and flows well with the emotions drawn from the viewer. From classic 60s hits like "Love Man" by Otis Redding and "Big Girls Do Not Cry" by Frankie Valli to pure 80s hits like Eric Carmens "Hungry Eyes" and Frank Zappacosta's overload, Dirty Dancing is a mix of fun and sensual, showing the transformation of a young girl from shy teen to a thriving femininity, all against the beautiful backdrop of a summer romance that we all hope and desire becomes more. <br /> <br /> Dancing in "Dirty Dancing" must not be forgotten. Cynthia Rhodes shines in her role as Penny, a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and light gymnasts. Patrick Swayze does more than a fantastic job and shows more and more of his abilities, not only as an actor, but dances and songs as well. And Jennifer Gray shines like Baby, while her dance transformation also shows her transformation in status. <br /> <br /> All in all, Dirty Dancing is one of the best movies all the time and worth seeing at least once. It is doubtful that the first turn of Ronette's "Be My Baby" in the opening title will not cheat your attention and attract you to a magical world of sensual dance and musical enchantment.
