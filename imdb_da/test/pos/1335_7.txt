"Strike Force" or "The Librarians" is a fun action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. William Forsythe stars as Simon, seeking a missing daughter of a wealthy client. He meets Sandi (Erika Eleniak), who is also looking for some sister. But there are evil evil guys. The most evil of them all is Marcos Canarious (Andrew Divoff). Marcos likes to kill people. So now, Simon and Sandi have to stop to bring the villain down. The whole cast is amazing, with Divoff stealing the movie. There are also cameos by Ed Lauter and Burt Reynolds.
