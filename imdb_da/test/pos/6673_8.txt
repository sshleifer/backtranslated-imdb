If you like movies that make you think, this is definitely one of the good ones. I always liked David Lynch and Cronenberg. They have always made high quality films. <br /> <br /> Iain Softley has great K-PAX. The film tears in the emotions and philosophy of mind and the world. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges both provide outstanding capabilities. It caught me, I didn't take my eyes off the screen under the film. On the other hand, if you're hoping for a special effect sci-fi movie, it's not for you. The story is a little drawn, which can be a bit boring, but also acts as a way to build the film's theme. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this movie, I did ..
