This movie is pretty good, it's actually like a good wine, it gets better the more you see it. The pace is pretty slow for such a high octane subject, but the cinematography is beautiful and surreal. There is a cool blue tint that "rides" the entire movie. There is also a great achievement in Gabriel Casseus' performance of the character "Midget". He's amazing. Why doesn't this guy work any more? If the movie got better support, he would probably have it.
