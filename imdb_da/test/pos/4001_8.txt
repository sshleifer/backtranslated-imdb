Chi-hwa seo (Painted Fire) tells the Korean painter Jang Seong-ub's life in the changing political landscape of 19th-century Korea. <br /> <br /> But the themes of this movie center are about the process of artistic creation through the artist's fire and expectations and demands from their audience and community. <br /> <br /> Jang Seong-UB is masterfully played as a complex character, changing from the innocent excitement of the youth to a hardened alcoholic tortured soul. This characterization reflects the young avid artist who finds it increasingly difficult to invoke the spirit of artistic creation in itself without letting the creative fire out through drink, erections and desire. Although this character development continues overall through the film, Jang's emotional complexity is still played in a constant oscillating way, based on the film's finale. Interestingly, montage of the film in parallel to this ever-changing and apparently wild feeling or fire of the artist as scenes is smooth transition from time and place to another without any conventional "cues" to the audience that such a scene change will occur. For example, many scenes will appear to change in the middle of the conversation when they are recorded at another location and location. <br /> <br /> The film's visual scenery is beautifully presented and also oscillates from strong (and perhaps gloomy) black and white scenery to more colorful and vibrant environments, again parallel to Jang's paintings either in simple black ink on white paper or with added Colour. Color bugs into the movie on points that the artist observes nature and especially women who are then reflected in his paintings. <br /> <br /> The theme of an artist's individual desire to create against society's expectations and demands arises in the movie through various points, including class distinction, government dominance over the artist, the accepted norms of artistic elites, and the basic desires of the common lots. Instead of creating his own completely original works, Jang finds himself most to recreate masterpieces by other artists throughout East Asia. The question thus arises if recreation itself deserves artistic profit. <br /> <br /> I wish I was more familiar with the political events of the period to firmly understand how they tied to history - but beyond any comparison with the current Korean government's role in artistic expression and / or censorship I can't comment. <br /> <br /> All in all, an extremely well-recorded movie and cinematography are often breathtaking. A good movie to watch and then consider.
