I love movies that take you into them. A movie that actually gives you the feeling of weakness when it is over and this kind of movie is rare. <br /> <br /> Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways to write and depict various characters on the screen. This movie has a cutting edge to it. A main stream cast for such a low budget. Why is it that a man with this great talent and charisma (not to mention sex complaints in ways other than most other actors) can do this with so little money working with ????? These actors really believe in his script and raw talent as director, author and actor. I am so happy to know that such a modern genius is out there, to be passionate about Art driving him and taking us as an audience with him. Damian I've heard about you through so many different circles and don't let the jealous people in this world come to you. Martin gets it, Fellini got it and you will always get it. The fire and passion in you is what we love to see on the screen. Thank you for being different and having a hard time writing as you do. You're one of a kind director, don't listen to the empty vessels.
