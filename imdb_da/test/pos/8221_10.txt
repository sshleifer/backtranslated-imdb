I watched this show on TV and lost it. My daughter played it over and over again. I borrowed at work and everyone just loved it. It's just brilliant physical comedy. Bill found a look here in California (he worked and lived in New York) and performed Flight of Flight on stage. I was able to take my daughter and her boyfriend to see this brilliant performance. Bill was assigned a federal endowment and my daughter wrote him a greeting card and Bill was kind enough to write her a note back and attach a photo. <br /> <br /> People ask me, and I can't decide if he's a comedian, actor, or clown. In fact, he is all three. I really want this to be on DVD, my tape is lost.
