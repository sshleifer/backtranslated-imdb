There are two ways to make a TV series a movie. <br /> <br /> The first, most common and least successful one is to base a television episode with functional length - see the disasters in Steptoe & Son movies. The other is to do something else - something completely different, Ã  la Monty Python. Fortunately, the creators of the cult TV series have gone to the second option and they have come up with something unique, clever and fun - it couldn't feel less like a television episode. Try to get your head around this - the authors playing themselves confronted with their Royston Vasey alter egos, played, of course, by them and told to continue writing the series, otherwise the apocalypse will come across the village. <br /> <br /> High concept, designed and easy to screw up? Yes, but somehow it managed to get it off. Not for everyone, perhaps, and the end draws, but fans will be happy and it can even win over the uninitiated.
