This is a really good girl with great humor. Jim Verney who we know was very good with facial expressions and demonstrates a lot of it in this movie. This is definitely the best of the Ernest movies. I would definitely recommend it to any Ernest fan out there. I find myself having good taste in movies and I'm sure someone will enjoy this movie. In the movie (Ernest) 2 roles, bad guy and good guy playing them pretty well. I really enjoy the exaggeration of humor where things just seem impossible, as in the naked pistol movies, for example, and there is plenty of it in this movie. I bought this movie right after I saw it. Good management, good script, worth renting.
