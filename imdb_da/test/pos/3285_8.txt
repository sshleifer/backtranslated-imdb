This was a pretty good episode. Although there was no "catch in the closet" or "cartoon wars", it had many things to do for it. Al Gore's character and the bizarre-like-hell "super grain" thing were beautiful darn fun. But the scene that made me love this episode was one I am sure everyone would agree was one of the greatest Cartman / Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious by Kyle, he will steal his gold (which, of course, is fake!) And he comes within inches of his face. Suddenly, Kyle wakes up and they have the crazy conversation where Cartman is trying to act as everything is fine. Cartman crapping out the treasure at the end, although predictable, was pretty much fun.
