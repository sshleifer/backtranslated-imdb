Anyone who has ever wondered how to make a film without a budget should see this documentary. The provision of all the portraits in this project was very moving for me and should connect to those of us who have ever ventured into any part of show business, be it movie, music or writing. I think the filmmakers could have done a better job of foreshadowing the events that led to the film becoming a documentary, perhaps using a narrator; Apart from that, the movie comes out as a true example of how show business is not about the "show", but rather "business". I hope that the actual planned project "Repo Man II" will see the light of day. I think the filmmakers did a good job of how little they had to work with and everything they had to overcome to complete it.
