From gone you will not be able to see away and you will not. "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya" (Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu) is one of the most entertaining anime I've seen for a long time. If you can look away from the crazy and sometimes perverse humor, it is easy to find an excellently constructed and masterfully done work. Part of the spectacle comes from the fact that the episodes are not in chronological order, so you may not understand some of the things they are talking about at first, but as the series progresses, you find yourself and say "ah, so that's what they thought! " Although this may confuse some people, after seeing the show, it will be hard pressed to make a case of telling the story this way. After all the focus is on the characters. The title character, Haruhi Suzumiya, is by far one of the most eccentric heroic moods of any anime ever. Her opening speech to her class in which she declares that she is "not interested in normal people" and is searching for "espers, aliens and time travelers" is quite bizarre, but she is lovable that way. <br /> <br /> There is Kyon, the "normal" guy pulled into the madness around Suzumiya-san. He is the narrator, and his quick humor always makes the scene much more entertaining. He finds himself trapped in the midst of various factions, all of which attempt to influence Haruhi Suzumiya, and the other three characters are representatives of these factions. Ironically, they are the very creatures that Haruhi is looking for, yet they cannot reveal to her. <br /> <br /> The first is Yuki Nagato, a quiet girl who happens to be the only member of the school. , and also a representative of Integration Thought Entity; She is basically a stranger, although the best description of her is a computer program in a human body. Her purely numb reactions make her comically deadpan and always make you believe there is more than meeting the eye. Then there is Mikuru Asahina, the time traveler who gets incredibly sweet, a big ditz and the subject of Suzumiya's plans to advertise his club, SOS Brigade, to the world. The end result is that Suzumiya does things for her who borders on sexual harassment and makes her dress up in fetish uniforms. The final character is Koizumi Itsuki, the modest and eternally optimistic philosopher who is Haruhi's "esper", though he can only use his powers under certain conditions. The end result of all these characters is a comedy as opposed to everyone else who is both raw and deep and always brilliant. Don't believe me? See the first episode, their "student movie". You will see what I mean.
