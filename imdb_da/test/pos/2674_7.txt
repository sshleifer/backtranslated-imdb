As for the Christian film, it is typical. Playing a mega budget they try their best. Sometimes, short, sometimes the cursor falls. This one almost hit, big acting can only carry a movie so far. A combination of H.P. Lovecraft and Frank Peretti were a good idea. All that was needed was better back story and better character development to make it a great movie. The visions are not so bad, also wise attitude of the demons until the last few minutes helped keep the tension at a good pace. Can be used for a better end. Not a bad condition to have terrorists trying to go wrong. Much better than typical Hollywood treatment about the demonic world. Perhaps someone will finally make "This Present Darkness" as a movie.
