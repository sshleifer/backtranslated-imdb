If you're looking for a movie that doesn't take itself seriously ... than Haggard is for you. I have to say before I write any more that if you haven't seen any of CKY (Camp Kill Yourself) videos than the movie probably won't be so funny. My advice is to watch a few clips of the videos that Bam and his friends made. Haggard is not serious at all, and that was never the purpose. Throughout the movie, you have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot, which can be annoying, but it's not out of control. Even through everything, the plot gets focused and the story of Ryan Dunn's character unfolds quite nicely. This story I have been told is based on a true story (mostly) by Ryan Dunn's ex-girlfriend. Brandon Dicamillo is by far the best character in the movie. He has a lot of talent and knows how to make people laugh. He stole the movie if you ask me. All in all, I love this movie for its simplicity and right up to wildness. It's a Bam movie people, it's not going to be normal. Haggard is filled with funny quotes, which my friends and I have constantly used since the first time we saw it. I've seen the movie 6-7 times and still find new things every time. The soundtrack is just as good. Everything from Gnar Kill to New Order and some techno. Just don't go into the movie with high expectations, let it all unfold and judge it for what it is.
