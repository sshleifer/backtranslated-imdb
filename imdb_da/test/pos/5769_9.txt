A sign of what to expect in this movie came when I found out that this was the first (and probably the last) movie that had a "Vomit Technician" in its credits. <br /> <br /> In what is a few hours of stupid gags, hilarious violence and excellent slapstick humor. <br /> <br /> This movie was just what you would expect from Bottom boys, and it's great to see them back in their best shape after Rich Mayall's life threatening accident. <br /> <br /> Richie (Mayall) and Eddie (Edmondson) are too similar to their Bottom characters if we have no criticism at all, and Edmondson does a surprisingly good job of managing the movie as well. <br /> <br /> This movie has already created the predictable comparisons with Fawlty Towers that just aren't there and Guest House Paradiso itself is hardly Torquay! <br /> <br /> Beware of some highly crafted dialogue among all violence and chaos. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Bottom, you'll probably hate this - but I loved it.
