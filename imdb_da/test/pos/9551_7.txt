Man, I really enjoyed this if it was only Fred Willard's comment on the dog show. There are some dead spots and some gags that do not work, but generally the film works very well. When I was younger, my parents broke dogs, and the people I met at these shows were not significantly less bizarre, freaks at this show, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie for its art and for its comments on how we usually take foolish things too seriously ... I enjoyed the play for its accuracy (most accents were flawless) and its subtlety (I loved the way each person went their dogs) ... <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if you have an appreciation for human existence.
