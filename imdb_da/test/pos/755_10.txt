Charlotte Beal arrives at an isolated country's mental hospital to become a full-time nurse there. She is confronted with a modley group of crazies and a seemingly crazier guideline. Is Dr. Masters everything she seems to be? <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE IN THE BASEMENT, is one of the best low-budget movies in the genre, and why people always put it down on me. The action is excellent, my favorite performance is by Betty Chandler as Allyson nymphomaniac. Chillers just jump right out of the screen. You may not say "It's just a movie, it's just a movie", it's not that scary, but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre that I do. It is very difficult to make a grim movie on a low budget and few actually succeed. AX is another cheap movie that is looked down on. Perhaps people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that does not have excellent effects and / or is not considered a classic does not have a chance with an audience. But I think that when people watch this movie, they'll see how important the low-budget horror genre is, and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other nonsense.
