You have to be terribly patient to sit through a movie with one-liners so flat and creepy that you wonder what it all was about as WHISTLING IN THE DARK opened for such an enthusiastic audience from the 1940s. <br /> <On the top of some weak one-liners and regular sight gags, the plot is as far as the stories Fox (Red Skelton) tells his radio audience. You have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a lifeless solution to how to commit the perfect crime and get rid of it. But then it is so unrealistic that the comedy is. <br /> <br /> But - if you are a true Red Skelton fan and look back at how comedies were made in the '40s - at least you can enjoy the gracious caste that supports him. Ann Rutherford and Virginia Gray do well as his love, and Conrad Veidt, as always, makes an interesting villain. One of his more entertaining moments is his reaction to Skelton, which explains the mysteries of wearing turbans. "I never knew," he murmurs, impressed by a minor point that is wisely introduced. <br /> All in all, there is typically nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the gags as they are. Not always easy for a discriminating viewer, as many of them simply fall, the way many comedies in this era do, because the news of sight gags and one-liners has simply worn off.
