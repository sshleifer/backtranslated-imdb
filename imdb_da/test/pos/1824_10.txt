It was 1983 and I was 13. I saw Valley Girl on HBO one night when my parents worked. After that I ended up talking to someone about it right away. It turns out my best friend also looked at it and it became our favorite movie. Every weekend after that we looked at it until we could recite it. We woke her parents up late at night and laughed hysterically. We started worshiping the main character Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I'm not saying it's a great classic. Although it is for me personally. And I understand that the whole Valley Girl speaker gets annoying, but it was the 80s. But deep down in the heart of the film - it's a love story and a well-known but good. The girl meets with boy and there are sparks from both sides, an instant connection. Julie's friends don't like him - he doesn't fit in, doesn't go to their school, doesn't have the money. They like her better with her ex-boyfriend football player, even though he's a dunk. She makes the ultimate sacrifice - her own happiness for her friends' happiness. And she has these really cool, supportive hippie parents. It's one of Nicholas Cage's first films and his first starring role. One minute he is absolutely fun and the next incredibly touching and romantic. His friend Fred is also quite funny. If you were a teenager in the 80s, you'll love this movie or at least it will bring back memories. It's no longer my favorite movie, but it's still one of my favorites, probably in my top 10. I'm eagerly waiting for it to be released on DVD, if ever released. You can go to Deborah Foreman's website to sign a petition to have it published on DVD, and there are 2 soundtracks from the movie to have if you like 80's music.
