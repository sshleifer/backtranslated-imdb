Back in the 70s, a small Texas filmmaker is called S.F. Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget running-in movies, which apparently have developed a little cult subsequently over the years. Before I look at his first movie, Don't Look In The Basement, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I was sure that hell didn't expect it to be the only Texas horror I thought was better than the chainsaw Massacre. I don't know, this can actually be my all-time favorite horror movie. <br /> <br /> We begin in an isolated insane asylum. Initially, it seems that it is a fairly secluded place to get mentally healthy, as all patients are allowed to wander around freely and anything, as if it were their house (I think it is). none of them all seem so dangerous, only misleading. The residents include a love-nympho, a 700-year-old woman, a male child, a spaz, a guy who thinks he is in a war, a woman who thinks she has a baby and a guy who thinks that he is a judge. In one day, the judge kills the doctor with an ax, shortly after, the stupid baby mother will kill the nurse. Ten minutes in the movie, and things look really ugly. Maybe the new nurse will know what to do, so again, maybe not. Giving away more would do more harm than good. It is best to jump your head first into this, knowing as little as possible. If you can appreciate honest-to-God, incredible horror, then you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you liked Scream, if you liked Wrong Turn, if you go to the unoriginal, overproduced, over-scoring digital Hollywood waste then chances are great, you just don't want to see the beauty of this. Don't look in the basement because it's a first try, making the quality more shocking. The atmosphere and grain fit into the location and score as a glove. Unfortunately good ol 'S.F. exhausted most of his good ideas on his first movie, although the next post in his corporate quadrilogy in Texas is something of a masterpiece, that is, if you are in an extra blurry, medieval, Hixploitation like someone I know. If you fall in love with Brownriggs first two and definitely have to find out what else he had to offer, check out Don't open the door and the house where hell is freezing. Don't look in the basement has everything that needs successfully, no stars, no budget, no digital effects, just an original story that was created for life in a crazy asylum, with a dozen throwing members and a gloomy, subtle score and of course twist. This is real horror for the real horror fan. 10.10
