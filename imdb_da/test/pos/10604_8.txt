I first saw this movie in a video store, and it was the Bam Margera fan I had to rent to see what it was all about. Since I have a big and stupid (note the word stupid) sense of humor, I found this movie absolutely fun. Some of the parts are meaningless and random, but it makes them so entertaining. You have to think things like being beaten in the face and bashed upside down with a watermelon is fun to appreciate this movie. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by the actor. These people actually did a good job. No Oscar worthy, but good enough to get past the amateur level. Teenagers and young adults will probably find this more entertaining because of the modern snake and the situations used. I would not suggest seeing this with your parents and vice versa. <br /> <br /> All in all, the play was amazing, the script was fun, and the story is really something you can relate to.
