What makes this better than most "movie films" is that it doesn't feel fake. The film is the story of the head instructor and his ascent and fall and rise by using real recognizable names and events during the quiet and early sound heat. Instead of the generic "sound will put us out of business", they actually show Jolson and "The Jazz Singer". The action is really quite good, with credible performances from especially Don Ameche, Alice Faye and J. Edward Bromberg.
