I had seen this movie before, but I couldn't remember that it was so amazing: it has a fun plot, Madonna fumbles around the city with pumas, etc. That causes a rebellion. And the music is just perfect! And the happy end! Who is the girl is a good choice for a romantic like me. In my opinion, it could be the best Madonna movie I've ever seen! 10.10
