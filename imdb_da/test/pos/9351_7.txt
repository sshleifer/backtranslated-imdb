** SPOILERS ** Actually based on the short story "The Brick Foxhole" about a gay man murdered by a GI on vacation due to his sexual orientation. The film "Crossfire" is about a violent anti-Semitic GI, which because of its own mistakes and frustrations in life takes it beyond the Jewish persuasion. Who he obviously feels threatened by. <br /> <br /> Get yourself refueled at a local ginmill in DC barley, beginner American serviceman Montgomrey, Robert Ryan, stains Joseph Samuel, Sam Leven, and begins to get a little too sarcastic, kind with him. It seems that Montgomery is a little ticked on Samuels because he speaks to his best friend and GI friend Arthur Mitchell, George Cooper. Samuel also goes through, as Neanderthal Montgomery cannot, to the sensitive young GI who is in the art, he is an artist and painter on the outside, about war, the Second World War that just ended. In addition to the appalling peace, if that is what it is with the atomic bomb, it now follows in this very dangerous and unstable world. What really exclaims Montgomery more than anything else about Samuels is that of course he is Jewish. The more than anything else is probably the reason why racist Montgomery will do Samuels. Samules invites Mitchell to join him and his lady friend Miss. Lewis, Marlow Dwyer, in his apartment for having a few drinks and continuing the very deep and stimulating conversation they started at the bar. This has one that seems very jealous and feels hurt and rejected Montgomery with his also effortless, but somewhat obscure, in which Montgomery's plans for Samuels are friend and colleague GI Floyd Bowers, Steve Brodie, later that night undamaged to Samuel's. place. <br /> <br /> With the party ending, with Mitchell and Miss Lewis away, the two very drunk GIs collided with the uncertain spot. The fact that Samuels, in Montgomery's sick and anti-Semitic mind, stole Mitchell away from him, had him whip up in a white hot madness. Montgomery and Bowers break into Samuel's home and steer their well-stacked liquor with Montgomery and take a couple of slings against Samuel's strong objections to Samuel's very expansive and refined wines and spirits, which are very unlike the water and cheap splashes that the creepy Montgomery is accustomed to guzzling. This soon leads to a violent and brutal attack on Samuels by the angry psychotic and drunk Montgomery, with Bowers cold on the couch from all the spirits he consumes, killing the poor and innocent man. <br /> <br /> The movie "Crossfire" goes so long and dull as it is obvious from the start who Samuels' killer is, examining why Samuels a wounded and decorated second world war veteran who got the purple heart in battle by Okinawa, was murdered by Montgomery acting as though he was really interested, yes sure to find Samuel's killer who is in fact himself. This so-called voluntary action on Montgomery's side to remove suspicions for himself that he may be the man who killed him. <br /> <br /> Montgomery is so ridiculous and even for a person who smugly considers himself to be very smart, stupid in him constantly opening up his great yap and spitting out anti-Semitic and racist epitaphs and slurs about those murdered Samuels! It only throws suspicion on himself and no one else. I guess I don't think Montgomery murdered Samuels, who in his sick mind was one of them, he even murdered his friend, it scared to death, being implicated in Samuel's murder, Bowers! Who in Montgomery's racist thinking is one of "us"! Just because he was scared, Bowers wanted to talk to the police to save his own spoiled throat and thus focus on Montgomey in Samuel's death. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take so long after the detective on Capt's case. Finlay, Robert Young, to look through Montgomery's obvious lie and deception and then set up by having another GI "friend" of his Leroy (William Phipps) who was rammed by all his stupid and racist hillbilly jokes, put it arrogant creep. This has brought Montgomery back to his crime scene, where he murdered Bowers, where a trap was set up for him. That was all Capt. Finlay needed to get Montgomery to panic when Montgomery saw that the jig was up and running for it right into the intersection of a police ambush. <br /> <br /> Dating a little now but very hard hit back in 1947 when it was released. "Crossfire" dealt with the horrors of anti-Semitism when, at that time, it was held under the covers and out of sight of almost every post-WWII Hollywood film about the racism in the United States and Europe. Even after World War II and with what happened to the Jews in it. When it should have gotten the very full and honest exponent that the film came publicly, it so legitimately deserved.
