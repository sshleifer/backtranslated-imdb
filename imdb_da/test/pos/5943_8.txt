What a pleasure. This is really a parody. Only French people can do such things without being coarse. And as a result, you spend a really good time watching Jean Dujardin play the stupid. Most of the film is on his shoulders and he has them wide enough to make this movie a good one. He has the perfect way to exaggerate James Bond's kind of guy that he's not a match for Mike Meyers in Austin Powers for example. The dialogues are also good enough to watch the audience's attention, with many silly jokes, it's really perfect. Both women, who have the bulk of the film, carry the comparison with the protagonist, and that was a challenge. There is no real plot in this movie, but that's not what is expected in this kind of movie. You just want to laugh for an hour 40 minutes, and that's exactly what the movie manages to do. It deserves the success it has in France
