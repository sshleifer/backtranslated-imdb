Good (not big) little horror movie with a high "creep" factor (not confused with a 1991 movie with the same name or the latest (2001) Campfire STORIES). Key stories of stranded teens that tell ghost stories about a bonfire in ghost forests nicely engage and link the various stories that make up the bulk of the movie (Watch for Ron Livingston (Office Space, Band of Brothers) and Jennifer MacDonald in a spirited, sexy segment ("honeymoon")). Solid-acting and a couple of really "scary" moments make this an over-average cooler. A good example of interesting history line combined with quality ensemble deals results in a whole larger than the sum of its parts. The "surprise" end of the main story adds a nice twist, though some may see it coming. Movies are not available on DVD, but are available on VHS.
