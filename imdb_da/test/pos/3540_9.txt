I have to say when it comes to Book to Movie Adaptations, the BBC rarely brings me down. Now concerning this mini-series. I love Starling Roman, it's by far the best murder / mystery I've ever read. The mini series, it did in a day when I saw it. The primary story was kept close to completely intact. The characters match them to the novel very well, the personalities and the ways were spot on for Red and Jez. I thought Duncan was doing very well, as was Kate, Eric came out as too much of a simplistic character, he had a little more depth in the book, but they also changed his sub-story so it might have been dealing with it. Of course there are changes, but most are cosmetic, but some I found disappointing in, the underworld with Eric's murder charge changed, and it changed the whole dynamics between Red and Eric to the movie, and they cut out the Triathalon training Jez did. Some of the other events in the book are changing to be perceptible. If you liked the book, you would like this if you like the mini-series and you will love the book. I have to say this is the most accurate book for movie adaptation I've seen.
