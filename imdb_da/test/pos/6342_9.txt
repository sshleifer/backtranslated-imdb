At first glance of this mini ... I was a little disappointed that Tommy Lee Jones and Anjelica Huston did not return to the cast. Both John Voight and Barbara Hershey did commendable jobs, replacing very important characters for the continuing saga of this legendary Epic Western. <br /> <br /> Cherokee Jack Jackson (Haysbert) played an excellent poor guy and Louis Gossett Jr. was as always true to form with his excellent plays. <br /> <br /> The drama that worked right in life in many scenes, including one of the best where the bold shoot-out ended with Ranger Walker being killed made me feel like I actually was in the movie. Back to Lonesome Dove was for me, almost up to the quality of the first of the series. The next 2 follow-ups with James Garner as Call just didn't do it for me. And that Lorena marries peas? How did it do in theirs? It was a total mismatch of characters. The first 2 of the series made the Epic story, the next 2 were in no way of the same quality. <br /> <br /> Now, if the first 2 could be remastered in Dolby Digital and an Anamorphic presentation, the movies could be where they should have been like today's movies.
