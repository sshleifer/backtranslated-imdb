During the Civil War, a wounded Union soldier hides in an isolated Confederate women's school; where the head mistress and school teacher decides to take care of him and keep him on until trouble begins to brew between the lonely and sexually frustrated women and girls. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but it comes at a price eventually. <br /> <br /> "Dirty Harry (1971)" (made about the same time for "The Beguiled") may be my favorite collaboration between Eastwood and Siegel, but after seeing this, I tend to Think about this being the couple's finest work together. A very atypical, wise and stylish vehicle for Eastwood is always on the field with richly controlled direction by Don Siegel and a joking musical score by Lalo Schifrin. Standing out is its sultrily lurid and gloomy nature, which is intrusively planted into the film's psychological makeup and manipulative stifling team in sexual depravity. It becomes playful gameplay and makes it more charcoal and blood-shedding when these random shocks and bad intentions address gripping tensions. The way Siegel illustrates John B Sherry and Grimes Grice's astonishingly bold, slow-burning manuscript (taken from Thomas Cullinan's novel) is effectively accomplished through strong emotions and the script's tight lyrical context. Siegel's strong direction captures the idyllic southern Victorian setting with such heavily garnished photography and he poses some odd piercings with great clarity and restraint. <br /> <br /> While the show is truly commendable and high in quality. Clint Eastwood as the smoothly suave, sweet talked chameleon union soldier is very impressionable and delightfully secured. A deeply prominent Geraldine Page steals the image as the tough head mistress and the elegant Elizabeth Hartman adds a delicate sincerity to her innocent character. Mae Mercer is highly tailored as the black girl and Jo Ann Harris is picking up the crop from the young students with her seductive dull persona. <br /> <br /> Honestly, while Eastwood's charismatic character plays the ground for his own selfish needs, there are still mixed intentions that one is played (where rivalry between women creeps in) turns out to be no better than theirs. guest at the end. Everywhere there is a perverted dark sense of humor and ironic touch that fits into the material. What is demonstrated here is simply more than your basic little minded shocker, but one that is thickly layered with intrigue and a realism that is hard to shake. It also applies to its extremely scary title and final song. <br /> <br /> An effective chilling, low key player that is hard to be tempted by the fluctuating hospitality.
