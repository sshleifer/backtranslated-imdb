The first full-length movie featuring the Aardman characters Wallace and Gromit manages to include elements from the entire previous half-hour show broadcast on television. <br /> <br /> Wallace operates a human trafficking rabbit company from people's vegetable gardens, and has the bright idea of ​​trying its invention on the miserable rabbits when trapped. Of course, as in other Wallace and Gromit films, it doesn't work as planned. <br /> <br /> Like a close shave, there is a love interest for Wallace, in this case Lady Posh village, and a large average villain with a bullish dog. Gromit is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions that make the character laugh incredibly fun. And of course, Peter Sallis gives Wallace's voice again and is a perfect fit. <br /> <br /> And, as in a Grand Day Out, the cheese has a great comedy effect as the film moves together. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, this movie is a bit on the long side. There are great effects and some pieces that make you sit up and see, but perhaps this story would have worked better as another short topic rather than pushing it to feature length.
