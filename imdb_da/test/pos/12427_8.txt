I saw this on Zone horror and fully expected to be competitive like most of the movies they play, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie revolves around 2 friends and a lunatic in a monster truck chasing them (I know it sounds crap, but it's actually pretty good), the movie is scary when it comes to being and laughing a lot of fun in parts (and not in an unintentional way, it is well paced and is very fun as well as being very gory, there are some very funny black humor thrown in as well. It is not the most original movie but so what.And your after Shakespeare so This is not it if your after a fun movie then it should be fine
