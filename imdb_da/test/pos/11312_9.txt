This movie was a revolt, it pokes fun of "Madonna - Truth Or Dare" in all the right places. I love Madonna & I love Julie Brown. How could I ask for more. Julia's spoof of "Vogue" titled "Vague" was hysterical. "Kelly LeBrock thinks she's great, she's just cold boogers on a paperboard". "Brooke Shields, Dawber, Pam Personality Spam" !! I could be dead! And just wait until you see what she can do with a watermelon !!
