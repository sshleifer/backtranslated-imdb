I first saw it on January 5, 2009, and after a day I saw it again and I want to see it again. Love everything (well, almost like 9 stars) about it. No color, beautiful naive stories, funny gangsters, Anna, camera work, music. Well, sometimes you just want to listen a little longer and the music just stops. But that is not something musical. I like Anna's acting, this naive wannabe gangster girl, how she speaks, keeps the gun, everything makes me smile. No, it's not so much fun, even though I have suffered for a few moments, it's just so subtle. Excellent work by Samuel Benchetrit. Although 3d nouvelle seems weaker, but they are also gangsters, perhaps even worse because they steal ideas. And the last scene is my favorite. Make me so warm and romantic. Yes, I would recommend this movie to the romantic souls with a taste for such artistic films. And I do not agree with those who compare it to Pulp Fiction. It's not about action and twisted history, though all vignettes intersect. It's quiet, and maybe too slow for most people. It's about characters, their emotions, very subtle. Anyway, probably this review won't be of much help to anyone (my first), just wanted to express my appreciation. SPOILER: This movie does not have a Goof section. Excuse me, did anyone not find that hand in the second part when the kidnappers decided to go home? It looks like a part of the crew, hehe. I know I should better write this in forums, but I do not agree with some policies here.
