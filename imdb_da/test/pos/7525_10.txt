The brilliant Chuck Jones, head of the Warner Bros comic book, brings us the first (?) Pepe LePew cartoon. A coastal cat who is tired of being pushed around paints in a skunks color and with a healthy dose of Limburger turns the tables on his ailments. Then comes Pepe and you know the rest.

But the kicker is the end where Pepe is revealed to be an American "wolf in skunk's clothes"! A must see! Classic Warner Bros ...
