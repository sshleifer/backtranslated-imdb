I just called my brother Paulie on the phone and he said he was looking at Hood's and it was fun. So, as I said, never go against the family! The demand for more lines is ok, as I would like to express my own opinions quite often. If something is misspelled, it is most likely my vision and not my brain. This gives me another chance to take my shot at "The Departed". When you know exactly what should happen in the last scene without prior knowledge, it usually means that it was not so exciting. All you need is a good director, the same guy I think made my favorite movie, "Goodfellows", but in a completely different way. And just throw Jack the big one and you got yourself an Oscar. Easy as pie. I need to see hoods to make sure it wasn't better than "The Departed" Gibbs
