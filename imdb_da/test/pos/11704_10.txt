<br /> <br /> Crackerjack, starring Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy - both parts of the role of the 90's Saturday night comedy show "The Late Show", Bill Hunter, an Australian film icon and John Clarke, which we still watch regularly on Australian television alongside Brian Dawe. Crackerjack is about a guy in his early 30s (Jack Simpson, played by Mick Malloy) who pays his annual memebership at the local bowls club to be able to get a few parking places where he uses himself and rents out to others like cheap indoor parking. <br /> <br /> The club falls on hard times and pulls all the resources and memebers together, so Jack can get a phone call telling him to turn up until next Saturday's bowls match or lose his membership (and hence his parking space) < br /> <br /> I don't want to ruin the rest, but the movie is fun, light hearted and contains everything a good aussie movie needs. <br /> <br /> If you are not Australian, some of the jokes and humor will no doubt baffle you if you are an Aussie - do yourself a favor and sit down for Crackerjack .. Its now available on DVD, I already have my copy! <br /> <br /> 10/10 .. Awesome flick! <br /> <br />
