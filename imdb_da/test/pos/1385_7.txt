"Planet" is an amazing piece of film making. For just Â£ 8,000, Stirton Production has shown one of the most original sci-fi movies for a long time. <br /> <br /> With the physically scary Mike Mitchell, the movie is a blend of amazing special effects, powerful storytelling and well-planned action. From the opening room to the pounding finale, everything about this movie looks good beyond the budget. <br /> <br /> To start with the special effects, but certainly not the "Revenge Of The Sith" standard, they are on par, if not over, like Babylon 5 and Farscape. And for a sneak of a price as well. The detail and movement are amazing and captures the imagination from the off. Designed by everything, ships, weapons, units are something else. The imagination and creativity involved is a real surprise to a movie of this budget. <br /> <br /> Another surprise was the strength of the story and the bow required. There are a few twists and turns, most of which are well written in the manuscript, surprisingly and well played. I was surprised at how relevant some aspects of history are to today's society, two years ago and first imagined 15 years ago. With the events around the world, there may be some resonance with the lengths that the mercenaries are forced to go to survive. Even the sound effects are spot on, as is the atmospheric music. The use of light and costume adds to the professional look. Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen sees a deserted and lonely place. <br /> <br /> This movie looks frankly at 10, if not 100 times, the budget used, and it is a testament to a creative, hard-working team of people from the director, to the cast, to the effects of the producer and sound mixer. Wonderful effort, I recommend that you get your hand on a copy of ASAP
