I've been a fan of Rachael since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I've seen her grow over the years. The moment I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen because I saw how Oprah was with her and for good reason: she comes across as very natural and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. The set is appealing and there are some fresh ideas (I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on). There is just enough of a celebrity segment and she stays away from controversy and debates (there's plenty of it during the daytime TV). The show is a fast-paced escape, and she has not moved away from her strength (cooking), which is very good planning. I know there are people who hate her and hate her show; It's okay, you can't please everyone. And somehow I think Rachael knows and accepts it. Then just turn the channel; I don't think she'd mind it.
