It is possible to have a good time with this movie while regretting all that it is not. In the 1980s, a raffish US Congressman (Tom Hanks) supports engineers for Afghan partisans who oppose the Soviet Union. Hanks is in breezy hail-with-well-met shape like roguish, politically incorrect Charlie Wilson, first splitting a hot tub with three deeply-available beautiful women. If only the film had the same air of incompleteness; but apart from Philip Seymour Hoffman's turn as a cynical CIA agent, it also attempts to be perceived as patriotic. Aaron Sorkin's trademark staccato dialogue serves its purpose, but the story is no more plausible than one of Wilson's tall tales. And there is a strange unspoken subtitle: Wilson's Afghan friends later mutated into the Taliban and other anti-Western groups and left the world worse than it was when those events occurred.
