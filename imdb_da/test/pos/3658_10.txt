In a word ... magical. And so incredibly real. Vijay Raaz is so incredibly raw, so incredibly vulnerable that you just want his characters to succeed no matter what he does. And he plays Hari Om impeccably - from his perfect "Bollywood e-shtyle" to his awkward, shy way with a first kiss. He is a truly gifted actor and I would not hesitate to see him in anything because he brings it all to life and gives it a soul. Camille Natta is absolutely beautiful. It took a little time for me to warm up to her - possibly because she plays the role of an ignorant but fascinated tourist as well. Her transition really became her, and she cast very well into her role. Even the man you love to hate, her boyfriend Benoit, was wonderful, even though you never really like him for the foam he plays, Jean-Marie Lamour creates a perfect cad. The scripture is so genuine. I found myself repeating to my friend repeatedly throughout the film to say, "That's exactly what's happening in India! They nailed it!" Very real, very raw. Very bittersweet, but you certainly leave the theater feeling fulfilled. Music by Nitin Sawhney is wonderful and goes perfectly with the constantly changing mood. But Vijay Raaz ... I find myself constantly coming back to him - because he's what makes this movie. He's the hero, the most charming, disarming rickshaw driver you'll ever encounter - he's magical. A lovely, genuine, sweet, incredibly talented actor that I can't wait to see shine and succeed in Bollywood, Hollywood or anywhere!
