'Blade' would be an extremely above average cartoon, vampire hunter / horror if it were not for two minor errors. # 1 I loved watching everything-but invincible Blade / Snipes make his cutting and dicing, but the whole "yes!" The fist / punch was literally a letdown. # 2 Bad, no makes it terrible, CGI ?? even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some steps everywhere. Okay, despite the minor violations, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburban job and the fact that this looks like yet another 'Matrix' rip-off is fun considering this came out a year earlier. So maybe 'The Matrix' copied 'Blade'. In any case, it is a great movie for several genre-loving audiences: cartoon genes, action fanatics and horror / vampire lovers. So, we have magazines, half-halves / half-vampires, or "day-hikers" and his performance, Whisler (a la "Batman and Alfred") is fighting the undead, apparently almost telling people. There you can just see? In a rare humanity (Blade is more of an antihero) our sword ninja / vamp rescues a newly infected (random) blood specialist / doctor. In the meantime, the problems among the vampires you want (you guessed it) break the highest power and need Blade somehow to achieve it. It is not the most original concept if you read what I just wrote, but still very comfortable. You want to see Blade succeed, you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms. And you want to know what's coming this is the typical action 1-2-3 in a comic book introduction movie. Still watch this without trying to go too deep. Such as Vampire SPF-1000 "Sunburned Lotion"? Really? What about the scalp? Wouldn't it still burn? Like the money they burn for weapons? Okay, I'm going too deep. Once again, sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride.
