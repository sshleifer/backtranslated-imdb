Yes, I'm sentimental, and yes, I love movies where children are the better people. True, the climber has some logical or even plot deficiencies. These are more than compensated by the children's great plays (Julia's first movie role at all!) And the charm of a Dogma movie (I liked this kind of movie story long before Dogma, ever since Herzog's 'Herz aus Glas'). Well, I was crying for the last fifteen minutes, which is a higher tear factor than bambi or Fly away home had for me.
