This is the first movie I have ever owned on video, and 14 years later I still have the same copy. Elizabeth Taylor was as brilliant as twelve as later in life, and Mickey Rooney gave a real dimension to Mi Taylor, and Donald Crisp was solid as always as Mr. Brown. The amazing Anne Revere, like Mrs. Brown, seemed to be the smartest woman in the world. After nearly 60 years, the warmth, humor and excitement of this movie have still affected the viewer. we still laugh at the jokes, root for The Pie, and love the Velvet for the spirit and capacity of love she shows. I love it as an adult like I loved it as a child. A must for every family video collection.
