I have loved a true thing since the first time I saw it in the theater and cried out my eyes. I bought it as soon as it was available and wasted how many times I saw it. <br /> <br /> For me One True Thing is the ultimate family bond movie. I love to see relationships in family change and evolve into what they end up with. I can relate to many details in the movie. My mother died of bone cancer so it really hits me at home. Maybe that's why I love it so much. <br /> <br /> I like the relationship between the children and their parents and the relationship between brother and sister, but especially love for the relationship between husband and wife. For me, it's really beautiful. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movement to anyone who enjoys this kind of movie.
