I can't say this movie was a fun thing, but I have to have a laugh on my face all the time. I like this darker kind of comedy; "very bad things", "8 heads in a duffel bag" or "coldblooded" <br /> <br /> The way the protagonist tries to get away with murder is very fun to see. For me it was not very surprising what the end would be, but the way the end came was. Another thing that stands out is the way they have managed to involve the audience. The way Terry looks at us is fun, you can almost pretend to be his accomplice.
