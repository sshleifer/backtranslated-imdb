Growing up in the late 60s and 70s I couldn't help but become a fan of science fiction. With America's top gear room sci-fi books, movies, TV shows and comics, my imagination burned and opened my mind to the possibilities of the universe. Farscape is unlike any other sci-fi show, but it has all the ingredients that made shows like Star Trek, Battlestar Gallatica, X-Files and Deep Space Nine personal favorites. One of the critics of Farscape is that the casual viewer can't just jump in and see an episode and understand what's going on. There have been other very successful shows that used several episode story arches and complicated characters. This for me is one of the charms of the show. I do not need or will have the story completely tied up at the end of each episode that the various incarnations in Star Trek have done. All in all, Farscape has wonderful and fun characters and an ongoing story that says that while humans can be least developed or advanced intelligent species in the universe, they still have outstanding qualities and abilities. Unfortunately, the short-term people on the Sci-Fi channel have canceled Farscape's 5th season. They have stated that the cancellation was based on sagging ratings. Only a few years ago it was their top-notch original series and a critical favorite. It is a pity that all artists who help create this show will not be able to continue their love power because of the fiscal problems of the channel / business that made it first. <br /> <br /> Hey, don't take my word for it, watch the show, look again, and make your own mind. Help save Farscape!
