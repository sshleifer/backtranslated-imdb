Cloakroom is not in good movie. Nor is it associated with any kind of social realism. This is perhaps its strength. The distance from certain times and nations strengthens the message, makes it more powerful and rips away from nationalism and propaganda, as you often notice in films made to criticize nations as opposed to themselves (of course, I am primarily talking about America's propaganda in some commercial films). <br /> <br /> The cabinet is so much more than a message. It is a film of pure surreal beauty, filled with the same clean, clinical form that you find in work as 1984, and it is equal. <br /> <br /> I'm old a big fan of Alan Rickman, the man with the golden sarcasm (and maybe I'm adding the straightforward sex appeal ;-)). The play between him and Madeleine Stowe is brilliant. Every time I see him, he seems to play a character yet nastier than the last ... But enough sweettalk. The film is missing in action. I don't want any cars running, but I want something to do except pure talk. After one hour, I was really tired of the interrogation area, the predictable actions and more than anything I wanted a more complex picture of the whole, the world, the past lives of the characters and the rest of the frame that was missing. For some people a good touch. For me, something less positive. In any case, Closet Land is a movie worth the time if you are ready to take a trip into the abyss of human nature. <br /> <br /> And of course for those who really love Always Evil Alan Rickman.
