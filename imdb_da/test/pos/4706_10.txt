I first noticed this movie when I saw an example of another movie. I was fascinated, but it didn't see it until it was short in theaters was done. <br /> <br /> Watching multiple times is not an easy movie. There is much violence inflicted on unarmed civilians. There are lessons to be learned here. One of Patricia Arquette's lines summarizes. "To the Americans, if it didn't happen on television, it just didn't happen." There is a lot of truth to it. <br /> <br /> Another is that at one point she thinks that just because she announces that she is an American citizen who soldiers will share and let her pass. It doesn't work that way. <br /> <br /> The landscape is beautiful. The action is all decent. The PROFESSOR is particularly good. Mostly, though, I care about these signs. Francis McDormand and Spaulding Gray are fine, but their appearance is short so they don't matter much. Patricia has gut. In the hands of a small actor, it could have been very bad. As it is love or hate the movie, you still have to get away with the idea that military dictatorships still exist in the world in this century, and until one of our own is evil, we ignore their oppression. <br /> <br /> Aung San Suu Kyi is the female political leader in the movie. In real life, she won the Nobel Peace Prize. She was only recently released from house arrest. The W. Bush administration, from the date I write this, is trying to push the military government to engage in negotiations with her and reshape the government. The Burmize government was under such a study that changed its name to Maynamar Republic. The US government has not yet recognized the new name. <br /> <br /> If you don't have a message in your movie, don't see it here. If you don't mind a little lessons with your entertainment, then that's fine.
