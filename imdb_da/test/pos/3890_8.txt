Garlin did a good job. Nice concept well done and tightly produced. Come across as a very sincere story. As a fan of "Curb Your Enthusiasm", where Jeff was basically the straight guy, I was delighted with how much depth he brought to this role in a simple but effective depiction. <br /> <br /> Much of the humor was undervalued and subtle and drew on poignancy that I really liked, rather than slapstick or over-explained. And there were some good little surprises and twists. The convenience store's vignettes were a joy. <br /> <br /> When I say it's a wonderful "little" movie, it doesn't mean budget or quality. It is simple, intimate and handmade. It tells a very credible everyday story. Relax and see it. Let it wash over you and you will feel good to have done it.
