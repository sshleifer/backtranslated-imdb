This is a romantic comedy, so it's really a fairy tale, but an unconventional one. Cinderella, instead of living in the ashes, lives in an over-decorated castle in the suburbs with a beautiful man who is not a prince. She finds her prince, but he is not so beautiful. Instead of a castle, at least in the beginning, she gets a little walk in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> Pfeifer, Stockwell and Ruehl are leading a roll of fully realized, if slightly over-the-top, characters. <br /> <br /> Demme reaches the highest level of film making in my mind. He creates a world I want to move into - a neighborhood in Manhattan and street life with life and society. <br /> <br /> I want IMDb linked to the reviewers' other comments. I want to know which other movies hate the people who have spun this one. I am always looking for many laughs and cozy places to "live" for at least an hour or so.
