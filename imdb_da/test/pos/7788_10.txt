It's the best movie released in Bollywood up to date. The best comedy, the best play and the best direction so far! Rajkumar Santoshi's writing and direction proved to be one of the best directors in the industry. Aamir Khan was amazing, Salman Khan looked as good as he did. Shakti Kapoor was good but Jagdeep over acted as normal! This comedy is still copied by people, and no other writers and directors have been able to do this again! Even Rajkumar Santoshi has not been able to make this cult classic again! This movie was a flop when it was released, but it has been a cult classic since it was released and loved by all kinds of people. <br /> <br /> STAR. </ P> </ P> br /> <br /> DIALOGUE 10/10. <br /> <br /> SCREENPLAY 10/10. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION 10/10. <br /> <br /> MUSIC 9/10. <br /> <br /> LYRICS 9/10. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is recommended. If you didn't see it until now, you missed something big! It's a ridiculous uprising and the best comedy I've seen so far! Classic movies like Hera Pheri, Golmaal and Jaane Bhi Do Jaaro are not even as fun as this. <br /> <br /> GREAT MOVIE, HATS FROM !!!!
