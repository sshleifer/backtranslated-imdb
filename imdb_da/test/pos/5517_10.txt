I enjoyed the movie and the fact that it was quite high in handling some sophisticated material. I watched the movie in a preview screen, and it was not destroyed by any stupid video boxes that spoiled the end. The performances were quite good, especially Andrew McCarthy in a more mature roll. I also enjoyed the movie's appearance, which gave it a mysteriously forbidden air. I have also enjoyed some of the "turns" in the plot and will not give away too much if other countries' video boxes do not give it all away! The script was a little over the top at times, but I appreciated the fact that the filmmakers were not afraid to challenge the audience with interesting and eerie questsons of the role of faith in our world. And while some might find the end a little too open, I appreciated the fact that the film refused to tie everything up nicely with a bow. This is how life does not work.
