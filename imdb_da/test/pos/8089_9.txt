This satire is just real, really dead, and no one is spared. But although this film has lots of laughs in the stupid story and the grotesque imitation of Hitler (here wisely renamed "Hynkel" and speaks in a hilarious kind of pseudo-German), the general tone is rather sad, perhaps because of the movie's place in history. And the actors don't even crush that much, I suppose. One of the greatest film moments at all times must be the end of the Jewish shaving, if only things could be completed that way. It is not even the very character who speaks more, it is Chaplin who says something he would really say. If you ignore the technical aspects, the movie does not feel dated or old, it actually moves at a pretty good pace. And the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing I don't care about is the slapstick, but it just comes with the time I suppose. This is an incredibly bold, tough tactic, it is so badly hit after all these years.
