I remember the old movie. It's a big, chilling, atmospheric scare picture of a man moving into a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange decline in the corridors at night. And there are even alien events taking place in Hollywood's most well-known rose maze. Yes, it's the maze you've seen in every movie of its own that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including "The Shining". But the punchline for this story is about the last thing you would guess. I probably didn't see it. This is a good example of how good and convincing a movie can be, even when the premise is completely loopy, bordering on ridiculous. I would recommend it to anyone.
