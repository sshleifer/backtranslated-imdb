<br /> <br /> I first watched this movie shortly after it was released on video in 1995, I fired it offhand and said that Julie was no Daniel, never really gives it a chance and said it was terrible. /> <br /> But here it is 5 years later, it is at Disney and I see it again. And I find that it's not as bad as I did it to be. Miyagi is still Miyagi, like coal as ever, the musical score is still as comfortable as ever. And Swank's character is not that bad, her plays are pretty good considering the script. It beats the third installment with a wide margin. So my original rating of 4 has been raised to 7.
