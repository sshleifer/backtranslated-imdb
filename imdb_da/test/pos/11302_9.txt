For a child's movie it's good. As an adult and mother, I enjoyed watching the movie with my daughter. There is a lot going on in this movie. The following * can * be considered a * spoiler * ... Barbie learns and does not learn to judge others so quickly in this movie. She also teaches not to give up hope and to master her anger. I loved the sense of cooperation you get from seeing Barbie and her sister and friends solving the puzzle. There is nothing in the movie I found offensive or inappropriate for young viewers. In fact, I felt that the film's moral messages were excellent and well done. <br /> <br /> The animation was pretty good. I really enjoy skating scenes and think they were very well done. There are a lot of actions in this movie, so I suppose most kids will enjoy it ... not just those who really are in Barbie. My daughter actually picked it because of Pegasus. She loves horses. But she enjoyed the movie a lot. My daughter is autistic and able to sit through the whole movie and enjoy it. She really liked action scenes and sharing with horses involved. <br /> <br /> One thing I was thinking about was that many people are protesting against Barbie (and Ken) because they are so beautiful. But I think children like adults like to look at beautiful people and things. It is natural. As adults, we also enjoy watching beautiful movie stars. However, it is wonderful that the Barbie character and her "girlfriend" have a lot of personality. While it is fun to see beautiful people, it becomes old if there is no fabric behind the beautiful face. Overall, I would say that this is a great movie for kids and parents will also enjoy it. :)
