Valeria, an elegant and beautiful young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shadow and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it is no difference to be completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take steps to approach the special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer her questions only with a "yes", "no" or "I do not know". The way to accentuate the loneliness of the character is magnificent. An example would be the distance between both, Massimo and Valeria taking a coffee in the same room, separated by subtle divisions and not seeing each other. I could mention several sequences, but it is better to watch the movie. It is impressive to see that not a single detail is out of control by the director. Although all actions are performed in slow motion, there is no need for shouts, but no special effects, but only big-acting and a touching well-written story. I loved it.
