It can't be Oscar material, but it was a very funny movie. I was always a fan of Eddie (Edmondson) & Richie (Mayall). "Bottom" & "Young Ones" were legendary TV shows "and it was time they made a movie. Some of the things they stand for are brilliant, from the pencil to the rear, to the rubber boots, and the infamous line, Richie says when he falls, and a candle he wears, goes to his eye, and says to Eddie "Candle In The Eye, Candle In The Eye," and Eddie was the simple one that he is, sticking the candle, Can't forget when Eddie is on his motorcycle and he needs to urinate, it was a great comedy, not to be taken seriously at all, but the film was missing with a ridiculous ending. <br /> < All in all, an excellent comedy, full of laughs and lots of fake green vomits. A 9/10. <br /> <br />
