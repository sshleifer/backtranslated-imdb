With today's standards, DI may seem a little hokey. Lee Emery's version is more accurate. I graduated boot camp in Parris Island, SC in 1964. Jim Moore is as close to the real thing as you could put on the screen in 1957. I can't comment on the plot, but I thought the ending was unrealistic for MCRD. PVT Owens is like many who were in a much more difficult situation than he negotiated. Like so many, he went to the Marine Corps for all the wrong reasons. My Drill Intructors was more like GySgt Hartman than TSgt Jim Moore. Much more. DI is more Korean Era and Full Metal Jacket is more Viet Nam Era. Today's movies allow such things on the screen. I have DI in my collection. I found it recently on DVD.
