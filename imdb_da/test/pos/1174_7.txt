This is the kind of movie that people of a certain age will say about "I didn't think they made movies like that anymore". Walter Matthau gives his usual over-the-top performance, but instead of leaving teeth marks the entire landscape, leaving the greasy fat spots. He is like the great uncle, we all know that it still carries plaid polyester and embarrasses everyone but we still love it anyway. Jack Lemmon's performance reminds us why he had more Golden Globe nominations than anyone else (22). He gives a real performance of the basic 'good, ordinary man', even in a farce's environment. <br /> <br /> This movie may not appeal to people who prefer dumb humor designed to confront or offend, but will appeal to people who appreciate wide-fledged fairy playing . <br /> <br /> All supporting casts are excellent in their ability to play such absurd characters while maintaining the reality of each character. /> <br /> Brent Spiner provides a great performance as a professional version of a lounge lizard. Anyone who has known professional hosts in real life immediately recognizes the type he plays. He nails the type perfectly. His rendering of 'slime' deserves to study as a perfect example of the contrast between absurd and pathetic. Rather, the plot is a 'let's marry rich' theme that has the usual results. Just because a plot theme has been made a thousand times does not mean that it is dated, but rather that it is a timeless theme. The rest of the supporting cast shows what can happen when professionals show their skills in the roles written to them, instead of fighting for the spotlight. In this movie, even the two tens actors shine. It is also obvious that they enjoy making this movie. The plot can be standard and thin, but it allows the artists to shine. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real treat for people who want to see professional actors engaging in their craft. The ground falls away and the artists shine.
