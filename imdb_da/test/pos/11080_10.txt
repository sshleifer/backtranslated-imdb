The Falcon and Snowman are based on a true story. Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee (the titular traitors) played by Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn received their KGB code names. Why? Boyce was an avid falconer and Lee was a chef. The film is based on a true story. It is based on the book of the same name. Another reviewer asked what was their motivation? Disillusionment is not. Ideology is not. (Excuse my bad grammar), but I make a point here. What was it if it were not disillusionment or ideology? With a word, greed. At the time of the Boyce-Lee case, money became the great motivator and not the ideology. Don't believe me? Then look at the Walker Family Spy Ring, which was broken in the late 80's. Three spies did the worst damage to our national security in the 70s and 80s. John Walker, who began his career as a spy in the 60s, Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee. All three sold this land to thirty pieces of silver. If you are not familiar with this sentence, I suggest you read the Bible.
