I first saw "Death in Venice" 1971) about 15 years ago, found it deeply moving and often thought about it. I saw it again a few days ago, I realized that it is close to the top of the major works of cinema. With almost no dialogue, it catches a viewer with the beautiful film, the fine actor, and above all Mahler's music, without which the movie simply could not exist. <br /> <br /> "Death in Venice" is an amazing Luchino Viscontis adaptation of Thomas Mann's novella about a famous composer (in the short story he was a writer, but making him a composer in a movie was a great idea that seems admirable) Gustav von Aschenbach (loosely based on Gustav Mahler) who travels to Venice in the summer of 1911 to recover from personal losses and professional errors. His quest for beauty and perfection seems to have ended when he sees a boy of incredible divine beauty. Ashenbach (Dirk Bogard) follows the boy everywhere and never tries to approach him. The boy, Tadzio, belonged to very rare creatures who own an enigmatic and unthinkable power that captures you, pampers you, defeats you, and captures you. Ashenbach became one of the prisoners of Tadzio spellbinding charms. He became addicted to him; he fell in love with him. Was it blessed or cursed for him? I believe both. He died of unreachable, impossible yet beautiful love, which object was perfection itself. The last picture Ashenbach's eyes were captured by the boy's silhouette surrounded by the sea and the golden sunlight. Nothing could compare to the beauty and charm of the scene and taking it with you to the grave is death you can only dream of. If he could, Ashenbach would probably have said, "I could witness one of the faces of the faces I could not bear, but I was chosen to learn to exist here in this world and I can die in peace now because It happened to me. "<br /> <br /> Unforgettable music, Gustav Mahler's joking adagietto from his fifth symphony found perfect use in a perfect movie. It reflects every sense of the protagonist - it spins, it longs, it asks for hope, and it sums up the idea that when you are blessed to meet beauty, you are judged to die. I can come up with hundreds of movies that use classical music to perfection, but nothing will ever compare to "Death in Venice". I dare say that Mahler's music is its protagonist - it will change and sound different depending on what happened on the screen. It sounded triumphant when Ashenbach returned to Venice for what he thought would be his happiness, but turned out to be his death. It sounded bleak when he first entered Venice from the sea. You can hear so many different feelings in it - tenderness and worship, confusion and self-suffering, worship and melancholy, but always - love that gives the purest happiness and breaks the hearts (literally). The movie for a viewer resembles what the boy was for the aging composer / writer / artist. We are enchanted and imprisoned by his power and beauty as much as Achenbach was of the boy's mysterious charm.
