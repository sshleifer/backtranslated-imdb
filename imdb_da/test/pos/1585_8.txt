After the death of all senior officers, Commander Craig-Scott, from the laundry and moral corps, commands the promotion of an intergalactic spaceship owned by the Starcups Corporation. The main task is to search for habitable planets and of course long-term coffee markets. Craig-Scott and his second commander, Chief Blather, find themselves unwarranted in command except to the extent that they are fully capable of keeping crew members clean - which is not to diminish the importance of pure underpants, especially when incompetent commanders cause that the same underpants are regularly dirty. <br /> <br /> The episodes are presented as a series of short, 2-3 minute reports from Commander to Earth. The mood is a mix of wry deadpan and outrageous physical comedy. Think yes minister meets with red dwarf, but on a shoe-string budget. All the usual plot units of sci-fi are here - aliens, nuclear weapons, computer errors - but each is enhanced by the fresh lemony scent of high quality detergent. <br /> <br /> Commander's Log is definitely low-budget, but the somewhat cheese-efficient and props fit the absurd performance of the show. Remember the hilarious hockey helmets they had on the old Battlestar Galactica? With the brand "Jofa" still visible? Okay, there's a lot in Commander's Log, but it's cute. Commander's Log is not high art, but it is not what it is trying to be. It's just a little off-kilter fun. It does a good job of being.
