Beautifully filmed, the mind expands exploration of gypsy culture in the context of their music. Traveling across a continent, experiencing the amazing musical styles of different groups of gypsies. It is kind of misleading to say that this movie is not told. It is masterfully told by the music itself, the soaring melodies and subtitles tell a story much better than a narrator would have. Watch this movie.
