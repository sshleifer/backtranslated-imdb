SPOILER ALERT - AND I REALLY PAY IT !! READ NO FURTHER, UNDERSTANDING THAT IS PREPARED TO BE A GREAT PLOT ELEMENT REVEALED !! <br /> <br /> Okay, first of all, I have a relatively high tolerance for depressing movies. I want to watch and appreciate movies about true life horror (like war and holocaust) or where death and sadness are important to the plot, but I hate movies like STEAL MAGNOLIAS and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, where the film is built around a manipulative death of a protagonist. So, no matter how good this movie is, it has a big strike against it because one of the protagonists dies of an illness at the end (though they never say what he had in the English subtitle version). <Br /> <br /> So you can ask yourself, "so if this hard-hard hate this type of movie, why did he first see it?" You would have an excellent point to ask this even though I hope I am not really a blow! Well, when I found it in our local library, I had no idea what it was about !!! The movie was not intended for export, as the subtitles were in Korean, English and Japanese, and the box was printed in Korean. Well, as a fan of trying movies from any nation (I've seen movies from probably at least 30-40 different countries), I tried it. <br /> <br /> Apart from the mandatory death, I loved the movie and then hated the way it ended. While I usually hate miraculous Hollywood-type conclusions, I would see the guy rescued through some new drug or trial. I was really bummed that he had to die - especially since he seemed like one of the best people I've seen in movies for a long time. His smile was contagious and I really wanted him to get the girl last. Oh yes, at least I can appreciate the film's message that you should grab the moment. Great acting, music, etc. But just not the most satisfying end for me. This movie was good enough to encourage me to try a little more Korean cinema.
