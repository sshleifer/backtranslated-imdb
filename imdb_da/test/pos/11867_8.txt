Liv Tayler in her sexiest movie! <br /> <br /> She incorporates the "Femme Fatale" role in an astounding way, while she manages to appear as a super sexy woman, while the "sweet girl" stands and is not exaggerated as others like movie (eg "Femme Fatale" with Rebecca Romijn) <br /> <br /> Until this movie, the Lord of the Rings was the only movie I've ever seen her (I'm combed with LotR) <br /> <br /> Point: At LoTR I had formed an opinion that the role of pure sweet woman was the only role that Liv Tayler could interpret, but when I saw "One Night at Mc Cool", I completely changed. She is the sexiest woman ever! <br /> <br /> Therefore, as a movie, a mediocre joint comedy with a "confusing" plot
