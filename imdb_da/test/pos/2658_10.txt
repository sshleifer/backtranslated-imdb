I am always surprised when the famous title track of 2001 is called "Also sprach Zarathustra" that no one (no one I have read) has seen the parallels between the film and Nietzsche's famous work, "Sprach Zarathustra". The idea of ​​man's rebirth into a star child; an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of Nets "Zarathustra"; there is a prominent passage called "On how a camel becomes a lion and a lion becomes a child", where N. describes the superior's first incarnation as a child exceeding both ascetic, altruistic side of man (camel, always praying to carry more weight) and the rapacious, brutal, will-to-power side of man (the lion). The fact that the song plays under the star's children's sequence can hardly be coincidence. And also, Zarathustra said that "man is a rope tied between animal and superior." The film's structure fits the description: A short story about man as an animal until we become real man by mastering weapons and acquiring land, then a long order of man (the rope as it was) and then a brief glimpse of the superior. The inconvenience of how these transformations occurred and the suggestion that an external force caused them is also Nietzschean; in "Zarathustra" he makes it quite clear that he has no idea how people will be able to cope with these changes themselves and suggest that we have to depend on an outsider (Zarathustra) to show us how to " go under". Bowman's psychedelic order at the nearest end could be seen as Kubrick's best 1960s style attempt to portray the mysterious "go under". I know that these parallels are quite broad and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that I haven't seen it myself. But I just wanted to mention them if it was nothing but trying to remove the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher. Few people find the end of 2001 to be gloomy, and in my opinion that is explicit and unmistakable Nietzschean. The case could certainly be made that 2001, above all, is a dramatization of "Zarathustra" updated to the modern age. Feel free to ignore the direct snobbishness of my bonding to Nietzsche.
