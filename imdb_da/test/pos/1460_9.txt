There are only a few movies that can be called `must see 'and SHEPHERED is one of those movies. In many ways it was before that time (and you can see it was the source of inspiration for several better known films). Copied by many who are equal to none, this is really a great movie. <br /> <br /> The story is complicated but unfolds as an exciting yet fun thriller and highly thought-provoking exploration of human nature. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos rule. C. Thomas Howell is a `Shepherd 'who protects the people of various religious leaders by killing any incomplete members of society. The whole idea made me think of our society. It's really a brilliant social comment, which is more than I can say for some newer sci-fi / action blockbusters. MATRIX RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS did not feel that there was any real innovation, just boring video game effects. But SHEPHERD also scores on the action scale ... <br /> Not even does this movie make the viewer of the viewers. Peter Hayman turns out to be one of the few brilliant action directors. We speak 100%, high grade, down home kung fu matches! It was excellent. Really good special effects, shoot-outs, gloomy-futuristic cyber-punk noir style ?? The movie really has its own elements. <br /> <br /> When talking about SHEPHERD, it is impossible not to mention how much style it has. The vision of this city is truly amazing. It is reminiscent of pictures of Tim Burton's very memorable view of Gotham in Batman. And these sights are photographed by Graeme Mears with some skill that puts Gordon Willis and Conrad Hall to shame. Even the special effects turned out to be fantastic. Without a doubt, the scenes where the fighting occurs are landmarks throughout the filmmaking. This movie is a ballet with a fantastic visual display. <br /> <br /> Still, at the bottom of it all, there is an interesting story made by a strong casting. The actor (especially Rowdy Piper) and the plot are both great and excellent. Unlike lots of futuristic movies made with a strong artificial flavor, the characters are credible, and the dialogue is natural and full of white. I am always proud to see a good movie that SHEPHERD comes with. It's a shame that it didn't receive good distribution and didn't do anything in the box office. It is a rarity worth looking for. This movie will impress you and make you feel 10 times cooler to have seen it!
