I've seen a couple of Fred Carpenter's movies on Showtime, Pay Per View and Video / DVD, and I enjoyed most of these movies especially with a few beers (Carpenter knows how to entertain) "EDDIE MONROE" and " MURDERED INNOCENCE "are my favorites. I recently watched a promo DVD of "EDDIE MONROE" and everything from cast to storyline and managing all the work smoothly. (Doug Brown's music score was sensational.) I enjoyed watching Frank Sivero ("Goodfellas", "New York, New York" and "The Wedding Singer"), he is a great and very underrated actor. But I especially liked the performance of Paul Vario, who played Uncle Benny, I looked up his play on IMDb and I found out that this was his first lead. Where has this guy been! Give Fred Carpenter credit to discover Great New Talent, it's just a matter of time you'll see this guy costarring with Pacino and DeNiro. As I mentioned, Carpenter knows how to entertain, and when you work with a limited budget, it's great what Carpenter can produce. (I read the interview VENT MAGAZINE and Carpenter have never made a movie for more than $ 400,000.) Before I saw "EDDIE MONROE" I saw "Rocky Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd" both good movies. "Eddie Monroe" took me on a trip to a surprised conclusion because of a very good script, great performances from all over (Craig Morris is a movie star waiting to happen, and leading actress Jessica Tsunis was hot!) Great Cinematography , Direction and Doug Brown's music score. As I said, I recently watched "Rocky Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd" if I were to write a comment on the two films, I would say some of the same things I have said about "EDDIE MONROE" the only thing the two very good movies do not have in common with "Eddie Monroe", they did not cost a few hundred grand. Fantastic movie and I don't even drink a beer.
