I had the PRIVILEGE of joining Britain's prizes of Inglorious Basterds tonight! Having seen trailers, I had great hopes, but had doubts about a number of self-permitting films (we can be honest, self-confidence is his middle-class tarantino) <br /> <br /> had pulled the cat out of the bag with this one. The film is rich in an interesting dialogue, perfectly timed comedy with a touch of brutal murder. <br /> <br /> However, the chronic glory of this movie lies with Christoph Waltz, who cannot find any errors or mistakes. He manages to create a real excitement in the audience, while remaining fairly "theatrical" (could not think of a better word). He certainly deserved his prize in Cannes and is undoubtedly on his way to an Oscar !! Hope to see him in something again soon!
