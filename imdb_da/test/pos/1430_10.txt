The man with the golden arm Otto Premingser's controversial panoramic criminal drama unfolds among the mental descriptions of his living and architectural residents in rhythmic, lashing arrangement. Opening the movie, a close-up from a bar by Frankie looking through the window, already tells us about the prominence that the protagonist's subjective experience will understand. Pulling toward increasingly slender spaces, the movie turns itself off when the local gangster's long-standing poker game shuts off from daylight, bowing himself as Sinatra's Frankie Machine himself is locked in a room in the famous scene of his fierce battle to Overcoming his habit. By immersing themselves in shapes and faces in his jazzy city garden, the visual traffic of The Man with The Golden Arm characterizes biased psychological conditions that create an overwhelming environment maintained by the recurring traces of close-ups of Frankie's eyes. <br /> <br /> The grace of this burning drama that strikes as early as the thrilling opening crane shot shows the command of the adventurous world that studio production allows. The wonderfully overdue city set defines an independent place without beginnings or ends, an indefinite state, the kind that really hardly lasts as long as this shadow rows seem to be gentrified or leveled. The flair of some performances, especially Robert Strauss, as the wonderfully named underground gambling chief Schwiefka and Arnold Stang as Frankie's credible four-legged lapdog, pleases this fiery surrealistic function. The prerequisite for drug abuse, Sinatra's powerhouse performance, Elmer Bernstein's infectious, powerful jazz score, and Saul Bass's famous, influential and controversial opening order, centering on the animated paper cut of a heroin abuse arm, ensured that in his time The Man with the Golden Arm pushes forward to the cause of realism in the still reluctant Hollywood. It is impressionistic and subjective as I say, but its purpose, its power and its spirit are much closer to home. What absorbs me most in this movie is its aspect as a gangster movie. It has illegal card games, short downs, the matches, the guns, the double crosses, the signs of the lamb, a femme fatale, an amazing sexy pistol, the shady nightclubs and the urban landscape, but it does more than exploit this environment for entertainment. Really, it is the perfect environment and genre to tell this story, a crime-specific city, where it is far too convenient to escape through a bottle or two or three or four or drugs, a transient dose that works only to keep you in ambiguity from any information and all the clear scenarios the world can offer.
