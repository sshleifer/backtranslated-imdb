I first looked at "The dead with boots on" around 1970, and although it has been many years ago, this film and its impressions remain. The cast was good at excellent and the lead was really heroic. When I first watched this movie I knew the wisest and the only real position to have was to enjoy this movie as an exciting bit of entertainment and saw some. I felt then, as I now feel, that Silver Screen does not as such give a true portrayal of much of all, let alone George Armstrong Custer's life, but Raoul Walsh, director, should contribute to the real value represented in this movie when I looked at a semi-documentary with other great directors such as Vincent Mennelli, where these key figures talked about there results with valuable comments that give an insight into Hollywood mind sets. This is what I considered something of interest and where all this became very interesting and very enjoyable. There has been so much made of everyone per oblems with the silver screen and its history tells the ability that some of the pleasure has been lost, and maybe you will also find it to be true here. Custer ranked 34 in a graduate class of ... 34. Much has been made of Custer's last class ranking, but of the 68 cadets who entered the military academy with him in 1857, half had already flunked or ended at Exam day June 24, 1861. It is suggested in the film, as the different instructors decide whether a soldier is suitable for the command, and then they come to the name George Armstrong Custer, and there must be an exchange between the two sides, and here is here, where Sargeant on Duty says in almost a low tone even suggesting it came out of an accident. "His squadron would follow him to hell." Your attention Sargeant reprimands Tape. If I am not mistaken when Flynn turns up on a first battlefield, he acknowledged that Custer did not act immediately, and he actually did work as a reliable attach√© to not only Sheridan, but Hancock also forced only to end for a time with The Potomac's army under General George McClellan. There is some truth to the boldness attributed to the heroism of the Custers battlefield, as illustrated in a counter attack, "Young Custer asked his horse to his head and boldly ventured among the stunned Confederates. As a lonely Union Soldier surrounded by rebels, He shamed Custer's inactivity, accepting the surrender of several enemy soldiers, including a rebel captain, the most outstanding in this act he personally captured the very first Confederate battle flag taken by the Potomac army, this remarkable act of courage marking him as an officer of great battlefield promise. "Robert L. Batman Armchair General.There is a problem here and it is the story of the story and truth of George Armstrong Custer, the story is good Hollywood entertainment maybe even great entertainment, but whatever the reasons were all there could be told, change d for entertainment. Though this might jump the gun, it may be good to know that Tom Custer would lose his life on the "Little Big Horn" just a few yards away where George Custer was to die as well. They were brothers and Tom Custer so far has an honorable distinction of being among a very small group, perhaps only 3 others who have been awarded honorary members twice in their military career. The list of exposures shown by the film picture shows that Custers was actually an active young officer. He was not with Union forces on either Chancellorsville or for that matter Fredericksburg, but he was with them in the Battle of Antietam, and at that time he was actually promoted to Captain by General McClellan, but that was not to be done as McClellan would soon replaced by the historical fact that The Potomac's army had the funds and the information (discovered about some cigars was General Lee's plans to divide his forces) and yet ill-acted for some 17 hours. It may be speculated that the war might have been over then and then that happened, but when McClellan failed to act, President Lincoln presented him permanently and the promotion was lost as a result. Custer's biggest victory can actually come to Gettysburg, Pa. His forces, occupying an area called the Cemetery Edge on the court in Gettysburg in the summer of 1863, could defeat a Jeb Stuart Led Cavalry of approx. 6,000 rebels with a power of 2,300. I think the heroics in Gettysburg by Custer are worth discussing. There is speculation in the film that the Custers appointment was a blunder, well you better guess again, because not only did Custer have men in his corner, but he established a claim to present to the Governor of the state of Michigan, who incidentally was relatively new for the Union Cause and where to prepare for the formation of Cavalry regiments. Although Custer was heavily blamed for this kind of shenanigan when he appeared in everything the gold braid was, it was not by accident that you would be led to believe. The truth is told Custer's defense at Gettysburg forbade Jeb Stuart to have lunch at Union's baggage stores and protected the flank. This action, incidentally, happened and it was time to coincide with Picketts Charge to create the greatest likelihood of success. It was a critical victory, and Custer was at his bravest and best. His men followed him to hell and lived to tell about it.
