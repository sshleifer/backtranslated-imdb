"The Aristocats" is classic Disney at its best. It is not considered the ultimate Disney classic beside the more well-known Disney movies, but it is a well-liked and fun movie that certainly deserves to be a Disney classic. "Aristocats" is definitely a safe kids-pleaser because it has all the components for a fun kids movie. I liked it as a child. I'm not sure if this movie is a sure pleasure for the adults who could see Disney classics for nostalgia, but I still enjoy this movie as a young adult. <br /> <br /> Storywise, "Aristocats" Don't be so complicated or innovative, but it doesn't matter. This film was made during the period in which the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were the story and the wise verse that "Aristocats" certainly shows. The characters do the movie; they are all cozy, fun, have big lines and have a great interaction with each other. The voice actors also help make the characters so convincing (Eva Gabor as Duchess, Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley and etc.). A misconception could have been the dogs Napoleon and Lafayette, as they are show stoppers and not so much with the current story, but fortunately they are fun and funny characters, and the scenes with them are pure gold. <Br /> <br /> "Aristocats" are both entertaining and sweet, but it is also a very fun cartoon. Animation style and appearance perfectly match the movie's French surroundings (especially the city of Paris looking greats). Draw the animation and design is great. And the songs are also very captivating. My favorite is "Scale and Arpeggios", but the title song is a sweet song along with "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and the memorable show stopper "Everybody Wants To Be A Cat". And the George Burns score is a perfect fit for the movie's fun and emotional situations. All in all, "Aristocats" is, in my opinion, the best Disney cartoon of the 70s, and it is a movie that deserves both to be seen and remembered. So what are you waiting for? Do yourself a favor and share this Disney classic with your kids. It deserves to be in their memories.
