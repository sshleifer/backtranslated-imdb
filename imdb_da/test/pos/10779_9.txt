Eric Bogosian gives as great a performance as you will ever see in an Oliver Stone movie. His Barry character is an assault rifle disguised as a man, and he blows away anyone, on or off the air, who insults him. Adapted from the Bogosien scene game, "Talk Radio" is a vicious and scary ride that won't let you down until it's too late. Then you become acquainted with the edge of racists, rapes, paranoids, wannabe assassins and just prank callers who listen, speak and sneak in the dark of Dallas nights. <br /> <br /> Stone, if even possible, lets Bogosian dominate every scene, from Barry's humble beginnings to brand or break when his radio program can reach national syndication. The rest of the molding is uniformly excellent as the lovers and / or colleagues who have all used and cast aside by Barry in common. <br /> <br /> The only thing I want to change is the recurring theme music, "Bad To The Bone". I would have used Bachman-Turner Overdrive's "Not Fragile". A better song, one I haven't heard so far in a movie and a run, relentless melody, whose vicious riff is like the true soundtrack to Barry's life. Listen if you dare!
