If you see this at home on DVD or Bluray! Make sure you have a good sound system. The musical score through this is what moves you through the movie. I've seen the movie several times and thought it was great, but after just upgrading my home theater sound system, what a difference. I want to see this movie many, many more times. <br /> <br /> If you don't have a good sound system. Find a friend who does it and sees it there. <br /> <br /> See also the extra stories and behind the scenes that come with it (BR or DVD.) The Quimet interview in the 1960s talks about his scholarship fund ... but for those times, just boys got it. today i hope some of it goes to girls .......
