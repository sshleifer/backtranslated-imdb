Unlike some of the previous commentators, I was (and is) an avid fan of the carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without carpenters. That said, I think the movie did a good, not excellent, job of portraying Karen's life. The movie was fun to watch on primetime TV, but the content fell short. I suggest you all look at getting some of the Carpenters specialties shown in the 70s. You can't believe how wonderful a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent. Also, Karen was beautiful but had a bad hairdresser. My choice to play Karen is Hilary Swank. I would love to see a more substantive story because there was more to Karen than to face my eyes when we listened to the fact that we were just starting out. I have tons of handed carpenters' music, and it's absolutely excellent. (Her song by California Dreamin is to die for).
