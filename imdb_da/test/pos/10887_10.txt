In my personal opinion, I think this is the biggest video game ever created! I first played this game on my friends house many years ago, the very next day I went out and got my own. Since the day close to seven years ago, I haven't stopped playing it. I can't help it, I just can't get bored of it. I've been addicted to other games on other, much newer systems, but I keep coming back to more Goldeneye. Each mission is incredibly fun and challenging, multi-player mode was like no other. I hope you can be lucky enough to have played four player multi-player mode because I had brothers and friends who would come together and play this game all the time.
