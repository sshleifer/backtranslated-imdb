Who could have thought that a non-disabled actor could act as realistically and immensely as the disabled person in a movie? Probably someone. But no one, really no one, could ever compare their expectations with the incredible emotional and powerful performance of the two actors in this movie. <br /> <br /> Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as shown to us right from the beginning, he has great problems communicating. So it's really a rescue line when co-worker Rory (James McAvoy), who can speak normally, understands him. Thus, a friendship that mainly depends on (ironically) communication starts. <br /> <br /> In a hilarious scene, moving out of home succeeds in their own. After Rory's refusal, Michael's good-hearted application made an application to move into his own house. Rory, who already had a bad name with the "judges", should be his interpreter. <br /> <br /> But problems soon arise. They start with good-heartedness to pursue a girl they once met in a pub and wanted her to be their assistant to do the little things that matter. She is initially reluctant; she does not know these men, but thinks they could be harmless; then it turns up another friendship, but not necessarily a good ... <br /> <br /> Besides being exciting, this movie really depends on the actors. But that's not a bad thing. For a non-disabled actor, you see Rory, though he can communicate properly, frustrated with the way he is completely dependent on other people, and has no real life in himself. But the real star for me is Steven Robertson. He works with such a feeling, longing to fit in and sadness / happiness, which really sees him gain over the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Excellent. <br /> <br /> Overall: 5 out of 5
