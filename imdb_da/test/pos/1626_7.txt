Still haven't read a single Dan Brown book, but I saw all his movie adaptations. I will not fall into the game to judge this with the previous one because the scale is not really the same: in fact, this is a thriller, a race against time filled with puzzles. <br /> <br /> The plot is very twisted, imaginative and cast is excellent: I've never been a big fan of Hanks but he delivers well. I noticed his jeans shirt (one spilled with blood) because I'm looking for such a one in vain! The Italian seeker is a glorious newcomer to me, but I really welcome the Ewan MacGregor depiction: his inner faith and tranquility are truly impressive. I really like the debate between science and religion. The action takes place in the Vatican, it felt like vacation. Finally, I am not sure that it will add new converts to Christianity. With all the presence of gold and human being displayed, one will ask what charity means and why women are so dismissed by church life while they account for half or more of the believers.
