Just go see this movie. Everything is great about rock and roll, the band comes up with some good songs (Classico, Pick of Destiny, Master Exploder, etc.). All this with the Humor of Teancous D makes this the best movie ever. <br /> <br /> The camos are right at the back, with Meat Loaf and Dio song for JB. Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are amazing, I really like Tim Robbins character. You also find out who Satan really is! Music and musical references are hilarious and Awesome. Playin songs good songs from The Who, Dio and others, just complete it. I didn't personally think that the band could top the amazing songs of D, but they did with songs like Classico and Master Exploder. Seriously great music. <br /> <br /> Just go see it, it's a must for anyone who loves rock!
