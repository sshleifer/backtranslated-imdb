Humphrey Bogart in her first lead looks very young, works well, but has a pronounced lisp only suggested later in his career. Still, he is very good and very appealing as the idealistic young inventor of a new airplane. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Mackaill is the right star here, playing a unique woman torn between her true love of Bogart (he is also broken) and the comfort and safety of marrying an elderly man (Hale Hamilton). Following on the tour, Astrid Allwyn as Bogart's tramp sister Bradley Page as her would be producer, Barbara Leonard as a beautician, Jack Kennedy as Gilligan and Halliwell Hobbes as the faithful (and clever) butler). <br /> <br /> Both Mackaill (who had been a star in silent movies) and Bogart tried to endure talkies in 1932. Bogart was a slow-growing actor from the Broadway scene; Mackaill slides and will soon be seen in skiing production as PICTURE BRIDES. Yet they are both very good here. Mackaill wasn't even 30 when she appeared in this movie!
