Before I forget, let me say that the artwork here is excellent. From rubbish bins to the large cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully finished. If this wasn't animated, critics would be proud of the "direction" in here because it's really good. <br /> <br /> The story: Sylvester picks through the garbage on the shipyards, but the pickins are slim. While breaking at the quay next to a large ship, he jumps into a porthole at Tweety in the cage. Tweety also stains him and you know his first comment - the same thing he always does when he stains the cat. Still, Sylvester runs over, opens the porthole and says, "Hey breakfast!" Tweety hits the window window on his face and says, "You're a bad old kiggetomcat!" The cat falls into the water. <br /> <br /> The pristine Sylvester sneaks back aboard the ship, tiptoes in Tweety's cabin, grabs him and is ready to leave when - who! - There is "Granny" at the door with his umbrella. Sylvester takes a beating as the old lady again protects her animal bird. But "flippy gibbet," says Granny, "I've dropped my glasses, I can't see anything without them." Sky to Betsey, where are they cheating. "Now Sylvester has the upper hand .... and the normal cat-to-catch-birds shenanigans are on again, as Granny's glasses. Sylvester's most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of Tweety on them, then she woke up and put them on, so she watched the bird and believe it was okay. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very entertaining animated card that was very fun to watch, as you can tell with the quotes , I love the dialogue in some of these old cartoons.
