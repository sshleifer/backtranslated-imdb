The way it looks on the other comments, it seems that many people didn't get the point on the girl. It is not centered on zombies, in fact they are not at all zombies, they are a unit that is regenerated by the wizard, to scare the girls to death, his main focus is on Meg Tilly, whom he will help him finish jobs he died while he did in the first place, and what you get is a good flip with a great ending, it's hard to find video, but every time it turns out on HBO or Cinamax, check it out, I gave it a 10 and highly recommend it.
