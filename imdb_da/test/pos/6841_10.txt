Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Carla Gugino and Gil Bellows are a DELIGHT in this sexy caper. This movie is smart, the edge of your adult adult entertainment, and what a relief these days of great concept predictable cartoons. Great music and camera work adds the fun that is this New Orleans set of puzzles. Highly recommended. Ten stars!
