This movie played in Lexington KY for 7 days. I saw it on the last day of its race and regretted that I couldn't recommend it to others because it is a movie crying for the big screen experience. The aerial shot, where the crowded ship pulls away from the equally crowded dock, is a masterpiece that is the scene where the two main characters flirt on deck - almost a ballet and sexier in its suggestion than so many more explicit films these days . I just crush to believe that more people will not be able to see this fine movie in a theater; The DVD experience will not be the same. Here's an idea: If you live in a college town, see if you can lobby to show up at a campus movie festival.
