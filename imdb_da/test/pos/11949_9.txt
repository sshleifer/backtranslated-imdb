This is classic 80's humor. If you were a teenager in the 80's it was a summer hit to see. It was an early look at the now superstars. This and better Dead are just funny and stupid movies to sit back and enjoy. Everyone can admit they had a crazy summer when they were teenagers. Even crazy family and friends like these characters. Being introduced to some of these characters was so much fun. The uncle who's crazy is sitting in a radio waiting for a million dollars every night, grandmother who only likes the grandchild and submitted a bill to the kids after dinner, the two brothers who don't look the same and that meeting hoopz was so much fun. It may not have won a prize, but it's just a fun movie to get lost in an afternoon.
