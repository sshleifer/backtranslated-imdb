"Eighteen" (2004) tells the story of Pip Anders, a depressed and extremely cynical young man who is alienated from his dysfunctional upper-class / middle-class family and lives on Vancouver's streets. On his 18th birthday, he receives a cassette tape and a player from his outdated grandfather, who relates his memoirs of his own 18th birthday, and has used it with the British army in France and is trying to help a deadly wounded companion, so you don't Avoid taking the occupied Germans. As Pip listens to the tape (Ian McKellen gave the voice to his grandfather), we see the scenes he describes as flashbacks, alternating with daily scenes of Pip's life, as well as newer flashbacks filling in the dark secret why Pip left home and finding it impossible to trust to someone who is nice to him. <br /> <br /> An ambitious second film by writer / director Richard Bell ("Two Brothers"), with a polished look, excellent photography, well-developed non-stereotypical characters (with homosexuals and just treated equally) and commendable stakes in emotionally and physically demanding roles from some talented new players (especially Paul Anthony as Pip and Brendan Fletcher as his grandfather at 6 pm). There is also a remarkable tour of Alan Cummings as a priest who tried to help Pip and a small supportive role played by Thea Gill ("Queer As Folk"). The complex story - in the director's own words in his DVD comment - must drive a "vortex of emotion" that pushes Pip to its breakpoint, and it certainly does. My only criticism is that the overall effect is too "schmaltzy" or artificial for an audience to really identify with, much of the supportive dialogue (and end) for constructed and predictable, and the direction must be sharper to limit blunt overactive in some scenes. I recommend it, 7 stars out of 10, including extra points for a remarkable effort.
