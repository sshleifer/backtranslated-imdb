For those who are not knowledgeable, the Asterix books are a hugely successful series of comics about a village of indomitable Gauls that resists Caesar's invasion thanks to a magical potion that makes them innocent supermen. There have been several animated features (only one of them, The Twelve Tasks of Asterix that really captures the books and the spirit despite being an original screen story), before a perfect cast Christian Clavier and Gerard Depardieu starred in two live action Adaptations that proved to be tremendously successful throughout Europe, but no impression whatsoever in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> The unknown French version is fun, but unfortunately does not appear to be available in a version with English subtitles outside the UK DVD. While there is still no sign of an American theater or DVD release, the Miramax version of Asterix et Obelix: Mission Cleopatre is also on that DVD (and has played on UK TV) and you will never guess what - it is completely edited (at least 21 minutes away) and dubbed English. Perhaps Harve lost it to a Hong Kong movie - after all, he never saw a foreign film that he didn't think could be improved by heavy re-editing and celebrating for some years. <br /> <br /> Asterix and Obelix Contre Cesar were lovingly baptized into English from a particularly good translation script by Terry Jones, but otherwise remained unchanged, that kind of thing is really not the Miramax road. The results are not good. The film was the best attempt to get the books mixed by slapstick, anachronisms and highbrow classically humorous to the screen, but many of the classic references are gone (like the great fleet of Medusa sight gag or the Cyrano de Bergerac references from Depardieu), along with everything that works too French or can slow down the image, with the result that the first 20 minutes are now a real hit. Several punchlines for sequences are missing, Depardieu has been trimmed (his part was already quite small due to his serious health problems during the shot: the American version has been partially digitally regressed to change the unhealthy spot in his face in the original!) And which Usually with duplicate because literal translations into English do not fit properly, lines are either rushed so much that they are no longer fun, or the dialogue has been changed altogether (a couple of these changes are certainly fun as a character dreams of a world where he could move his lips in French and hear the words in English). Not a total disaster, but very disappointing considering how good the full length version is. It would be nice to think that Miramax would make a Shaolin Soccer and release both versions, but since they have both filmed two years ago to pay $ 45 million. For them (another classic case of Harvey's infamous chronic buyer's remorse: Disney was so p **** d on their overspending) and still has no publishing plans, it may just be too much wish list. It is a real shame that such an accessible and entertaining movie will now only be available to non-French speakers in such a lumpy bowlerised version. It seems that the nice Gauls might have been able to defeat Caesar's legions, but are no match for the Miramax jackboot.
