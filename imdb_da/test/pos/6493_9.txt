This is the fourth full length film by Marc Recha. By the third 'les mans buides' -Empty hands-I promised myself not to cut my veins anymore. But this time the plot is completely different - a kind of tribute to Ramon Barnils (Sabadell 1940 - Reus 2001) a Catalan journalist -. The trailers in the trailer are amazing - a shining river bathed in sunlight - and the promise that Marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother - none of the two professional actors - finally convinced me six weeks after the release. Leave yourself in this very unusual road / river movie. Learn almost nothing about Ramon Barnil's but his most poignant legacy: his constant struggle against the amnesia of what we Catalans chose to forget. The 'La Batalla de l'Ebre' view of Ebro's beating wikipedia was not lost once, but twice, because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of half-hearted democracy, no one has done much to remember the legitimate side of Spanish civil war and them who fought for it. This film is about the lonely people roaming the same places with very little conscience about what took place there 70 years ago. This movie is about the landscape.
