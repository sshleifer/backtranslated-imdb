Seriously, any movie with John Malkovich is usually very good. And this includes Clint Eastwood, Rene Russo, John Mahoney (Frasier), Dylan McDermott (The Practice) and many more amazing actors. Clint gets old now, but thank you he is also a great instructor (in himself). We are used to Wolfgang "water film" like Das Boot, Poseidon and Perfect Storm - this was really different, but equally sublime. <br /> <br /> The murder premise is as serious as it comes, the movie is well paced, some of the violence is a bit ... But it is totally recommended (but not for children).
