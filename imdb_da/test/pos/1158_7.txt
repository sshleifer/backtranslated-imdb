This is a perfectly sophisticated adventurous movie to watch, with a great cast and a good story based on true events. It is interesting to note that the history of the film is based on true events. Above all, it is mostly an adventurous story with all the usual ingredients you would expect from an adventurous movie in an Arab world. So lots of sword fighting, good old-fashioned honor, religion and a richly proud country. But the film is also full of humor to make the movie a light and comfortable look. The constant cutting back and forth between the Morocco plot with Sean Connery and Candice Berger and the US plot line involving Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) was not the best possible approach in my opinion. The two things have completely different steps, quite different characters, they are just completely different worlds! Of course, both stories are connected and focused on the same, but the contrast between the two worlds is just too big to let it work. This does not always mean that the film feels connected and slightly uneven. The American plot line is most of the time more political, while the Moroccan plot line is purely adventurous and action-packed. In the end, you might also wonder what the whole point or Roosevelt in this movie was. See that John Milius is a great admirer of him. Often, the American plot line would take most of the pace out of the much more interesting and action-packed, full-length Moroccan plot line. Jo John Milius has always been at his best as an action director. <br /> <br /> It is only until halfway through that the film is completely on steam. The most and greatest scaled action of the movie then kicks in. Especially large-scale end fight does not disappoint. I wish the whole movie was like this. That way, this film would also have been a better known, no doubt. The movie has a great Jerry Goldsmith musical score, it may be better known than the movie itself. The film is also a nice look with great production design and nice look and battle sequences in it. On the other hand, the film costs only $ 4,000,000 to make, but it's really hard to believe, considering the movie's settings and size. I think John Milius's best-known movie "Conan the Barbarian" costs about $ 20 million, but was far more campy and less impressive on his scale. Very fun to see an Arabic speech with a great fat Scottish accent but hi, it's Sean Connery, so you simply tend to accept this. He fits well with his role. It also does Candice Bergen. It is always difficult for a female character to come across as trustworthy and train in a movie like this, but she manages. Also John Huston plays a big part in this movie! <br /> <br /> A great, serial movie! <br /> <br /> 7/10
