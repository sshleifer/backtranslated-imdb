I can't understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently only available through an Australian video company, but that's the unfortunate blur in this Peter Sellers classic. (Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide continues to provide the same BOMB review as they gave it in the 1970s). With so many stage performers on the screen, Sellers comes through with what may be his most hilarious role. It all begins with his discovery of a patient who expired at. 11:15, but Sellers claims the body is still alive because of the fact that the new day does not start before noon! The last straw for the besieged hospital commissioner comes in the big room, DO NOT DISTURB the sign still on the door; When he leaves the room (handkerchief holds his nose), there is a brief conversation with the doctor with him. Doctor: "We can't save them all! That man was at least 85! COMMISSIONER:" How old was he when he died, 63? "Harold Gould plays an infertile surgeon who closes his eyes when the knife digs in. Richard Lenz (whose" pompous ass "reporter in" The Shootist "was started at the back by John Wayne) plays the patient who exposes the fraud (he only came in in an X-ray box until they discovered he owns a house.) Also in the play (and providing some excellent country music) is Keith Allison, former guitarist for Paul Revere and Raiders, who also worked with Michael Nesmith on a few Monkees recordings (and co-wrote "Tales Municipal Court" with Nesmith in 1968's "The Birds, the Bees and the Monkees") Unfortunately, there is no record of this print, including a topless sequence of Uschi Digard near the end, also a scene with actress Kathleen Freeman (who wants to use green stamps to fund her operation), which is locked by sellers in his office, never be seen again (in the undeveloped version, he returns to his account or to find out that she has written in capital letters on the wall "UNFAIR PRICK"; his answer? "you spelled the wrong price!").
