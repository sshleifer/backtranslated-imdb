This is a "Revised" Riverdance presentation held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Of the three Irish "dance" musicals, which I saw in the mid to late 90s (which includes the first "Riverdance" and "Lord of the Dance"), I liked it here. <br /> <br /> I thought it was better than the original held in Dublin, Ireland because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful scene setting and it is eliminated for two from the original, which was not good to start with. This is just a very solid show with few weak spots. To be sure, there are some songs / dances that are just "fair", but no one is poor, which is great considering there are 20 numbers in total. The cast corresponds to the first Riverdance with the greatest exception for Colin Dunne replacing Michael Flatley as the featured dancer. Both are extremely talented. The big difference can be in their appearance with Dunne a small, goateed black-haired guy, while Flatley is the pure shaved blonde. I prefer Dunne because Flatley's ego is so big that he gets annoying at times. Fortunately, the female leader, Jean Butler, is still there and it is great to see: what graceful beauty and talent! Butler and the rest of these women have the biggest legs I've seen in dancers. I also enjoyed the dance of Maria Pages, a Spanish flamenco performer, and two guys: Daniel B. Wooten and Ivan Thomas. One number - with the two mating against Dunne and two other dancers -0 is called "Trading Taps" and is great fun to see, perhaps the highlight of the whole show. I also have no complaints about violinist Eileen Ivers. <br /> <br /> The "fast" Irish songs here appealed to me the most. I appreciated that the audience did not get in the way of the performance either with screams and screams as the women do in the "Lord Of The Dance" video.
