I watched this movie when it was broadcast on Life Back in 2004. I have never seen it since then, but have thought about it often. It left such an impression on me, I've searched it lately. I finally found it and realized it was made only for television. The film is fabulous - filled with great writing and acting. William Petersen is perfect as always. This movie left me speechless and in tears. It is a wonderful story of faith, love and compassion. Does anyone know how to get a copy of this movie for my home? Is it possible with TV movies? I would really love to see it again. This is a must have among my collection !!
