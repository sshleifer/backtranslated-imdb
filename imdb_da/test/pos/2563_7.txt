The trailer for this film focused so much on the chain (of course because it is so sensational) that it missed most of the film about a developing but rather simple executed relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they try to recover from their previous pain with each other. <br /> <br /> Of course, assuming a nymphomaniac in chains, it's not surprising that there are lots of implicit sex involved. But in essence, Black Snake Moan is a basic narrative of redemption and the healing power to help another person together. Maybe it's just myself, but I think poor Lazarus should have had his story focused on more. He is a hurting man after his wife leaves him, but we never quite see how helping Rae solve her past pain also cures him. It's just implied that it does - essentially, he plays the guide that helps the young Rae overcome his curse through a large oil chain and some blues. I like the story, but I wish it was a little more smooth and didn't have to rely on the sensational. The page signs were pretty decent if it was simple and I liked the music. The action was good enough, although I cannot be sure whether the Rae character is fully credible. But it could just be my naivety. <br /> <br /> All in all, I liked the movie, but I wasn't forced by it. Perhaps it is that I am too critical, but history seems a little too practical to be fully credible, and then, while it all seemed very cool, I could never really buy it. The chain thing was a little too far fetched for me. Nevertheless, this can provide some entertainment for those looking for dramatic redemption stories with a shot of blues. 10.7
