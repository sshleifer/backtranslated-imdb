You have to see it to believe it. Shot in Hollywood on the strip in the middle of the veil, everything goes back in the 70s, this cheaply made flick must really pack inland theaters back in the day. Then again I know it had a week's run. In fact, it's pretty funny. The play is terrible, the direction does not exist, but the hair, the clothes, the rotten pre disco music and the general out and out the blur of the story is insane. Sleazy, it's very dull. Highly recommended (if you can find it)
