I have nothing but praise for this mini-series. It's only about a year and a half old, but I've seen it twice already; with greater pleasure the second time than the first. I seriously think about seeing it again soon since I find it spiritually uplifting. It is a very tender romantic drama with such beautiful performances, sets, costumes, music and scenes that it has a resonance that places it almost in its own league among mini-series. <br /> <br /> Some others have commented on the difficulties of living as a lesbian in the UK in the 1890s. Nothing particularly difficult about it; It was only male homosexuality that was against the law that bad Oscar Wilde experienced at his great expense and as a great loss to the literary world. Anyway, I'm digging. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is important TV. It is perhaps one of the greatest tragic romantic dramas since Romeo and Juliet, but not in the conventional sense. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 from me. <br /> <br /> JMV
