I saw the first one when I was a teenager in my last year of Junior High. I got ripped off! I loved the special effects, the amazing places and the sample aspect and the flashback method to tell the story. <br /> <br /> Several years later, I read the book, and while it was interesting, and I could definitely see what Swift was, I'm trying to say that even though it's not as perfect as the Social Comment Book, It's like a story that the movie is better. It is more sensible to make it a long adventure than to have Gulliver back after every journey and make a profit by selling the little lillipop or whatever. It's much more arrested when everyone thinks he's crazy and makes a cameo anyway. As a side note when I saw Laputa, I was stunned. It looks a lot like Kingdom of Zeal from the Chrono Trigger video game (1995), which also made me like this mini-series even more. I saw it again 4 years ago and realized I enjoyed it as much. Really high quality stuff and began an excellent run of the Sweeps mini-series for NBC that followed it up with the solid Merlin and interesting Alice in Wonderland.
