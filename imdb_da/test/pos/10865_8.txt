I began to see this expecting the worst, I was happy to find out that the movie turned out to be fun, a bit confusing in parts, as when they all just started singing. It gave me a chance to see Daniel Wu start for the first time, he is a better actor than I thought, at times he seemed a little out of place. I thought purple storm deserves its release of Hong Kong legends, as it is different from most other HK movies, it's about a man's emotional battle when confronted with memory loss, it may sound corny, but when He eventually throws out what and who he actually is making the movie much more interesting. When you get into the movie you will find it stuck to it as if you are missing a bit, so much of the movie will make sense, for example, I missed a bit at first and I recommend to anyone who sees this they miss None of it. So I can say that this movie was worth watching and a grateful surprise to me that I enjoyed it.
