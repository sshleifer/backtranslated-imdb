Ghillie a remake of the teluguen "okkadu" is fortunately a clear version of the original. It packs the same blow and Dharani true to his cinematic brilliance delivers it with style and panache. A fluttering Vijay's career with the entrance of Surya and Vikram on the fray has got the much needed uplift with this movie. It may turn out to be the best movie Vijay has ever been on, considering the choices he has made since then. The hard-working actor seems to have lost his key to accepting talented new entrants both by industry and the public. <br /> <br /> The tightly twisted script that runs at the head of the neck is about Velu, a deliberate youth who wants to make a mark in the Kabaddi game (a popular game among boys in India). The events following the chance that meets Muthupandi, his rescue of the girl in distress, and how he juggles with the wishes and own shapes of his friends form the crotch and end of Vijay fits like a 'T' into the role and essays of a subdued and credible depiction of the boys next door. <br /> <br /> Trisha has more than one stereotypical Tamil heroine mantle to play. The role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble. With limited dialogues, Trisha utilizes her occasional subdued expression and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role. This is a classic case of a face girl who is going to become a professional actress. Trisha became my personal favorite for this movie. The movie ends in predictable lines, even though one has to credit the director to keep the audience guessing many things, including Trisha's changed decision to leave the country. Prakash Raj deserves a word of praise to give the perfect counterweight to Vijay's role. His almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent chinks in the hero's armor is a perfect ploy to keep the audience guessed. All in all, it is a fantastic movie that deserves at least one view. I give it a clear 8 out of 10.
