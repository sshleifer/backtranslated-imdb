(Review of the original 1950 version, not the restored 1980's). In a country where the king likes none, and no one likes the king, a shepherd and a chimney sweep from two nearby paintings come to life and run away. A portrait of the king who loves the shepherd, kills the real king and takes his place. A large bird, the titles of the wild birds, acts as a hero of battles and helps our two lovers. <br /> <br /> This is a weird strange movie ... no surreal, very very surreal. <Br /> <br /> The background style is very European, while the characters are Fliescher, Warner meets, but early arty Warner of the non-great characters. They move in both realistic and cartoon-like manner. <br /> <br /> It's a weird movie and it takes a bit to get in, but Peter Ustinov, as the bird is a rebellion, his kids and puppy are wonderful. There are police in rubber bands and a bear design that makes you smile. <br /> <br /> And there is deep philosophy in the movie about the existence of a world out there ... beyond a Metropolis underground city. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. There is something strange and unique about what rewards you if you join it for the whole trip. It's not perfect, but what the hell. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is searching for. If your local dealer DVD bin has the Capcom version (paired with Alice in Paris), buy it. It should drive you under ten bucks, probably around five and the price is definitely worth it, especially when you realize it comes with two full-length cartoons, two short cartoons and several nice commercials and other fun stuff.
