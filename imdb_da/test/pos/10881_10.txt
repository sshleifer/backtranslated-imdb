absolutely the best game for N64 ever. I say most that I was very disappointed in tomorrow, never die, but the world is not enough to be better than goldeneye (according to the website). I love goldeneye so much, I find something to do every time I play it. I myself made my own missions for the levels. Multi Player is the best of any game out there, and the graphics are amazing even now. The first day I got this, I remember they would go back and play all the bondage movies. Can you imagine driving the fast boat alive and dying and making those incredible jumps or battles of ninjas or jaws in the spy who loved me and moon raker. (I think fighting him in these games would be more fun then in aztec) how about chasing Sanchez in the carriages or scalling st. Cerils just for your eyes. Oh, let me get back to the game at hand. All levels are unique and allow for very fun killing environments. there are many places to hide so you can catch up on people (especially statue park) well this game is not worth renting you really have to buy it today.
