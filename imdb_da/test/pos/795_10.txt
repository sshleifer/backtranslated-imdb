Along with Cops, Goat is one of Keaton's two funniest shorts. Which makes it one of the best shorts ever made. This has a decent "plot" for a card and it forms a perfect line to hang some good gags. Keaton is wrong for a shattered convict (how the error happens is a classic) and then elude the authorities. Best gags - the bread line and t he "elevator".
