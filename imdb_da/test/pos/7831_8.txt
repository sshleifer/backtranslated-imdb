Ladies and gentlemen, we really got a winner here. In fact, we do not, but boy is this film an often hilarious and always entertaining horrible hoot of a stinker. Poor Alma (retrieval Julia Ruiz) suffers from an old Mayan curse that causes deadly poisonous snakes to grow inside the body. Alma and her enchanted shaman husband Brujo (Alby Castro, who feverishly overacts with delicious eye-rolling intensity) on a train tied to Los Angeles. Of course, a bunch of deadly vipers are lost so they can terrorize the disgusting range of passengers. Mallachi Brothers, working from an absurd script by Eric Fosberg, deals with the ridiculous premises and thereby creates a wonderful miserable piece of deliriously campy cheese. The rough CGI effects, the pathetically terrible common black Gardner snakes (which are scary rattlesnake sounds added to the soundtrack to bend them with a weak sense of otherwise non-existent threat), the plodding speed, the total lack of tension or momentum, the obvious scary stage-bound train sets, and especially the simply amazing "you must be kiddin 'me!" The over-the-top preposterous end is all really awesome in their very compelling horror. Even better, we have also played the game (if lama) from a non-named body, a nice smithy of tasty, female nudity, a funky hum'n'shiver score and lots of extremely rough and grotesque makeup f / x. Bonus point for the fact that the token annoying cutesy little girl is eaten by a large reptile and for the stoner engineer being caught smoker breaking out of a hollow bulb (!?). An absolute gut-bust of a kitsch howler.
