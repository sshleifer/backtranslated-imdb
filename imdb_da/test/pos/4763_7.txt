I think the filmographic descent can run like this. Be aware, thank you for having to look up. In 1967, Peter Yates, an ex auto racer, leads the English caper film "Robbery", where the most exciting part is a car race through London's streets, down the hills, where there are lots of children playing and all that. It is a success. A year later, Yates leads Bullet with starring Steve McCool, I mean McQueen, with yet another spectacular car crash up and down the San Francisco Hills with dumbfoundingly authentic engine sounds that seem to include double clutching, full race cams, no silencers, twelve cylinder engines under forty-foot caps, supercharged, super dupercharged, and all five thousand horsepower running at full tilt. Lots of pictures of McQueen's chewing gum-chewing visage scowling with concentration as he tries to bump another car off the highway, even though a passenger in the other car constitutes a shotgun. Chase is arranged by Philip D'Antoni. Bill Hopkins is driving the criminal vehicle. A year or two later, feeling a good thing, Bill Friedkin reckons with "The French Connection", which shows a hunt between a commander police car (Gene Hackman) and an elevated train in New York City. Lots of shots of Hackman's cursed face as he wrestles the battered car through the streets. Chase is arranged by Philip D'Antoni. Follow the Academy Awards. <br /> <br /> It feels good, a year or twice brings us "The Seven Ups" with a chase between a car operated by Roy Scheider, with lots of shots from Scheider's damned face as he tries encountering the other car operated by Bill Hopkins from the road, even though the criminal car certainly carries a shotgun passenger passenger. No hills in New York City, just bumps, but they are still sharp enough to raise the cars a few feet. The persecuted car crawls around a corner and strokes down a street where a dozen children play. Screaming by the screaming children as they are scattered by the pavement and allowing the car to zoom through. But once is not enough. The children immediately run back on the street and must repeat the retreat for the subsequent police car carrying Scheider. <br /> <br /> I once experienced a high-speed persecution on Philadelphia streets. Both criminals and police drove through the streets about 25 miles an hour and came to a stop at each stop sign and red light - very boring things to this movie. <br /> <br /> Talking about this movie, it's pretty good. "Robbery" and "Bullet" were cool. Everyone dressed nicely. But the New York movies are filthy. There are garbage everywhere and the metro station is covered with graffiti. Shoot outs and beat ups take place in vacant lots surrounded by crumbling brick buildings or in disposal dumps for industrial cabinets. <br /> <br /> The action is also quite good. Roy Scheider seems whippet slim. The other actors have faces made for the camera, especially Richard Welsh. And the story is engaging, if not totally unfamiliar. What is best about the movie is the way it captures New York City in almost complete indifference to human arrogance and nobility. At a funeral, the limo drivers with their collars stand up, bits hanging out of their mouths, kicking their cold feet together, bored completely by the ritual. The movie wants us to believe that The Seven Ups is an elite group of motionless police who stop for nothing to get the job done, and here it is a bit of a sale. They always seem to be threatening to do something unethical and illegal - throwing hell out of a suspect or physically damaging an inlaid and helpless hood - but they always fail to do so. (If they actually did, their characters would be lively and ambiguous, and we would rather have our heroes and villains of a more biblical nature.) Very fun, even if you've seen it before, and you may very well have one or second of his previous incarnations.
