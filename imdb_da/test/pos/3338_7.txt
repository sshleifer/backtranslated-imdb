George Sanders plays Saint for the penultimate time doing a good job out of a good script - with the usual good RKO thrown around. It is also a non-Charteris story that is chest with murder and good, pure fun. <br /> <br /> Thread 1: In New York, Police Inspector Fernack, the Templars friend is hit by a corruption scandal and a joke - ST comes from London to try to put things right. Nice and simple so far - but is there really more than $ 90,000 in the world? Thread 2: Another tale of a female raising on the people who murdered her brother, Wendy Barrie, manages to encounter some unpleasant men and make Saint fall in love with her to start. Including a baddie who was under their direct protection and in Fernack's basement - there is a scary shot of him (dead and staring) and those in a car when they take him back to where they had got him. Paul Guilfoyle as Pearly Gates must have been gay in this - witnessing in the beginning and the later mocking comment from ST that he was thinking of keeping him as a pet - and also did "Palm Springs"! Fernack was played by Jonathan Hale as usual, but this time with such a deflated attitude that what he really needed was a good slapping from Templar to experience him. <br /> <br /> Hays Office also made sure you got the picture to the right, all threads are tied up without tight bits. Worth looking at for all of us who like this kind of thing, but if Val Kilmer's version is your yardstick then you won't bother.
