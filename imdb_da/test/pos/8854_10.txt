The Thing is a milestone in film making and remains one of my favorite movies full-time. Despite the film's roots in science fiction, it is ultimately a horror movie that brilliantly balances splatter with psychological trauma. Today, over 25 years after the release, the special effects appear as an example of pure shine and effects, while Rob Bottin suffered a complete physical collapse for his art. It would be impossible to make the same movie today, as the studio would certainly insist on throwing a female character or a Paul-Walker type. <br /> <br /> An all-American science team in Antarctica is in turmoil when a foreign life form is able to completely absorb and imitate other life forms infiltrating their camp. Their confidence in each other is steadily encountering as they are becoming increasingly uncertain who is genuine and who is an imitation, and this "body-snatchers" scenario sees their numbers steadily down as one-on-one, they become victim of The Thing. When it is the corner, it manifests itself as another nightmare creature, the metamorphosis is always horrific and convincing. <br /> <br /> The helplessness, isolation, and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men without their situation and no way to help them reach is professional. The long hours of darkness and the rising snowfall give a bleak background for the terror that unfolds. Director John Carpenter has carefully chosen a team of brilliant character players, and each member of the team fits in perfectly with the part they play, whether it be the young and street-wise chef, the elderly and the wise doctor or the bitter and cynical helicopter pilot. The point is that no one here comes close to being an American badass superhero with blonde locks and a six-pack, and the movie's real strength is thanks to the poorest realism. The people who suffer from the screen are recognizable in our daily lives. <br /> <br /> Thing remains consistently entertaining and even impacts on repeated prospects. I have now watched the movie on more than twenty separate occasions and my amazement at the directional quality, the play and the special effects is immeasurable. My boyfriend prefers the high-school spin-off of the movie - The Faculty - which is a good and solid entertainment, but far more light hearted and whistful. However, she loves and recognizes Thingen's brilliance and thanks for it ... Because I couldn't stay with someone who didn't love this movie. <br /> <br /> A classic and then some.
