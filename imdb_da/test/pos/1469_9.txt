Going Down to South Park is a 1 hour documentary about South Park with interviews with Trey Parker and Matt STONE and all the other people working at South Park. There really isn't much to say, it shows South Park's history and what's required to make an episode. It's basically a behind-the-scenes of the show. It shows the various goods that South Park has made (it was really Comedy Central that put it out). It also shows the controversy caused by South Park. It also shows lots of fun clips from the show. It's a pretty funny documentary. Any fan of South Park should check this out. You can find it on youtube. <Br /> <br /> 9/10
