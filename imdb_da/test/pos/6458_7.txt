Axel Nordman (Cassavetes) appears on New York's dockyards looking for a job, but with a hidden past. He gets one on condition that he pays a kick back to surly crew boss Jack Warden. While looking forward to a friendship with the black man Sydney Poitier, who unfortunately leads to a gut-wrenching moral dilemma for a man we learn, typically runs from his problems. The film looks like Oscar wins on the waterfront feels like on the waterfront, and most importantly, plays much like the 1954 Kazan production. But the racial theme is pioneering for the time being. The black poetry and the white Cassavetes are treated as in all respects. It can even be called the first of the black and white "buddy" pictures, which later dominate so many action films. <br /> <br /> It helps the two leads play so well from each other. Nevertheless, the film's key flaws fail to indicate why crew boss Poitier initially pushes a friendship with dour Cassavetes. He really goes out of his way to make friends with the new arrival. But why he would cross racial obstacles to do so is never really suggested. One possible explanation is that Poitier will use Cassavetes as a farmer in his rivalry with other crew members Warden, but then it really comes as the guy. There is a hint of it in some of Cassavete's suspicious reactions, but beyond that, the relationship seems to be unmotivated. <br /> <br /> If there is a single stage shot in the whole movie, I couldn't spot it. Everything is done in seedy New York location, without the usual movie extras. In this way, it is an anti-Hollywood production, carefully dimmed even down to the nightclub scene, which in itself resembles a real posterity. I suppose sociologists would dub this pretty raw slice-of-life "a glimpse of the poor". <br /> <br /> But for all its virtues, as many are, the movie remains too close to Brando-Kazan's movie for comfort. Here, a fine unknown actor Kathleen Maguire gets the role of the redemptive girl friend, Warden, as the role of the corrupt work commander, while Cassavetes, like Brando, must suffer a bloody blow before regaining his moral standing and doing the right thing. Still and everything, despite the derived nature, the gritty urban drama retains enough of the original power to deserve a look-see.
