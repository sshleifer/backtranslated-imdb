Just like Baby Blue Marine again after 30 years. I still find it a comfortable and romantic movie that captures a time lost forever. The innocence and purity of a long time has truly been captured in this little film. The action is above average, and Richard Geres short look like a shell-shocked Raider Marine War Hero, holds a keen interest in any movie buff or gere fan. Jan-Micheal Vincent is at his best and looks and works like the "All-American" boy. The late Bruno Kirby (who was billed as B.Kirby, Jr.) has a carnal role as "Pop", a peacekeeping officer, Marine Corp rejects, dreams of coming home to his wife. If you're looking for sex, drugs or rock and roll, this movie isn't for you. If you are looking for action and adventure, the same applies. But if you want to resume a time in America of innocence, honor, romance and love, then Baby Blue Marine is a movie for you.
