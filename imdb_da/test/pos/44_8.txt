Lackawanna Blues is a moving story of a boy raised in a house by some rather unusual people. <br /> <br /> It's editing and soundtracks really pulling you into the story and letting you experience the movie as the author really meant to be seen. <br /> <br /> The music is really tied up in history, which made the characters alive. The editing made the story more progressive and captivating. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by some of the cast of the cast, especially S. Epatha Merkerson. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see one man's show with this movie author, Ruben Santiago-Hudson.
