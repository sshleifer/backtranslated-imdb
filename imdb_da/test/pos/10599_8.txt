I watched this movie hoping for a good laugh, but when I looked at it, I didn't stop laughing for a few weeks, they are such bad actors, and that made this movie so much more fun to watch. (BTW Ryan Dunn did not eat the toy car, he pushed it up in his ass). The random appearance of skaters and Vito's parts was great. Gimme some grapes Vito.! No, Valo, your grapes are in the store. I would not recommend anyone under 13 to see it, honestly they would not understand half of the jokes or what they were talking about. I love VLB and after watching this movie I couldn't help buying it or the Viva La Bam series. What is the deal with this stupid commentary? There must be 10 lines, what kind of Bull-sh1t is it? I should be able to write such a long time or so short as I want. I just keep writing until it tells me that I can actually send it. It's just a waste of time, I just expected to say what I wanted, it wasn't too much, but then I am told that I should continue to put in more, and then I correct myself on the spelling, so what if I don't spell anything right, you get what I mean still. This is ridiculously long. <br /> <br /> ~ Those who live by the sword are shot by those who do not
