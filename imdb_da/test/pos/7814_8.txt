I caught this for the first time a couple of nights ago on TV. I expected to adjust for a few minutes, but found myself fascinated by the movie. I ended up seeing it all and found it surprisingly convincing. The action of the three American leaders was quite good, especially for Alex Cord. He plays a gunslinger with some degree of vulnerability. Very different from how most of them are portrayed in westerns. He ended up in several situations where he was for the celebrations of mercy. The final shootout between the three leads and the evil ones was very good, just like the scene where the doctor digs a ball out of Clay McCord. Something cruel, but realistic. I have to admit that despite my first drawback of seeing a "spaghetti western" I ended up enjoying this movie quite a bit. I would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns.
