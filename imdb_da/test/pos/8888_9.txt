Black comedy is not always easy to sell. Now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful as a fargo, for example. But usually they do not often find large audiences. People seem to either put their thoughts on comedy or for serious chaos. There doesn't seem to be a big market for a good mix of both. Throw Momma From the train a pretty decent hit, but few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age. Danny DeVito almost hit this road all the way back from the park in 1987. DeVito plays a weird mother's boy named Owen, who seeks to get rid of his monstrous indulgent and unpleasant mother with whom he still lives. The mother is played by Anne Ramsey, who died shortly after this was released, and she is quite a caricature. She is tall, ugly, rude and indulgent. Although Owen hardly seems to be able to take care of himself, he desperately wants his mother to be expelled. He fantasizes about it in some really strange scenes, but he obviously doesn't have the courage to do it himself. This is where Billy Crystal comes in. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen's creative writer at a nearby community college. Larry is a paranoid, intellectual novelist who claims his former wife stole his novel and made millions of it. He is currently trying to write a new one, but can't even make a decent first sentence. "The night was ...." Owen hears Larry that his ex-wife was dead during an outbreak at the school's cafeteria. And borrowing the idea from Strangers on a train, Owen decides to travel to Hawai'i and murder Larry's ex-wife. When he seems to have done so, he expects Larry to return and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite fun, and even gripping. It is certainly never boring and often filled with surprises. The action is extraordinary, though Ramsey was a little over the top. Crystal is as good as he can be, and DeVito has always been undervalued as a performer. The film relies on a lot of physical comedy that usually works, often painfully. The movie uses some truly innovative editing methods in some scenes, and the off-beat tone is really refreshing. I have often been critical of the late 1980s as a time of artistic disadvantage and down right lazy filmmaking. Throw Momma From the train takes chances. Both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot. How many comedies are about a son who has his mother murdered? The movie is not too long and it's chock full of laughs. Authors tend to find it more interesting than the public, but it can still be enjoyed by almost anyone. 9 out of 10 stars. The dog.
