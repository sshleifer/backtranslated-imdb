I watched this movie when it first came out and never forgot it. My uncle Antoine is much, much bigger than the sum of it's parts. The film is resolved on a pre-adolescent sent to live with a relative in a small town in Canada. There are adventures that seem more or less typical, but below is a current building. MUA has a relaxed pace but has patience, the reward comes. I think the movie was the subtitle, and as with any non-English speaking movie I've seen, it's worth avoiding any dubbed version. Inevitably, dubbed movies reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors, with the added necessity of lip-sync lines that don't fit perfectly. The English-speaking Amarcord is, for example. A travesty while the subtitled version sings. My uncle Antoine is well worth finding and looking in French.
