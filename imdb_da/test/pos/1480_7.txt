All reviewers make a big mistake. This movie is not believed to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It was made for kids and teens in the late 80s or early 90s and as such it was really a movie of that time. If you hated that period or love the first movie so much that you can't even take a joke about it, then it's some waste, but only because it wasn't for you. The low budget here and the failure of Beastmaster 1 at the ticket office (amount less than four miles with a budget of nine miles) were, of course, the reasons for losing the seriousness of the original and saying it today. You can complain about the story, the dialogue or the logic, but again it was made to run, not to win races. If the film had tried to take itself seriously, it would be a total failure, but it does not do it for a second (in "our" world, Dar sees a cinema advertising The Beastmaster 2, said enough). To paraphrase Clint Eastwood from Dirty Harry movies: This movie knows it's limitations. It is more of a comedy / parody than normal adventure. Soundtrack (currently) was fantastic. The actors do not take that seriously, nor the obviously annoying "spoiled rich abrupt" role (played very well by young Kari Wuhrer). <br /> <br /> So if you're nostalgic to the 80s / 90s (cheese) culture, or you liked the first part and don't mind going out on a cheese frame, you're having fun with this attempt to revive Dar in the 90s (literary). This is not really the sequel to the first, and don't look at it if that's what you want. It's more of a "what if" fantasy sequel. As for "why different dimensions and not just other time" questions: When in history did we have the high winged humanoid creatures that suck the flash of bones (from the end of part 1)? By the way, the movie ends at the Zoo because of an attempt at a cheap (money) big finale. It is supposed to be the best place for Dar to show all his movements (he is the animal's manipulator).
