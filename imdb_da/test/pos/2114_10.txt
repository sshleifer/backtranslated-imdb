It was easy to get lost in the simple and light hearted humor of this year's best family movie ... Grand Champion. The story of a 12-year-old boy (Buddy) who, with the help of his sister, mother and best friend, is determined to raise a Grand Champion board. It is a whimsical trip to the great competition. After Hokey Pokey's crowned Grand Champion, he's auctioned at $ 775,000. To pay for kids college education. Buddy finds out that next time he sees Hokey .... it would be on a bowl! The kids interact to steal the award-winning star and vowing to save him from the grill. This is where the fun begins ... Julia Roberts, Larry Mahan, George Strait, Natalie Maines, Steven Bland, Tommy Guy, Tuff Hedeman, and so many more stars create the backdrop for all the antiques. You won't believe who actually won the board at the auction !!! (he looks good in a mustache) The soundtrack is rich with tunes from George Strait, Natalie Maines, Willie Nelson and more. Where else can you experience Stars, Country & Western stars and Rodeo stars .... only in Texas ... only in the Grand Champion. <br /> <br /> It's masterfully crafted "simple" little movie that can be the best movie you see this year. The film will open in selected cities on Friday 27 August. 2004. <br /> <br /> Another great movie by Rope the Moon and Michaelson Productions is IN A WHISPER. Keep an eye on the cable network for this!
