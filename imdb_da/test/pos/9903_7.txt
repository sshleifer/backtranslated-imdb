I was fortunate enough to catch this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival and I have to say that I very much enjoyed it. When I asked the director if he had attended the film school, I was very impressed that he didn't. Movies like these do not come from people without talent. To get started in advertising then produce a heart-felt family comedy as this shows true reach. I will definitely keep an eye on what he does next time. As a good indie film, the film must be very character driven. As apposed to your average Hollywood movie, which is mostly plot driven. The film is centered on a Jewish family in New York, Applebaums, who have all been invited back to their father's "suicide party". The film is filled with witty, fast, jabbing, dialogue. The fact that the little Jewish family is obsessed with being Jewish and anyone who is Jewish is the unrealistic situation of a "suicide party" in reality. Director Jeff Hare does a wonderful job of pulling the characters out of the actors and bringing them to life on the screen. The production design brings the sets to life with great attention to small details that make the setting feel like a home that has lived for 40 years. The editing stops the dialogue in such a way that it puts you in your seat and wondering who should stick with who with the next witty sentence or stroke line. And when appropriate, the film lowers to let the audience dive deeper into the meanings and motivations hidden within these lovable characters. If you're a fan of Woody Allen or movies like "As good as it gets", watch this movie.
