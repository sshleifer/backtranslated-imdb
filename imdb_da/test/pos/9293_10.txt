This show is up there with the best Comedys made in Australia, as it makes fun of just about anything that many of our people want. Some of the best bits in the show are the ad road test that tests how an ad would do in real life. What really is good about the show is how original it is and the fact that it has people (chasers) who love to do what they do and who wouldn't. This show has lots of bits in what can ruin anyone like the ad road test I have already mentioned, Mr Ten Question, where he asks 10 questions really quickly before famous celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Beach boys, temporary as The Chasers Emmys and those who have been there from the start as What have we learned from Aktuelt this week. Overall, I consider thin show 98%.
