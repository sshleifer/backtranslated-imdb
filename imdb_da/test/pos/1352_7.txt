Burt Kennedy both wrote and directed this western take from a novel. Kennedy was a well-known good writer and director, mostly western. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum was a star for over 20 years when he did this. This role was like many he had already done. One can see why he was a great star for so many years. <br /> <br /> He filled this role easily as a suitable glove. <br /> <br /> The title character is played by Robert Walker Jr. (his father a fine actor Robert Walker - died tragically at age 32 - his mother is known to actress Jennifer Jones). <br /> <br /> Robert was of weak build & although he only had talent made a few movies. (He was in Rita Hayworth's closest movie. <br /> <br /> VE TO SALINAS --- same year and was very good). <br /> <br /> He looked very much like his father, but seemed to lack his father's charm. He made only a few more films. He still lives and I wish him well. <br /> <br /> Most of his scenes are with another son of a Hollywood great. John Carradine's son David, still making movies. they have made a good team. <br /> <br /> In western you always have a female character and usually she is a dance artist. (Today they call them hookers), Angie Dickinson analyzes this role nicely. There are also Western Stalwarts, John Anderson & Jack Kelly. <br /> <br /> There were movies in Old Tucson) outside downtown Tucaon Az. & the landscape is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Typically, for the elderly western there is not too much action, there is some good humor and the usual ending shoots out. <br /> <br /> It's a quick enjoyable 89 minutes. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 10) 84 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
