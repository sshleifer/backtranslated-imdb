I grew up in New York City, and every afternoon the ABC showed the 4:30 movie. Saratoga Trunk was one of the first films I remember watching as a child. I loved this movie and it has been with me for years. I recently saw it again and still thought it was great - maybe I'm just a romantic - but I thought it was well done. I don't want to say that this movie was good only because of the main actors - I didn't know who they were when I first saw this movie - I guess I just knew quality as a child. Both Bergman and Cooper were excellent. I especially loved seeing Old New Orleans during the time of this movie. If you ever get a chance to visit New Orleans - you should watch movies showing the city during this time - when you see some of the old homes in the French Quarter (not just Bourbon Street) or uptown, You really imagine life as it was 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I love old movies - this one for me is a good flick !!
