I'm a big fan of this movie and found the TV mini series "Children of the Dust", the version fans should look for. At least 20 minutes or more will be cut on the DVD version of this movie. I would also suggest viewers who have had this movie to check the book there is a more rounded story with Corby / Whitewolf and Rachel more on Black History and Buffalo Solders. There were two many stories for the series or this movie. Sidney Poitier only shows that he is getting better with age, the talent continues to grow chemistry between his character Gypsy Smith and Regina Taylor were wonderful viewing. I also enjoyed Billy Wirth / Joanna Going's story, they seem to play well off each other. <br /> <br /> Of course, Billy Wirth is the "Model of Indian Vision". The look, the attitude, the dream of any woman who would be carried in one of the Romanesque novels of a native completely. Worked for me too. <br /> <br /> Much more could have been done with this story, but it gave the viewer a brief glimpse of racial problems back in the 1880s, whites taken over by Native American school, lack of black pioneers setting up western cities. Michael Moriarty (Maxwell) as always a great actor comes across as a very caring and confused teacher, not sure if the "whites" should interfere with the native culture. <br /> <br /> For anyone who enjoys characters and sees them change this movie is for you. I thought that chemistry between Poitier's character and orphaned Whitewolf moved very much and thought Wirth and Poitier worked very well together. Billy Wirth did some of his best scenes when working with Poitier. <br /> <br /> I sometimes get on my nerves when you just want to stop and shake her or give her a "wake up and adult call". But on the whole it was a good evening of entertainment. Look for the two tape versions of this mini-series, if you are a fan then you will really see the difference.
