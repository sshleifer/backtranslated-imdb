Hollywood is one of the best and the beautiful things that had happened in my life. I admire and am very fascinated by the way Hollywood generates ideas and implements them. It makes me wonder the extent of human brain. I saw Flatliners a long time back, but the story, the direction, the cast and of all the actions are still fresh in my mind. The story begins with our leading actor Sutherland saying during sunrise "what a beautiful day to die". For all of us, it's a story that shows emotions that are sometimes held back in our minds throughout our lives. Never able to understand a few things in life. It shows us to be motivated and improve our quality of life. Still, I suggest it to anyone who sees it once.
