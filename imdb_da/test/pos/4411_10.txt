"Meat" is difficult to describe with a solid summary, because it is well not essentially a plot. The film shows just about the day in the life of a hustler named Joe (Joe Dallesandro, who is in the undervalued Louis Malle image "Black Moon") when he makes his rounds, sleeps and models around for cash in the money pay for his wife's lover's abortion. Not much, and since the movie is quite a long 90 minutes, you would think "meat" would be a slow and dull one and a half hour. You seem wrong. The film consists of improvisation, no manuscript, and the film's angles are also beautiful on the spot, but there is a kind of truth under each frame that gives the film its demented entertaining lifestyle. Everything makes sense and serves purpose in what happens to Joe this day. He meets a regular John who apparently lies when he says he wants to see Joe again, a photographer who speaks so much that it drills Joe to tears, two dragons reading out of tabloids when Joe receives his head a mousy-voiced abuser who mumbles later on how she wants a breast lift, an old friend of Joe who reads he-to-man rape cases to him, and saw a final scene with his wife and her boyfriend who honestly echoing the scene at the start of the movie (one of the best openings for a movie I've seen for some time)? and fully tells what the film is overall philosophical about. It is amazing how the film's messages and styles feel almost timeless, even though it is set in the New York City in the 1960s, in real time, in real-life locations, and is admittedly an obviously independent flick from that era. It is certainly not a movie that could be made today, adding to its delicious mystery. <br /> <br /> Burned by unexpected cuts; and missing a score to promote his pictures ?? "Meat" is as raw, gritty as a movie about male prostitution in the 60s can get.
