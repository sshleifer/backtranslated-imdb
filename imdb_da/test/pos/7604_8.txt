This movie turned out to be pretty much what I expected. Of course it is juicy, of course it is predictable. We all know the adventure. But knowing that when you go to see it, it is pleasant enough to see. It was fun and sweet. I found it annoying that they showed geeks as either children who do not wash hair or children who loved math and joined clubs on math and had T-shirts on math. I was excluded from high school and I didn't do these things. It goes much deeper than that. Having to deal with many things, some of which are how much money your family has, how much you are willing to hide your unique and what means you are willing to be for other children. Anyway, I don't want to get into it. I do not agree with other opinions that Drew does not convince as a geek. With hangers, no makeup and unwashed hair, I don't think many people would throw themselves over her. And even when she goes back to high school and throws these things. She still has the "wrong" clothes, "wrong" hair and has the "wrong" attitude to be considered cool. And her other "geek" friend can be beautiful, but it doesn't matter where I come from, you can still be excluded and be beautiful. (in and out)
