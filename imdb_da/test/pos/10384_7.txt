"Beyond the Clouds" is an over-the-top artistic group of four vignettes, each with a glimpse into a relationship between man and woman from the heavy to the turbulent. Although the film offers outstanding filmography, exquisite visual beauty and a cast of fine artists, there is little meat on the bones of this fragmented work. A taste of a relationship cannot give the fullest and synergism suggests that much more can be achieved with a story of 2 hours than with four. Nonetheless, "Beyond the Clouds" is a diet for dilettants and a visual feast for everyone, albeit superficially, lacking in substance.
