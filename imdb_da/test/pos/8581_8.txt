I've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it. The conversation between Nimi and her mother plus Nimi and Matthew is very touching. The Nigerian community is certainly very truthful and as colorless as it usually is. <br /> <br /> Although some things could have done with a little more explanation; If we knew why Matthew was in the South of France at first, the scenes after Matthew would be found in his car be more understandable. Fortunately, Optimum Releasing has a website that has detailed production notes that help make such scenes better understood. <br /> <br /> I would go and see it again, but unfortunately it had a limited release in London and is no longer available for viewing. I hope the video release makes it a bigger audience because the movie deserves it.
