Oppenheimer was a big series (that was the first thing I saw Waterston in) and it is too bad that copies are not available. A similar situation exists for "Glory Enough for All", a British series from around the same time about the discovery of insulin. I would pay a good price for both of these on DVD. Is it really that hard to get Oppenheimer on a DVD that can be played in the US? Another very entertaining series, again from about the same time, was "Dare UXB". A series about defusing UneXploded Bombs, thus the name. The one you can get from your local library. <br /> <br /> Pete
