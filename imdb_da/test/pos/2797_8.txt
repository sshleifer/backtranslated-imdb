As a European, the film is a good decline for my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences I had lived abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so you would think he was pulling on this experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting how the film balances the message that "one should not generalize" in the sense that "for each stereotype there is some underlying truth". For example, the Italian character is more based on the pothead aspect than on a well-known Italian stereotype. The German character has a few more proven stereotypes. But the most stereotypical aspect of the movie is not a sign, but the central theme of adultery. As critics observed, adultery is just as crucial for French film, as the class is for British film. <br /> <br /> Both the protagonist and his girlfriend are played as not quite sympathetic, which I think is conscious and great. It may be unintentional, but some of the citizens have elements that can be taken as a metaphor for their country's perceived role in the EU. The British woman has a fling with an American (who is an entertainer - as an American president in 1980), while the Frenchman appears as the natural leader (when the landlord appears). <br /> <br /> Although Europe is not as different as New York, it is striking that we only see two non-white characters. One is a Chilean woman with native traits who, despite the emergence of our main character, is not portrayed as a potential object of interest. Another is a Gambian-Spanish or rather Gambian-Catalan man who seems a little invented. <br /> <br /> One can ask why Klapisch chose protagonists, all of whom were from long-established EU countries in Western Europe. While these nationalities reflect what he and I would meet as students in the 1980s, I believe that exchange programs in today's Europe are much more diverse. The Erasmus program comprises approx. 30 countries from Iceland to Eastern Europe, many of which are not EU members. However, I understand that the choice of nationalities, which is more widely known to the majority of viewers, may have been considered necessary not to distract from the contrast Klapisch wants to create between peoples' Europe and bureaucratic Europe. <br /> <br /> In spite of minor grips, a great movie that made me consider going back to Europe is a living. A French friend of mine, also a foreigner in the United States, caught our common feelings in this contrast "If Europe were more like the United States, I would leave the heart."
