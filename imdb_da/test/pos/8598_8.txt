Well, where to start? I stumbled upon this one in 1993 and just hit "record" on the VCR out of habit more than anything else. "Citizen Kane" that's probably not ... but if you have had a bad day and are in the mood to throw in front of something that is not too intellectually stimulating, then for the time being I suggest it might just be your "thing". <br /> <br /> We have a lot here - great title tracks, more stereotypes than you could shake a stick on, unconscious comedy, the bitchiest battle scene all the time and more, more! David Hemmings plays the diametrically opposite of his role in the 60s classic "Blow Up" - still a photographer who is still hormonally stimulated, but not "totally" the same. John Philip Law is easy to slam as an actor making a logbook seems to be rude, but it would not be fair to see how he had about 5 minutes notice before accepting the role. <br /> <br /> Wexler as "Amanda"? It was enough to say that it was her only and only film role! The real star of this movie, however, is Ethel Evans, who plays one, we must say secretary (?), With the morale of a gray cat and an ambition to match. The way she manages to unite her present life with a future of the future with her comic man-to-be is actually touching in an earthly, gritty what is to be. <p> <p> br /> I actually love this movie when I'm in the mood for it ....... and wouldn't touch it with the crazy bargole when I'm not. <br /> <br /> Kudos to throw to hold a (relatively) straight face when filming. <br /> <br /> A "classic" in Edward D Wood School of cinematic endeavors!
