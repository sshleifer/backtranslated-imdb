The first episode of 'Man to Man with Dean Learner' that was just aired was at least the bottom of most episodes of 'Garth Marenghi's Darkplace' and had me on "My Maisonette". Hope it stops the good work of "faux fear" on my TV. Richard Ayoade is one of the best in the new breed "alternative comedy" (I hate this phrase but is also lazy to think of another.) Comics on television today. I'm glad that on a tour of local DVD dealers today "Garth Marenghi's Darkplace" was sold out across the board. Even from his short stint in Nathan Barley, I knew that Ayoade was a serious talent and I'm sure he would have been great as Dixon Bainbridge in 'The Mighty Boosh' for continued success! In the way of these programs, I also felt it was necessary to extend my review to secure a place in this public area.
