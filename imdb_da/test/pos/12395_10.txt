First, I considered this movie 10/10. For me it is simply one of the best I saw since I was born (I'm 23, but I saw so many movies). The story is cruel, but the reality is, isn't it? It went deep into me and shook my heart. I saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me - and I still remember it! <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is no "national preference" (this term is a direct translation from the French) to this movie. I mean it's not because it's a French movie, I put it so loud: it really caught me when I saw it. Besides, I don't know Marcel Carne's filmography, so I don't know if it's his best movie, but I know it's not his most famous: Hotel du Nord, Quai des Brumes and Les Enfants du Paradis are the most famous. <br /> <br /> Third, the movie is in B&W, but it deals with inter-temporal issues of youth (not acne) like love, friends, and studies in a modern way. It can even be restored frame by actual young actors, a Dolby (tm) sound and special effects (a car crash), it would still be a good movie! Problem: Maybe it's a movie seen by young adults (from 16 to 25 years old) - and of course - because its message is well understood ... Did I say it was a good movie?
