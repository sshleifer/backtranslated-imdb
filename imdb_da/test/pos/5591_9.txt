This story of the problems caused by an over-possessive, overwhelming, dominant and conscientious mother (Laura Hope Crews) for her two adult sons and their girls, is a powerful vehicle for stellar performances by Irene Dunn (the new daughter law), Joel McCrea (number one son), Eric Linden (number two son) and Frances Dee (fianc√©e of second son). Here, the exhibition of the pure tyranny of the mother's zeal and possession is run amok, as four good people find their own life damaged, their plans changed and their own identities in danger. Irene Dunn is the star of her role. Joel McCrea's performance is open and clear, and Laura Hope Crews is masterful as the mother. <br /> <br /> But this reviewer finds Frances Dee's performance the best of all. Hers is the first sign in history to show the strength of her inner feelings. Her depiction in her heartbreak broken-engagement scene is gut-wrenching, and even raw. Dee yanker around and steers you into her pain without even showing her face! <br /> <br /> Frances Dee, as Laura Hope Crews, has long been overlooked and is now almost forgotten as the magnificent actress that she was. No actress who started filming after World War II has had something to talk about at Frances Dee. <br /> <br /> If you are fortunate enough to watch The Silver Cord, which was never released on television, you will find this "old-fashioned comic book drama" to be an excellent movie that shows just over 74 years after its release. in 1933, because it is filled with amazing performances.
