This is at least very close to a perfect video publication. Messianic metal group, rock musician's dinosaurs, largest and most influential heavy band in the world play their hit songs and reminiscent of the band's past - what more do we need? <br /> <br /> Video starts from "war wine" and ends in "Paranoid" and in the middle are all the biggest and most significant classics in the original line-up included: "Electric funeral", "Sweet leaf", " After forever, "Iron man", "Children of the grave" ... and of course my personal favorite "In the void", I'm glad they didn't leave it. Well, how could they? <br /> <br /> Still, this video is more than just the music. Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward go over the group's colorful history. The only thing that disturbs me a bit is when a live song is interrupted with interviews. For example, is it necessary to state how the song "N.I.B." got that name right in the middle of it - one on top of the other? I doubt. It's still a small mistake, so it's not too big. <br /> <br /> Band members also make chairs around and talk together: comfortable material for a Sabbath fan! I admit that I'm having trouble following what Ozzy Osbourne mumbles, but it's just fun. I had a privilege to attend when "The Last Supper Tour" entered Finland, and for me personally, this video is an ideal way to remember the magnificent show.
