Bit of a curate egg, this one. I began to hate it, with the predictable 'Old Dark House' setup, it's constant references to recent American horrors and regular journeys up and down dimly lit corridors. <br /> <br /> But it starts and has It is moments of originality. I started to wonder when the kitten started out how to endure only a six-throw, but then we get flashbacks for a previous visit to the building and see a whole bunch of gory kittens that are quite effective. <br /> <br /> Naschy is fine, and in the end it has been an enjoyable enough movie. It just doesn't jump up and grabbed one, hard enough.
