I chose "The English Patient" for a historical extra credit. I thought this movie would be incredibly boring. Instead, it has become one of my favorites. It describes life in World War II exactly, and the love story is amazing. The love story made the movie so incredible. I felt this interesting feeling, passion or something. It made me see the movie again and again. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes are great actors, and the way they played their characters is amazing. The look wonderful together and actually seemed to be in love. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie to be seen as a leisure activity or a task.
