Okay, "pretty good" doesn't scream at me, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the Campfire Tales. Under no circumstances a classic, the directors involved have an idea of ​​what is excitement. The scares do not just jump at you, but instead the directors constantly control the climatic moments. The film is based on popular urban legends and ghost stories. The authors have updated the stories quite well and twisted them equally well that the well-known conclusions still pack a blow. The best shorts are "The Brunch" and "People Can Lick Too", I enjoyed both as they have a good excitement in every story. "The Locket" was a good ghost story, and the cover "The Campfire" is also good unless they go for too many phrases at the end. The only disappointing segment is "The hook", which is fine because it is quite short anyway. All in all, I give this a 7 out of 10. It has excitement that is missing from most horror movies today and it works well by the player. It can't be judged up there with Halloween and The Exorcist, but it's a good little movie worth the price of a rental.
