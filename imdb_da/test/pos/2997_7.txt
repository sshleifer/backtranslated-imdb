I caught this flick on the track of a tape I had used to capture a movie I really wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening point, I decided to see it. In fact, it was mildly entertaining and took me back "in the back-up" to the Faroese films that Hollywood beat out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff. Oh the actor wasn't great, nor was the plot, but it was worth seeing. There was some lovely landscape, although Mrs Welch gave it the most pleasant of it. Tap it if you get the chance and see it when you absolutely have nothing else to do. It's not a snoozer, but it won't make you roll in the hallways that want more.
