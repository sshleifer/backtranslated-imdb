WARNING: May contain some minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say anything bad about this movie, except one thing. You won't see much more !! !! So again, maybe it's because you have to be home in the morning or 3 o'clock to catch the Fox Movie channel. <br /> <br /> Too bad, because this is another gem lost on time, Clifton Webb takes his patented sour, know-it-all attitude he had perfected as Lynn Belvedere ("Sitting Pretty" and sequels) and become 'Nature Boy'. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is. <br /> Webb plays Robert Jordan host to a Sunday children's education program that loses audience sharing, and the network disrupts him from doing something else. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is due to the fact that the married host does not have children. <br /> <br /> BUMMER !!! But when such things happen, the local church pastor has a head of a troubled squad of Boy Scouts and finds a willing victim ... ahhhh 'VOLUNTEER' ... in the host, so Jordan takes his position. <Br /> <br /> Problem solved, RIGHT ??? <br /> <br /> ERRORS !!! This is a movie, there are other problems. <br /> <br /> For example, one of the scouts turns out to be the son of his boss at the TV station, giving a little friction; Especially since the baby is overweight, has asthma and an attitude. <br /> <br /> And he's the more sensible. <br /> <br /> Also, this Cub Scout, Mike (George Winslow) who wants to hang around is the "combed puppy" type. As it turns out, the reason he doesn't have any of his own but is cared for by a relative who doesn't have that is a lot of time for him. <br /> <br /> These are things that make your work harder than expected. <br /> All in all, Webb becomes more understanding for children, saving not only its show but learning a rewarding lesson and finally adopting Mike himself. <br /> <br /> Still a great movie after all these years.
