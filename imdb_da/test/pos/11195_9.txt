Nuri Bilge Ceylan's 2002 film Distant (Uzak) - his third feature film (his first was 1997's black and white The Small Town-Kasaba), is a significant step from his good but flawed 1999 film Clouds of May (Mayis Sikintisi). The previous film had potential but reeked of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst ways-plot holes and wood appearing from amateurs. The fact that Clouds of May succeeded at any level was a testament to Ceylan's talent as a budding filmmaker. Distant, however, is Ceylan's arrival on the international scene as a great artist, one of which has many of the same qualities as other fantastic filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman (although his manuscript is not so dialogue-heavy, it is equally brooding, and he lacks Bergman's sensation of close-ups - his shots are usually long shots for exterior and medium shots for interiors) and Yasujiro Ozu (whose penetrating scenes of contemplation Ceylan reconfigure). Most of the film takes place in snow whales Istanbul (the fact that it is snowing in Turkey will probably surprise some), which gives the film a certain Bergmanian feel, and to remind one of the gloomy snowy cityscapes of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Decalogue . The natural images claim the best of Werner Herzog - as they usually go on a stroke or twice longer than standard film theory will dictate - which makes them even more memorable, while urban landscapes range from the almost precisionist compositions of Michelangelo Antonioni to Woody Allen's Cultural Hagiography - a shot of a bench overlooking water is a direct quote (read stealing) from Manhattan, hiding the lack of the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. In another scene, Ceylan also quotes a famous shot of a ship in the port of Ozu's Tokyo Story. Yet, like all the great artists, Ceylan makes its grants its own art by modifying them and keeping them in line with the needs of his own film. Far away is a movie whose title is sufficient for the characterization of the film, and the feeling of some viewers will have against them, but it does not describe the film itself, because scenes remain with a long time after the end of the film. Perhaps the most memorable scene and picture of the movie comes when Mahmut steals his ex-wife at Istanbul Airport and looks at her with her new husband as they head aboard the plane who will remove her from her life forever. As he looks at her, we see her only a glance at him who looks at her. Will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this movie. He retires behind a pillar, and Nazan returns only to her future. Mahmut is her past and she knows how best to move on - just keep moving. Mahmut will never get it. Most rarely get such moments of insight into life itself. The fact that some viewers get the film and that Ceylan gets his own creation powers shows that ignorance can teach as long as one moves. Remotely does it, albeit the same length.
