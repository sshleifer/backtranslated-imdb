The scary and humorous rescue scene helps make this one of my favorites in the 14-movie series. Wonderful play, great cast. And this film contains one of the few frequently noted facts about Sean Bean's career. The part where he and Alice Krige fall out of the horse in the water was not written, but was left behind when they both went right to act after it happened. <br /> <br /> This is a good follow-up to the intense ending of Sharpe's Enemy.
