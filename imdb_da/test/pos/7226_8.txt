Who else than Troma can take the classic tragedy and change it to today's standards ???? Nobody .... in my opinion Leonardo DiCaprio sucked one. Tromeon & Juliet is a particular stretch from the original Shakesperan tragedy, but it stays well. Its sick, demented, twisted, yet insane fun and satisfying. Mostly, the true Romeo and Juliet follows history, but many Troma elements are added. Will Keenan gives a good performance as Tromeo. The plot is solid and the story is amazing. Many people overlook these movies, not just the Kaufman Troma films, but all those they distribute. Safe Troma film is an acquired taste, but you should see some of these. It is dismissed cabinet at the best.
