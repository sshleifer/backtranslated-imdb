A very insightful psychological thriller! Footprints is a stylish example of the 70's powerful Italian film production. And Luigi Bazzoni, a mistakenly underrated director and visually stunning 'author'. The film develops its unusual plot with an incredibly exciting atmosphere and never disappoints, especially in its sad and dramatic finale! Florinda Bolkan delivers an outstanding performance, lots of shades and touch of sensitivity, to depict a dark lady who is not only fascinating, but also painfully genuine and tragic lonely. But all the throw is also a treat! Lila Kedrova, Nicoletta Elmi (the mysterious children at the beach), Italian acting specialist Caterina Boratto and amazingly beautiful B-movie dreams Evelyn Stewart in the lead's friend's short but joking role! And Klaus Kinski in a surprisingly disturbing cameo! It is strange to see how incredibly well done movies like Footprints were! Vittorio Storaro's humorous and eerie filmography, stylized places and sets, Nicola Piovani's ghost score and, above all, the story, so intense and disturbing, so intelligent layered and structured! A thriller with amazing elements, but especially with a soul and a personal vision. I wish movies like Footprints would not be forgotten! I wish the movies were more insightful and personal today as they were back in the 60s / 70s! And yes .. I want someone to soon make a digital remastered widescreen DVD out of this little masterpiece!
