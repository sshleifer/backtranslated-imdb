I can't even imagine why everyone hates this movie so much. It literally shot me with laughter several times ("I trust you slept well?" "In fact, we had a hard night." "Ah, the dangers of infidelity."). <br /> <br /> Finally, the end is a bit flat, but still has its moments (the boogger ball's obvious fake spalsh flying in the sea, "beach house paradiso"). Personally, I think it's the funniest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
