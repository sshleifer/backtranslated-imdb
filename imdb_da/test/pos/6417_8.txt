Footprints are definitely not your average operation of the mill Giallo, and that's not bad. In contrast to his previous efforts, the fifth line (which was your "classic" Giallo) Luigi Bazzoni's movie disappears almost all of the Giallo trademarks and instead of murdering; The focus is on psychological mystery. It is obvious from the start that this will be a completely bizarre movie, as the film opens up with a scene on the moon. Things don't become clearer after that, as the moon's order turns out to be the dream of Alice, a troubled woman. Alice is plagued by dreams of an astronaut stranded on the moon, which apparently comes from a display of a movie called 'Footprints on the Moon'. After several things go wrong for her, Alice decides to go to a mostly abandoned former tourist resort called Garma. At her arrival, she is surprised when the people she meets seem to know her already. Alice also meets a young red-haired girl who also seems to know her already; The girl tells Alice that she looks like Nicole, except for nicer and shorter hair. <br /> <br /> The fact that Footprints does not have much in the way of sex, murder and other Giallo trademarks puts it a little backwards with the primary audience from the beginning as most people enter this movie will not Get what they expected (or probably would). But on the other hand, Footprint orders respect for the fact that it doesn't just go beyond what went before it. In 1975, Giallo had begun to lose its popularity, and many of the films that came out during this period (with a few notable exceptions) were just retreads of what was before, so Luigi Bazzoni would have taken a big chance on this movie . Florinda Bolkan gives a strong performance in the lead role; And the fact that she is not the most beautiful Giallo heroine is not really important. The mystique builds nicely throughout, and although it can become a little turgid at times; Footprints are generally exciting for the duration. It probably won't come as a surprise to many when they get there, the end doesn't make much sense, and certainly not quite something; but it adds fine to the movie's bizarre cult value and all in all; I give footsteps a thumbs up!
