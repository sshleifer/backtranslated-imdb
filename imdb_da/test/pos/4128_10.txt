"The Buddy Holly Story" shows the famous singer's beginnings in Dunk Lubbock, Texas, for his rise to the star, for his tragic death in a plane crash. Strengthened by Gary Busey, like Holly, playing his own instruments, this movie is the biopsy in its purest form. There are some things that seem a little choppy, namely the people of Lubbock who are considering rock'n'roll to be the devil's music, but the mastery beliefs outweigh any weaknesses. If there is only one thing that is safe in this great big world of ours, Buddy Holly's music is never obsolete. Whether it's "It will be the day", "Peggy Sue" or another of his songs, they still sound good after all these years. He is still one of the greatest singers in history. <br /> <br /> Just to show what Lubbock really thought of their most famous son, they didn't name a street after him until 37 years after his death! What a lot of inspiration!
