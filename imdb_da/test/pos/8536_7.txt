First, to rent or watch this movie, you expect something in the B-horror series. What this movie delivers to the magnificent fan of this genre is quite a hilarious hull of Nordic flavor. Sometimes reminds me of the mood of Jackson's Dead Alive and others of a Stuart Gordon flick, this little one should find the most chuckling all the way through. <br /> <br /> F / x reaches a couple of heights of really creepy (first time Ed meets with his nemesis), but generally has the feeling that this movie was put together by of / x team who decided to use any and all props at their disposal from other movies ... gremliner, devils, slasherfilm etc. for quite good effect and worked in through the use of hallucinations. <br /> <br /> The movie clip is humorous. Gore works most of the time, but more for laughs. At his heart it is a parody and a fun thing about it.
