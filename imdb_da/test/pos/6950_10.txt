This is an incredibly compelling story, told with great simplicity and grace. The story itself is the subject of the film, even though the scene is beautiful. The play is underestimated, even amazing, because the characters themselves come through in all their eccentric simplicity. <br /> <br /> This work of art is unlikely to be appreciated by those who watch movies "randomly" without blame. It requires work to be brought into the story, but when you get involved, the captivity is complete!
