Francis Ford Coppola's first 'personal' film, released and published in 1969, was the last film he made as a mostly unknown, up and coming director before The Godfather and contrasts sharply with both that movie and the rest of his uneven career. It is apparently a roadmap involving a disconnected young woman saddened by her homely life, and pregnant with a child, she is not sure she will, escaping her tedious marriage and hitting the open path of freedom search. Along the way, she is friendly with a lovely man, a former football player who has suffered brain damage due to a traumatic head injury, played in an unexpectedly subtle manner by a young James Caan, and decides to "help" him, despite being frustrated with its simple ways. Her efforts to get rid of him always fail, either by guilt or coincidence, and eventually lead her directly to an emotionally wounded policeman (Robert Duvall) who has his own ideas. The plot is blurry, but Coppola does a good job of explaining the emotional life of these people and uses editing techniques to relay stories that were not common at American movies at the time. Shots are simple but extraordinarily effective, conveying both the open highway moody desert and the emptiness of the American suburban life infused with a gentle melancholy from the film's score. Coppola also deserves credit to address the issue of domestic dissatisfaction from the point of view of women in the culturally turbulent 60s. All in all, a rather low-key movie, which is not what the audience expects from Coppola, but one that is a minor triumph in its own quiet and modest way. 7.5 / 10.
