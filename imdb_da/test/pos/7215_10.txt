This was the best movie ever seen at "Germens Cine Club" (Buenos Aires). This film is a realistic criticism of the past society and the next century. It gives a very good impression to all partners in the "Germens Cine Club". I recommend this movie to all fans of Troma and to all the people who like the good movies, not the commercial movies.
