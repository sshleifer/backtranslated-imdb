No more corned beef and cabbage for her! <br /> <br /> This little romantic comedy clips from scene to scene with a few exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and a costume party). All of this is centered on the spouses' wife who is looking to break out of the doldrums, played by Gloria Swanson (she is twenty here!). Both leading men have a natural air that is compelling, and of course, Swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods, from relentless to anxious to hoping. <br /> <br /> Behind all the games and the seemingly light heart is the old serious problem of falling in love and not rejecting in love. There is little corniness, but director DeMille is on top of keeping it snappy and trustworthy on the whole. As with many films from this period, the subtitles not only tell what they say (or think) but often give some sort of philosophical insight, as if to justify the tragedy (or racial). And there is the higher purpose here, probably better without the instruction text, but it is part of the narrative style, and it is a little quaint. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for visual or formal wonder, you can't find it here. But as a story, well-acted and filmed with precision and economy, it really is a good example. The events may not come as a total surprise, but it is such a modern love story set almost a hundred years ago, it's a gas. And did I see that Swanson was perfect?
