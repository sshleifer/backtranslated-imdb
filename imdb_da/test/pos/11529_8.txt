If I look hard enough, errors can be found in this movie, primarily with the script. I found Wolf's character not quite convincing. But that was my only "complaint". Because when this movie started on Cable, I was just recording it and watching it later. But from the beginning, I was riddled with the eerie music, and Cameron Diaz made her distant 60's dance. I never came up until the movie was over. It seemed like I never blinked. <br /> <br /> The action of Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster was excellent. The scenes were beautiful, the girls were beautiful, and the music was haunted and very touching. The story was unique and sometimes had a surreal quality. The viewer would tend to like the picture more if they had a good understanding of the young state of mind in the 60s and 70s, especially in America. Many of the scenes largely managed to show some of the hard-earned era. It was a little more complicated than the simplified sentence that they wanted to change the world and ended up disillusioned, though perhaps the most obvious aspect. Phoebe learns more and more about this when the film progresses. <br /> <br /> One aspect that apparently was not covered by the other reviewers who had to mention is the way the two daughters seem to slip through life after their father's death. They both had worshiped him, and his presence had been a stabilizing factor in their lives and of course he had loved them deeply. We read so much today about boys who lose their fathers prematurely, only to lose their way themselves. This film covers the ripple effect of the loss of the father on daughters left behind, first on the older sister Faith, and then on to her younger sister. Their mother feels inadequate to try to be both parents. This type of dynamic is not covered by hardly any other film, especially in so many different layers of plot and subplot. Phoebe's inner struggles of reality versus perceptions are gradually peeled as the layers of the onion. <br /> <br /> Talking about plot, this movie should be higher than it has here. I kept waiting for a great conspiracy to find out about the death of faith. How it solved itself surprised me even though others may have guessed much earlier. <br /> <br /> Maybe not for everyone, but I could see the movie many, many times.
