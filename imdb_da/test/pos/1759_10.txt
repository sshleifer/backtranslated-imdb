I first looked at it in black and white, around Christmas in the early 60's when it was shown on British television. I was completely connected and saw it again when it was repeated on TV (possibly only two or three times as it happens - if we only had video recorders!). As outlined by other contributors, the plot describes the return of Hoppity the Sprinkhoppers after a period spent away to a forty American city. He finds that everything is not when he left it, and his good insect friends (living in the "lowlands" just outside the garden belonging to a songwriter and his wife) are now threatened by the "human" who are trample through it broken fences that prefix the property using it as a shortcut. <br /> <br /> Insect houses become flat by their feet and are often burned by throwing cigar tips and battles. Old Mr Bumble and his beautiful daughter Honey (Hoppity's childhood sweetheart) are in serious danger of losing their Honey Shop to this threat. <br /> <br /> To put together their problems, Devious Insect 'Property Magnate' C. Bagley Beetle has romantic designs on Honey Bee himself and hopes, by means of his henchmen, Swat the Fly and Smug the mosquito, to force Bumble to give him her hand in marriage. Will the heroic and fearless Hoppity win the day and manage to save the bowls from their fateful destiny, and especially his precious honey from her? Enjoy the classic songs ("Katy Did, Katy Did not" is a fantastic, swinging, optimistic example) and the colorful images that the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> Time has not struck my fascination with this animation and storytelling masterpiece, and I was delighted to find that it was released for video even though I later found out that it was in NTSC PAL format. I didn't mind, I immediately sent the video and bought only a portable TV / video combination (complete with NTSC playback). I have enjoyed many nostalgic views since then and have even discovered that the TV rights have shifted from the BBC (who informed me that they would probably never show the movie at any of their stations) to FilmFour, who finally (last) appeared on their digital stations in early 2007. <br /> <br /> My granddaughter (three years old) was totally encouraged as we looked together - and this is a child who has been influenced by the digital age and the resulting computer-generated productions! <br /> <br /> I would thoroughly recommend this movie at any age and especially the youngest of the viewers. <br /> <br /> Give Max Fleischer a Posthumous Oscar!
