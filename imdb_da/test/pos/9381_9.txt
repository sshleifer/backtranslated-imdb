George Barry's "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is told at the root of a dark adventure via a horror movie frame. It is, in my view, one of the best films of the 1970s, and it is just criminal that the image was essentially stolen and distributed without Barry's knowledge (those responsible for this theft must be fed to the bed, ASAP). If you are looking for open or healthy actions, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is not the girl for you. "Death Bed" is a milder, weirder drive-in image; It plays like a weird dream, half remembered. I would recommend reading Stephen Thrower's summary of "Death Bed" in Thrower's FAB Press book, "Nightmare USA" (he describes the movie's vibe perfectly). Whether it's appropriate or not, I've noticed shades of "Death Bed" in everything from the "Phantasm" files to Michele Soavi's "Cemetery Man" to the author's magic realism / slipstream fiction like Kelly Link. Barry is an original and in a fair world I am sure he would have followed "Death Bed" with a number of amazing bizarre films.
