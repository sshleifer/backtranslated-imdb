It is an interesting fact that metaphysics of Plato and Aristotle, formal logic and abstract ontology form the sciences that most people are not interested in. But then, the computer began about a thousand years after Aristotle to build human thinking and humans Who refuses to reflect issues of being other than biological, physical and chemical, suddenly felt paralyzed because they could not cope with the consequences these computers would bring "overnight". R.W. Fassbinders "Welt Am Draht" along with Tarkovsky's "Solaris" and Godard's "Alphaville" is probably the first film that took philosophical issues of new computer science as the basis for a story to be told in a movie. The confusing questions about identities and realities are wisely embedded in various interwoven criminal stories, which the audience is really trying to follow because it is interested in resolving the issues. Fassbinder was a master to sell high abstract content to his audience by embedding theoretical knowledge in practical, appetizing forms. The basic problem to understand is that an identity defines a reality, but on the other hand, a reality also requires identity to be perceived. The idea of ​​a person with multiple identities is only known to us from the point of view of psychiatry. But logically, the only reason we only have an identity is the fact that our logic only has two values ​​(right and false). Now take a logic with only one value, ie. with three: So, as you can easily see, you already have three identities. What happens when we say that Dr. Sets are killed? Then it is quite possible that only one of three identities is abolished, and the other two remain and are able to save the individual from death. Another question is if a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at once. The idea of ​​showing such identity sets in a downward or downward manner as shown on the stage with the elevator in the hotel is misleading, as identities and thus realities are not structured in hierarchical, but in a Heterarchic way. Strictly speaking, there is also no "artificial identity", since each identity is defined over two objects that share all their properties with each other. Therefore, the idea of ​​assuming that each individual has only one identity is not a consequence of ancient binary logic (another identity implies that a person simultaneously exists and does not exist). But now look around and see that one and the same object (which by definition is self-evident) is perceived by each subject in its own way. Therefore, if each subject sees an object differently, why should it not be possible for each individual to open the boundaries of his bivalent individuality cross, with the effect that different people can exchange their different individualities? Fassbinder wanted to pick up this subject five years later in his masterpiece "Despair. A trip in the light".
