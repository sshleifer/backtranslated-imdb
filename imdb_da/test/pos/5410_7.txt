It is difficult to judge 'Imaginary Heroes' without referring to the fact that director and screenwriter Dan Harris is only 25. You can hardly believe seeing this movie, which is not just a mature job, professional and deep, but also with some of the shortcomings in routine specifics for senior executives. <br /> <br /> The setting is the US suburb, known from 'American Beauty' or 'Desperate Housewives'. As in the 'American Beauty'the movie, a suicide turns, but this happens at the start of the movie, and we are left to see a family in the family who cope with the death of the talented sportsman's brother and son. Emile Hirsch plays the younger brother, Sigourney Weaver is the mother, both are excellent attempts to cope with the loss, to find the cause and motivation to survive. Harris drives his actors with a safe hand, and the first two sections of the movie (there are four in all as the seasons) create a wonderful excitement with credible dilemmas and real questions. It is the second part of the movie that is disappointing, it looks too tired and conventional, and I suppose the producers might have interfered with the work of the young screenwriter and director trying to bring him closer to the Hollywood Convention. It's that this movie isn't a gloomy version of 'American Beauty', with another focus. However, I am sure we will hear a lot about Dan Harris in the coming years.
