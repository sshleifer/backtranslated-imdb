Movies can certainly be a narrative medium, but it is by no means the ideal medium. The literature best bears a plot because the reader can deliver the imagination needed to complete the structure. Movies are best appreciated when viewed for what it is: A series of images grouped together. What Soderbergh does in Ocean's Twelve is combined with impeccable filmmaking technology with the free flow of American films from the 1970s. From looking at the recent comments, most people were waiting for a standard file, heist movie, a la Entrapment; It seems that people actually miss the boring cliches of romance disguised as tensions between the leaders and the ridiculous plot phrases designed to keep the audience awake. Soderbergh's instructional skills are just for watching this movie, but close-ups of Pitt and Zeta-Jones forty meters high on the screen do not hurt either. A real treat for those who love the flickering of light on the silver screen, and a disappointment for those who are trying to make something, it's not.
