I have to say: Out of every modern Korean martial arts movie, it's worth checking out here. It wasn't as epic as Musa-The Warriors and didn't develop the characters either, but it had many good ideas. Simple story: An elite soldier believed dead, returning after years to end Japanese rule in Korea in the Middle Ages. His counterpart was formerly the best friend he had, and now he's out to stop him. The fighting scenes are all with swords or different weapons and very entertaining to watch. The motives of the numbers are first discovered near the end. You may need to see it again to get all the links to the right. And me personally ... I loved the end. I could see it again and again. Maybe a little pathetic, but a real freedom war story .... People can be killed, but not the ideas they stand for ...
