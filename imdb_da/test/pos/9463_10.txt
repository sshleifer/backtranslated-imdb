OK, now I thought it was another cheesy romantic comedy that held back on the comedy, but it wasn't. I mean, how could it have been with the amazing Amanda Bynes staring at it! She was fantastic, really fun & is still great! The boys in it were also extremely suitable, a great reason to go girls! The reason is strongly based on the Shakespeare game 'Twelfth Night', as it was extremely uniform, there was even a spider called malvolio, which belonged to malvolio-like character. The script was very well written and drawn together, and it was very witty. Football skills in it were also great, it made me think of playing football myself! Anyway, to summarize this is a light hearted film about young romance that gets very confusing! Go see it!
