I've seen this movie so many times, it's so good. Maybe because I can relate to Tita's lifestyle, is the reason for that. Not everyone would find it to their liking. Also, my Italy improves after each viewing. Am I a sad case? Thank you, Mr Sorrentino. I'm looking forward to your next movie. Even though I didn't watch the movie in a movie theater, I have the DVD and will encourage someone to buy it. The special function of extra functions alone is worth the price. How much time an instructor uses to make a movie, is very rarely appreciated, enhancements on the DVD provide an excellent insight into the film production. As for the film's story, I am bias.I happen to be raving over it to all my friends, but as I said before, I relate a lot to the protagonist, who is a single family in a situation that is not his own choice. The mafia in Sicily uses the watch to wash their money in a Swiss bank. He owes them to cost them millions of dollars years ago in the stock market that went wrong. Killed life.
