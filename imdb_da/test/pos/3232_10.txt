A movie is beyond all expectations, an excellent insight into the human condition. What drives Mila to get her ass painted. What could push a man so far that there is only one opportunity to escape is to have it backward repeatedly painted by strangers. <br /> <br /> This movie is not afraid to kick squarley in the face of the ass painting. Simply breathtaking. Role on the successor or what comes next from the geniuses who did this.
