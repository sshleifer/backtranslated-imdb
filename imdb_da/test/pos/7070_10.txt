Yes. Watch this movie if you like brave movies. This is perhaps the best Mexican picture since Midaq Alley just because of the excellent cast, the outrageous direction and the sublime soundtrack. Many people did not like 'Cronica', they think it is very aggressive, but they did not understand that it was only a representation of the Mexican community's hyperrealism, but then all the third world families resemble. I hope Benjamin Cann and Bruno Bichir (who in this movie give another example of his greatness as an actor) will soon come together again with a new movie. Just remember how Los Olvidados (Luis Bu√±uel) was misunderstood when they were released, but now we consider one of the best movies all the time. Prepare yourself and watch this movie.
