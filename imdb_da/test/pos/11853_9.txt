The best romantic comedy I've seen this year. Not that kind of licking over the best Hollywood stuff by Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler and much less syrupy than a Hugh Grant epic. Julianne Nicholson and Jay Mohr are the perfect cast and both regularly deliver professional performances like the fianc√© couple who decide to spend some time watching their sexual oats before marriage. Instead of playing it strictly for laughs, writers and instructors created a good mix of human emotions and comic actions. Nicholson is as big as the unpleasant seducer, and Mohr does a good job as the man who reluctantly enters the game, but soon finds himself enjoying his flings a little too much. We see just enough of the supporting characters to nicely round out the plot without disturbing the main story. Andy Richter (serious friend) and Helen Slater (distraught single-mom) are particularly good. There is enough meaning and emotional complexity to do this much more than a standard boy-girl farce. In fact, with just a little better pacing and a little bit more cutting this movie would be a top ten comedy.
