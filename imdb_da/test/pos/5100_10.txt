I saw the first in the theater in 1969 when I was 9 and immediately fell in love with it. I'm sorry that Sony hasn't seen enough to release this on DVD ("but one day, one day ..."). I recently obtained a VHS copy of this on eBay and sat down to see it 39 years later. I'm happy to report that it's still time-tested. The action is spot-on, John Williams' orchestrations are lush and Leslie Bricusse's songs memorable ("When I'm Older," "You and I", "Fill the World with Love", "London is London" are just a few of Standouts. And there is not enough to say about Peter O 'Toole, Petula Clarke, Michael Redgrave and Michael Bryant's play Terence Rattigan deserves an A + for his update of the James Hilton story, there really is nothing that doesn't like this Movie - It's a good cheer-me-up choice, happy to have released the original soundtrack as a three-CD set of extras, so Sony wants to hurry up and do the same with the movie.
