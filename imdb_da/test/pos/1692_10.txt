Krajobraz po bitwie as many of the Wajda movies may not be understandable to "the rest of the world". History based on the short short stories by Tadeusz Borowski, who during the Second World War were imprisoned by Oswiecim, Dachau and Dautmergen camps. Borowski describes in his books inhuman life in the Nazi camps from the perspective vorarbeiter Tadek - parole of the author, who was also at the privileged position among the prisoners. Borowski was merciless to mankind and merciless to himself. He describes human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation. Ironically, after returning to Poland, he stopped writing artistic prose and became a communist propagandist who produced a stream of anti-imperialist and anti-American press releases. After some years he committed suicide. In the film, Wajda's viewpoint changes. Vorarbeiter Tadek - character created by Tadeusz Janczar - plays only support role. The story is focused on the poet, destroyed, burnt out by the war and imprisonment and his one-day love affair with Nina, Jewish girl who fled communist Poland, even though she actually hates Jewish life and mentality. As a background we can observe sad grotesque of so-called "dipis" (displaced) lives, which after the liberation are settled by the Americans in the SS barracks. Marches, patriotic kitsch mixed with hunting for the extra dose of food and / or prostitutes German girls. <br /> <br />
