'O Brother, where art you are a joyful tale of Homer's' 'Odyssey', set in the 1930s Mississippi and scary with brilliant quirkiness, the trademark of the brothers Coen. Three rude judges make their escape to find treasure - and more than their share of adventure - in this lovely movie. George Clooney is in good, clever form as the chatty, gracious leader of the trio; but the real actors go to John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as his greasy but lovable cohorts, called 'Soggy Bottom Boys' by Clooney's character, after receiving baptism at full immersion in a river. The three cut a record during this homespun nom-de-plume for cash, and unknowingly become overnight sensations with a true "rock star" status. The film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical. And there are some amazing movie shows here: the scene of the KKK rally is a real doozy and so resembles the scene when Dorothy's friends save her from the witch's slot in 'The Wizard of Oz' that it almost went to cinematic plagiarism. And what a fantastic plagiarism it is! Without renouncing the end, I have to say that the climax of the movie is one of the most breathtaking sequences added to movies in the latest memory (on a par with the spectacular finale of 'Magnolia', another of My favorites). 'O Brother' is a must-see, a perfect 10!
