TORTURE NOT A DUCKLING (Lucio Fulci - Italy 1972). Definitely a leading candidate for the most insane movie title ever conceived, and it is quite a feat in Giallo Country. Originally, the movie title became even more absurd, "Do not Torture Donald Duck", literally translated from its Italian title. A small Donald Duck figure is short as a toy, but hardly enough to make a title like this, but apparently it was changed for fear of legal ramifications of Disney. I traveled quite a bit against Fulci's former LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN (1971), but here are all the right ingredients present. A surprisingly effective mystery, a well-cast and imaginative shot against an unusual landscape setting. Everything just clicks. I think it is rightly hailed as one of the director's most accomplished achievements. The story is set against a small hillside village in Sicily, where someone kills young teenage boys. Among the suspects, the most obvious is a young woman, Maciara (Florinda Balkan), a self-proclaimed witch who murderously disregards the skeleton of a baby and foams to the road. Guiseppe, the village idiot is also suspected when he made a slight attempt to take advantage of one of the boys' disappearances and went straight into their trap. At that time, a fast-winning beginner (Tomas Milian) arrives from Milan to cover the murders, he immediately begins to question the authorities' assumptions when he meets two other potential suspects: Don Alberto, the local priest (Marc Porel) with a haughty attitude , and Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a boring young woman from the city with a troubled past with drug crime who also wants to have sexual relations with the young boys in town. Talk about your primary red herring. <br /> <br /> Fulci neatly contrasts modernity and tradition with the newly built elevated highway passing through the Sicilian hills past ancient cities, where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition. One could discuss the film's political attitude as North to South, or as a comment on the virtues of the small town - the conventions of society in general - too often dangerously close to tipping over to moral dissolution, chaos and - ultimately - justice of the population. The movie has often been lambasted because of its anti-Catholic tone, but it is hardly an important element here, except for obvious plot-related reasons that would give away too much. In fact, it is rather tame compared to a movie that Joël Serias does not deliver from Evil (1971). Probably the movie's rather unflattering depiction of Sicilian values ​​from small towns (when another boy is killed, the local population is depicted as a delayed lynch mob), which can cause some offenses in Sicily, but - given Sicily's problematic conditions to the rest of Italy - hardly problematic for other Italians, I think. The movie overcame in the dark too fast to have great influence anyway. <br /> <br /> When talking to Fulci, the amount of doing is usually a primary topic for discussion. Although the eyes are not missing, the film contains two very graphic scenes. In the gross final, the killer falls into a rock and beats his face along the rocks heading down with cruel results (albeit not very realistic). And the chain split sequence with Florinda Balkan in the cemetery shows Fulci's penchant for sadistic violence and typically he does not hold back by graphically showing what most filmmakers would just hint at. Certainly one of the most horrible scenes in Fulci's repertoire. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a tight, well-written, effective little mystery, finely lined by Fulci, with an impressive cast of genre regulars like Barbara Bouchet, Marc Porel (not very convincing as a priest), Tomas Milian and Florinda Balkan (mouth-foaming crazy as the city's witch). <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
