It is really good to see that Van Damme's films are slowly improving and especially in relation to C-grade flops "Derailed" and "Second in command", which were both tragic and not in a good way. The Sheperd: Border patrol is a good action flick with some really good action / battle sequences. It is good to know that Van Damme still knows how to watch as his last movie "Until Death" did not have any martial arts at all !!! <br /> <br /> It is said that this film is significantly inferior to "To Death", which was a great trip to Van Damme. "Until Death" lacked the over-the-top action of most Van Damme films, but was dark and gritty, and Van Damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that movie. Still, The Shepherd is definitely a movie worth checking out especially for Van Damme fans or just action movie fans in general, but if you're looking for a movie with a bit more history line ..... you can skip this one! <br /> <br /> I think this movie was good enough especially on what small budget it would have been shot at. The only real problem I have with this movie is the title; "Shepherd"? I do not understand it! I suppose "Border Patrol" just doesn't have the same ring for it without the word "Shepherd" in front of it !!! <br /> <br /> My rating of this movie is 7 out of 10, but at Van Damme movie standards it is not in any other movie category. <br /> <br /> It's good for a Van Damme movie.
