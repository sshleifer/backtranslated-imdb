Now I'm afraid my review of this particular will not keep much different observation than the others before me, but I've just seen it - under a PBS membership drive - and frankly I'm too excited NOT to say anything. To really appreciate the riddle that is Barbra Streisand, look back before the movies. Before the Broadway phenomenon in the mid 60s. As the television was still a young medium, there was some kind of entertainment very prominent on the air, which is only a memory today: musical variety. Some musical shows were weekly series, but others were single, one-time specials, which usually exhibited the particular talent of the individual performer. This is where we get the raw, unobstructed first look at Streisand. She had already been the guest's performing artist on other kinds of shows, including Garry Moore, Ed Sullivan, and scored a big coup in a one-time-only tandem look with the woman who would pass her the baton of extraordinary belt: Judy Garland. In 1966, COLOR ME introduced BARBRA Barbra Streisand in color (hence the title), but copied the format of her first special one year earlier almost to the letter. In 3 different actions, we get an abstract Streisand (in an after-hours art museum that looks at and sometimes becomes works of art), a cartoon Streisand, who works an already adoring audience in a studio circus (populated with many fuzzy and furry animals), and Best of all, a song Streisand in mini-concert format just-- yes honestly, just do it. <br /> <br /> It amazes me that she still had the movie debut of FUNNY GIRL yet to come, becoming as songwriter, director, and political activist. Here she is barely 24 years old and does extraordinary things because she did not know that we could not, as we did. The Art Museum's order has been shot in Philadelphia during a weekend immediately after the museum was closed to the public on Saturday night and apparently done with only one color camera. Yet there are cuts, disintegrations and spores to a large extent, resulting in a rather spectacular peak - the modern, slightly beatnik-flavored "Gotta Move." After being lost among the modern abstracts, jazz club bongos, with Streisand coming up in a psychedelic dress and glittering eye makeup, make the captivating staccato tune with almost androgynous sex appeal. It is not before Act 3, believe it or not, that the moment is matched or better by another feat: In the concert sequence, in a white dress and pearl earrings, Streisand recites the "Any Place In Hang My Hat's Home," tear in the final notes and reveal one of the climax bands that scare you like a little girl, even if you are 44 years old ... and a guy. Just plain old big tv. Check it out.
