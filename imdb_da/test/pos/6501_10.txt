just watched this movie on the travel party and became the floor. I've never been a big fan of scratches, but this movie had me hooked from getgo. It is listed as a documentary, but has never really felt like one. (can't remember the last time I had such fun watching a documentary). It has a style and energy that is refreshing, insightful and never preaching. the production values ​​were also up there. (shot at movies with cool cuts and a great soundtrack). All in all, a smart, entertaining and informative piece.
