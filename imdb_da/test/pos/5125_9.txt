The story is incredible, it starts with a new child in the city named Roy, while on the school bus discovering a kid running without shoes, and the same day he breaks the big bullie's nose trying to fight with him. Roy soon discovers that the child is a trajectory and he and his sister's sister are trying to destroy a building view that can kill all the beautiful owls living there. Roy decides to help them fight, they can win this battle before the clever but bumbling cop Dave Delinko (Luke Wilson) stumbles to them. An enjoyable movie, fun and adventurous. I admire Luke Wilson for taking this role. I don't think his brother Owen himself would take that role.
