This is really a fun movie. His dance scene finished with the tape is one of the funniest scenes I can remember. I thought "I am gay" scene on high school graduation ceremony a little surreal, even though it was fun. While I was watching the third time, I started to pick up small, small segments that I had missed. One was when Matt Dillon's girlfriends, a classic ditz, tried to use a phone she had never used before. Kevin Klein made this movie successful with Tom Selleck. This was also the first time I could appreciate Debbie Reynolds; She turned out to be fun. She confirmed this in the TV series 'Will and Grace'. A discovery I found after the third view is Lauren Ambrose of '6 Feet Under' fame. She sticks out with her red crack, but it is obvious that this is one of her first films. Bob Newhart is also very fun on the high school principle.
