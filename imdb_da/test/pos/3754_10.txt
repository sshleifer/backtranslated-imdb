I remember watching this movie when I was quite young and being pretty disturbed by it. I found the storylin very disturbing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One particular was when the other schoolchildren spit in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They tied him up and shaved his private parts. It was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at play. I have a feeling that even though he was good at playing, he would have been bullied because it is difficult to determine what makes anyone popular. For me, he is the type of person who would always be chosen because that is how children work. Popular kids are popular because they are somehow "cool". Popularity is a difficult thing to define. So even at the end, when he succeeds in his career, there is no difference and he is still back so he feels bothered. I found the end rather disturbing as there was no solution.
