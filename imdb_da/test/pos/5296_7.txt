Told to be inspired by Disney's The Little Mermaid, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is Japanese animation master, Hayao Miyazaki's next great work after the well-received Spirited Away in 2001 and Howl's Moving Castle in 2004. In Ponyo, his signature style is animated fantasy realms and children, characters appear again. <br /> <br /> Sosuke (Hiroki Doi) discovers the boy's lead in the movie a "goldfish" caught in a glass jar while playing at the ocean under the rock. He stays with his mother, Lisa (Tomoko Yamaguchi) above and upstairs. Sosuke shakes the jar vigorously to try to get the "goldfish" out, but the little "goldfish" is stuck. He then tries to pull it out, but it just can't be solved. Sosuke then put the jar on the ground before you smash a small rock on it and break it immediately while you suffer a small cut on your finger. He then curiously checks to see if the "goldfish" is still alive. As he observes, the "goldfish" reacts by licking the blood of the finger suddenly. Excited, Sosuke quickly jumps back to the house and puts 'goldfish' in a small bucket of water hoping it will survive. It did and he called it 'Ponyo' (Yuria Nara). <br /> <br /> The above scene would mean what should come to the rest of the movie. These are the interactions between Sosuke and Ponyo. And it is one that Hayao Miyazaki did carefully in portrayal. He must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of how children behave before depicting this communication chemistry between the two main characters. The construction of the children will also extend into the rest of the film in their additional meetings. The sensation between Sosuke and Ponyo grew as the film progresses from the moment Sosuke brought Ponyo to school in Lisa's car. The best moment came when the two were reunited after a brief separation, when Ponyo's father, Fujimoto (George Tokoro), a magical seafarer recaptures the alien Ponyo before encapsulating her in a magic bubble of friendly intent. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time Fujimoto has grown to refer people to disgust to pollute the sea and steal his life. But all Ponyo wants to be human and stay with Sosuke, so for a second time she escapes, accidentally empties her father's pet shop of magical elixir into the sea, creates a storm of tidal waves and engulfes the small town in the process. /> <br /> What follows is Sosuke and Ponyo's adventure in the flooded city. <br /> <br /> Is there ever happy in this? Would true love prevail? You find out. <br /> <br /> Look at the art of Ponyo on Cliff by the Sea, which seems to be a departure from Miyazaki's earlier works on the rendering. It seems that the environment, in addition to the characters at stake in each scene, is not colored in the usual way as in Spirited Away (2001) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004). The aesthetic appeal is discounted from what appears to be crayons. The objects and characters are not as detailed as before. <br /> <br /> This is peculiar if it is taken at face value, but from the way the story is written and told, the possible explanation is that Miyazaki allows the audience to watch the movie with a child's tint, yet leave the adults reminded of Japan when they were younger. This move could have prevented potential filmmakers, new to Miyazaki's work to see it. The trailer didn't do anything to promote Ponyo as well. However, taking the matter to Japan would be a different story, as Miyazaki's credentials far exceed any marketing technique. In summary, however, it was not the same as its parts. Aside from Miyazaki's ability to cast vivid and animated characters, the movie lacks elements of excitement and wonders when measured against previous works, resulting in a large-screen deficit. <br /> <br /> The sparks from Ponyo and Sosuke failed to illuminate the film in a big way, but moments of warmth, kindness and love can still be found in recognizing the movie as one not made for the kids, but The children that everyone is or was once.
