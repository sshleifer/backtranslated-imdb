I watched this on Sky TV late one night as I am a Vampire fan. I have to admit that I half expected to be a B-Movie disaster, but I was pleasantly wrong. Subspecies are about a family of vampires. When a vampire master dies, his two sons, the beautiful and noble Stefan and his brother, the evil, hideous Radu, begin a war with each other over their birthright, Bloodstone. The Bloodstone is a sacred variety for Vampires, and it blows the blood of Saints who give the vampire who drinks it an ultimate High. The Battle for Bloodstone Takes An Unexpected Trip When 3 College Students Switch Up In The Brothers' Area On A School Trip And Stefan Will Protect Them From His Brothers Lusts. As I said, I went into this movie and I don't expect much at all, but it was one of the best low-budget movies I've ever seen. The sets and locations (Romania think I've been a while since I've seen it) are very nice and the music scored the film justice. <br /> <br /> Most of the play was enough, but it was Anders Hove like the evil radu who steals the movie (and all subsequent sequencer). Hove's performance as the twisted Vamp is really breathtaking and encounters the movie simply from okay, to beautiful d @ mn good!
