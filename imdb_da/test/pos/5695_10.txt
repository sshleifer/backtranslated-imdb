BLACK WATER is a thriller that completely surpasses its limitations (it is an indie flick) by constantly undermining expectations of emerging as an intense experience. In the tradition of all good animal-centered thrillers, ie jaws, The Edge, the original Cat People, the directors know that restraint and what does not appear are the best ways to pack a punch. The performances are genuine and poignant, the crocodile is extremely well done, in fact, if the Black Water site believes it is because they used real crocs, and the sump's location is fabulous. <br /> <br /> If you're after a B-grade gore party hook body forget about black water, but if you want a smart, exciting trip that will fear the water and wonder what the hell would I do if I was up that tree so it's a must see.
