Looking for a comic drama with excitement and an ensemble cast? Well find this little sleeper. John Lithgow and Billy Bob Thorton are good at this little plot twister. Don't forget the cameo of Jamie Lee Curtis. A touch of the 60s, a touch of "The Prince and the Pauper", and a touch of the homemade gold gives a small little story.
