Since frame number 1 do you know the good guy in suit and tie is doomed ?? He has no luck ("Black Nula"), or he believes in that music on the car radio, and the dubious talk of his best friend and business associates who takes him to parts unknown through a desert road. Alberto simply wanted to be alone to take a flight abroad the next day ?? Well, somebody we are back guesses. <br /> <br /> The film goes a long way it will find short ?? to a final scene with the man who hears the same music on a cab to the airport. Occasionally, a number of lucky people have found various ways out of the story, some die, some are born, others fall into severe distress. This time he's really doomed ?? Or is he? The film is a kind of one-man show by director Fernando Fragata, who only left the sound recording and special effects for other competent people. Those who typically reject Portuguese films due to sound problems and unclear speech recording must search for other issues to criticize this time. The car accident (this is not the spoilers, the movie is too clever for that) makes for a great scene and apparently was done with cheap equipment. (US Studios note: you can save a dollar or two by saving competent Portuguese executives!) <br /> <br /> The rest was done by Fragata, from script to dialogue, from camera work to editing. If part of the dialogue was ad libbed, then he must again be congratulated for the direction and casting with most inexperienced actors. A large number of non-speaking parts are credited, but most of these people were used for music video clips and the production of widely used in the movie's promotional trailer. The cast has a dozen actors and actresses, including ten relevant people and a large number of relationships ?? Step by step is revealed in an exciting, exciting way reminiscent of the best genre writers. 'Alfred Hitchcock' (qv) and 'Claude Chabrol' (qv) will think of the cat-and-mouse game between the director and his public and the character of his characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this thriller and comedy to Portuguese language speakers, and if the movie gets a decent translation of its conversation conversation to anyone abroad who enjoys these genres.
