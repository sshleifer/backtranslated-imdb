After seeing the unknown version, I thought this movie was beautifully made. It caught my attention from the beginning to the end; The excitement was wonderfully conveyed. Nasaan Ka You portray the typical Philippine family with accuracy in their presentation of secrets and lies. Even the religious culture, the human tendency to keep an eye on appearance and maintain a pure reputation, are shown with strong vivacity in Gloria Diaz's character. There is not a small scene in this movie that has no purpose - the cinematography is excellent and the writing is brilliant. Although the plot is amazing, I personally found that the twist at the end, the revelation to do with Jericho's character was not so much of a shock as it should be. But then maybe it's just me, because otherwise Nasaan Ka Man is a very smart movie. <br /> <br /> The molding was good at first, but Deither and Claudine's play was the icing on the cake. Not one if you're looking for a Filipino movie that will surprise and exceed expectations. Inches up to the instructor.
