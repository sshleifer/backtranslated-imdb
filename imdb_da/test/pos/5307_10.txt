This is a great movie and was immediately put in my top ten (believe me, I know movies!). It's one of the movies that really makes you think, not necessarily about the story, but about yourself! The film is about a fifteen-year-old child (Leland Fitzgerald) who kills an autistic boy. He is sent to the Juvenile Hall where he meets Pearl Madison, his teacher. His relationship with Pearl grows slowly, and finally, Pearl decides to write a story about Leland and his peers, but as he gets closer to finding out Leland's motive, he learns that he first has to deal with his own problems. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie and one must watch with great music by the pixies and a great score! See it!
