I saw years ago and it is entertaining but not profound. The basic story is of a young man who dreams of Midian, even though he is not sure where it is or even if it really exists. <br /> <br /> Spoilers Follow: He finally visits it, turns into a Nightbreed being of being bitten by another. Then he has to help the other members of Nightbreed because they are attacked by the Canadians. (Save for the accents, they work like all the good Ol 'Boys. Not much in line with the Canadian psyche, eh?) Someone observed for "monsters" or "nightbreed", replacement "Jews" and for the Canadians / humans, replacement, "Nazis", and you must get an insight into the monster's struggle against humans. Well, maybe. One major objection I had was that while the underground city was interesting, it was rather ramshackle and honestly dirty. This must be a convention for films with underground settlements. One would think that if monsters were the good people, some would have at least a sense of decor. The story is a bit thin, but it is introducing characters. But it is entertaining enough for a repetition.
