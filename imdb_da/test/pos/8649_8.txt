In the beginning I thought of the opening scene in "Once upon a Time in the West" with the careful, remote and sweeking metal sound. When it comes to the city, it begins to feel like "Kitchen Stories" or "Drifting Clouds", maybe even "Grimm". <br /> <br /> Then it turns out that this is more like Joe Versus volcano "in theme (not style). And the film is performed from the beginning to the end of the same underrated style. sugar-blue-gray shades of gray, dresses, wall-color, furniture, bedding, mirrors, cars, music, background sounds and even people's expressions. . <br /> <br /> But perhaps the observation is too long for me, I would much rather see the alternative side or what happens to the character after the final shot.
