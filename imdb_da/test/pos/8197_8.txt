This three-hour Chinese epic, set in 220 BC, can ultimately constitute a well-known theme for an emperor's idealistic dream of peace through union that transforms into ruined isolation, and there is nothing inherently challenging for the film. But it is a compelling tale of intrigue and passion and betrayal and epic events told in living lines. Even for those who are not attracted to such historical goggles for their own sake, it is an astounding feast for the eyes: the scene depicting the Marquis coup attempt is one of the most enchanting statements about physical space and grandeur of memory, and The battle scenes are memorable both in their scope and in their immediacy. The title sums up the film's use of compelling contrasts - great plainland resides against intimate horrors; The noblest of motives opposed the most degraded; hope to turn to dust. If you have never seen a three-hour Chinese epic, it would not be a bad place to start.
