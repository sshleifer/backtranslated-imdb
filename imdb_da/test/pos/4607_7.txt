The best - and it is pretty good - about The Black Castle is that it is a black and white Forties' Gothic grabber with a murderous crazy counter, somehow made in 1952. The star is apparently British actor Richard Greene, a talented leading man who reminds me of an earlier version of Roger Moore. The villain is a wild figure played by Stephen McNally, who does a credible job, except when encouraged to laugh maniacally. Shedding around in the shadows is a long dress Boris Karloff in a certain secondary role as an aged doctor who may or may not be the salvation of our hero. <br /> <br /> It is the mid-18th century in Austria, and Sir Ronald Burton (Greene) is determined to find out what happened to two close friends. They disappeared near the castle of Count Karl von Bruno (McNally), deep in the Black Forest. It seems that Sir Ronald and his friends had helped defeat a brutal plan for von Bruno in Africa three years earlier with slavery and ivory. The groves were not only left with errors, but with a scar on his face and a black patch, he now wears to cover a broken eye. von Bruno claimed revenge, and it seems he may have been partially successful. So under a false name, Sir Ronald arranges a hunting search from Count, and outside we go through a dark storm storm and howl wolves to the Count's castle. It is a hulking lot of stone towers and corridors, shady stairs, large fireplaces ... and creepy passages that lead to dank dungeons, a torture chamber and a great pit filled with snapping, thrashing crocodiles. It is also full of the Count's lovely blonde sensitive wife, Elga (Paula Corday, who is sometimes billed as Rita Corday), and of the Count's two close friends played by the two actors we know from the fifties who specialized in being slime in costume, John Hoyt and Michael Ansara. There is a dangerous leopard hunting, forbidden kissing, beating servants, creaking wood signs and swaying in the cold wind and poison in a cup. Not least, Dr. Meissen (Karloff) has a special vial filled with a drug that will lower the body functions that death seems to have occurred. The risk is that ... Well, when the person awakens ten hours later, he'd rather hope he hasn't already been strapped into his chest. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the Black Castle for all clich√©s remains pleasing. The film is serious, but it is sufficiently made to keep our interest, even though we come back with a smile while we look. It's even calming in a way to realize that there are strong echoes of The Dangerous Game. When Burton realizes how crazy Bruno is, he is even more determined to bring von Bruno into accounts. And of course he has fallen for Elga. von Bruno, outraged by revenge, but scornful and skilled, is a man who loves the hunt and is engorged with the murder. Hollywood's second creative rule has always been: "If you have to steal, steal from the best." It's the first creative rule, of course, is "If you have to steal, steal from the best and then make it liverwurst." Black Castle is a good bite of Austrian braunschweiger.
