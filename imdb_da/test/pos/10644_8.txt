Wanted to watch this for a while: I never thought I'd see it on a damp Trafalgar Square, London with 15,000 other people and everything for a new score by Pet Shop Boys. <br /> <br /> Quickly that experience specifically. A new departure from PSB seemed to suffer from the same problem that miniaturist Hugo Wolf had when writing his opera Der Corregidor: the long structure was a chain of short, ie. songs. PSB produced a more fluid, integrated score, even though it was rather static on its own terms. They could not resist singing either: An attitude of the text was in this respect a freestanding meditation on the action of the Odessa crotch during the action of the sequence I was, as far as I could say, counter-productive. All in all, it was very exciting, but it is definitely what Eisenstein tried to achieve. <br /> <br /> It's a very exciting movie with sharper editing that takes up space for thrill or action. In fact, the film, although beautifully shot and passionate (it has a quiet film melody, but not in the comic style of Hollywood), pulls through its meticulous editing pacing specific shots with the sense of speed that the audience will take them And there is also a wide variety of perspectives; either he had many cameras or the sequences on the harbor, and the stairs took a lot of time. <br /> <br /> Superfilm that can be judged regardless of sound, as it was how the finished product would have been conceived. 8.10
