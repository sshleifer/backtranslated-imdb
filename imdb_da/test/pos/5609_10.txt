This is my favorite Hal Hartley movie. All his films are small beads. I love independent movies and I hope Hal Hartley never goes to the mainstream or sells out. What if the Lord Jesus came back and loved his people so much that he could not open the final book and destroy the unbelievers? It was nice to see P. J. Harvey in a movie since I am a fan of her music. Don't look at this if you're a fan of cookie cutter Hollywood movies, you'll be disappointed.
