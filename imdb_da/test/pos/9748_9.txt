After 66 years, "Flash Gordon" still has an appealing scifi / adventure / epic feeling that many of today's science fiction adventures strive for and fail to deliver. The only way to enjoy this serial number is just to sit back and not choose anything (hokey effects, dialogue, why Flash doesn't go to Princess Aura, etc.). And for you older people who saw "Flash Gordon" back on the series screen or on TV "back in the day" if you want this fine series to remain appealing to future generations, your kids / grandchildren should see it here when they are young. It worked for me (man 18 or less). 9 out of 10
