Fascinating looking behind the scenes about how a really good movie can get done if the producers, the director and the cast simply "refuse to quit." These guys experienced serious obstacles in the project's two years (miniscule budget, problems with the manuscript and with the scriptwriter), so the finished product was not what was intended, but proved to be more interesting than the movie they should show the punk mentality of "just doing it" ... with or without any support, money or help ... find out on the run and do whatever you want to do. I really liked this documentary and know that viewers will see and learn things they didn't know before. This movie is really "one of a kind ... it's hard to classify because it has pieces of" sci fi "and" excitement "and also" how to make a movie. "It tells the truth about how movies are made, what can go wrong and how to overcome. I especially liked music written by Ed Ivey. These guys know how to produce a good movie on a shoe string because they are creative and know how to build props, dollys, staging, lighting with what they can scavenge ... pretty amazing stuff.
