I first met Arthur Penn's "Fire Friends" late one night at HBO. Having never heard of it, I expected very little, but looked at because I was interested in seeing what a creation of Penn and scriptwriter Steve Tesich would be. For the next two hours or so I sat mesmerized and watched this amazing talent talent and the story they woven. A semi-autobiographical tale of a young immigrant to America growing up in the mid-1960s turbulence, follows the "Four Friends" story of Danilo, an Eastern European immigrant (the brilliant Craig Wasson), from his arrival to the United States over a decade that changed the American landscape. Accompanying Danilo on his journey is his friends Georgia (the brilliant Jodi Thelan, in a role that unfortunately she has never had the opportunity to answer), Tom (Jim Metzler) and David (Michael Huddleston). "Four friends" cover too much space for me to try to explain this, but if you haven't seen this movie, I encourage you to find a copy (it has just been released on DVD) and watch it. You will not be disappointed. Tesich's script is wonderfully poignant ?? sometimes fun, sometimes incredibly sad, but always fascinating and honest. Penn leads with a safe hand and an obvious love for the period and the people whose lives we follow. The molding is uniformly excellent. This movie should have made a big star out of Wasson, which is really one of the country's most wasted talents. Jodi Thelan, not your standard brain-free Hollywood sex pot, heats the screen in a performance that makes the audience fall in love with her character as easily as the characters in the movie. Metzler and Huddleston's subtle performances could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their co-stars, but they are excellent and help anchor the film. Also excellent is Miklos Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence as Danilo's parents, as well as Reed Birney and Lois Smith. I haven't been without a copy of "Four Friends" since the day after I first saw it on HBO them many years ago. It has been and is one of my all-time favorite films for more than 20 years now. I cannot recommend it enough and feel if you give it a try, you will feel the same.
