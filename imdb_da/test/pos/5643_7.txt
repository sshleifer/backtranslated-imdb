The title is a reference to the destruction of the remains of a harvest, such as rice shells, by farmers who burn those who create fires on the plains. This is a bleak tale of the Japanese soldier's destruction. <br /> <br /> The story is set on the Philippines campaign day as a soldier with TB returning from a hospital because he can later go, they have no room for him. His senior officers do not want him around as he is really too sick to work or fight. Abused by his officer, he is sent back to the hospital with orders to either be admitted or killed himself. They will still not take him, and he is soon back to waging the war ravaged landscape trying to find help or a place to live or even just food. It is a gloomy journey without hope in sight and only death and human inhumanity to man in every turn. Factored as a terrific journey into the dark heart of man and war, it is also a very fun movie. This is not to say, it is not terrible, it is sometimes, but it is also dark comic. How could it not be? Here is a movie where madness and insanity run wildly, people are constantly trying to throw tobacco plate for food and are trying to get another little better pair of shoes and trying to remain a Japanese soldier in light of the absurdity of marching constantly, but never getting where anyway and you can't help laughing. To be sure that things get darker as it becomes clear that cannibalism may, literally and figuratively, be the only way to survive, but at the same time there is something unpleasant about human comedy. <br /> <br /> Hailed as a great anti-war movie, its strong photographic style makes it clear to the war's war, though it flashes our eye on its beauty. Here we see landscapes full of bodies that include the soldier and the civilian. Seen amidst forests and trees that would otherwise be, and to some extent still quite beautiful. It's an exciting feeling. What excites me is that I read that this is based on a novel about the fulfillment of Christianity. The director removed all the religious references to hope and salvation and used it instead of showing that life stinks, the war stinks worse, and ultimately there is no hope. <br /> <br /> Intellectually, I admire the movie, emotionally I don't. Part of it is an offensive downbeat score which, to my mind, accentuates what we see on the screen. Its almost gilt lily, as the image is so strong, it doesn't really have to make the music force you to feel in one way or another. Is it a good movie, it is for you to decide. For sure, unlike any other war movie, it is bloody, horrible and real in ways that large budgeted movies claim to be, but never. This is not for those who are harmful to blood and do since it is here in spades. Definitely worth a look.
