If you see this series, you get enough to feel like our parents felt when you saw Star Trek for the first time. <br /> <br /> This series has everything. The kind of stories that make you forget how to blink, the kind of characters that make you jump into the TV to join the action and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair fought in awe and endless admiration. <br /> In short, we begin with John Chrichton, an astronaut who is shot into a wormhole and ends up with a prison prisoner on the run from the bad thrills in black, ironically known as peacekeepers. <br /> Other colorful shapes consist of D'argo, big guy with a short temper and a sword / laser gun. Aerun Sun, former peacekeeper and a Ph.D. in buttkicking. Zotoh Zhan, who is a plant. No really, she is She is also a priest, but with an average stripe. There are also Dominar Rule XVI, a fat lazy killer who throws helium and generally does more harm than good. <br /> <br /> Later in the series, we meet the sexiest alien ever to be on TV, Chiana. A young and apparently chronic horny Nebari. She is played by Gigi Edgley, which is a name you should remember. <br /> <br /> One of the many things I love about these series is that John Chrichton accidentally ended up in this part of the galaxy holding references to "Real Life". When John finds it difficult to accept that he is frozen as a statue for 80 years, one of his many complaints is that when he returns, Buffy The Vampire Slayer will be dead. <br /> <br /> So take care of all the other series, get your Dren together and spend an Ahn on one of these episodes. I can assure you, Sci / Fi as you know it will change forever. <br /> <br /> This series has everything. It's sexy. It's action packed. It's hillarious. It's Farscape
