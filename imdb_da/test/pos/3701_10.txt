That's 3:30. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie about six minutes ago, and it's great. A teenage girl has a night of passion with her mother's lover and it ruins everybody's life. The really interesting thing about this movie is that you can't really put the blame on anyone. <br /> <br /> Everyone performed perfectly and the story was thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> You should definitely watch this movie if you can get your hands on it. <br /> <br /> I give it a 10.
