A beautiful movie. Someone who made me think of God but doesn't feel guilty or overwhelmed. Made me think of death, but don't fear it, think of life, but don't hide it. A movie that gave both love to everything I stand for and at the same time condemned it to the hell's deepest pits. A movie that made me think of love and everything I lost, but no grief showed me some strange reasons, relief. A child of two worlds, god and theater. And a good bit of wine and irony! I highly recommend ***** <br /> <br /> "When The S *** Hits Fan, Get A Tent" Oh, and we'll all go camping. Every day.
