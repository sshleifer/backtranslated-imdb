I found West Point to be a comfortable movie, though I doubt I would watch it again. The performances were compelling, with William Haines as yet another unpleasant entertaining young man having his com-up at the end of the film. It's hard to believe that the star waved Joan Crawford less than a year after this movie was made, as she sometimes seems to be pretty awkward. <br /> <br /> I would use another commentary on Ramon Novarros "Huddle" (1932) for this movie as well. There is a good movie waiting to be made here, but something is missing. The Corps's background and integration was well exploited, but I was less involved than I thought I would be. Perhaps Haines' character went too far, or went away with too much. His "repentance" did not seem real enough; And what kind of message did it send him to run each game in the last minutes of the Army Marine game? Where's the "Corps" in it? Could have taken the ten other men out and let him do everything himself. I also very much doubt that William Bakewell's weak, bad character will ever have a real counterpart at West Point. <br /> <br /> All this aside, the movie is sometimes very moving and inspiring. It is a good look at the daily practice of a reputable institution. Well, the tradition still matters at West Point, unlike the weak "traditions" of the Ivy League schools, which are only half-heartedly engaged these days. <br /> <br /> Regarding the point: It was appropriate match. But there was a clear overuse of snare drums. By using them to knock on the door, scene transitions, the ALU and in over half of the scenes must be quite boring. It diminished the viewing experience. I was ready to say "I get that point already." <br /> <br /> Enjoy the movie, but don't expect too much emotional involvement.
