With "Batman Returns", Tim Burton made an important priority in American cinema: giving a sequel to a blockbuster. Three years after this year's most successful film, "Batman" (1989), Gotham City's rejoices to many spectators. As its predecessor, "Batman Returns" enjoyed tremendous commercial success. Tim Burton got Batman back again because it is believed that the latter victory of his enemy, Joker, did little to improve Gotham City's image. In fact, violence and corruption exist, and here the second word is the epitome of Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the penguin (Danny De Vito). These two villains, eager to take control of Gotham City, will make life difficult for Batman. His task will be more difficult with Catwoman's appearance ... Tim Burton still provided a lot of work on stage, and he seems to be trying to correct the mistake in the first movie. This means that the director gave the opportunity to fight better sequences than in the first Batman. But he did not neglect the psychology of his protagonists for all that. If in the 1989 movie, Burton had focused on Bruce Wayne / Batman's psychology, here is the penguin who apparently interested him. The director tried to make of him, very well acted by De Vito an ambiguous character. On the one hand, he is full of bad intentions (previously quoted), but on the other hand he seeks his past and wants to be considered a real man. "Batman Returns" also appears as crazier than its predecessor, especially with the casting. I'm thinking of Mich√®le Pfeiffer, who offers a bold and powerful performance as Catwoman. Moreover, I do so at the time I write this review that I remember that a new version of Catwoman is currently in the cinema. But considering the bad reviews (3 out of 10 on IMDb!), It is certain that her performer Halle Berry will be pale in insignificance next to Pfeiffer. In the end, this movie is one of the best sequels of 1992 and it allows for the development of Tim Burton's distinctive style. We also find its taste for the strange and the Gothic. With regard to Batman's other adjustments to the screen, you can skip them. "Batman Forever" (1995) and "Batman and Robin" (1997) are not good. I heard that Christopher Nolan shot the start of the Batman story and it was to be released next year. Will it match Tim Burton's works?
