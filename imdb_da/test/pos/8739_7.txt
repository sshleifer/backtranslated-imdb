Ingrid Bergman, who plays dentist Walter Matthaus's faithful receptionist, who has a little penchant for his boss, is absolutely fantastic in this movie. She handles the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steals a fantastic scene where she and Goldie Hawn speak in a record box (Ingrid's monologue is a front, but her face tells you she believes it with her whole heart). Matthau is a strange choice for the leading man (he's too old for Goldie Hawn and too unfinished for Bergman, not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist), but I liked the way he tries hard to please Goldie and stumble around about trying to free himself from a lie. Hawn (who won a Supporting Oscar) is as fresh and bubbly as she is today. This bedroom farce is not terribly sophisticated (and likewise reminds one of "Any Wednesday" besides), but it is a welcome relief from the noisy, teen-oriented comedies they appear today. "Cactus Flower" is a wonderful sigh! *** from ****
