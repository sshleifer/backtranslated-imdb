This 1955 hoist movie follows Tony le Stephanois, who was recently released from theft for theft as he assumes his robbery. He joins with his old hoist friends, and they bring in an expert biscuit, Cesar from Milan (played by Jules Dassin, who also instructed. He aimed only because he was blacklisted as a communist in the United States and unable to work in Hollywood.) The brilliance of this movie is 1/2 hour during the robbery. Throughout this time there is no dialogue and no music, only the muted sounds in digging through the floor or drilling the security. This increases the tension and pulls you in. They come away with hundreds of millions of francs, but a jewel offered to a dancer by Cesar brings their traits to a trio of brutal brothers. They sat down to get stash for themselves and bring misfortune in their wake. Great hoist / gangster movie, but I prefer J.-P. Melville's movie in this genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is like some lemonade I had last night. I had gone to a Caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made with sugar cane juice instead of sugar. It also had a lot of ice and was heavy on the lemons, which left it rather sour (which I like). The sugarcane juice gave a subtle, slightly more mild taste to it than the actual sugar, and the ice made it cool and refreshing when I sucked it down. 7.5 / 10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
