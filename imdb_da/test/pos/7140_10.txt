this is more than a sat. afternoon special. Extremely well written if very low key there is a lot here if you are looking for it. Catch eg. The cat fellow / scout. It could not only have been a cartoon, it should have been a comic book. The cartoon (as well as the film's publishers) missed the boat on this. One of the least knows really good movies. A good script by John Sayles is a strong point, but the action is also good. Probably the best superhero movie I've ever seen. Short about special effects, but long for credibility. This is a keeper. I've never seen a DVD of this movie, but I used to own a VHS version. Have a good hunt
