I saw this on the Accent Underground release with the short films. I first found the movie dull and old-fashioned and knocked it off after the first hour - I was a little full and tired. <br /> <br /> I went to bed and no fun I had a nightmare about this movie within half an hour to fall asleep. I couldn't stop thinking about why, so I came up, switched on the TV, read the DVD and saw the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Well done Alex Frayne sir, you've managed to implant your movie into this old, cynical filmmaker's head, and it requires it. So 10 out of 10 for you. <br /> <br /> I can't say I love this movie of yours, but it has had a lasting impact despite shortcomings and low budgets.
