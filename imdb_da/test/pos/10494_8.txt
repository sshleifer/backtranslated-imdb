I must admit, when I first started watching this movie, I had no idea what was going on. So the beginning was a little confusing to me. But it did not diminish my enjoyment of the movie. The characters turn out to be more complex than they might first appear, which is what makes this a memorable movie. First I heard it was a really "Hollywood" movie. Although it lacks the stereotypical "pistols and fists" of course, the convincing notions of talented actors like Martin Sheen and Sam Neill make up more than that. I'd rather watch a movie with more substance than shooting one day.
