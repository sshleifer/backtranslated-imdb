The Department S was created by Dennis Spooner and was an excellent thriller show on an Interpol interpol set up in Geneva created to solve confusing mysteries that the police could not cope with. If a man was found in London in a space suit, if a man was found around London in a space suit, if the passengers on a Rolls Royce suddenly transmogrified in a skeleton if a train pulled into a subway station turned out to contain dead commuters, called you at the 'Department S' to sort things. <br /> <br /> Peter Wyngarde played 'Jason King', a flamboyant-dressed crime writer whose fertile imagination helped break many of the bizarre cases. King caught the public's fancy and was later awarded a spin-off show. He was greatly assisted by American 'Stuart Sullivan' (Joel Fabiani) and the lovely 'Annabelle Hurst' (Rosemary Nicols). Outside of a 60's show, the department was led by a black man - 'Sir Curtis Seretse' (Dennis Alaba Peters). If the show looked and felt very much like 'The Avengers', it was hardly surprising. It shared many of the same authors and directors! The colorful titles are designed by Chambers & Partners and are worth tuning for alone. As was the case with so many I.T.C. series, the music was composed by Edwin Astley. His theme for the 'S' Department must be one of the best TV themes from time to time. <br /> <br /> Predictably, the show looks a little sexist and dated now, but don't let it off tuning. Imagine a hybrid of 'Jonathan Creek' and the 'Austin Powers' movies, and you have 'Department S'! <br /> <br /> Trivia Note: The episode 'A little war of nerves' a young Sir Anthony Hopkins in a big role!
