Reader is a perfect example of what a short movie should be. A narrative story is simply told through well-written dialogue, beautifully painted images, a score that seamlessly weaves it all the way through the narrative and characters adorned with thought-provoking and grace. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at a festival where Other Interesting Movies and Ideas were screened. But none of the other shorts had all the elements of great film making that came together in a movie made by The Reader. Readers offered the attention of every festival-goer in the living room and for 10 minutes took us into the emotional life of emotion. <br /> <br /> Duncan Rogers has created a beautiful movie and I hope to see more from this director it is more shorts or maybe a feature length movie.
