I want to thank Herr Hacke for the movies. My Deutsch is not gut. Excuse you. First of all, I didn't know how different the sound of Istanbul, despite living in Turkey. Akin and Alexander Hacke have made another approach to Turkish music. Seeing Istanbul and Istanbul Music from an alien aspect had given the real meaning of the music itself. In this movie I had found out how different our (Turkish) culture is, how interesting our artists are and how much respect they deserve. Unfortunately, no one has previously been able to operate this kind of documentary.
