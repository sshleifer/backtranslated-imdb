An extremely mild re-entry of the Shakespeare game (and much more obviously than the Forbidden Planet). Cassavetes is always a joy to see, and even more with Gena Rowlands, who shares the spotlight. His take on the Prospero role is suited to the kind of scary knowledge he brings to history. This is especially in the forefront of a scene when he evokes a storm by his blown wife and her boyfriend in a speedboat (accompanied by the soundtrack of an appropriate selection from Stomu Yamashta's "Go"). This is just one of the moments in the movie where the line between reality and fantasy becomes nicely blurred, and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more possible than you think. Add to this an excellent performance by Raul Julia, plus good work by Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and the movie becomes a nice little treat to occupy the space behind your eyes.
