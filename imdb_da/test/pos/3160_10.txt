Whole shorthand to be more aware of this weird time is that you are "Blue". The Blue State's mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what has happened in the last few years in our country (USA). It does not get anyone from the hook, but it makes us feel better as if we are in no way benefiting from living here and getting all the good things that a US citizen gets from being a US citizen. <br /> <br /> But I'm so sick of bitch about this. It doesn't do any good. I haven't taken much lately, and I wonder how many people there are. Maybe I'm just down because my job was "outsourced" last month, and now I'm looking for work in the shrinking tech support field, where most of the jobs go quickly to India and elsewhere abroad. I soon think it will not pay to be a citizen here with the screwed infrastructure and the shrinking labor market and the obsession with the war. These days, anyone who speaks out looks and jumps about questions of "patriotism". Anyway, back to this review: USA The Movie is a fuzzy DVD that makes me realize that some people have taken steps, whether through politics, protesters or art or media. The filmmaker is, of course, passionate, knowledgeable, willing to go beyond the norm, frustrated, unique, clear etc. <br /> <br /> I look through the entire site associated with the DVD and lost in all the articles, essays etc. there is. The DVD does it too, has references to different times, views and historical points. Sometimes someone does something out there.
