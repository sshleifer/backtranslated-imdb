I tend to be inclined to film about people who choose to cross the censorship barriers and express what they really want to express. Eric Bogosian's character of Barry is like Howard Stern, but much more intelligent. The character itself is very fascinating. As an Oliver Stone movie, I suppose I expected more. The film is a little under the third act. Plus, it's pretty obvious that "Talk Radio" is based on a game with its long dialogue scenes. But in general, the film works. Bogosian is at the forefront, and the fact that he also wrote the game, of which the film was based, probably helped him. If you want to check out one of Stein's larger films, I suggest you check out "JFK" or "Salvador". This is not his best work, but a good movie anyway.
