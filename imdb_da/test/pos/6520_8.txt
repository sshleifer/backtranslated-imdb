Dan Dailey gives a sincere and colorful performance as the great dizzy dean. His handling of the character is very true to life and captures the dean's background and limited education. The film is, of course, centered on Dizzy Deans, who rise to fame and his sudden turn to the sidelines with an injury he chose to ignore, much to his regret. His wife is marvelously portrayed by Joanna Dru, who gives a very down to earth quality to the woman who loved and supported the ball player, who so quickly rose to a "dizzying height". The depiction of Dizy's later career as a sports caster is honest and incomplete, reflecting his problems stemming from his poor education and his colorful language both on and off the air. Dizzy was quite character, and Daily has breathed his life into his story with admirable skill. If you've enjoyed this movie, I recommend comedy "Kid from Left Field" (1953), where Daily plays a down and out ballplayer idolized by his young son (Billy Chapin). Every day a ballplayer is meated in a completely satisfactory way. I heartily recommend the Pride of St. Louis for baseball fans everywhere.
