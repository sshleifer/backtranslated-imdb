This review is in response to the objection wondering how the facts were properly filming ... Watch this movie last year and found it inspiring that hopeful immigrants like my Italian grandparents who came through Ellis Island in the last century's shift would submit to any form for invasive inspection just to enter America. It was definitely eye-opening when my grandparents never talked about anything terrible while there. My grandmother was 5 years old and my grandfather 18 when they arrived. <br /> <br /> I have just returned from a trip to New York where I had the pleasure of visiting Ellis Island, and the museum actually goes through the immigration evaluation process - The filmmaker did, of course, his research, right down to the medical exams and equipment, questions and puzzles. They are all there at the museum. Even wedding photos and review board room - actually correct! Anyone who has immigrant grandparents should watch this movie. Inspiring to say the least.
