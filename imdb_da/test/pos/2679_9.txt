I just started to see this show. Its currently flying in Ireland at the Irish television station RTE1 at. 12.30 in the afternoon (July 26, 2006). This program makes me very loud and I can't boast it on most sitcom's (except for the UK's 'The Office' with Ricky Gervais in it). Today's episode of TKoQ (July 26, 2006) was the one where Carrie starts a new job and invites her friends home and goes to make some coffee, and Doug wants Carrie to have no 'outside' friends, so he lifts its top and shows off his 'stomach hair!' and lacquer plates when he goes out to dinner! But another fun episode was the second week when the old fella (carrying father) won at Bingo and that episode struck me up with laughter, especially as they went out and got a new fridge and Carrie's father stood there and watched it and thought it was new. <br /> <br /> So I don't know how much longer it has to run on Irish TV or at what time (recorded year) we are on, but I hope it doesn't end soon because I'm I can like it. <br /> In summary, there is something good to write, some good characters and comedy effects (namely Carrie, Doug and Carry's father) some good punchlines and delivered well - a little sour and close to the mark sometimes (send the kids out in the room!), but I think this American Sitcom is a winner and a lot of fun.
