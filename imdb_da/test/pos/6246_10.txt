"Tourist Trap" is a really spooky low-budget horror movie that will surely satisfy horror fans.It contains extremely strange atmosphere and there are some quite unpleasant moments of total fear and fear. Some scenes are actually bizarre for example, there is a scene when Chuck Connors sits down to have dinner with a mannequin that comes to life and starts talking to him before the head falls off. There is very little going on, but the violence is pretty strong for PG-rated horror movies. Mannequins look very scary and the Climax is horrible. David Schmoeller returned to make several other genre films, including "Crawlspace", "Puppet Master" and "Netherworld". Seated "Tourist Trap" is definitely his best horror movie, so if you want to be scared, give this little gem a look. <br /> <br /> classified PG for short nudity, violence and profanity.
