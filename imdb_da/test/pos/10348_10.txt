David Tennant and Sarah Parish's brilliant plays had me in tears, as many of the scenes were so familiar to me. My husband suffered a subarachnoid bleeding in 1977 and required a major surgery involving lifting his brain and connecting the leak. Like Tricia, I was naive enough to expect him to return to his former self. After over 25 years of love and care for him, he left me without warning to go live with a woman he hardly knew. He then asked for a divorce. I hope the program has helped people understand what it is to deal with brain damage.
