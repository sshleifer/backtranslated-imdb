This movie was full of excitement and well-tended, the black and white effect made it a great mystery. Fay Emerson, (Hilda Fenchurch), who was married twice to the famous musician Skitch Henderson, and also the son of Elliott Roosevelt (FDR's Son), fell in love with Zachary Scott (Ronnie Mason / Marsh). Ronnie wins the hearts of all the ladies in the picture, even Mona Freeman (Anne Fenchurch) and suggests marriage when he can. Rosemary DeCamp (Dr. Jane Silla) (famous radio and television actress in the 30s and 40s mostly played small town MOMs) warned the ladies about Ronnie Mason's sick mind and the tremendous childhood he had when he grew up up, which caused his love / hate relationship with women. Fay Emerson and Zachary Scott would have been bigger stars with more rewarding roles, but their lives were short lived in real life. This movie is more than critical, it is a trully great 1945 movie classic for many generations to see and enjoy!
