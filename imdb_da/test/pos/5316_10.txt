My God, Ryan Gosling has made many deep characters in his career, this is one of his wonderful plays. For me, it is a very deep movie that requires a lot of concentration, not because it is hard to see just because you understand it if you put your shoes in this child even though it has everything and has a famous father who is the author , have a deeper mind, you do not understand why he kills this poor child until you really have heard what he has to say and you start thinking, at least for me, that many things he says are true . Simple child, sweet, very gentle, in a way like any teen, but inside of him suffers because he begins to look at the world in a different way, then you understand why he did what he did. I recommend this movie to those who like deep drama.
