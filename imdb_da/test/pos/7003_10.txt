As a zombie fan, I really love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by evil monsters! PB is also an excellent tie-in for the Chronicle of Riddick (COR). The band should run as fast as they can away from the dark. There are so many metaphors in history! Riddick is this bad guy, but he's also the hero trying to save the slow people. The Muslim guy, Imam, relies on the sun's positions for the five times a day of prayers, but he is stuck in a country where darkness will rule. In general, I recommend this movie to all sci-fi fans. You will not be disappointed.
