Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and especially "thriving" by one of them. An outraged "Spike" -type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is located in a disability home and quickly creates friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside the home, but McAvoy has, and he's bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they can only do so in this fun and cordial and often heartbreaking inner strength story that overcomes physical shortcomings. The two leaders are great, especially Robertson, who must have spent some time studying the disabled to pull out this difficult role. He appears in almost every scene and performs an absolute storm. For anyone who doesn't know, they may think he really has CB. Highly recommended.
