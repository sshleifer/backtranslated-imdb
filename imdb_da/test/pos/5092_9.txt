30 years after the original film, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" was transferred as a musical. Peter O'Toole and Petula Clarke stood in this wonderful remake of the beloved schoolteacher, Chippington, called Chips by his beloved wife. O'Toole was excellent here and received another Oscar nomination. You have to wonder what Peter O'Toole should do to win an Oscar. He has lost the coveted price 8 times now. You also have to wonder that in 1969 he lost to John Wayne for "True Grit," which was really a testament to Mr. Wayne's long career and popularity. This year was also marked by amazing performances by Richard Burton, "Anne of the Thousand Days", as well as Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight for "Midnight Cowboy." <br /> <br /> Surprised to see Petula Clarke cast as Mrs. Chippington. But as this was a musical, a beautiful voice came through, and she also did a good play. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the scene when Chips continues in class despite the news that his beloved has been killed in a bombing. He never got to tell her the wonderful news about his pending campaign. The beautiful movie and music only improved a truly memorable experience.
