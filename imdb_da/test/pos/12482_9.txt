First, it is obvious as a police drama crossed with a fun melodrama, QUAY ?? is worrying, fairly independent and a threat to banality. Jouvet's aplomb is used for good use in a hard police officer who can be immediately felt by his powerful and exuberant force; his Antoine is not so much an intellectual man, but a man of great life experience and earthly instinct. QUAY ?? is not subversive in the sense that today's (and already yesterday) philistines enjoy using the word. It's Clouzot's most legendary hour. He tended to adapt Steeman's books into a satirical note. (It is said that Clouzot was a great reader of detective books.) As a director, Clouzot's permanent hand is successful. <br /> <br /> It's not a mystery or a thriller, but a satirical look at a Parisian couple and in police cases. Those who are accustomed to Clouzot's masterpiece LES DIABOLIQUES may perhaps confuse the many things, styles, elements of QUAY ??. Here, Clouzot talks about many things, about a couple and a hidden love story (Simone Renant's for Blier) about the world of entertainment and about old spinsters, about police techniques and an old bitter politician with a boy to travel up, etc. There is a remark about infidelity ? Not only in Jouvet's performance, but also in the film's view. <br /> <br /> Quay is a realistic criminal drama made like satire. It gives an excellent performance of Jouvet as a tough police visit. Antoine is an old policeman with an adventurous past (he fought in Africa, but did not climb on the stairs of the ranks because of his independent behavior); he lives with his son, a schoolgirl At work, Antoine is hard and merciless, a capable inspector, bitter, intelligent and hard. It's a big gusto, very picturesque role. Jouvet composed his character of several defining features ?? his clothes, his expression, his fun accent, his brutality and the mocking air. Antoine is not made to look more clever than credible; When questioning Blier, Antoine makes mistakes, and his talent is presented as the talent we meet in real life mixed with mistakes and gaps and defects. Antoine's talent is one that also comes from experience, from daily observation? It is not the almost supernatural _divinatory genius of almost all the famous detectives. QUAY ?? is multifaceted. It is a realistic criminal drama, and also a satire and a melodrama. One can consider it among the first _ filmical forays in the legendary toughness of the French police. Long ago Eastwood's and Wayne's tough police were Antoine. <br /> <br /> The title is interesting, suggesting that this is a movie about the police, not a case or a mystery. <br /> <br /> As a craft, Clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in France (in the way Welles was). QUAY ?? is very true for Clouzot's nature? A sardonic cartoon, sharp observations, a lot of psychology, sharp, unequaled irony. The man was first class when he filmed something? He knew what to shoot, what to choose? See the introductory scenes in this movie, with Jenny Lamour's great stage success. Each scene is strange, for example shot. Clouzot's technical, stylistic abilities were amazing. His style is inventive, satirical, sharp, extremely clear, brilliant. <br /> <br /> Jouvet style was bubbly, powerful and powerful. (Some did not like it precisely for these features. As he had been a great stage actor, his film state was regarded as theatrical, etc.) Hans Antoine is a fine example of what was meant by composing a role in a composition. <br /> <br /> Jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomy? Much like a threatening bird of prey? Something like Van Cleef? Even more subtle, more noble and more intelligent and prominent. Jouvet had this predator, wild air, and this is useful here when he performs an old hard policeman. One of QUAY ?? s pages are that it is a Jouvet recital. He is immediately recognizable, identifiable by the quality of his game (I see that many see this flick, do not know it is a Jouvet movie, which is an amazing quality in itself). <br /> <br /> Fresnay and Jouvet are the two French actors that I admire most; the first was revealed to me by a Renoir drama (the famous), while Jouvet became a Carn√© comedy. I was charmed to see that Clouzot gave leading roles to both of them. <br /> <br /> Finally, a word about Steeman; he wrote the novel, which was used by Clouzot (who had previously adapted another Steeman novel, as a Fresnay comedy). Steeman was an old school mystery writer, in the Wallace vein. He quickly became obsolete with the new hard-boiled fashion species. When I was 11, I read one of his thrillers and liked it very much.
