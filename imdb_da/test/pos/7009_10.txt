I'm 15, usually not kids, my age usually looks at these old classic movies. But this is one of my favorites. I was totally addicted after seeing it for the first time. It's really good if you think of technology and movies back at that time, music is great, history is ok, choreography is great, must see it. I don't know why there is a prequel for this movie. Not many people like this movie, but I love classic love movies, they are so much better than movies now! This movie will make you smile, cry and make you start dancing. The music is absolutely captivating and beautiful. I haven't seen Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights (prequel), prequel should have the star the original actors, that's what I hate about prequels, they destroy the original. No one wants a prequel, they want a successor. Many people agree that for a movie - the original, the successor and the third is enough. Besides that, people are not worried about seeing it. Who remembers the movie about St Benard Beethoven? I think there are 5 movies completely.
