Jean Renoir's greeting to Paris in the late 19th century is beautiful in many ways. It does not only appear to have been photographed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha, it depicts the geographical Paris; The streets are only accessible by stairs, the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity and sexual opportunism in men with a product selling in an uncompromising image of show business that is in stark contrast to the image painted by Hollywood. There is an obvious comparison with Lloyd Bacon's 42nd Street, which was made about 20 years earlier, and gave Ruby Keeler as a dance experience a fresh face child from the sticks that had come to New York to enter show business, who rescues the show when the star fails - "You need a child from the choir, but you have to come back a STAR !!" Warner Baxters "Julian Marsh" is a director who suffers from his art and is not appreciated. Jean Gabin's "Danglard" is fighting for genital policy, but when he talks about the show, he is more like Knute Rockne than Julian Marsh. He is just about the game, except - for his pointed things. He has a profitable new venture stitched up until his mistress becomes jealous of the woman she recognizes as her next mistress. His prospects rise and fall with every journey he takes. <br /> <br /> Danglard takes Mistress 1 (Lola de Castro, played by Maria Felix) dormant to a dive where he sees "Nini" (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) with his boyfriend and baker Paulo and discovers that she is a lively dancer. He uses his charm and the prospect of money to entice Nini to study dance so she can go on stage. The prospect of money and fame charms Nini and she becomes Danglard's next mistress, as well as an apt student on the cancane, which Danglard has called "French Cancan" to accommodate the current Anglophile trend in the dance. <br /> <br /> Both "42nd St" and "French Cancan" are tribute to show business - to modern entertainment - that has its own iconography and its own objection. "42. St." is centered on Julian Marsh, a good director of Broadway shows, which he organizes with great personal energy and doubtful sexual involvement. The male juvenile is a medieval twit with lumbago, replaced by Dick Powell, the beautiful tenor with secret wealth to conceal. Danglard, on the other hand, goes from woman to woman and seduces them with the promise of fame and chops with what must have been a very convincing endowment. One has no doubt that he is heterosexual and quite active. Postcoital scenes abound. <br /> <br /> Days after seducing Nini away from Paulo, he has discovered Esther, a Piaf type, and started preparing her for her job singing the movie's theme song while playing it on her fool. Of course, it awakens Nini's envy, just as she has aroused Lalias envy. (And of course, Nini had already disappeared the privilege of being a czarina!) The whole movie is about how Danglard's conclusions cost him money, but how much his cumbersome passion is subject to his love for the show - how the audience demands affection - and that is this Potential combination of false persuasion and tempting fame that makes Danglard the hero while claiming that a true lover of the show will never earn as much as the money men. At the conclusion of the film, Danglard approaches that he has shown the creditors and the jealous babes, a new attraction that looks at cancan's incredible (and believe me, it's incredible). "Have you ever thought of being on stage?" he asks, and the curtain down. Meanwhile, the bad Julian is sitting in the fire extinguisher of the theater, listening to Peggy Sawyer's new fans, averting his contribution to the show's success. (I don't even want to go into the "42nd Street" central line, "Oh, Guy, it was GRAND of you coming!") <br /> <br /> Also, I don't go into the glimpse you get legendary Parisian entertainers, including a brief vision of Piaf, nor about the vision of a Paris, both urban and rural. There is certainly a sample of the styles that created the Trenet and Aznavour. But it is a repetition of a confident and welcome masculinity, something unseen in any Hollywood musical as it is, is a pleasant relief from the androgynes of 30 Hollywood musicals (including my beloved Fred Astaire, not to mention Dick Powell) , let alone barf released by MGM in movies as the repulsive "American in Paris." All the fountains! We save our comparison of the turkey to "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and its deconstruction of the American man for another day. <br /> <br /> The Danglard may have been a hope for the vision, in post-war France, of some kind of hypermaskulin mec that may or may not have existed, is practically next to the point. Being a man's husband, neither John Wayne nor Edward Everett Horton, is perhaps more on target. That he is a man who likes the ladies is never in doubt. I didn't mind living his life at all. I wonder if Gabin was so lucky. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this comment I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis called "boloney". I never got that far. Baz's Moulin Rouge ... well, Paris doesn't put that sort of thing in the Seine anymore.
