I started to see this show by accident, but I love it. The fact that the protagonist is in a wheelchair is something that is lacking in television, especially for children's exhibitions. My five-year-old nephew (who most children do) would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other form of disability, but after he looked at Pelswick it just seemed to be a normal event for him. Every time he saw a wheelchair, he would just say "Like Pelswick" and continue what he originally did. And yes the animation is a bit raw, but if you can stand to look through the first season of the Simpsons then it's not that bad. "Genie" is actually an angel there to help Pelswick learn life lessons. He can't go somebody else said he could go a bit of time, I've seen every episode, and he never came to my recall, he's a paraplegic, he has no feeling under his armpits (he mentions it in an episode) . In terms of humor, if you can get a copy of the episode "Ntalented", which lampoons boy bands, you will immediately love this show.
