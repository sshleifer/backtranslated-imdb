'War movie' is a Hollywood genre that has been made and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem inevitable for any conflict that deals with great struggle. Once in a while, however, there comes a war film that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War era "Cold Mountain" with Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a movie. <br /> <br /> Again Cold Mountain calls "a war movie is not quite accurate. True enough, the movie opens with a (quite literally) fast and dirty fight sequence that puts" glory "director Edward Zwick ashamed. Cold Mountain "is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people History is centered on the disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who is crazy about the cruel war and home of the beautiful village of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman, at first glance, this setup seems formal, as the romantic interest back to home gives the audience enough sympathy to rotate the restrained soldier's hardship on the battlefield. The former segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even "Cold Mountain" soon takes a drastic turn, but as the untouched hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (in Moreover, the audience rescues from the potentially confusing scenario that wants to roam for Confederates) and begins a long odyssey home. Meanwhile, back on the farm, Ada's cultured ways of spending a little on the fields show; soon she will be transformed into something of a wilderness. Getting to Ada's rescue is the course, robust-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, which helps Ada put the farm together again and perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation that the war seems to have brought on Ada . <br /> <br /> Within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and sometimes very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters that Inman and Ada interact with are surprisingly complex, enhanced by amazing performances by Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's death-borne father, Ray Winstone as an unwarranted southern "lawyer" and Natalie Portman as a deeply concerned and isolated young mother. Everyone has been severely affected and changed by the "war on northern aggression", mostly for the worse. The dark, transparent anti-war message, accentuated by an effective, scary score and chilling beautiful shot from Virginia and North Carolina, is conveyed to the audience not so much by gruesome fighting scenes as by the older country and traumatized people for whom the war was being fought. Although weapons and tactics in the war have changed a lot in the last century, the sacred effect on the earth is timelessly relevant. Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the movie, but the atmosphere is unfortunately averted by a rather lukewarm climax that does not give justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is suddenly dressed at the beginning and end of the movie, although their relatively intrinsic, abstract and even absurd character somehow fits in with the gloomy character of the rest of the plot. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, "Cold Mountain" has neither the emotional romance nor the inspirational war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience in the life of a people torn apart by a war and totally desperate to get rid of its terrible consequences entirely.
