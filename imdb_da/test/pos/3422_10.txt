I haven't seen a movie for a long time that moved me and grabbed me in such a way; that I could not take my eyes off the screen. I broke for loo; And I wouldn't even stop it because I was pulled straight in. Emotiv; powerful; very moving; horrific and heartbreaking. It gives you a great insight into South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The action of the managers was mind-blowing and the manuscript was incredible. Despite the terrible events unfolding in this movie and how horrible the story is; I was jailed. I will not even try to explain the story; It's too complex, and I wouldn't do it justice. Please see this; You understand why when you do. Bowl, Hol
