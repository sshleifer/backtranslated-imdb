I saw it because my friend said we could try it when my father asked if we wanted to see it. I didn't want to, because it was such an old movie, how could it be good? I finally saw that friend and my father. my friend and i loved the movie. the songs are great, the actors were cool and we were crazy about it. I think this shows, even though it is from his father's time, that doesn't mean it can't be a good movie. I bought the movie not long after watching it on TV, I put it a lot and sang along with the songs. I've even seen it with my classmates at my birthday party. It's a good, good and sometimes funny movie. <br /> <br /> If you don't try, you can't say it's bad. Even if you believe no, I will not see a movie from Father's time. Try the first part of the movie, you can always stop watching if you don't like it. I really recommend it, it's fantastic !!
