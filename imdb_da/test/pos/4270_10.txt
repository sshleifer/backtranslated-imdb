As an English teacher, I appreciate movies that do more than tell a story. Good films, such as good literature, make you think, reflect and predict. This movie made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also like the fact that, despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem like young or criminal as other movies I've seen. The action is pretty good, and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other. Excellent soundtrack, with songs you don't listen to on the radio. It's an association with life / spontaneous road trip films that deserve more than just another look.
