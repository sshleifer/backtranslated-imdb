I work at a nuclear power plant so I get a kick out of those answers. <br /> <br /> I seriously do it. Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades_Nuclear_Generating_Station and you can see where I work. <br /> <br /> I couldn't think of a safer industry to work in. We are committed to procedures to report events as minor as paper cuts. Any problem identified as a potential problem with regard to nuclear, radiological or industrial safety is reported immediately in corrective action. <p> <p> <p> Underlining is that nuclear power plants in the United States work with certainty in the front of their minds.
