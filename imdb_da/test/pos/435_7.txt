This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance garden. In many ways, it reminds me of Hollywood's musicals from the 40s and 50s as it has many clich√©s that lead to the inevitable conclusion ("will the show continue?"). Of course none of this is new, it was comfortable and well made. The musical numbers at the end are frantic and beautiful to see. In many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. In reality, Ziegfeld was completely playing, but this was sanitized in the American movie. But in FRENCH CANCAN, the characters have fully functioning libido - but nothing is really shown, so the movie is okay for kids. Nothing new but well done anyway.
