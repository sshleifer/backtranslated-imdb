One year after her triumphant first special, "My Name Is Barbra", Barbra Streisand rebuilt with his production team to produce this follow-up CBS TV especially in such revolutionary color. First broadcast in March 1966 follows "Color Me Barbra" a similar format to its predecessor - three segments, the first two with unique concepts. The first takes place in the after-hours halls of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where it is dressed as a girl, she hits the galleries and becomes part of the artwork through song. In various guides, Streisand expresses a number of moods from "Minute Waltz" comedy to the melodrama "Non C'est Rien" in a Modigliani painting for the beatnik style phase of "Gotta Move" set to abstract art. My favorite moment in the thesis is when she turns into a queen of Queen Nefertiti while she sings a joking rendition of Rogers and Hart's "Where or When". <br /> <br /> Opening with another comic monologue full of stupid non-sequiters, this time in French, is the second segment left in the studio for a light-colored circus medley in which she interacts with animals, including her beloved poodle Sadie. She finds an appropriate context for "Sam, you made the pants too long" with a host of penguins and comically compares his profile to an anteater with "We have so much in common". As with the first special, the program ends with a fast-paced solo concert, where she sings some chestnuts, "Any Place In Hang My Hat Is Home," "Where am I going?" and "Starting Here, Starting Now" among them. Also included is the short introduction she filmed in 1986, ironically dressed in all-white, since the thesis was first released on VHS. The combination between local and singing is even more effective than in her first special, and a 23-year-old Streisand is in top form.
