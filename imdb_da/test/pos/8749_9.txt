Compared to the renowned Hollywood remake, this movie is less flashy, but much stronger to give an overall picture of the drug problem. The remake loses the most interesting of the three plot threads, namely a farmer whose small livelihood depends on drugs as a paying cash crop, and whose increased involvement with the drug trade in an attempt to improve himself destroys himself and his family. In addition, the story of the daughter's dependence goes into the problems not only with the withdrawal, but also the high probability of relapse. This original miniseries makes good use of the extra time to go further into the issues and stay stronger on this controversial topic.
