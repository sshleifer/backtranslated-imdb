This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. I looked for about 20 minutes, a little confused about what was going on. Then I started laughing and didn't stop until the movie ended. Such deadpan satire is rare. Christopher Guest has a real eye for the humor associated with those who have no sense of humor about themselves (about 90% of the white heterosexual men begin with). As in "Waiting for Guffman" Guest nails Central America's idiotic self-esteem on the wall. I can hardly wait for his next movie.
