Plot in a nutshell - Duchess (Eva Gabor's voice) is the well-polished single mother cat of three small kittens. When their owner, the rich elderly woman, known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time is running out, she decides to write her will and leaves everything she has for her cats, who then goes to her butler Edgar when the cats pass. Edgar overhears this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would get everything for him and suddenly destroy the duchess and her kittens; He loses sleeping pills in their dinner one night and then leaves them stranded in the French countryside. Out of their element, the duchess and her kittens befriended a street of smart swelling cat known as Thomas O'Malley (voice of Phil Harris who made the voice of the great bear Balloo in Jungle Book); after making a passport to the Duchess, unaware that she is a single mother, O'Malley decides to escort them home, where the Duchess really falls to O'Malley when the usual coherent surrogate family bond develops; chaos and chaos ensues, culminating in a violent clash between O'Malley, his brother's cats from the streets and Edgar. Also, appearances of British geese, American southern dog dogs (what they did in France are any guess), a mouse that sounds a lot like the rabbit from "Alice In Wonderland" (he was actually voiced by the same guy who stood Winnie the Pooh ) and a horse. <br /> <br /> Sometimes slow but still fun Disney venture. Contains the memorable "Everyone Who Wants to be a Cat" musical piece sung by the late Scatman Crothers (better known as 1980's fans as Jazz on Transformers). Of course, if this was done now, it would probably be a dark social commentary on class division represented by the dividing line between well-bred and well-bred duchess and street-born O'Malley.
