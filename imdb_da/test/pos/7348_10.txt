OMG, it's seriously the best show in the world. It cuts harder than Jackass and CKY and is so fun and entertaining. I love the show. All 5 seasons are awesome, but for a quick summary: Season 1: - Great if you want to plan a scavenger hunt, watch the house be pulled apart and enjoy watching Phil, starving. <br /> <br /> Season 2: - Great if you want to see them buy Castle Bam, watch a slayer concert, see the wonder that is Mardi Gras and the fun to come to, see a demo derby and actually see a construction and opening of a Tree Top Casino. <br /> <br /> Season 3: - Great if you want to see the first Driveway Skatepark, a civil war, Johnny Knoxville, a pirate ship and Don Vito, who actually wins one of Bam's reindeer championship. <br /> <br /> Season 4: - Great if you want to see them in Europe, they get Jobs, a state building and a Bayou and The Dudesons Season 5: - Great if you want to see them in Brazil, Aps birthday , Mike Vallely, Metal Mulisha, Bams Lambo disappears, Bams Lobster gets destroyed, a playboy party in the swimming pool and very last ever Viva La Bam :(
