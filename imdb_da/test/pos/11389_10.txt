Altman and Scorsese have twisted sex together in one of the greatest American films of the last 20 years. Boogie Nights didn't make a big first splash, and I still don't think it received the credit it deserves. The immediate cling around the film ("Some porn movie with Marky Mark") was completely without profit. What Paul Thomas Anderson has created is no less than a fantastic representation of the persecution and subsequent loss of the American dream (if such a thing still exists). <br /> <br /> For those of you who have been living in a box (or confession) for the last 8 years, Boogie Nights tells the literal raising and narrative of young Eddie Adams (Wahlberg). Eddie is just a drowsy child from Torrance, California who wants something more out of life. His room is soaked in muscular, naive Americana. His dreams are far greater than his potential, but not quite as great as his ... special gift. His bald southern gent quickly increases the attention and eyebrows of the thriving, omni-present adult film industry. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds as the movie's twinkle-eyed Papa Bear) gets wind of Eddie's hidden talent and decides to put him in a movie. Before you can say "deep throat", Eddie has changed his name to Dirk Diggler and postponed his massive member for a wide eye publicly. Fame and happiness make Dirk acquainted, like a host of local porno fathers. His friends and colleagues become his vanity family, but soon it turns out to be a Sunday picnic like no other. As the emotionally happy 70s make room for the coke-addled, video-friendly 80s, Dirk & Co. begins. a dangerous blow. <br /> <br /> Anderson put everything he had in this glorious, moving epic. It sizzles and never fizzles. Nary a frame of this monumental image is wasted, and the signs and their dialogue live with us long after ELO falls from the soundtrack. See this right away. And then see it again. <br /> <br /> And again.
