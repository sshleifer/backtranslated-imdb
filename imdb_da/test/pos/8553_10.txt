This movie ... I saw it 15 years ago, and in the last few years it couldn't remember it anymore, name or anything else. It was just about a Romanian country that played excellently by Anthony Quinn. The impression I got from this drama will be forever. Finally I found the name of the movie, I hope I can buy it. And honestly this movie worth 10 oscars. Ten times BRAVO. I was pretty young when I first saw the movie. I asked my friends if they heard about this story, but no one would know anything about Anthony Quinn playing the role of a Romanian farmer. I remember when a German officer came and saw Anthony and told him he was a good "race", but he actually cheated on him. Too few bucks you will not get rich if you buy the movie, but you will be rich if you have it.
