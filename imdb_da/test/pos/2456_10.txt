Estevez, Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are amazing in this depiction of a Vietnam veterinarian's home from the war but still haunted it. Bates plays a clueless mother who just wants the family to be a "family". Sheen is great as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through, but is also wrapped up in his principles for really empathy. The setting is Thanksgiving Day, and relatives come for dinner. Estevez, who plays the recurrent veterinarian, does not want any part of the family tradition and insists on carrying his fighting strife for dinner and explaining "This is what I was carrying last Thanksgiving." Bickering and family arguments are invaluable, especially "peanut crisp crisis", but the end is both gripping and frightening. It should be seen as appreciated. <br /> <br /> All in all, one of the best movies I've ever seen.
