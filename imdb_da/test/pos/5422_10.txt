I've only seen this once - in 1986 at an artistic theater in Minneapolis ... but I remember it as if I saw it a thousand times this morning. Hilarious ("Sawing for Teens", plays Scrabble with all "e" tiles), beautifully animated (takes your eyes up, shakes them back in place and puts them back on) and exciting (the end of the world) ... <br /> <br /> Necessary view to humanity. Calling this simply a cartoon is like calling the big GATSBY nifty typing.
