Feisty Dianna Jackson (a winning spunky performance of the beautiful former Playboy "Playmate Jeanne Bell) goes to Hong Kong to take the evil heroin ring that murdered his brother. Dianna assisted by friendly karate master Joe (gracious Chiquito) faces opposition from undercover drug agent Elaine (lovely blonde babe Pat Anderson) and romantic boyfriends, reckless ambitious Charlie (outlined with supers arrogant aplomb of Stan Shaw) while plotting her revenge against drug kingpin Sid (an effective slimy Ken Metcalfe). Santiago, who works from a blithely trashy script written by none other than Dick Miller (!), Tastes the lively and eventful 72-minute running time with an abundance of free key finesse and lots of badly staged martial arts scenes (Bell has clearly doubled by a squat guy wearing a huge Afro pearl!) The final blurry highlighting happens when a topless bell individually beats a lot of thugs The hotel room Felipe Sacdalan's raw grain scratched filmography, the clumsy use of strenuous slow motion, the funky groovin score, the ridiculously eerie battle choreography and the surprisingly gruesome conclusion add immensely to the overall scuzzy fun of this deliciously ostrich grindhouse exploitation toad.
