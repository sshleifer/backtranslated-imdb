This movie is the one you fall in love with. Alfred Hitchcock must always be over the top of any director in his time. The most influential aspects of his film are Simplicity & Gripping Drama. The second best thing about Hitchcock's movie is a Definitely & Gripping End. <br /> <br /> Anything said about "The Man who knew too much" is less. Cinematography, Acting, Dialogs & Camera Works are magnificent in this movie. The song "Que Sera Sera" at the end remains in our memories for life. The movie is so funny from start to finish that we never know when it ends. Rarely will Hitchcock include humor in his films, this movie has comics that fit into the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely brilliant and as good as Vertigo.
