The reason is starting to be interesting, but in the end many die in a short time, making history's thriller-mystery aspect a slaughter. The only true highlights were Adam Beach and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow who again were their excellent ones. Nice try with an inappropriate last third, though a good ending.
