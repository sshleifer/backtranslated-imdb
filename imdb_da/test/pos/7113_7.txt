This is an entertaining B-flick in the Universal Horror series featuring Dracula, Wolfman and Frankenstein's Monster. The reason is about Dracula (John Carradine) and Larry Talbot, the wolfman (Lon Chaney Jr.) who visits a revolutionary doctor separately. They ask him both if they can be cured and the doctor tries to devise a way for each. Under the doctor's castle, they find Frankenstein's monster buried in mud (this is apparently a reference to the former Frankenstein series film). <br /> <br /> Of course, if things had gone as planned, the movie would have proved incredibly boring. Instead, Dracula cannot suppress his appetite, and the doctor is eventually infected by blood transfusion with vampyrism. As a semi-vampire, the doctor becomes insane and awakens Frankenstein's monster. As with all the Universal Horror series, the end is completely unsatisfactory. A beautiful woman with a hunchback, one of the doctor's two assistants, has a particularly gruesome end. Plus, you just have to be sorry Frankenstein's monster in this movie - he's awake for about two minutes, kills a police officer and then another building (what's the fifth now?) Collapses on top of him and is consumed by flames. It is also unfortunate that the great character created in The Wolf Man (1941), Larry Talbot, is really reduced here. People undermine the movie and Chaney's performance in it. Here he would rightly be criticized as wood. All in all, it's a pretty funny movie in just 68 minutes. A good waste of time. 10.7.
