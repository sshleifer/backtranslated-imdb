I haven't seen so many people packed outside a theater since Star Wars Episode III. Both show sold out, and for good reason. The man with the screaming brain was the best movie to see with a crowd full of nerds. (Hey, I'm also a dork.) <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell was present and had the whole crowd in stitches! The movie was cheesy in the best possible way. It may be the funniest movie Bruce has made. Ted Raimi steals the show with his Bulgarian hip hop itude and zany facial expressions, he is a ridiculous uprising! Who knew Ted could rap? <br /> <br /> I changed the person who stole the show was actually a robot. There's nothing more fun than a robot ... does the robot. <br /> <br /> As far as Bruce's performance is concerned, "I'll take it 5th." Thanks Bruce. Thank you for being cool, thank you for taking the time, thanks for all the fun.
