Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres upside down, and the latest of famous director Chan-wook Park is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire. Add a temptress that takes him to the game and a cast excentrics and you have a wonderful recipe. <br /> <br /> In a style similar to the "Sympathy" trilogy, it is as lavish as it is dark. Clich√© free it gives some new tricks in the overdone vampire genre. It is an existential film that tries to capture the moral concept of exactly where a person should choose to live with their relationship rather than salvation in the desire of the blood. However, the film does not take too seriously, and there is boundless humor all the way through. Our leaders play their roles to perfection, play with our emotions and swear in the dark humor. There are moments of reflection on the entire moral events involved in the movie, but it is never predictive. Some may find it slow and it can rest on points, but it is worth giving it a chance at the end. <br /> <br /> If you like left field films, then there are fewer better than this one too late. Dark and exciting, it will draw in a crowd. One I would recommend to try.
