Anthony Minghela (Author / Instructor) Cold Mountain is a carefully constructed, sensitive and intelligent drama set in the social context of convergence during the Civil War, which deals with war policy in a very subtle and realistic way. While accurately depicting the brutality and inhumanity of this war, it also does something that many films related to this period do not handle so effectively - Cold Mountain studies the southern context from the outside and portrays changes among non-slave-owned people by the war. And almost uniquely, Cold Mountain leaves no sailors, northern, or anyone else. <br /> <br /> The movie surfs through genres as needed - never present a dull moment. It's a romance, a war story, an action adventure and historical fiction, all of which are nicely woven into. History is centered on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) who are infected with each other by much simple reasons. As this young romance begins to pounce, Inman admits to the Confederate army, taking with him a book Ada has given him and a photograph of her. Ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third perspective, but history is clearly her from the beginning to the end. Ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. She starts the film as a father's girl, who is skilled in many of the arts, that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives are expected to learn. In other words, as she admits Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), she is a master of all things useless. Ada's father is passing by and she is back to managing her modest property herself. With no experience of this kind, she struggles and survives by keeping Inman's memory close to her heart. Ruby goes into the picture as a hard young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities that Ada lacks and as they become inseparable business partners, they grow to love each other as best friends. Inman's experience is radically different, but something of a mirror image. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends killed for reasons that they do not really believe in and decide to leave. No one he meets comes to his rescue when he begins the thousand miles back to Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of them face death. <br /> <br /> The bulk of the movie takes place during Inman's long trip, both main characters they live, learn, grow, and change. An ongoing act of desperation will retain their intense passionate love. For Inman, it's his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation. For Ada, it is much the same, but also a symbol and part of the old south - a world that quickly passes by. <br /> <br /> The camera is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful shots of appalachian landscapes that give the film a strong sense of history. The script and editing are also extremely strong - underlining the broad classes and educational differences reflected in ante bellum southern middle and lower class dialects. With the casting of this film, nothing outside of perfection is to be expected. And the casting rises most to the apartment. My one criticism, however, relates to the accents adopted by Kidman and the sign of the law. An Australian and a Brit may not be expected to accurately reproduce the South American speech, but there are a few times when these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting ballot papers. I admit my hypersensitivity to this and can say with great confidence that it will not bother most people. Zellweger's performance is excellent and she creates a sign I will remember in my senescence. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
