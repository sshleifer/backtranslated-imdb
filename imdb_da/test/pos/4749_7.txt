How did they get the biographical shot of the car that collided with the rear end of the semi? And then Roy sets himself up - great! It seems that the DVD is scheduled for May 2006 - about time !! Watch this on a big screen or movie growth in a theater if it is possible to fully appreciate the full aspect ratio. My other favorites in this category are: Original Italian Job with Michael Caine; Bullit with Steve McQueen; To live and die in LA with the CSI guy when he was young; French connection with Gene Hackman; Ronin with Robert Deniro; Disappointing point with Barry Newman; Enemy of the State with Hackman again - What are your favorites?
