I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has received. To be honest, I saw the example of this movie, and the premise fascinated me. Yes, I rented it after reading the comments of others. They are correct because some of the actors leave much to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best notions of this movie was that of Dr. Graves. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the child in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I'm in a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth watching.
