Goldie Hawn, in 1969, was best known for playing in television comedy shows - especially ROWAN AND MARTIN's LAUGH IN, where she was the giggly cookie young blonde. She made movies before CACTUS FLOWER, the most notable being a Walt Disney feature, the only genuine original family band. But CACTUS FLOWER retrieved its character from LAUGH-IN, and (due to a good script by IAL Diamond - Billy Wilder's second partner - based on Abe Burrow's play) she could develop the television character, so a real achievement was sheerity. As a result, Ms. Hawn won an Oscar for the Best Supporting Actress in 1969, and her career began for such future hits as PRIVATE BENJAMIN and THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Although other stars in LAUGH-IN were good at television (Henry Gibson has a recurring role as a judge at BOSTON LEGAL), only Goldie could have a career as a bonifide movie star. <br /> <br /> At LAUGH- In Goldie's personality it would turn out to be a naivety that would be embarrassing. Occasionally she realized and would laugh aloud to cover, but sometimes she just didn't see her mistake (example: Goldie introduced to the 1950s show Gary Moore and told, "Goldie, this is Mr. Gary Moore." She shakes hand and say (much to his confusion), "I always wanted to meet John Gary Moore!"). But as Toni Simmons it is completely different. She is desperately in love with dr. Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), a successful dentist who can never marry her. Julian has told her that his wife (with whom he has two sons and a daughter) will never give him a divorce. So at the start of the film Toni tries to commit suicide at his stove. But she is rescued by her neighbor, Igor Sullivan (Rick Lenz), a struggling playwright who breaks into her apartment and turns off the gas. <br /> <br /> Toni is committed to living, but she sent a suicide note to Julian. Igor tries to deliver a message to ignore the note, but Julian's receptionist / nurse / assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (Ingrid Bergman), will not stop Julian's work schedule to send him the phone when Igor calls. Instead, Julian finds the letter and races of Toni's opportunity to only find her alive. When Igor supports her story that she was trying to kill herself, Julian realizes the depth of her love and decides to marry such a woman. Unfortunately, Toni has extinguished Julian's lies and believes in his wife and children. You see, Julian has no wife and children. When Toni is firmly convinced that she cannot marry a man who would lie to her, Julian is stuck on a debilitating tree branch. <br /> <br /> Julian will fix it by making Stephanie pretend she is Mrs. Winston. Stephanie is against it first, but alone, on her first free Saturday, she confronts Toni at the record store Toni is with. They speak, and Toni notes all the fine strong characteristics and personality Stephanie (and since Stephanie has her two nephews with her, Toni thinks they are Julian's children). Toni tells Julian to see who is Stephanie's husband. So the lie begins to sprout for Julian, Stephanie and Toni. Soon a lover will be given to Stephanie in the form of Julian's friend and freeloading patient Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston). Greenfield is so lukewarm (Stephanie loathes him) that Toni feels he is unworthy of Stephanie. <br /> <br /> And then it goes with a complication (mostly caused by the well-meaning, misinformed Toni) after another until the conclusion. The script is full of first-class situations and one-liners (example: Julian to reward Stephanie for lying about their marriage, buy two record albums from Toni's store. He has given mink to Toni, but she decides to send it to Stephanie with Julian's card Stephanie is very happy to get mink, but she doesn't say anything about the nature of the gift she got - when she thanked Matthau thoroughly, he said the idea that she wanted Horowitz - which means Vladomir Horowitz. believe that Horowitz is the name of the furrier!). <br /> <br /> Bergman must have enjoyed the movie as several scenes show the earthly charisma that was a trademark of her in the late 1940s movie. But there was also the similarity with her 1958 movie comedy smash hit, INDISCREET. There Cary Grant lay to make sure the couple would concentrate on the romance of their affair without having to think of marriage. When Grant's lie is revealed to Bergman, she decides herself for a lie to convince Grant that she made him a cuckold. Here, instead of being the passive lover, Matthau thinks to tell the truth, Bergman gently tries to get Matthau out of his mess at small white lies, only to find one leads to another to complicate everyone's life. Bergman is seen as a nice woman who becomes part of the problem, despite trying to be part of the solution. <br /> <br /> All leaders work well, especially Bergman, first and foremost, business fundamentals, but first and foremost regain her sexuality. Matthau is lovely as a man who finds a useful lie is an obstacle that just can't be kicked aside. Support support, especially Weston as the mooching and sexually slimy Harvey, and Vito Scotti as the UN ambassador who actually has the heads of Bergman. It was a smart comedy and a great way for Goldie Hawn's film career to push forward.
