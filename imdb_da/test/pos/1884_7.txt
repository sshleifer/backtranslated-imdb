This was a funny movie. Just seeing the evil dead trilogy not a week ago (and left the desire more), I got as many Bruce Campbell movies as I could, including really bad ones. This is fun, without being extraordinary, but as safe as hell original. I think you have crazy scientists, superhuman cyborgs, half-brain freaks, gypsies, ex KGB drivers, jealousy, murder of passion, love, romance, sex, action and more, all with the same 6 actors :) <br /> < You really need to see it and enjoy it, I can't explain it in a text box. I think it's not as much a cult movie as Evil Dead was, but it certainly has the Bruce Campbell touch I love. Ted Raimi launches a hand, Tamara Gorski looks both beautiful and interesting (she has gone a long way from the hooker on Friday the 13th) and Vladimir Kolev also shows a lot of promise as an actor, although he is likely to be cast as a secondary character in Hollywood movie all his career. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: fun movie. If you liked Evil Dead, you will also like it here.
