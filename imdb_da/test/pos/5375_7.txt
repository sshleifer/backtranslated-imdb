This very strange ball feature is a typical and leading example of satanic shocking 70-horror. The events are thoroughly confusing and it takes a while before you find out what the hell is going on, but the burning atmosphere immediately sucks you in. Right from the indescribable bizarre intro showing a couple of scary kids making toys into real war machines, you just know this is an uncompromising and greedy shocker. "Satan's brotherhood" soon seems to be another tranche in the alleged and unofficial "spooky little town that hides a dark secret" subgenre. A young widow traveling with her new yummy girlfriend and 8-year-old daughter stops in a remote little town to report a car accident they experienced on a nearby highway. The villages behave very hostile and insist on visitors leaving immediately. The city was bathing in an atmosphere of fear and panic, which local children disappear inexplicably disappeared and unnatural forces maintain all within the city limits. Hillsboro is in the grip of a satanic cult, apparently ruled by the older members of society. I really liked "Satan's Brotherhood" a lot. The story reminded me of a novel written by John Saul, but I can't remember the title. It was also about a cult of older people abusing youthful villagers for their own greedy benefits. The movie is mainly dependent on horrific scenes (such as dolls and witchcraft), but a slightly more involved and coherent manuscript would have been good. The subject often raises many questions and questions, and director Bernard McEveety cannot always give us answers. The Climax is amazing, very seventy (meaning shocking) and unforgettable. Beautifully shot movies too.
