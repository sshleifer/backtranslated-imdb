Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is harassed by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), a bomber who literally thinks he won't be caught. In the opening, everyone's favorite modern serial killer is "John Kramer" (Tobin Bell) from the Saw series. Through great planning and influence, Frank can make the arrest of Mendoza (Bell). <br /> <br /> Then there is a series of cat and mouse competition. Malkovich is an amazing actor and incredibly versatile. I show yet another role in this movie, he confuses me with his ability to exchange his characters with the next movie. <br /> <br /> I've seen Malkovich in Con Air as a threatening crazy clever Cyrus, in Of Mice and Men like the tragically challenged Bunny loves Lenny, to name a few. He plays a very smart bombing terrorist who is very sane, but is deceived into believing that he can elude his prisoners. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood is no one special to me. He's too old to really do much action in movies, so the only thing he can really amaze you with is his ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters he plays are simplistic and one-dimensional. Rene Russo plays Eastwood's love interest in the movie and catches me that she is actually a bigger part to me than Eastwoods. <br /> <br /> While this may seem like an action blockbuster, it is relatively slow paced and anticipating. You have to wait for the build and the end and it will pay off in the end. Along the way you will be fascinated by Malkovich and Eastwood's chemistry and their scenes of cat and mouse.
