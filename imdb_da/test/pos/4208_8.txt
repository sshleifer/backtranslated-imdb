The young John Garfield got a good performance in 1939 "They made me a criminal." Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed closet, boxer Johnnie Bradfield emotes about his love of mother, rejection of booze and pure living style for fans, including police eating it. Later in the evening he is plowing and juggling his bimbo gal while his manager, on the wife, shares the evening. And whiskey. <br /> <br /> A problem develops when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter, and he says he'll reveal Bradfield's fake life on the front. The leader kills the reporter and he and floozy leave. The murder discovered, police are later on looking for the now somnolent boxer whose car is driven by the leader with his new girlfriend Johnny is now the immediate ex. A police hunt ends with a burning car accident. Manager and girl are dead and unrecognizable. <br /> <br /> Johnny discovers he should be a killer. But he is also believed dead. Seeking advice from a lawyer, he leaves the counselor with the key to a bank deposit with his only savings, $ 10,000. The lawyer later gives Johnny $ 250 and tells him that the balance is his fee to give him professional advice: get out of town, quickly and go far away. (I would never charge a client more than $ 5,000 for such a pithy, succinct and wise direction.) Johnny, now a freight shopping hobby, wins out conveniently on an Arizona date ranch where he is nursing back to health at beautiful Goldie West, Ann Sheridan, a fine actress whose career was increasing. With Jack Dorney as his moniker, the pugilist loses some of his coarse edges as he falls in love with Goldie. He becomes a mentor and friend to - The Dead End Kids. Known screen characters for pre-war film players. <br /> <br /> A chance to make money arises when a showbox shows challenging sucks to hold multiple rounds with him. It's a natural temptation for Bradfield / Dorney, but there's a fly in the ointment. Who's gonna show up, but New York's detective Monty Phelan, the department's laugh store? He has been in the morning duty for ages because of a slight mistake in his career that sent an innocent man to Old Sparky (we make every mistake, right?) Phelan recognized Bradfield from a news photo and he is there to watch the match and make the clamp. Claude Rains is a policeman who has been running lights and barbs from his co-officers for years. <br /> <br /> The following is predictable, but it is well-acted. I hope this was a major feature when it was released - it's too good to rank as a "B" other on a tent. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley, best known as an excellent choreographer, directed "they made me a criminal" and Max Steiner, one of Hollywood's full-time score composers, wrote fine but not extraordinary music to the movie. <br /> <br /> Now available on the DVD from Alpha Video, the movie puts me one more $ 4.99 and gave me real pleasure. I'll see it again. <br /> <br /> 8/10
