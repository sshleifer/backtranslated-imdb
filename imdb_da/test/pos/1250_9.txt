Really a wonderful movie. Bruce Willis gives his always outstanding comedian-romantic acting power to this movie, and the movie brings hope to the losers many of us know we are. A gift for everyone in the Middle Ages, whose spent time seems both full and yet empty: there is more about the next bend, and it can be amazing, enriching and romantic. Leave the recent past and return to the lessons of the distant past, then take a favorite flight for your better future. If we could live our youthful experiences if we really could remember the events that shaped us, wouldn't we find a particular kind of freedom? Watch the movie, open the gift.
