History of three eclipses (perhaps even Indigo, ha) children begin their love of murder. Oh, and the people who are "hot" on their tracks. <br /> <br /> Blood birthday, a pretty mediocre title for the movie, was a nice little surprise. I was by no means expecting a movie that treated bloodthirsty psychopaths. And I can also say that this is also one of the best flicks I have seen in children like the bad guys. At the end of the movie, I seriously wanted these children to die in a terrible way. It's a really solid 80's horror flick, but how these kids get away with all this chaos and murder is just something you can't think of. Even the smallest part of the study would easily uncover these lil shs ts as the murderers. But there seems to be only a few police in town, well in the end, only one, and he seemed like a dim white, so I suppose they could have gotten it away. Haha, yes, and I'm a Chinese jet pilot. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this movie delivered some evilass children who were more than entertaining, a lot of premarital sex and a decent amount of boobage. No kiddin! If you are discouraged by the less than the star's title, dash it from your mind and give this flick a shot. It is a highly recommendable and underrated 80's horror flick.
