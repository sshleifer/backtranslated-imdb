Agree that this was one of the best episodes of this show. I remember the series just as I was in the Florida Keys when the show had its debut. I look through old video tapes that were "users" and encountered two that had about eight episodes. I ended up spending part of Christmas Eve (and the next) watching these shows. The singer was Bankie Banx - so his name came up on the credits. He is from Anguilla and owns a beach bar called The Dune Preserve. He is a long-standing friend of Jimmy Buffett and Bankie's classic song "Still In Paradise" found on the latest Buffett CD / DVD combo called "Live In Anguilla" - it's number # 12 on CD 1 and # 8 on CD ' one. I would also like to see this short-lived series one day on DVD. Keep faith!
