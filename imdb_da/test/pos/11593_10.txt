This small, quiet and harmonious film grows into a masterpiece of human dignity. It is intelligently structured, filled with meaningful little details and important pages. It tells a story of a man of great humanity without positioning itself politically, but promoting life as a valuable right (not a commitment) and emphasizing the individual's right to choose. It enjoys the wealth of different landscapes (mentally and physically) and languages ​​(important details). Excellent performance by each of the actors, especially incredible Javier Bardem. His screen presence has such power that you forget that this is fiction. The film has a wonderful rhythm, it is beautifully shot and outwardly directed. It takes true talent to make a movie on such a difficult subject with understanding, humor and heart. Six stars out of five.
