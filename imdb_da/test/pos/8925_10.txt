I'm a 55 year old, pretty combed gay white man. Since I don't watch TV, I see at least 250 movies a year, most on DVD. I keep notes on all the movies I see and judge them. Since December 2003, I have only seen five movies as well as AUGTEEN. So I rated EIGHTEEN better than at least 700 other recent films. Mr. Bell is too modest in his film commentary. Above is a great movie. And it also resulted in two "firsts" for me. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie for the first time, and I was ridden all the way through the last half hour, something that only happened to me three times before. (Five minutes in the movie, I knew it was very good.) When Jason started reciting Whitman, I lost it and then ... The Kiss. Well, it's one of the movie's big kisses, and the scene of the movie's most poignant and unforgettable. When Pip blows the light at the end and the credits are rolled, I clapped. I cheered. I love happy endings. I cried. <br /> <br /> Then I saw the trailer and TLA previews and thought, "Okay, is this $ 800,000 or so Indie really that big?" So I immediately saw AGT again, something that has only happened three times before. And EIGHTEEN blew my socks off yet again, even more. Then I looked at the "Making of EIGHTEEN" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and Mr. Bell. <br /> <br /> So I thought I'd see EIGHTEEN again with the director's comment. I have never before seen a movie three times in one night. After the third time at 3:00 am, I knew I had just seen a big movie; AROUND now stands # 10 on my top 20 movies all the time. And in the very small universe of great gay or gay subtitles is Brokeback Mountain, AUGTEEN, Mulholland Drive and Maurice. <br /> <br /> Thank you Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully realized, with magnificent casting, a wonderful movement, discrete score, excellent filmography, an entertaining, touching, perfectly fitting and hummable song. I can continue, but I won't throw too much more. <br /> <br /> This movie should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for best picture. The performances were all without exception wonderful. Ms Gill's lovely, sultry voice was a surprising epiphany. And Mr Ian McKellen? "Said Nuf. Awesome. EIGHTEEN is the reason why I beat over 200 mediocre to horrible movies (some in the $ 150 million plus range) a year to find one treasure, one exquisite, magical, unique and enchanting. perfect "Faberge egg" with an unforgettable heart. <br /> <br /> Finally (I promise), my second "first" - I have never written a comment on any movie I've seen before. <br /> <br /> Thanks again, Richard Bell! Breathtaking genius. Give this man $ 100 million for his next movie! He made $ 700,000 for one of the 50 best movies all the time. If I had cash, I would give him $ 75,000 a year cost of living and match any funds raised to his next movie, Mr. Bell is already a great instructor at 31-year-olds. Can you imagine him at the age of 45? <br /> <br /> Clever and witty tender and brutal, clear, attractive, discreet, yet edgy, chilling and exciting, fascinating, unforgettable: real, MASTERPIECE.
