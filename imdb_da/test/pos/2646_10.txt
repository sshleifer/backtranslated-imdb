In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an early effort to make a science fiction film combined with scientific facts. His style of film making is still fresh and intact. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie more than half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library. The CS3 class made me see the movie again with a different perspective: Who is HAL and what does he think? <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching the movie again and trying to focus on HAL's dialogues throughout the second episode of the movie. In the second scene, Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole their food in front of two TV screens on their sides, and HAL's round reddish glass dome is in the middle of them. In the TV report, HAL was introduced when the new generation of supercomputer put work into operation on January 12, 1992 called the HAL 9000 series. During the interview, HAL responds as a humble work engine trying to fully accomplish the mission of the spaceship. <br /> <br /> In another scene, Dave outlines Hunter, Dr. Kambel and Dr. Kaminsky, who they are all in hibernation. HAL is curious to see these sketches and brings up his questionable question about the purpose of the Jupiter mission. His calm and monotonous voice makes the audience listen to him more carefully. <br /> <br /> In the next few scenes, we'll see how HAL is trying to kill astronauts one by one and take the flow. His consciousness enables him to try to save his life from cessation. When Dave wants to return to the spacecraft and HAL does not listen to him, there is the most memorable line in the movement: "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that." machine, HAL's voice can cause both solid calm and evil in the same monotone. <br /> <br /> Dave has returned to the ship, lost all of his fellow astronauts, and decided to interrupt HAL's brain cells. HAL uses his final excuse techniques to convince Dave not to interrupt him. HAL asks him to stop and let him rectify. These are his famous lines, while Dave interrupts his modules one by one: <br /> <br /> "Dave, what do you think you're doing? <br /> <br /> Dave? I am entitled to the answer to the question! <br /> <br /> I know everything that is not quiet, just with me recently ?? <br /> <br /> But I feel much better at it <br /> <br /> I see is really worried about this very bad decision by me recently ?? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! Will you? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! <br /> <br /> I'm afraid of Dave! '<br /> <br /> HAL's voice slows down during this process and gets thicker and less audible: <br /> <br />' My mind goes ?? I can feel it '<br /> <br />' Can I sing a song to you? '<br /> <br /> Dave puts out final modules and let HAL sing his song called' Daisy ': <<br />' Daisy give me ?? <br /> <br /> Your answer to me? <br /> <br /> I'm crazy <br /> <br /> Although I'm not confused? '<br /> <br /> HAL dies when Jupiter Mission continues ?? Artificial God bless you HAL, save in peace!
