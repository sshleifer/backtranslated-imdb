is not a bad movie, but the play and the manuscript can be better. I like this movie because I have a life that's a great deal like that in the movie. It's difficult for a lost generation to get a life in Romania, and 90 percent of us choose something else, and something else involves dealing with people with "bad habits" if you understand me, but it comes with the territory. this movie represents me and i like it. i have a rage in me that barley speaks to people i live in a troubled society and i cant fit in and i dont want to and that is also the movie's story if you are like me, you can understand the true movie If not, you will find it easy and cheap.
