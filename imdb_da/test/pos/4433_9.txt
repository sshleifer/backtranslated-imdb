After visiting the Kimbell Museum in Forth-Worth, Texas, USA, enjoying the art and architecture (also in the adjacent Modern Art Museum) and having a nice conversation with the skilled bookstore lady, did I buy this a DVD with slightly high expectations ?? and was not disappointed at least. The thematic approach, dramatic tensions, revealing interviews, archive films and stunning architecture are also blended into a coherent whole to explore life in the late iconic Louis I. Khan. <br /> <br /> The documentary begins: contemplative classic music games, archives scanned with a reflective shady face overlaid, blurred letters symbolically referring to a train window passing past a landscape landscape ?? A journey, focus and out of focus culminates in the search for an article in a newspaper. Nathanial Khan reads from the cover of the New York Times where his father is also praised as the best American architect alive and his death announced. <br /> <br /> "When I first read it, I must admit I was looking for my own name. I was also his child, his only son. I didn't know my father very well. Never married. my mother and he never lived with us (?) he died when i was eleven. <br /> <br /> So many years later, this illegal son is still haunted by unclear fragmented thoughts and feelings about his father who seem to be a great professional and public figure, but who is secretive personal life escapes him and influences him to the point where he intends to do something about it. "For years, I struggled to be content with the small pieces of my father's life I have been allowed to see, but it wasn't enough I needed to know him. I needed to find out who he really was. So I sat on a journey to see his buildings and to find what was left of him out there. It would take me to the other side of the world looking for the man who left me with so many questions. "<br /> <br /> So the documentary is two-fold by a slow systematic discovery of the world-renowned architect, we learn: 1) his ideas, buildings, and architectural perspective, and 2) his families, colleagues, people's lives, he has hit and the human perspective <br /> <br /> The DVD also adds added insight into a Q&A with the author / director and additional footage containing so great Louis I. Khan quotes as "Everything Everyone Says , is the truth. It's their truth. It cannot be fact. "And" A good idea that doesn't happen is no idea at all. "<br /> <br /> This movie is a voyage of discovery. Self-discovery and discovery of a man, a great man, yet human, imperfect as all of us. We get to know him through an admiring and slightly bitter son, but openness and objectivity to really explore without making simple conclusions and without judging. <br /> <br /> In key interviews with people who interact with him in different capacities, we slowly put some pieces together for the last interview with this man from Bangladesh who really seem to bring it home with visceral and sensible comments. <br /> <br /> Brilliant architect, brilliant documentary.
