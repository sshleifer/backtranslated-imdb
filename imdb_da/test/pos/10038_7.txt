Of course, along with every other reason, I was expecting a lot of Hollywood fantasy revisionism in the DIED WITH their BOOTS ON over the Custer legend. Just having someone like Errol Flynn play Custer is probably a clue that the legend has primacy over the truth of this production. And for the most part, my expectations were met (in a rousing and entertaining way). Even in this overtly tense (and highly criticized) tale of the Custer story, I was struck by some of the points made in this film, which sometimes seemed subtly but firmly to counteract the typical cliches of apparent fate and irresponsible heroism. which is usually found in western in the early 20th century. <br /> <br /> For example, although this film tried to whiten it, some scenes still suggested the more flawed and stupid character of reality Custer: <br /> <br /> 1) His initial West entrance Point the front gate where his arrogance and pompiness is a clear aspect of his character. <br /> <br /> 2) His miserable record at West Point, apparently attributed to Custers cluelessness of military service claims like any other factor; There are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point, where he seems stupid. <br /> <br /> 3) Custer's promotion to General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but it plays like a slapstick comedy. I'm half expected to see that Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello walk into the scene. <br /> <br /> 4) Custer's stand against Jeb Stuart in Gettysburg is not whitewashed as a brilliant military tactical leadership, but presented as ruthless and very lucky. <br /> <br /> 5) Custor's drinking problems are certainly not ignored. <br /> <br /> And while the music and some of the ways the Indians were shown in this movie, it was certainly reinforcements of racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it still came as a surprise to me that the film actually went into detail. why the Indians were entitled to attack the whites who moved into their country and justified the blame for the fighting in the black hills, at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can argue that the clear villain of the play is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as the white devils make the false claim of gold in the Black Hills. Well, that part of the story is true, but I didn't expect to see it portrayed so uniquely in a movie like this. And another thing: Normally in these movies, the Indians are portrayed as a drunk animal apparently incapable of basic common sense to avoid falling full when they come close to alcohol. In this movie, it is actually the troops of the 7th Cavalry, and not the Indians, who are portrayed in at least two scenes in this way. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie slides in surprising moments in the midst of Hollywood bunk beds.
