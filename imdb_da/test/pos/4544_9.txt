This movie is probably not the funniest thing I have ever seen, and it certainly does not have much redeeming value. In fact, it's really nothing but a collection of vignettes tied together by a loose plot. But this "make-it-up-as-go-along" setting actually works for the benefit of the movie. "Tommy Boy" succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that SNL outlines Farley and Spade who succeeded. They managed to be humorous despite their immaturity.
