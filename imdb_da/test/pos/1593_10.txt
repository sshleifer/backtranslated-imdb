Death in Venice is a movie I have to see once every ten years. It's always different because I'm always in another phase of life. <br /> <br /> The film is about art, beauty, longing, death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others are simply annoying to see, especially if you have had them before. But I will not miss a single frame. The music is repetitive, the main theme of the adage from Mahler's fifth is repeatedly used. But I will not miss a single note. When the last picture falls, the last tone dies, I'm stupid and exhausted. <br /> <br /> This film is a monument to film making. As with most great movies, Saturday night's volume must stay away from it. And it's simply the best movie ever.
