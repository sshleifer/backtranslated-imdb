Overall, this is entertaining and strange film. Don't try to make sense. There are more gaps in the story than a computer could keep up with, but Robert Cummings and a small figure cast are the most fun to see in this "fugitive" -like story. <br /> <br /> Unlike the popular TV show and then 1993 movie, this refugee is not looking for a slot machine but a two-armed Nazi saboteur called "Frank Fry." Cummings ("Barry Kane") is blamed when a defense plant blows up in Los Angeles and goes for lamb looking for the man who did it (Fry) to clear his name. <br /> <br /> The first 40 minutes or so are very exciting and interesting. Then Priscilla Lane ("Pat Martin") goes into the story and it begins to coincide with a sappy dialogue. Director Alfred Hitchcock often did this with his female characters, and I wondered if he had a clue about how woman spoke. Lane's character here was a little lame. In fact, the villains who played by Otto Kruger ("Charles Tobin") and Norman Lloyd ("Frank Fry") were the best, in my opinion .... just fascinating. Kruger's plays and dialogue were particularly good. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie but saw Hitchcock's well-known "North City Northwest", you'll chuckle at the end and really enjoy it. Instead of a climate game on Mount Rushmore, we have a memorable last 10 minutes here in the Freedom State. As usual, Hitchcock's camera angles are great and fun to watch.
