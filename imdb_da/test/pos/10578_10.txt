After reading the book before seeing this adaptation, you would think it would have lost some of its excitement. The story, however, is so smart that I could never tire of it. <br /> <br /> Sally and Elaine really put their hearts into their roles and brought so much out of the characters. I fell in love with the story and the women again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful to see thanks to directions, settings and costumes. Despite the television speed on the television, I do not feel that something important was lost in transit. It had me on the edge of my seat all the way through with lots of wonderful stomach-trembling moments. Enjoyed it thoroughly. This is the kind of TV I've been waiting for.
