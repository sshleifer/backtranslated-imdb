I saw this fine flick immediately leaving college. As I sat there happy to see Alice go from the oppressed virgin to the sexual adventurer, I had to wonder why her sexual encounters seemed to be known. Then I remembered - Intro Psych 101 Lectures! One of the lectures dealt with the psycho-sexual stages of development, basically shifting over time to which part of the body and its accompanying stimulations our greatest attention, as well as the changed emphasis on what gives us joy. Alice's first meeting is bathed with emphasis on the genitals and bottom. Her next meeting is an oral with Mad Hatter's dingaling. I forget the rest of the lecture and the order of Alice's meetings, but I remember how well they matched. It's interesting to see a skin girl with some brains behind it, rather than the cliche "I'm here to deliver your pizza. Let's screw." <br /> <br /> I can't see how Kristin DeBell's career could be ruined by this movie as it was her first movie. And Reagan's tired hypocrisy had not yet met this country when it was released, but somehow he and his stooge affect Meese's wife DeBell. When Meese was doing her anti-pornography commission (to distract people from her own criminal activity), Meese hired the services of an anti-porn activist named Judith Reisner. Reisner was obsessed with pictures she perceived as child pornography. She saw the Alice deck, Ms DeBell did for Playboy and immediately announced that she had scientifically proven that Mrs DeBell was actually a photo collage of parts of multiple adult women and the face of a 10-year-old. Yeah right....
