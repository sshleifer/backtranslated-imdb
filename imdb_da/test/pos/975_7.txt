Much better than expected. Good family girl - catch it at reruns. The whole is more than the sum of its parts. Paul Giamatti chews nature - he has far more talent than the role deserves. A treat to see the inspector Uhl from the "Illusionist" goes over the top. The blue man scenes had my 11 year old in masks. The comedians were especially fun for the parents - great to see Lee Majors and Urkel (umm, Jaleel) again. It will be difficult to think 10 lines for this movie, but let's hear it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and their parents! Amanda Bynes does a fine job when she is part of the stitch. I can't usually stand Frankie Muniz, but he's just fine here. Hats off to the casting director - if only to hire Giamatti!
