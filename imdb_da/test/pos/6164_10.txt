Absolutely one of the best flying movies of all time on so many levels. Hardware junkies will plunge over the largest single massage of fleeting Spitfires outside of a Battle of Britain reenactment. No less than eight flying tips are available for very precise soil and air sequences. Those who are amazed at the flight and get misty-eyed reciting High Flight identify with the key characters' reverence for the freedom to be fast, free and tall in their dark blue world. Be warned: romanticists and even dog lovers are treated to a very emotional tour of this movie. The core message is one shared by many warriors because their finest hours, their lifetime, when they felt most alive, were actually during the war, as everything else was sad and weeping. <br /> <br /> The plot is about Czech pilots fleeing their country when the Nazis invade and participate in the RAF-free Czech squadron. There are a few subplots that are all worth paying attention to. This is just an ordinary old excellent movie that even the most ardent anti-hardware romantic will love (keep Kleenex at hand). Beautiful photography, first-class acting, accurate details of the RAF life during the Battle of Britain. Easily a candidate for any aviation-interesting personal DVD collection.
