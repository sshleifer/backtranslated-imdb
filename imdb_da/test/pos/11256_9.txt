This movie was amazing. Never before have I seen such a film that led me to the hard reality of drug abuse, like this one. There is no glamorization, sugar coating or glittering heroine. This movie shows the true struggles, pains and losses people go through when dealing with this drug. Good movie, decent emotionally packed, and a great story. A big clock! <br /> <br />
