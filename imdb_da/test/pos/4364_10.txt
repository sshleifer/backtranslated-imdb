I consider this to be a breathtaking but deceptive film because it seems so simple and straightforward: a Vietnam survivor tells his horrible tale and part of the story is reintroduced on the spot. Critics sometimes even claim that Herzog's presence in the film is minimal, but how wrong they are. We know that all documentaries are "communicated" to some degree and this has Herzog's subtle hand over it, especially in the amazing music, the incredibly selected selection of archive films and cascading images management. The evocative force of this movie is amazing, starting with its title, the opening title card from the book "Revelation" and the original voice-over. This is a movie that you can see repeatedly with increasing entertainment, not a simple item that gulped down with its favorite drink on its way to the evening news. This is one of the movies that can resonate with you in life.
