This must be one of the funniest Danish films ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are fun when they drive over Sweden. I do not know how Ulrich Thomsen does, but somehow he can manage to play crazy in a very healthy way. BUT if you don't understand English (I don't refer to your pastry here) don't waste your time on this ?? I don't think it would work with subtitles.
