This is a great movie. Raw and sublime moving. It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually comes from watching people at a stage) playing on everyone's terror of a white onion rising to monstrous consequences. All the main players are fascinating. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end ... and everyone else judges with the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands that go up to faces among men and women. Julian Fellowes has won again. He is a national treasure. Gosford Park, Vanity Fair, Mary Poppins ... and now this. Can't he do something wrong? Go see it! This is a movie for real adults.
