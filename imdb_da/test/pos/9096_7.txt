Originally I was a Tenacious D fan of their first album and of course listened to some tracks from The P.O.D. and was pretty disappointed. After watching the movie, my view was changed. The movie is pretty funny from the beginning to the end, and I found myself involved in it even though it was really a stupid story, because of the views that KG and Jaybles portray in the movie. <br /> <br /> Much more entertaining and enjoyable than movies I've seen in the theaters lately. ex. Saw III (boring and drag), Casino Royale (the road to homo-erotic), as in previous installments I really enjoyed <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Borat, you'll enjoy the story of The Greatest Band on Earth
