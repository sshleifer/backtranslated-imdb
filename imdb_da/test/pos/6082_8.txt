One of the most charming and certainly the most powerful elements of Anthony Minghella's enthralling Best Picture winner "The English Patient" is that in the mid-90s when Hollywood was at the beginning of losing its nerve For major new projects, a film was created that brought back traces of very powerful traces of the sweeping, wonderful majesty that made films like "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) and "The Ten Commandments" ( 1956). "The English Patient" contains much of what made these movies so powerful. It has the glorious feeling, a stretched running time that almost doesn't let long and fascinating characters with past and stories. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient", based on a novel by the same name by Michael Ondaatje, is like "The Godfather: Part II" (1974) in the sense of how it is constructed. It's a mixture of two stories: past and present, and it's all about titular character: an English patient in the subsequent years of World War II. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient who has been arrested for life by a plane crash and is taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse who played wonderfully by Juliette Binoche. In addition to joining his raspy-cast, troubled patient, Binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives, and the two men seem to know each other. <br /> <br /> It's just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this movie. The other, who is told in feedback, is the patient's past before he was scarred and dies in a bed. The story of the present is mixed with the patient's past and his love affair, which tragically changed his life forever. To be blunt, "The English Patient" is a love story mixed with a sweeping epic sensation, and it blends wonderfully. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was, how passionate, how obsessive, how enchanting it was shown on the screen. Usually in love stories, such as Minghella's later "Cold Mountain" (2003), the romantic elements seem far more pleasing than obsessive to me. Some of the love scenes have elements that may be more associated with lust than love, but because they are so well developed and not hasty and not exploited out of proportion, we can believe that there is a sure, true love between those signs. It reminded me a lot about "Vertigo" (1958), how well the filmmakers and artists convinced us that these were two real people who really fell in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Performances around were great. I was especially excited about the performance of Juliette Binoche, who took home Oscar for her performance the following year. I also liked Willem Dafoe to play the kind of cynical, dubious character that he is always boring to play. And of course I can't leave Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate lovers. <br /> <br /> Despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I were to describe it as a perfect movie. There are two mistakes that I cannot look over. Number one, it is a little too long, and the reason for this is my second complaint, there are a few unnecessary subplots. I was not enchanted or particularly interested in the second love story between Binoche and a bombing specialist that Naveen Andrews played. My research has led me to assume that this plural element comes from the original book, and I'm sure it worked perfectly in there, but in the movie it just seems a little distracting and the relationship between the two characters doesn't fascinate me. I was much more interested in Fienne's character and his relationship with his two leading actresses. <br /> <br /> However, these two flaws are easily forgivable, even though they slowly slow things down. The devoted "The English Patient" is an extraordinary achievement of filmmaking. For me it was like a crazy mix between "Casablanca" (1942) and "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), two remarkable and better films, and this effective blend turned out to be worth my time. It is a real shame that Anthony Minghella has left us. For he was a truly gifted filmmaker. These are all the proofs that someone needs.
