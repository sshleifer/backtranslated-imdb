Chris Smith's American film is an in-depth study of the American dream. The film focuses on Mark Borchardt, an independent filmmaker from Wisconsin. Mark has dreamed of becoming a great writer and director since he was a teenager and had an unfocused hi8 camera. The film follows Mark through his attempt to make his dream game, Northwestern. There are a number of hilarious scenes in the movie, which Mark goes through the pre-production of Northwestern and later his short film Coven (pronounced included, the correct pronunciation, Mark says "sounds too much like oven"), which he plans to use to travel money to complete the Northwestern. The film's insight and humor are on an equal footing with Roger and Me, Michael Moore's great film. I first saw it at a chaotic Sundance Film Festival screening that brought out the spirit of the movie - a huge air duct fell from the ceiling at the start of the movie, hit seven people and caused a delay of 25 minutes. halfway through the movie the sound began to flatten and the projector had to be stopped to correct it, and for the last 20 minutes the projector stopped and the movie burned up. Despite the delays, the audience remained through the movie and gave it a standing ovation. American Movie also won the Grand Jury documentary film award at the end of the festival. I highly recommend this fine movie, worth sitting through any hellish screening.
