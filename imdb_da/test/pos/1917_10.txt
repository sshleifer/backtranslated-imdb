I watched this movie on TV and loved it! I'm a real disaster movie fan and this one was great. The molding was made by some really interesting people. Connie Selleca is always great. And William Devane is in his own league. He can play both comedy and thriller in the same movie as few others can. The story is also fantastic. The idea of ​​being able to follow a timeline of what will happen and using this timeline to prevent a global disaster is an interesting idea. And this film brings it out in such a way that it is almost entirely credible.
