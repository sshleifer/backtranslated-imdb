Of all 48 films by Brigitte Bardot, "Une Parisienne" is widely regarded as (one of) her best. What we see is special: for when the plot has its own value, it does much more than just a cheap vehicle for BB's sex-loaded appearance. <br /> <br /> This movie is your true and well-worked out light comedy, with a good and coherent story. Set in france circles in the late 1950s, it entertains from the beginning to the end. Provides many entertaining twists and turns - everything was based on at least three major roles, including Bardot. <br /> <br /> "Une Parisienne" (= French to "Woman in Paris") focuses on telling a story, not showing Brigitte Bardot. Brigitte serves the plot very well by using her talent to perform in bright comedies. <br /> <br /> When you sit on your sofa on a Friday night, tired and tired of a week's slavery, just turn on "Une Parisienne". This movie will make you feel better.
