I just saw "returning from lonely pigeon" and it was very good! I've seen many negative comments about it, and I don't think viewers are real about it! In the TV / film industry, it is difficult to get all the actors back to a 2nd successor or 3rd part. We are happy to have another MINISERIES that settles in D. D. CONFIDENTIAL !! This production was top notch with the original music score, and the actors put their hearts into it (you can tell). If you want to see lonely with Robert Duvall and tommy L. J. then look at the original. Back to L.D. had not so much humor and took on a more serious tone, but is absolutely captivating anyway. From the moving moments to the bad guys this is a winner! "Wonderful!!!"
