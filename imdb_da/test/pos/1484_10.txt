This is one of my favorite T.V shows of all time, Rowan Atkinson is simply a genius! And it is only fitting that I chose this to be my 1000 review! I can't start telling you how much I love Mr. Bean, he's the man, and what amazes me is how he gets out of those incredibly difficult situations and he's always so creative, plus Robyn Driscoll also deserves recognition! He's also a genius! My favorite piece that he has made is Mr. Bean's amazing adventure, and while the rest of them are amazing, it remains my true favorite, plus I want the show not stopped so soon! Each episode is brilliantly written, and they were all masterfully directed, plus every episode is a classic in my eyes! This show is incredibly popular, and I can certainly see why, as it may be the funniest show ever. The character actors played all the roles really well, especially Robyn Driscoll and Matilda Ziegler (like Irma). This is one of my favorite TV shows all the time Rowan Atkinso is simply a genius and an incredibly talented comedian (possibly the best!), And it's only fitting that I chose this to be my 1000 review f you haven't seen this show, drop what you do right now and go check it out, you will not regret it trust me, it is one of the best tv shows ever !, and i will continue to watch the show again and again, i never needs it! Mr. Bean Rules!. ***** out of 5
