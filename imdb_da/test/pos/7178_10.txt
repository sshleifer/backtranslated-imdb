A movie with high intelligence and activity. Besides being a strong capsule of time and persona who were the 60s, the film is also a surprise in its futuristic themes and the unique presentation of the power system in a group. William Greaves points to the authoritative role of the group. He asks his crew members to film and film and continue filming. First, the two actors, then the crew filmed the actors, saw the whole set including supporters, police officers and finally a homeless man who lived in bushes in Central Park for 9 weeks. <br /> <br /> Greaves edits the movie (thousands of feet) together and surprisingly makes a strong story with an interesting bow and motivation. Don't expect to be bored of this movie. Each of the crew makes it possible to engage conversationalists and often speak the thoughts that the observer has seen on this movie. Greaves make it great to integrate multiple cameras using synchronized three-in-one images and other attention-shifting methods. In the end, the film will really only be effective if that is what you are looking for: If you are looking for some abstract artistic films that feed your own self-forgiving ego while you never have something, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a movie that will eventually speak and think about the desire for honesty and sincerity in documented "reality" and the inevitable transparency that comes from it, then it's the perfect movie.
