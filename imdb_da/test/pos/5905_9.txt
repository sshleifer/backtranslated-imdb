Don't be fooled by the nostalgic aura that surrounds "Mon oncle Antoine" because, as the best of Canadian films, the darkness just falls beneath the surface. <br /> <br /> Explains in the 1940s rural Quebec that history explores young Benoit's developmental consciousness as he learns to deal with both sexuality and death. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the movie is amazing, especially as much of the criticism of the Canadian cinema by the public surrounds aesthetics. In addition, the unpleasant Benoit is a seductive protagonist of the audience and looks at his devastating society with fresh innocent eyes. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading Jim Leach's critical essay about the film in Canada's best features for anyone seeking to place the movie in a historical context, while also dissecting the movie's form. Definitely check this one out.
