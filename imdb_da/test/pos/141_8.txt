I hate vampire movies. That being said, this was very interesting to me. I would like to point out one thing tho. "Bakjwi" literally means bats in Korean, and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, you can see that Dracula or vampires become a bat and fly away or wuheva. We also know that bats are mammals that can fly, so many categorize them to be "unusual". When I watched the movie, I realized that the theme of the bat is deeply embedded in this movie more than just to get the bat-vampire connection. <br /> <br /> Duality of human nature = If you ever read aesop's fables, this is the one fable where mammals and birds fight and a bat just can't seem to take a side and it is trying to play both sides to their advantage. Mammals and birds find out what this bat has done and ban the bats from their lands at the end of history. The two opposing sides of human nature are constantly in battle throughout the film ex. song-hyun's blind pastor, song-hyun's efforts to quench thirst and his sexual desire, tae-ju play both sides, his ordinary boring life vs. her excitement looking for vampire adventures etc. (will not spoil too much, you should watch the movie) and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance, sex, violence, religion, dark comedy, tragedy, revenge, you called it ! <br /> <br /> I feel like many would find this movie boring and too long, but this movie is very fresh and new, something I haven't seen b4 yet. I don't want to say that this is CW Park's best work, but it's bog. def. the strangest thing to understand even dark exciting!
