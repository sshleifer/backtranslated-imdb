Just before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it being far less of a horrible horror adventure than I expected. Instead, director Jeff Lieberman tells a wonderful atmospheric and unpleasant atmosphere for great stretches of the film that constantly builds the excitement until I was completely unsure of what would happen, but long as a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave it a lot of deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's good mood, and when the action really starts, it's really shocking and dramatic without ever really having to be gory. The characters are about couples for this kind of movie, but more sympathetic than some, and the bad guy is oddly freaky. Photography and excitement are the real winners in this movie, and they keep it from being jaded (as it has been suggested). I highly recommend this to serious horror fans. Don't expect to do, expect an eerie backwoods tale with more amazing moments and a fantastic dream-like atmosphere.
