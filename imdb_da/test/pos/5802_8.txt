I must admit that when Madonna first saw Holiday on Top of the Pops many years ago, I told my wife "another American hit excuse to get it all wrong!" Now she was wearing a scarecrow and was terribly dressed. I have never grown to love her as my daughter does, but I will eat my words. I like some of her stuff and sometimes enjoy her filmed concerts. This Confessions tour movie is great even if the music is not (and it is not). I was impressed with the scene and the concepts. Madonna's own performance was enhanced by the incredible dancers she chose to support her. My daughter was in London gigs and was crazy about it. The lady (Madge) has shown my first rating of her so much wrong !!
