This film is probably well-built, beginning and ending in the dark, focusing on Lili Smith / Schmidt, Julie Andrews, initially the song 'Angel' later on the infamous spy. <br /> <br /> It's beautiful! I watched the movie about 15 years ago and saw it again recently. While it was rejected by critics in the 70s as overblown, 'cinema vulgaris' and lack of structure (among others), time has proved wrong. Blake Edwards has certainly produced a film that is almost lyrical quality. <br /> <br /> The movie floats and swirls (aerial photography, Julie Andrews in motion) and prisoners. You just have to buy in on the assumption that Julie Andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong. Overlooking the warm chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson, one has to believe that these are lovers - who in all innocence fall apart. And finally, love is far more important than winning wars. And then maintain innocence. There is very discreet appearance, and the film certainly reaches emotional depths that are often not seen in comedies. There are wonderful comic elements (foreshadowing the French goons in Victor / Victoria), interesting diplomatic asides (reminding me of Tamarind Seed, seen 18 years ago) and a general sense of goodwill. Suspension all disbelief and this movie will carry you away. Julie Andrews' belt out of war song and the haunting 'Whistling Away the Dark' is reason enough to turn on the TV just for the soundtrack. And the striptease number, like the 'Jenny' number in Star! work. <br /> <br /> Like a good champagne, this movie has a good age. Paramount should bring it to DVD as soon as possible. The same goes for transferring the laser disk to Star! to dvd. These are both interesting pieces by Julie Andrews' meticulous and so undervalued works.
