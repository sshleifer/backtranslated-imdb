I must admit I liked this movie and did not find it completely misogynist. It could be subtitled, three ways to look at LiV Tyler. Three different men are occupied by the same woman and tell their stories to very different characters. A man (John Goodman) tells his story to a priest (the very funny Richard Jenkins). For Goodman's charcter, Liv Tyler is an idealized saint, the other comes from his holy wife, Theresa. subject of (kinky) sexual fantasy Finally, Matt Dillons fair charcter tells HIS side of the story a sleazy hit man, played by Micheal Douglas.All three of these obsessive stories are told simultaneously and everyone is entertaining. bizarre fun climax I don't want to give away.
