In New York, a group of freshmen participates in High School for Performing Arts after being successful in their audition. For four years, their dreams, deceptions, success, love and personal drama are revealed, although the insecure Doris Finsecker (Maureen Teefy), the gay Montgomery (Payl McCrane), the aggressive Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray), the hopeful Coco (Irene Cara ), the ambitious Ralph Garci (Barry Miller) and their friends until their graduation day. 28 years ago, "Fame" was a great success with the story of teens looking for a place in Show business, and I loved this movie and the audio track on CD. I just watched "Fame" on DVD, and at the moment I would say that it is only a good movie with great potential, but with too many flawed subplots. The story follows too many characters and leaves many situations unanswered. I don't know if Alan Parker had trouble reducing the movie's time, but what happened to ballerina, for example, going to an abortion clinic? What happened to Leroy and his teacher, did he fail because of his grammar problem? What happened to Coco after dressing her blouse in this quake's apartment? The musician, who plays synthesizer and his proud father, is left in the subplot. Anyway, "Fame" is still a nice entertainment and a cult movie for me. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fama" ("Fame")
