As I recall, my family made a point of staying at home at night "Nichols" was on (Mondays? Tuesdays? NBC?). It was a great vehicle for James Garner, very well written, great ensemble cast. His character is very much like "Support Your Local ..." movies: Retired gamblers with mysterious past get into the city and have adventures every week. In fact, it seemed quite obvious that it was the same character. It was just a charm of a TV show. A sleeper, like "My world and welcome to it", which may have been its contemporaries - I forget. I wish these shows would be made available on DVD. It was just good tv. Maybe "Briscoe County Jr." Come close but only a kilometer.
