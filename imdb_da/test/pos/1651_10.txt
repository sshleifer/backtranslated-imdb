Rififi, directed by Jules Dassin, is in line with the Melville crime scenes (especially Bob le Flameur and to a point Le Cercle Rouge) to be completely focused on history and character and make sure there is no word that No need and was ahead of time. Ionic still has some kind of professionalism among its characters, a kind of respect (if not for itself than for others, a kind of duty) calling well in post-WW2 France. Its actors carry faces for those characters who say 'we know what these guys are all about' and from there, the story goes off. Maybe it's because I have a weak spot for heist images, especially where we only see nuts and bolts (error, actually physical side) of how a hoist is pulled off. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with how the actual heist is filmed in today's movies is that it's all very fast (ie Snatch), or done in ways we've seen too many times before. Dassin, like Melville years later, decided to create virtually a silent movie of a hoist, accompanying sound effects. The excitement built up in this scene must not overlook what Melville had in 'Rouge', but at its own level it achieves its own grandeur and speed and equally decisive originality to what has been done before. There are some maintained close-ups, for example, as security is cracked, marking some of the best I've seen from France at that time. An added plus for the movie, apart from the caterpillar-scene new wave touch to the movie, which eventually makes it a little more modern, is that the story seems so good and different. It gets completely about character at points, and then keeps the excitement up. The last ten to fifteen minutes, the lower right is miraculous; as with another classic lift image Asphalt Jungle, it is not even the last stop that matters, but all about how much you want to pass the call of duty and put humanism over greed. You almost wonder about the camera's exhilaration that flies by the trees at high speed with the car that he might just do. Dassin has here a very entertaining and intuitive film of his genre with a beautiful little song too.
