Being a "Wallace and Gromit fan", I looked forward to this full-length movie. Surprisingly, I saw it at world premiere in Vlissingen (NL), at the Film by the Sea festival. A wonderful feeling to be one of the first to watch this very funny and happy movie. It's about Wallace and Gromit (which I don't think needs an introduction) to have their own pest control company in the city that hosts a giant vegetable competition in a few days. Everyone, including an eccentric baroness, hopes that his or her giant carrot or melon will win the golden carrot. Unfortunately, the city is plagued by lots of hungry rabbits. This is where W & G comes in. They have their own cracking contraptions to control these sweet creatures in a human way. It is a very fun and colorful story. Anyone who liked the three short films from W&G (which is more than amazing!) Will love this full-length movie. Nick Park really delivered a wonderful and original result with a good sense of humor. Like in the Kyllinges√∏e, I really wonder how he can capture so much history and emotions in a few frames. "Well done job, let" ;-) Oh yes: The music was amazing! It really completes the trip. Enjoy!
