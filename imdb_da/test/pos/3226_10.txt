This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines like the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the witty dialogue, that's what makes it unique with the show. Kelly Bishop is evil, great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman are wonderful as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a delight as Luke Danes, and the band members are kind of to see. Community, Miss Patty, Babette, Mrs. Kim, Taylor Doose, Kirk and others are always laughing loudly fun, quirky and interesting, always making the cunning one-liners stand out. This show has changed so much over the years that it never gets old. Gilmore Girls is an original and smart show that keeps you looking. It's so good it is. I give this show a 10/10 rating.
