Dutiful wife Norma Shearer (who Katherine "Kitty" Brown) is waiting for man Rod La Rocque (like Bob Brown) hand and foot. While making breakfast in bed and helping him dress for a Sunday golf excursion, Mrs Shearer suggests joining Mr. Leave the Rocque for the day and note how rarely the two see each other. But La Rocque puts her out and says her presence adversely affects his game. Then Shearer unexpectedly meets the real cause of her husband's frequent absence ?? his beautiful blonde mistress! <br /> <br /> Three years later, Shearer is a glamorous and flirtatious divorce. During the summer in Paris she has made a friendship with wealthy, older social Marie Dressler (like Mrs Boucci Bouccicault). Ms Dressler invites Shearer to her Long Island home to meet with some friends and ask for a favor. Dressler is worried about her grandson's relationship with a suave, worldly man. She wants young Sally Eilers (like Dionne) to marry Raymond Hackett (like Bruce) instead. Knowing Shearer's flirtatious conquests, Dressler asks her to lure the unwanted man away from Mrs Eilers. Shearer is stunned to discover that the man is La Rocque, her former husband. Shearer and Dressler make this a sweet and entertaining game. They are in top form, providing guaranteed-to-be-popular performances, with enthusiasm and professionalism. The story is stupid and predictable; however, in a way that helps the humorous situation. And the end is pretty smart. In fact, the comic book "Let's Be Gay" might have become better than Shearer's larger produced and more serious "The Divorc√©e", which was released around the same time. Cast uniformly fine. La Rocque is better than his movie with Lilian Gish; but his role is not endearing at all. Gilbert Emery (like Towney) and Tyrell Davis (like Wallace) are fun beneficiaries. <br /> <br /> Those who are not familiar with Norma Shearer cannot realize that she is the lazy woman in the opening scene. This is Shearer as "Kitty" before her make-over. See the close-ups of Shearer with light, natural makeup, for a good look at an exciting beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> ******* Let's be Gay (1930) Robert Z.
