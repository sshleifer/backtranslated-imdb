I just wanted to say that when I was young, my favorite tv was show back today night heat. I loved the characters and the plot of the show. I thought it was an excellent show and still does this day. I enjoy watching reruns and I am a big fan. I love the way the characters played each other. I would always stay up late to see my favorite program with my mother who was also a big fan. Now I can enjoy watching my show again and listening to the theme song. As I thought was a sweet song to the show. My favorite characters were Scott Hylands and Jeff Wincott. I enjoyed watching these beautiful guys take down the bad boys.
