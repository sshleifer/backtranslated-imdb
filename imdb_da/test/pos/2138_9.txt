At the time of its opening, "the gate of heaven" was harmed by a more cultural phenomenon than a movie. At a time when concern about big budgets and directional arrogance grew, it was a convenient target as it was a general budget work of the latest "author" to hit Hollywood who had not yet established the track record giving him the benefits of the doubt among critics and industry. As someone pointed out at that time, no one would jump on Warren Beatty's even more expensive and dark "Reds" because Beatty was "one of us" while Michael Cimino had not achieved that status. <br /> But "the gate of heaven" was also influenced by a cultural change that took place at the time of the political movement to the right and to a more undisputed patriotism and one-element of the myth of the West (and the Western) . A few years earlier, Ciminos demythologizing the border could have been timely, fresh and a necessary corrective. But in 1980, in the Reagan Revolution cluster, it was thought to be almost un-American. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the movie, from the vantage point of view several decades away, is a fascinating and thought-provoking look at the special time and place as a world where life was, in Hobbe's words, "unpleasant , brutally and briefly ". Kristofferson plays James Averill, an Eastern European Eastern European, who becomes a sheriff in Wyoming at the fair's exploration, where he finds himself having to resist the settlers and plunder against an assault by a mercenary war employed by wealthy landowners, including Averill's lifelong friend. In a more innocent time, Averill and his rag-tag "army" of poor farmers would come to victory but this is anything but a traditional western one and when the American cavalry enters the battle here, it is not on the side of the "good guys." <br /> <br /> Much like "Deer Hunter", Cimino's Former Movie, "Heaven's Gate" spends a great deal of time building the details of his principal's life, giving the movie a sometimes relaxed pace that nonetheless leads to a poignant conclusion. With excellent plays, a fine musical score and the visual texture that makes one believe, one actually sees "Old West" through new eyes, "Heaven's Gate" is a movie that rewards repeated views. I just want MGM to exhibit a new DVD with an improved transfer and a comment from Cimino. Nevertheless, the current version is satisfactory enough to let viewers see which critics in 1980, possibly blind by the film's cultural subtitles, managed to miss ... that "Heaven's Gate" is a good movie.
