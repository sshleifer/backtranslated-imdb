Michael Sheen shines like the afternoon sun in this brilliant depiction of a comic genius. If you are familiar with Kenneth Williams' manuscripts and diaries, this drama captures their essence perfectly. When I read about Kenneth hoovering in his swimming tanks, I laughed, and then it was brought to life on the screen, but this time I did not laugh as it was put into perspective as a repressed and tortured man. It must have been such a solitary existence that is in Kenneth's skin that requires attention, but stifles it when it really matters! The last 20 minutes are heartbreaking as you see Kenneth gradually sink to the depth of despair and consider suicide as the only alternative. I have seen it a dozen times and still cry uncontrollably at the point where he offers good night to the LOUIE. I cannot recommend this drama enough. Sexually explicit, but it runs home that Kenneth could not let anyone invade his world, and this is where the man's sadness lies. For a genius that brought happiness to so many, it is such a shame that his private life was filled with such despair and sadness. Pauly.
