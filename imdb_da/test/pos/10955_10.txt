Improvisation was used for a pioneering degree in this movie, but it only works as a novelty. No greater truth about the situation is asking the actors to improvise. The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the players now have twice as much to worry about: not only if they deliver the line well, but whether the line itself is good. Therefore, the performance in many Robert Altman films is often very hestitant - because the actors are not entirely sure to say lines that they have made and therefore are not safe are something good. <br /> <br /> And, frankly, it's often not very good. Often, the dialogue does not really follow one line to another, or fits the environment. <br /> <br /> An unpredictable youthful energy is creaking - but frankly, I found it difficult to follow and concentrate on that bad. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, a fascinating raw piece of film and commendable 100% to take the power over the green light into the street. There are some generally good things in it. This joke, for example: <br /> <br /> I'm a dancer. What kind of dancer, like a ballet dancer? Oh no ... exotic. <br /> <br /> And the whole party scene is in, the next trip to the park and the scene where the boys look at statues. <br /> <br /> 2 / 5. I won't say they are worth 2 hours of your time, though.
