Lovingly designed and terribly interesting to see Garfield's gritty, breakthrough performance (introducing a new form of rebellious acting style that would transfer to Brandos and Clifts and so on after the war) but all the sisterly love is a little choking. Priscilla Lane is a brilliant, engaging performer, but the other sisters do not register properly (though they all must be tart and twig), and I just had a hard time buying some of the other male characters beyond Garfield. Jeffrey Lynn is a pleasant enough actor, but he lacks the weight of the movie star to match Garfield's good luck with Mickey Borden, and it throws the movie off a bit. (Imagine a Jimmy Stewart or someone in the section.) Nor was I convinced that Garfield would make the decisive (to the smallest) final decision he made. The film needed another half hour of running time to better explain the action; It feels terribly premature and under-motivated. However, it is not difficult to understand how anyone who grew up with this image would remember it wildly. It has to be classic, but it contains some classic moments. The two port swinging scenes are pure movie magic.
