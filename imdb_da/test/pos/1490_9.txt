Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless Mr. Bean, which never goes far without its Teddy Bear. Appeal from Bean is basically his childish behavior and innocence. We don't know if he came from heaven or another planet. He is the kind of strange character that you cannot easily handle. He is often alone and used to it. He has difficulty communicating through speech, which may be why we only hear his grunts at times. There are other signs that speak to him and he responds. The character of Mr. Bean is a mystery and is still. He lives alone and makes it unthinkable when he can make sense. Mr. Bean is quite a strange man who has nothing against it. Rather, he lives a simple life with his yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to come to work in time.
