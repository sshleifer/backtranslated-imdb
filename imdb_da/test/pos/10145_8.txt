This is another enjoyable and entertaining Hitchcock movie. James Stewart and Doris Day are incredible in this movie. Bernard Herrmann appears as himself near climax. The scenery and location are great, except for one scene early where the background was obviously false, which makes no sense to me since scenes before and after were in the same setting and they were real location shots. I've heard that Hitchcock did it on purpose at times. <br /> <br /> The reviews for this movie seem to be mixed. I think it's a better than average Hitchcock movie. Very entertaining and it has a really bright comic scene at the end. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 8 out of 10. <br /> <br />
