"The Man Who Were Too Much" (1955) is Alfred Hitchcock's own remake of his 1934 thriller about a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) on vacation in Morocco, where they were caught in a nightmare involving murder, espionage, murder and the worst of all, kidnapping their 10-year-old son. The movie, which Hitchcock himself is considered to be better than the original, is a lot of fun. Stewart and Day have a good chemistry together. The film is filled with the wonderful comic scenes and dialogues as well as scenes of chilling excitement. <br /> <br /> The inclusion of "Que Sera, Sera" proved to be a brilliant blow, because rarely the song fits the content and plays such an important role in the movie as "Que Sera, Sera" in "The Man who knew too much ". <br /> <br /> Hitchcock also treats us to live music from Arthur Benjamin's "Storm Cloud Cantata" for nearly ten minutes, while the scene in London's Royal Albert Hall, where the murder of a very important politician was attempted, takes place, and Both, the stage and the cantata are simply wonderful.
