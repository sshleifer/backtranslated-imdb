It's been a few years since I've seen this movie, so forget most details. But I loved it at the time and found the plot intense grip, the climax heart stops. I remember being literally on the edge of my theater seat in 1979. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda plays a Los Angeles reporter, Kimberley, who stumbles across an accident at a local nuclear power plant. She wants to go public with the story, backed by her hippie cameraman (Michael Douglas), who has photographed the event, but a creepy conspiracy tries to cover it all. Jack Lemmon is absolutely wonderful in the role of the nuclear power plant's conflicting middle management, betraying loyalty to his company and "doing the right thing" by reporting the dangerous situation. His facial expressions speak volumes here. <br /> <br /> Apart from the enchanting plot and tearing excitement, this film is about Jack Lemmon, his character and his amazing acting. As for Jane Fonda (I was a big fan of her at that time), I suppose she just moved from her anti-war protests to the nuclear industry. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a nuclear scary tactic. Chernobyl and Three Mile Island regardless (they are different types of reactors), our Canadian CANDU reactor is safe and respected worldwide. I would not hesitate to stay close to the nuclear power plant about an hour's drive away, where my friend works as a very competent engineer. Apparently they shut down every teeny problem, regardless of the financial loss. On the contrary, I doubt that there are conspiracies there. One can hardly imagine any of the leaders or highly trained operators who are willing to risk any kind of crash or whatever ... it is absolutely emptyfoolery. Of course, it is moral here not to save any expense or effort, either by building the plant or securing the ongoing security. <br /> <br /> If we want our western lifestyle, we need to get our energy somewhere. For those who claim nuclear energy, never can be made absolutely safe (true, of course), perhaps they should volunteer as coal miners or else return to pre-electric horses and buggy days. <br /> <br /> In every way, you can enjoy this entertaining and extremely exciting movie that is apparently based (loosely? decorated?) on a true story. It's a real chiller, a thriller, and maybe (?) Even a killer, but please get your views on the operation and safety of nuclear power plants from it.
