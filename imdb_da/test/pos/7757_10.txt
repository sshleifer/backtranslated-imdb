A 2006 online survey of Japan's 100 most popular animated television series of all time, performed by TV Asahi, put this series in fourth place. It tells you everything you need to know. So go see it .;) I don't want to comment on the story simply because I don't want to ruin anything. I only encourage you to watch after you have seen the first episode. The animation is really good and above the TV average. The best thing about this series is that there is finally something new. I mean it's not groundbreaking, but it still gives a fresh new idea and similar sign. You will not regret entering the world of Suzumiya Haruhi. <br /> <br /> And the best thing a movie is coming soon
