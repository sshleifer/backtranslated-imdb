Black Snake Moan is rebellious. It is exuberantly rich, wonderfully orchestrated, strange and cumbersome, unique and visionary. Following on from Hustle & Flow, Brewer paints his portrait of the American South almost as a mythological country one would expect to see in a fantasy or ancient Greece epic. And yet so far high above us his film is hovering, they are still rooted; anchored in the deepest, darkest earth that is. As in traditional adventures, Brewer paints his portrait in Black Snake Moan using extremes and exaggerations. Sharp and strong characteristics when combined with such extreme actions as chaining a half-naked white girl to a radiator in an attempt to redeem her for her sins, exaggerate and emphasize the metaphor in the same way as extreme visual techniques such as some characters who have color in Pleasantville enhanced the metaphor of this adventure movie. But Brewer does not start his movie "once". In this film and also in Hustle & Flow, Brewer presents us with another adventure; a dark, gothic fable of sex, prostitution and ultimately redemption. These themes run through the blood vessels of the film as blood and resonate and bloom in its dark, burning environment. <br /> <br /> However, despite these harsh extremes, Brewer treats his characters as human beings and creates extremely well-executed, dimensional characterizations in Lazarus and Rae, particularly emphasized by their relationship with Lazerus' friend at the pharmacy, Angela and Rae's mother. . The action is all perfect. You get the feeling that both Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson were born to play these roles. Their characterizations are so intense and so serious; It is even more a challenge for actors to keep their heads on and create realistic characters. And they succeed admirably. Samuel L. Jackson disappears entirely in his character, which serves as a polar contradiction to most of the character he played before. With films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Shaft and others, he has made a typecast of "ultimate bath-ass". In Black Snake, Moan Jackson plays an old, broken, defeated and earthly character that is quite different from what he has done before. And honestly, it's just amazing. However, it is a surprise that Justin Timberlake is cast, and more specifically the fact that he is crossing as completely tolerable. Sure he doesn't have much screen time, but like Brewer did with Ludicrous in Hustle & Flow, he actually gets Timberlake to act and do what he has to do and doesn't come across as quite convincing and annoying. <Br /> <br /> But what really is so good about the movie is the atmosphere that Brewer creates. The rural southern sites work to their advantage by creating a dark, dirty, ugly, crusty, robust kind of texture for the entire movie, more than just in the film's thematic and metaphorical aspects. And by utilizing all sorts of elements like the rising sound of cicadas when Rae gets her itch, or a violent thunderstorm that increases and intensifies as Lazarus plays his blues number for "Black Snake Moan" for Rae, Brewer really manages to create almost a fantasy world, an undermined mythology to rural southern surroundings. And it seems so amazing to handle Brewer's unique vision. <br /> <br /> And you can't talk about a Craig Brewer movie without mentioning the music. In Hustle & Flow he used a soundtrack of down-and-dirty, street-wise hip-hop music to emphasize the atmosphere and vision. In this film, the music works even better on polishing and fully represents the unique atmosphere. It's a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the most beautiful, rawest, grittiest blues you've ever heard. And it just sounds amazing. <br /> All in all, one could say that this movie had been a simple tale of an old, broken, lonely, godly black blues singer who redeemed a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffering from nymphomania, there may not have been much to write home about. But this movie is not about the plot, and not even about the characters, as well as they are designed in the film regardless. No, this movie is about the vision ?? And what a unique vision it is! It's about the atmosphere, the mythology, the setting. It's about anger, fear, redemption and most importantly, blues. And it's all wrapped up in a unique, entertaining, stylized and impeccable bond. Brewer has secured a spot on the most promising upcoming instructor list, and with such a solid follow-up on a large debut film, Hustle & Flow, he will definitely be on my radar for future projects. <Br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that the film has one of the most amazing and unique titles I've heard yet.
