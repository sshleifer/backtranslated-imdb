This, which was shown in Italian at a cinema in Rome (not as bad as it sounds) after being presented at the Rome Film Festival, is very much an art film and a festival film that guarantees to charm and delight such audience for its distinctive style , droll humor; Ability to draw comedy from the suffering of others, appealing, delicious music; spot-on performances; overall sweetness and humanity - but condemned, because of its weird and lack of convincing line of history, letting average audiences wonder what they see it and why anyone admires it even how it was done. <br /> <br /> Andersson gives us almost a series of dry sketches. Running through them are different themes. Money: A guy at the next table (Waldemar Nowak) nicks the wallet of a rich drill talking on a mobile phone in a restaurant over a glass of brandy, then goes and orders a series of posh suits made to order; A deadly son calls his famous father away from an assembled assembly to ask him another loan. A shrink cares high about his exhausted investments, while his wife crushes him in bed and only wears a shiny Viking helmet. Depression: A basic teacher (Jessica Nilsson) breaks down in the class because her husband has called her a "harpy;" The spouse's spouse (Pär Fredriksson) collapses for clients because he called her it. Several men have depressing dreams. But hey - it's Sweden. Isn't everyone depressed? Love Problems: A fat bohemian couple breaks up forever; a girl groupie has fantasies about a lead guitarist, Micke (Eric Bäckman). Wives sludge doors when their husbands start practicing their instruments. (Music is also of course a unifying theme. In addition to the dashing guitarist, there is a tuba and a drummer who is in a Dixierland band and also plays in marches and funerals. Each scene has an extra lilt from the music, which niftily links one Sequence with another.) A violent storm outside the window of many scenes, fierce rain, people in it, the thunder so loud it sounds like a battle that rages across the country. This also unites the tone and gives the impression that different scenes occur on the same scary stormy day. Andersson is a master of visual composition and the static middle-distance image and the film has a foggy gray-green look made by DP Gustav Danielsson, who is perfect because it evokes the gloom of the Swedish winter, but also twinkles with the subtle colors in the director's white, which Ends each scene with a smile. An almost never known drabness could be so beautiful. (Or perhaps one did: Alexcanr Sokurov sometimes creates such effects in very different contexts.) Within scenes and in the film as a whole, there is a kind of silence that comes out of the visual style, the pacing of the scenes and the detached humanism of the superior perspective. There is something about a fully mastered style that soothes, calms down. <br /> <br /> Not everything works just as well. One can feel impatient with the succession of barely related scenes that already read too much as the work of a Saturday Night Live writer who needs Prozac. As some scenes certainly move you or draw a laugh, it is obvious that others fall a little flat. <br /> <br /> But some scenes are true singers, and of course a triumphant climax of pure magic is a dream - described and so visualized dreams are another important thread) where the girl group imagines in a newlywed wedding dress with its cool guitarist ideal, playing a delicate array of riffs, while a multitude of admirers gather outside a large window. The view switches to the exterior and the window slowly slides away as if the building that the newlyweds dream of was a train moving out of a station to take them for their honeymoon. It is a fresh, subtle and rather sublime effect. Possibly you can feel everything in Du Living (Du Levande) is a dream, including the recurring scene, where the barman always hits a bronze bell and announces the last order time, after which all the torpid customers rise from their tables and go up to get another drink . <br /> <br /> An Italian reviewer called this "a small, big movie" and that's right. It limits itself in a dozen ways, but there is greatness in it. Roy Andersson is a small master (as a medieval miniaturist) of the inner comedies of Scandanavian's gloom, and this is a film that is no different. Exhibited this year as an "Un Certain Regard" selection from Cannes, this is also the Swedish post for 2007 best foreign Oscar. Hard to say what Bergman would think, but Andersson worked with him; is famous for its widely produced TV commercials, some of which can be viewed on YouTube. Bergman called them "the best advertising in the world." It will be interesting to see if this director, whose craftsmanship is as subtle as his point of view, will begin to work for longer segments for some time. In the meantime, every good film cuff really needs to look at this. <br /> <br /> "Schadenfreude" is not quite the right word. It means joy in the misery of others. Andersson teaches us to rejoice in all our misery.
