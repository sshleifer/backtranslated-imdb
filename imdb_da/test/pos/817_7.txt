I watched this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. He prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how fun it was and in connection with his explanation it was HILARIEUS. I can see how it would be detrimental to some audiences, and the subject is not fun at all, but there are at least three lines in the movie that made me laugh so hard I thought I would pee. They do not come until after halfway, but when they do, oh God ... you want to die. Oh and Jim Brown is brilliant. He is not in much of the movie, but when he is there, you know whose movie it is. Of course, the best line in the movie (and the funniest one) is his; You know it when you hear it.
