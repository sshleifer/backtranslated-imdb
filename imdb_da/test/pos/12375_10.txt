One of the best silent dramas I've seen. As dark and shady as anything the German expressionists produced, but with performances that were rather discreet and naturalistic for the day. No camera ripples and nothing inadvertently laughs due to wild eye arm waving histrionics. Sjostrom gave a convincing performance as the drunk, medieval, and scary David Holm. <br /> <br /> Seen most of the night in a dingy Swedish slum, the film had a very claustrophobic set bound feeling to it, aided by the low key lighting and the great use of the iris. There was a deep and typical Scandinavian sense of despair and hopelessness for the story: The movie begins in a rather bleak gift, and then we told David Holm's story in a series of flashbacks (and flashbacks in flashbacks - a rather complex story structure for 1921), where his character is offered many options for redemption, but he does not take them, and we know that he will not take them because we have seen him die dunk and miserable and means as always in the present. The penultimate scene is as dark as anyone I've seen in any movie theater. <br /> <br /> Writing and steering is tight and intelligent, even to today's standards. In several cases, Sjostrom skillfully sets the audience up to suspect a thing, and then a surprise pulls out. The end may not be such a surprise to some viewers, but I couldn't see it coming. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves a full restoration and DVD release. Or even a crappy budget release. It just has to be out there so people can see and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10, which rounds up to 10/10
