Although you are not a "theater person", I strongly recommend that you see this. Based on a game with the same name by Christopher Bond (which was again based on an old London legend), Sondheim did a wonderful job that led to the musical theater stage. The score is just fantastic - far Sondheim's best, and one of the best scores written for a musical ever. The view was extremely good, my only complaint is Betsy Joscelyn's portrayal of Johanna. It's good, remember, and she's a very versatile actress, but she's just singing "Greenfinch and Linnet Bird" for good. But apart from that, it is quite phenomenal - Angela Lansbury * did * the role of Mrs Lovette and she does it just as well. George Hearn was a good replacement for Len Cariou in the title role, and Ken Jennings gives a good performance as Tobias. The end will give you chills. Top marks for a wonderful show.
