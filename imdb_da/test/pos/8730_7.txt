Far more crisp and smaller stage and tied than Gene Saks' past efforts Barefoot in the Park (67) and The Odd Couple (68), Cactus Flower is not a work of art, but compared to most of the tired farces of 60s as the apartment, how to murder your wife, goodbye Charlie, a guide to the married man, divorce, American style, any Wednesday, kiss me stupid, boys night out, it's a masterpiece. Director Scissors and author I.A.L. Diamond has effectively "opened" Abe Burrow's Broadway hit, and the film benefits greatly from New York City's location and outstanding performances by Ingrid Bergman and Goldie Hawn. Bergman is charming, looks good and demonstrates a flair for comedy. Hawn in his Oscar-winning role has never been better or more appealing. Matthau is OK, although it is hard to believe that Hawn's character would be so enchanted by him. And gradually, Hawn's attempt at suicide at the start of the movie is out of character and incredible. Nevertheless, the film has a plausible farcical set-up, and when it does, it generates laughs. Rick Lenz, Jack Weston, Eve Bruce and Vito Scotti provide good support. The movie is cute and fun, and Hawn and Bergman make you careful.
