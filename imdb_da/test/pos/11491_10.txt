This is a really big and beautiful movie. The underlying theme of this movie is the innocent child (Heather Graham as Joline) who is struggling to make her naive desires for how the world should make sense while they are constantly being knocked down by the real world. However, this is not an unhappy movie - just the opposite. It's a funny movie with a sad side, but just thinking about the movie makes me feel so happy. Near the film, the beautiful, vulnerable Joline confronts a drug addict trying to break into his friend's car. She reasoned with him, convincing him to seek help and giving him $ 30 as a start. At the end of the movie, he is seen again to pay her back, explaining that he is away from drugs, goes well, and he thanks her. I can hear the cynics moan. By * course * it would never really happen. This movie does not take place in the real world. It is happening in the world we wanted us to live in. The sad part is aware that we are not living there. The happy part is knowing that there are people who want it.
