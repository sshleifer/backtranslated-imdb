I sit by going through movie lists and not really seeing anything I want to see. My appetite keeps saying, "Something like BROADCAST NEWS." That's what I want. Something smart and fun, with adult ideas and good acting and writing, and a director's style that doesn't draw attention to itself. It may well be Hurts best performance (that's it or the big chill), but eccentric, Hurt is smart, and playing an unintelligible person without being sure - flashing glance - the audience knows - blink blink - - Hi, I'm Not stupid ... Well, that's fine shopping right there. Hunter is note-perfect, and Albert Brooks is a revelation. (And he can read and sing at the same time!) Great, good work. <br /> <br />
