I felt cheated by knowing the whole story. While there might be a twist, this twist was so important that I felt betrayed. I think it could have used a better writer who could weave all elements of the story together better. The author could have revealed more of the "twists" throughout the film, rather than all at once in the end. On the other hand, I think the actors did really well with what they had, especially Matt Damon, who actually had a small character in his character, small quirks that were not selfish or as a happy criminal who always knows what he does. The other protagonists were their own separate entities that have just been pursued with each other. The group's context in Ocean's Eleven was gone.
