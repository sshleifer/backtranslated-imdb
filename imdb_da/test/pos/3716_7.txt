Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, lives in a world incompatible with modern life. He relies on his homemade weapon - helmet, sleeves and spear - made of hubcaps, seat cushions and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, "Man" rides his crime (literally) and transcends the lost lives captured in the hard and discouraging modern world - hovering over the earth, away from the state of modern man. Both characters are in search of adventure in an attempt to correct the worlds disturbances. Both characters are valued knights of values ​​not known to most of the other characters in history. <br /> <br /> Contrary to Cervantes' narrative, in this movie we identify more directly with the protagonist's anachronistic ideals. We can only compare this stranger and forbid the landscape to the lush and beautiful world we live in. Our frame of reference is imaginative, as the lone knight might remember. Our vision would be one that expects the protagonist to win, to overcome, to change his world (for the better) back into a world of masses that no longer exist. <br /> <br /> We watch this movie and see a true knight among a world of people-like animals. Don Quixote is considered a true knight among animals. <br /> <br /> With Cervant's narrative, we can only see the dreamer without really understanding the extent of his anachronistic displacement. In the story of Besson and Jolivers, we see the new world from Don Quixote's eyes because we appreciate the same visions and ideals as the main character.
