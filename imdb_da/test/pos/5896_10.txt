One of the great things about the best years of our lives, that although it stays pretty firmly in the Second World War era, the issues that are being talked about are just as real today as they were at VE or VJ day 1945. The problem of how to assimilate recurrent war veterans is as old as our world's planned history. <br /> <br /> And while we're not often learning from history, we can be grateful that the United States once learned about what happened to its veterans after the previous world war. The GI Bill of Rights mentioned in passing for the best years of our lives was possibly the greatest piece of social legislation from the last century. So many veterans used it as the veterans like Fredric March, Dana Andrews and Harold Russell, as you see here. <br /> <br /> All three of these actors played archetypal veterans, characters that every corner of the United States could identify with. They all meet a military airliner flying to their hometown, Boone City, Iowa. <br /> <br /> War is a great leveler of class and distinction. Banker March, Andrew's soda and high school football star Russell would probably never face real life even in a small town like Boone City. But those meetings and war smiles indestructible bonds that can never be broken. March is the oldest, a man with two children and Hollywood's perfect wife Myrna Loy. He settles in the first and the best. He has some wonderful scenes, is cuddled drunk by his return and later with a little fluid in him, the bank's officials at a banquet say without any precarious conditions. <br /> <br /> I also love his scene where another recurring veteran wants a shareholder to get a bank loan for his own piece of land. See March's expression as he listens to man's pitch for money. You can feel that he is reading man's soul. That's what made him his second best actor Oscar for this movie. <br /> <br /> Harold Russell was a real veteran who lost both hands during service in the Pacific. He received a special recognition Oscar for his performance. Because of that, it was probably unfair to nominate him in the Supporting Actor category, which he also won in. His achievements, especially his scenes with Cathy O'Donnell as his girlfriend who loves him with or without his hands, are beyond all what could be described as action. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is the only officer in the three, a bombing in the Army Air Corps. Of the group of them he might have stayed. He also comes from the group's poorest background, and he was an officer and a gentleman in the uniform. The uniform and monthly allocation control is what made Virginia Mayo interested enough to marry him. The problem is that he is considerably smaller in the eyes of civilians. <br /> <br /> While Mayo cheats with Steve Cochran, Andrews has the great luck of having Martian's daughter Teresa Wright interested in him. They are the film's main story, Andrew's adaptation to civilian life and adapt to the fact that he married the wrong woman. Not all veteran's problems were solved with GI Bill. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy gets some recognition for the best years in our lives. My guess is that it is because her role as a wife was too much like the stereotypical roles she had patented at MGM. Still as a wife to March and mother of Wright, she is truly the glue that holds that family together. <br /> <br /> The best years of our lives won for Best Picture of Sam Goldwyn, Best Director of William Wyler and a few others beyond the two plays Oscars became. It was a critical and popular success, possibly the best movie Sam Goldwyn ever produced. It is today an endearing and persistent classic and will be so for centuries. It's almost three hours in length, but never once will your interest fall. <br /> <br /> The best tribute this movie received came from Frank Capra, who had his own film in the Oscar competitions this year in several categories. In his memoirs, he said he was disappointed to be skunk on Oscar that year, but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created such a masterpiece, he deserved any price he could get for it. <br /> <br /> The way Capra had hoped the movie was a wonderful life. The Beat Years of Our Life can't get better praise than that.
