I remember watching this movie when I was very young and several times on television since then. I've always wanted it. I noticed on the screen shown on local television that a scene has turned film. That's where they hide behind the rock outcrop (it looks like Vasquez Rocks near Los Angeles), so the Indians pass by. If you look carefully, you notice that all the soldiers are suddenly left-handed! It's just a short segment and I have to admit it took me years to notice it. <br /> <br /> As far as history goes, there were often expeditions to rescue white prisoners from the Indians. The direct connection to the final battle scene is the battle of Beecher's Island. In that act, a group of volunteer scouts equipped with repeating carbines (Spencer Carbines not Winchesters) were amazed by the Indians and retreated to an island and held several charges. In the last charge, the Roman noses, one of the more famous Indian bosses, killed. I have no idea the writer's writer had that in mind, but it fits nicely. <br /> <br /> There are several Guy Madison movies that I hope come out on DVD someday and that is one of them.
