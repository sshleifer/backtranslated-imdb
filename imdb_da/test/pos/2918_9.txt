Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years, I was surprised to learn about this movie via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD to 99p. I enjoyed the movie, the twists in the plot, and that the file was essentially about the protagonist Sinuhe making it more of a "family story" than an action movie. Costumes and attention to detail were remarkable for their time (1955). The rear projection during the truck trip now looks clumsy. My main interest was in Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion. In this film he was portrayed as "Jesus" as in his refusal to go to war with the Hittite himself by invading Egypt and in his final speech of the infinite of material and political power. Initially, one creates a connection between Sinuhe, who was thrown into the Nile in a reed basket and the Old Testament Moses. But this connection is undoubtedly explored in a new film, where a Moses-like character carries Akhenaton's monotheistic religion to the wider world if such a film ever will be politically feasible. It is universally accepted that there were women who worry about man being stupid creatures, but the relationship or lack of one between Sinuhe and Merit, the nature of Jean Simmons is difficult to accept. And the intelligent, educated physician would be so beaten by Nefer's Babylonian "femme fatale" to give her her adoptive parental home and Tomb is not really credible, nor that his parents wanted a grave themselves. In fact, Nefer (Nefertitti) was Akhenaton's wife. And although Horemheb became Pharaoh, it was after a few others, including Tutankhamen, who was the son of Akhenaten. <br /> <br /> But of course it's just picking up and the movie is fun to watch, and it's about Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion is a big bonus. Perhaps after "The De Vinci Code" book and film, this movie is restored with the central secret that is the foundation of our current monotheism! I am waiting with great anticipation for such a movie, there are already many books on the subject.
