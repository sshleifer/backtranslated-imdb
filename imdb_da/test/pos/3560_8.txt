"Any Gun Can Play" (1967), directed by Enzo G. Castellari, is a very good pastiche of Spaghetti Westerns, especially Leones. The first half is great as, except for the opening, which is a direct nod to "A Few Dollars More", with Monco, Colonel Douglas Mortimer and El Indio lookalikes entering a ghost town and then immediately killed by a Bounty Hunter called "The Stranger", is very serious, with huge armies (especially the wooden track), quick and furious action and good performances by Gilbert Roland, George Hilton and (who manages well, judging he is very mistaken) Edd Byrnes. But when the film reaches the halfway mark, there is a joke fist between Hilton and Byrnes. It's not much fun and is the weakest part of the movie, but it throws everything you've seen in a new light before. You realize it's all a spit of Spaghetti Western Conventions, and in retrospect, the first half is so well done that you completely miss this spoof undercurrent. What follows is a more obvious parody, with even some acrobatic leaps from Brynes running for all of the Seventy Circus Westerns. The ending, a complete send-up of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" climax, is very well done, as in other hands it could have been very stupid. So, a pretty fun Spaghetti Western that doesn't take itself too seriously. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Spaghetti Westerns.
