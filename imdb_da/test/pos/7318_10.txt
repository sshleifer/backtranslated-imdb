This is one of Stooges best shorts. It was the only one of their shorts to be nominated for an oscar. On this card, Stooges play physicians who cause problems as usual. This short has non-stop sight-gags, puns and jokes. The part at the end where Stooges breaks apart machine. This is definitely a classic. I would highly recommend this Three Stooges card.
