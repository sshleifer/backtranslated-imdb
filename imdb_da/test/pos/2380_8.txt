Monster of Mexico I agree is the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo movies, mainly because of the weak plot and how predictable it was. Loch Ness Monster, however, is a significant improvement, with beautiful animation, frankly so Scotland looked beautiful. The music is good and the plot is well thought out. In addition, there is a great dialogue, and the voice action was fantastic, with Casey Kasem a consistent delight as Shaggy, and the beautiful Scottish singer Sheena East was a pleasant surprise in a guest's lead. In fact, my only complaints were some weird accents in one or two members of the voice cast, with the exception of the East, whose accent sounds real, and somehow Loch Ness Monster was not as well designed as it had potential. Overall, a solid and fun Scooby Doo movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox
