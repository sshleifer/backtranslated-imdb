I consider this loving and sensitive written story to be one of the true masterpieces of the screen. After watching this movie, originally on the silver screen with my mother, in Los Angeles, California, when it first came out, many years passed before I would have the opportunity to experience it again. The beautiful, quiet, simplistic elegance and tranquility of the film for me sets it apart from many, many others of its kind. Yes, tears still come into my eyes when I see it, and hear it renounce it once in a lifetime. Maybe still, today my number one most beloved movie. I hope this classic love story will be enjoyed and appreciated by our future generations.
