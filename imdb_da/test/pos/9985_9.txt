This is first and foremost a good and exciting story with well-developed characters. But all the other details are well crafted on top of it, leading to a wonderful movie. Don't let the Disney label lead you to believe this is dumbed-down or just for kids - it has a lot to offer at all ages, whether you like golf or not. One of the more impressive things is that the film manages to make a golf game look really exciting. And speaking as one of many who can't keep golf on TV, it's not a small thing. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film does a great job of laying out the basic characters with their motivations and backgrounds enough that you end up congratulating all the important competitors when the pivotal battle begins halfway through . Sure you are fighting for Ouimet's character all the time, but his primary opponents are sympathetic and interesting in their own right. The background is important when the golf game becomes a battle with mind and golf clubs, as you get a good understanding of what each person's strengths and weaknesses are when the game progresses. <br /> <br /> The effects of the computer are flashy, but they help the story more often than not. The management has all sorts of wise golf shots, and period costumes and sets are top notch. <br /> <br /> There are a few small quibbles - many of the smaller characters seem a little too stereotypically cast from class warfare, but it is forgivable with the big characters so well drawn. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBoeuf plays Francis Ouimet is as usual callous and sympathetic. But the real standout is Steven Dillane, who plays Harry Vardon. He rarely moves his face, but his intense, often sad eyes and minor changes of expression say so much. <br /> <br /> Ouimet's caddy Eddie Lowery, played by Josh Flitter, steals the scenes he is in. After you watch the movie, Google to find the real photograph of Ouimet and Lowery in the tournament for an even better understanding of how amazing this battle really was.
