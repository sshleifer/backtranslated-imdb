On holiday in Northern Australia, Gracie (Diana Glenn), her husband Adam (Andy Rodoreda) and her younger sister Lee (Maeve Dermody) decide to take the Blackwater Barry tour in the swamp for fishing. Their guide Jim (Ben Oxenbould) uses a small motor boat and takes a tourist along the river to a distant place. When they stop, they are attacked by a huge crocodile who capsizes their boat and immediately kills Jim. The three survivors climb a tree, and when they realize that help will never come to save them, they decide to try to find their way out of their protected location. But in the muddy water their boat is turned and the crocodile stalks the trio under the water. "Black Water" is an exciting, realistic and dramatic low-budget film, and in keeping with the early warning based on a true event. The action of the unknown Diana Glenn, Maeve Dermody and Andy Rodoreda is first-rate and gives credibility to this simple but frightening story. There are many similarities between this movie and "Prey", but in different environments. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo Profundo" ("Deep Fear")
