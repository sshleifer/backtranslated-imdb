(Very mild spoilers, a basic plot outline, no real details) <br /> <br /> If you go into this movie with enough low expectations. I saw this movie on a free screen some days ago in Maryland, and the only reason I agreed to go ... was because it was free. I was expecting a few chuckles, but as I have never been a big fan of Tenacious D, not much more than that. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes of the movie are fun as we get a look at Jack Black's humble Christian origins in a midwestern city. The film then takes us years into the future, to the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass, the second half of Tenacious D. We see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name. Finally, as the title suggests, the other half of the film describes their quest to get the fabulous "Pick of Destiny". Again, the beginning of the movie was ridiculously fun, and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face. That said, there were times it felt a bit long; It's only 100 minutes, but it still felt like it should have been a little shorter. The story is as absurd as it sounds, and it's not a movie you see if you want a real plot. That's fine unless it means that many of the jokes are very hit or miss ... and when they miss, they miss the bad. Same thing with the songs; it is a musical, but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so ... so it continued anyway. <br /> <br /> I would say that the R-Class really saved this movie from bombing; D's humor simply couldn't work without cussing, sex and drug references. But unless you're a real fan of the band, or at least you appreciate their comedy style, I'd recommend saving you some money and renting. "Pick" makes you giggle a little ... but is it worth 9 bucks? I do not think. I was tempted to rate it a 6, but since I think many would enjoy it enough to justify watching it in theaters, a 7 seems more appropriate. Just be sure it's your style.
