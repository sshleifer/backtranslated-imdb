The early films from Dead End Kids (before being renamed "The Bowery Boys") were all very entertaining and well-produced films from Warner Brothers. Despite being rather formal, they still had excellent writing, performance and well-being over time. Not to be confused with the cheap Bowery Boys movies from Monogram Pictures - despite the presence of Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey, these films were several notes during the previous quality films. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with tough guy John Garfield wins the lightweight championship. Unfortunately, shortly after that, he was on a drunk binge and blamed for a murder he didn't really commit. The problem is that he was so loaded that he wasn't sure he didn't kill the man, so he ran away and lives a hobo. Eventually he meets with feisty May Robson and Dead End Kids - as well as a woman you just know becomes his girlfriend's time. Where the rest of the movie goes, not all was surprising, but because of the quality of the movie, it doesn't seem to be anything. Garfield and the kids are the best and it is a movie that is sure to please everyone but the most famous viewers.
