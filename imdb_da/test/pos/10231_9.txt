I just watched Nightbreed for the first time since seeing it in the theater almost 20 years ago, and while I remember liked it at that time, I can't remember being blown away by what I was today. I really can't complain about anything in this movie. Craig Scheffer is excellent as Boone's main character. I have never understood why he has not had a more successful career because most of his early work is excellent. As far as Scheffer is, Cronenberg is even better. His depiction of psycho Dr. Decker is unforgettable and steals the show. The rest of the casting, which includes Doug Bradley, is very good, except for the ridiculous over the top redneck sheriff. The pictures are good and in some shots are great. The Danny Elfman composite score is as good as it gets and is among his best work. The end was epic, with nonstop action for almost twenty minutes. All in all, Nightbreed is a great achievement for Clive Barker, and is one of my favorite films just before Hellraiser. 9.10
