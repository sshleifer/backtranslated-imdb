I've seen this movie a couple of times, and with each view I still feel the excitement of starting a journey and the frustration of trying to overcome the barriers that hamper the path. It's more than just a desire to find a home; It's about the very basic human spirit to find its way in the world, to overcome despair, to face the character fibers that deter our goals. Underlying these human efforts is the challenge of reconsidering the origin of life. While this movie is steeped in serious ideas, it has just enough comic lines to let viewers hopeful. It's surprisingly fun. The performance of the story is excellent! This is all packed with visually engaging animation. One should see. <br /> <br />
