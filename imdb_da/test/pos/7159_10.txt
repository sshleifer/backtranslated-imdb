Just like this movie a day at the Santa Fe Film Festival. I was fond of his honesty and humor. It was the most thought-provoking movie I've seen for a very long time - I just can't get it from her for some reason. It may not be for everyone because it makes you think. I don't know if people like to think in movies so much more, which is a shame. The actors who play Franklins are right. I couldn't imagine playing these complicated people with such frankness. Although I thought some of the supporting characters were not as good as Franklins, I can totally forgive it - because it is an important movie in my opinion. I didn't expect to like it so much, but as I have been thinking about it for a few days, it turns out to be a very relevant piece of entertainment.
