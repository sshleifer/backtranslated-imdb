William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the south, especially during the years of depression. Many of his stories have been adapted to the screen. Card stories as two soldiers are a loving tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to appear as hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother does not take off well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without money to find his brother. Surprisingly, he becomes a soldier of a different kind, as he also wants to attract 10 years old. Ron Perlman makes a surprising achievement as the military leader who manages to take care of and hold onto the boy. This short film won an Oscar for Best Short-Live Action film, which is well-deserved. If it was longer, it could compete with the longer movies. Everything else like costumes, art and restoration of America in 1941 is perfect. The film also shows the heartbreaking war at home, as most Americans survived the Great Depression. The actors and actors are not known, but they perform first class performances. If Hollywood wanted to make more quality movies, I would probably go to the cinema. If Broadway had more quality shows, I would go to the theater more.
