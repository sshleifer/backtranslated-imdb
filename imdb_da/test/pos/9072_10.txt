Bevy of box office big league stars is phenomenal in this movie !! William Baldwin, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts !! This film was made in one of my favorite years also in 1990! I am a Chicagoan and the Chicago setting was very identifiable and artistically expedited too !! I liked this movie, and the agitation that motivated the climax of this picture was a strong element to the plot, which was quite sensational !! /> <br /> "Flatliners" center around a group of disgruntled pre-students who want to be flat lined as a way to achieve some sort of social justification !! When life doesn't make sense, it seems to be very illogical to be curious about apocalyptic nightmares !! At the same time, when their unpleasant curiosity has improved, no one will return !! The King of the Hill (so to speak) is the one who shouts strongly: I will do two minutes !! WHAT OTHERS GO TO DO IT! Someone will try for two and a half !! In the end, all these newly arrived and very unwelcome accusations now have an extremely ubiquitous disposition in these re-life lives !! Implementation to their justified or unjustified pathos required a full 360 degree perspective on the problems they were agonizing over !! Whatever purpose this quiet and academic chicanery serves, it is definitely an original approach to claiming your personality !! I liked this movie, 1990 was a good year for me too, it seemed to fall into place that year !! When I watched this movie one night in November of the year 1990, I was very glad I did it !!
