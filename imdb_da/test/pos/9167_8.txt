I think the basic idea of ​​any movie is to entertain or inform. If you want information, you look at real life movies and historical movies. Sometimes these are one of the same. The other side of the coin is to entertain. Has Hitch entertained me? Yes it did. Okay, the formula is standard. The boy meets girl, or in this case met boys girls. They come together, have one fall out and come back together. But the way it happened in this movie was refreshing. I especially liked the bar scene with Hitch and Sara. The Allegra Albert romance was a pleasure to see unfold, most genuine men are shy when it comes to awakening the woman of their dreams and had I had Hitch's advice, I would probably have gotten my wife up on the altar in half of time. I read First Comment on this movie that seemed to indicate that this movie was played safely and well has had some more laughs. I tend to disagree. There are so many laughs you can pack into a romantic comedy without making it a father. Besides relationships, there are serious moments. All in all, I found Hitch totally entertaining, the actors did a good job (I want to watch them in other movies) and Hitch is a movie I love to have in my DVD collection.
