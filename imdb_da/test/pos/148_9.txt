'Oldboy' director Park Chun-wook returns with what should be one of the yuckiest and at the same time the most serious vampire flicks in movie history. <br /> <br /> Confidence in the latest Hollywood fad, vampires today have to be rather non-violent, asexual, love-learning chevaliers, rather than the viciously violent sexually-bloody mind-manipulating man-animals. This is the movie you want to see if you want to remember the sticky tensions of the past ... Well, at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> 'Thirst' starts with a long drawing with culmination in a slightly different love story. The vampire transformation of a priest is for some time sidelined by the romantic and sexual aspects of history, giving some awkward viewing. But the last 40 minutes or so is surprisingly gory. Well, maybe not so surprising if you know 'Oldboy' and 'I'm a Cyborg, but it's ok', but it's fair to say that 'Thirst' beats Park's previous movie on violence in your face. <br /> <br /> All in all, be warned that this is neither an art cinema nor a scarecrow. It can be too disgusting for many and too tame for some. 'Thirst' is original, entertaining and luckily a little less strange than Park Chun-wook's previous efforts.
