There is an interesting split in the vote for this movie (currently at least). Those who expect a documentary are impressed, or at least not disappointed. I expect those who give the movie 1 out of 10 are those who expected a war movie or a repetition of the Gallipoli invasion. <br /> <br /> So - if you want to see actors, firefighters, and do, this movie doesn't suit you. If you want to see an independent documentary about Gallipoli, without pretense to a side (the only enemy in those events was the war itself) then you will get away both impressed and safe. I found it a very moving movie, and even liked Captain Guy Nightingale at the end.
