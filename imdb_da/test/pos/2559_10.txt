Where do I start? Let me put it - after watching the whole movie and the special features of the DVD - saw wife and I all over the film again with the director's comments. I can't remember ever having endured more than 7 minutes of such a comment on a movie. It's worth hearing. <br /> <br /> I'm not a southern boy, but I've spent time around Memphis long ago and have a feel for the area. This movie almost smells to the south, it is so right. Samuel Jackson, one of my all-time favorite actors, is magnificent as the emotionally bent Lazarus, and Christina Ricci gives the notion of life as Rae, a woman who has been severely injured during her short life. I have always listened to Mrs Ricci's work, but in this performance she gives 137% of herself every second she is on the screen. Prizes and small statues are not enough to reward her for what she is before the audience in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are other places where you can read the essence of history so I just comment on the work. I had heard the name Justin Timberlake before he saw "BSM" but had no idea how he looked, or even why he is famous. Bumping my head in 60 years, I'm out of his goal demographic, to say the least. After watching this movie, I recognize him. He can act! He gives a significant, credible performance as the beloved soulmate in the county. <br /> <br /> The director is from Memphis and shows reverence for his home region. He is also a nice story count. <br /> <br /> ..... and I have to mention the music. I love Blues, and the soundtrack to Black Snake Moan is a real feast for a blues fan. <br /> <br /> I write less coherently than usual because my enthusiasm for this movie overcomes my sentence structure. Watch this movie and I mean now.
