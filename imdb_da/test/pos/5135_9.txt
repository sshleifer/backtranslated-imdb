This is a lovely gem of a movie, unfortunately the duet-holed as "just for kids." The plot is about a young man, Roy Eberhardt, recently arrived in southwest Florida from the Montana mountains. Roy discovers a brother-sister's team trying to fit in with the other children at his intermediate stage, trying to protect endangered owls on an illegal construction site. Look for Carl Hiassen, the author of the book on which this film is based, as the male secretary of the evil chief at the company's headquarters. Author / director Wil Shriner is also a clerk at the Public Records Office, where the untouched teen detectives discover that the incriminating environmental impact report is missing. Luke Wilson steals almost all the crucial scenes from the charming teenage actors who have most of the best lines. Wilson is the Polish police officer, in his three-wheeled electric police car complete with blue light and funky siren. As Officer Dave, he tries so hard to do well, but usually stops falling into the muck, literally! Repeatedly! Jimmy Buffet is pretty low key as the tacit supportive science teacher. But the young actors Logan Lerman (Roy), Brie Larson (Beatrice the Bear) and Cody Linley (Mullet Fingers) are great as teenagers, who finally put Officer Dave on track for the paper track left by the evil corporate boss. I hope you get away from this movie, feel as good as I did. Just fun! A little complaint, though. I hope all non-floridians realize that not everyone from Florida is as surly to beginners as depicted in this movie. We are really a friendly bunch! Just ask Carl Hiassen and Jimmy Buffet !!
