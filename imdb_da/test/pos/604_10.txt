Jim Henson's Muppet Movie is a charming, fun, and brilliant movie that can be seen and enjoyed by adults and children. I feel this is my favorite childhood movie because it combines great characters, great history and great joke that it's irresistible. The reason involves the Kermit frog (puppeteered and voiced by Henson) in his odyssey in America to follow his dream in Hollywood. Along the way, he meets Fozzie Bear, The Great Gonzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf and DR. Teeth and electric chaos. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many good things, I can't even tell them. But it is memorable, and every time I think of a puppet or muppet, I think of this movie. Look for cameos from Mel Brooks, Dom DeLouise, Paul Williams, Madeline Kahn, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthey), Elliot Gould, Carol Kane, and Orson Welles. Excellent and spectacular, one of the best movies in the 70s. A ++
