Can the intensity of a man's love for his wife lead him to cover a crime despite fraud at many levels? Tom Wilkinson is not brutal Othello, in the setting of modern England. So gradually a web of fraud begins to be woven. And we experience bicycles of jealousy and intoxication and guilt and adultery. And then the network of "separate lies" begins to fail and then hold together again. And life (and death) continues in spite of the bright flame of the man's love and the deep despair and blame woven into so many lives. How many scams should be shown in this growing tap race? The impulse is to build sterling reputation and career and relationships in this most civilized corner of the world. Wilkinson gives an emotional performance full of grace and discretion, yet mankind of those who have much to hide. Those who want clarity and openness on the road to justice will be disappointed with the evil of so much deception. And yet, who among us, has nothing similar to hide from his loved ones? Nevertheless, the viewer may wonder if this web is greasy to crumble one day.
