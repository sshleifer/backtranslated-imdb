The channel zapping one night I just caught the start of this movie and it hooked me from the beginning. It tells the sad story of an adopted child, Adam, whose mother left him after birth. The film takes us through his childhood and makes us discover a very disturbing fact from Adam's past. I don't want to reveal more, but it's a very in-depth movie and will intrigue you for sure. This was one of Jimmy Smith's best roles in my opinion.
