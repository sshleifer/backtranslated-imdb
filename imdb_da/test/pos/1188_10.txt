I first saw this movie in the theater. I was 10. I just saw it another time and I have to say it was amazing. The music, the dance, the actor. It's a great story and told very well. I fell in love with Treat Williams when I was a kid after seeing him in this movie. One of my favorite parts was when his mother kept shouting at him to give her her pants and then finally said "how much do you need"? (money). It was classic. ; ). <br /> <br /> VAT is the best. If you haven't seen this movie since it came out, I'll say it again. It's timeless. It will do what every good movie does; Make you laugh, cry and think.
