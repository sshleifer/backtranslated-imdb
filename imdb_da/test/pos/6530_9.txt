This is a really cute movie. I had a massive overnight stay (girls 10-11) and they absolutely loved this movie. They saw it twice! Don't let the judgment fool you. You must be 13 or older to judge a movie on IMDb that eliminates the film's audience. If you have a girl (or a boy) between 7 and 13, I guarantee they will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Sort of a gender reverse "Notting Hill" in high school. Aaron Carter plays a famous pop star who fails his privately trained classes. His mother sends him to a "regular" high school with the ultimatum "passing high school or no summer trip". On the advice of her boss (former pop star David Cassidy), he is kind to the smartest girl in school (Alana Austin) with plans to cheat from her. Look for the humorous and insightful Janitor (another former pop star Lief Garrett).
