Normally I hate period movies. Living in England is a nightmare at the moment if you have an allergy to period dramas - as I do. But this one is the best. It doesn't take itself seriously, and Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are good together, Liv Tyler is also good, although her English accent is risky !! <br /> <br /> The movie has everything for anyone who just wants to go to the cinema to enjoy themselves. It has action, adventure, drama and comedy. I'm not sure how well the jokes will translate across the ocean, but hopefully they will. It would be a shame for the American public to miss this movie. It shows that English filmmakers can produce something that does not involve constant swarms and sex. Both functions are in this, but in a balanced format. Iain Robertson's rental description of the gentleman's well is brilliant, and the two brothers who are also part of the upper class are hilarious! <br /> <br /> As the trailer for "The Spy Who Shagged Me" is backed up .... "If you see another movie" .... this spring it does Plunkett and Macleane. It has fun, action lurks and of course Jonny Lee Miller with an English accent for a change!
