I just read what I believe to be an analysis of this film of a lyrical Irish. Nice to read. <br /> <br /> A brief analysis of this film, however, is that it is a link between the sins of the seven deaths with the four types of justice. Envy, greed, pride, laziness, anger, etc. and justice in the form of retributive, distributive, blind and divine. <br /> <br /> I could demonstrate three examples of each one for each of the three main characters; However, it is very fun to notice them for themselves. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it.
