It was harrowingly close, but China's syndrome received the worst form of publicity when it went to theatrical releases, the accident at Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant. I still remember that the whole country's attention was glued to hourly tickets coming out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. And if you don't know, a scientist in The China Syndrome describes the worst case that makes an area as large as Pennsylvania uninhabitable. <br /> <br /> Less than a decade later in Ukraine in Chernobyl the Soviet Union has in its last days dealt with such a crisis that did not get right in time. China's syndrome again became a relevant movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is more about cutting corners for security than it is about being anti-nuclear. Jack Lemmon is a man who lived with nuclear power all his life as captain of a nuclear submarine. What attacks him and sets him off to create the confrontation that climaxes the movie is the stupidity and greed of the power company. Stupidity and greed although goods are found every day. The problem with them is that there are places where it can be tolerated less in human society. <br /> <br /> Lemmon shares a star account with a couple of famous Hollywood offspring, Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. Jane is a television news reporter who is constantly assigned puff feature stories and happens at a nuclear power plant when an accident occurs. Covered by his own station and her later meeting with Lemmon settled the chain of events depicted in The China Syndrome. <br /> <br /> However, the funda's best scene I thought with Peter Donat a news manager with her station. Take a look at her facial expressions as Donat flips out of the importance of history and tells her that her very beauty requires her to stick to puff pieces. Fonda knows she has something and sticks with it. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays his iconoclastic cameraman, it was a typical part for him back in the day. In his TCM tribute to his father Kirk Douglas, Michael said he chose roles that showed sensitivity. I could still have seen a young Kirk Douglas in this part. <br /> <br /> What to do with energy for industrial and post-industrial countries, a worrying issue that will ask our government for a few future generations. This film shows what can happen to a nuclear power addiction. Our current problems, geopolitical in the world, stem in part from a dependence on fossil fuels, especially oil. Everything we use brings the consequence a little unforeseen. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the real hero of the movie is Wilford Brimley, Lemmon's colleague at the nuclear power plant. In the end, Brimley really goes up to the plate. <br /> <br /> See The China Syndrome to know what I'm talking about.
