The third part of Miike's death or living trilogy is so independent of the first two parts as they were more or less together. Show Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi are back again for the lead, but this time the film highlights us 300 years or more in the future ... after apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Riki plays a fierce policeman, an enforcer for the corrupt city's extreme police policies, and Show plays a drift associated with a bunch of the city's oppressed rebels. The film must have been shot in Hong Kong, as most of the remaining voices are Cantonese speakers, with Terence Yin and Josie Ho being the most recognizable faces. There is also a HK stunt crew member available for the movie's action sequences, which are very cool in a HK-via-Miike style. <br /> <br /> This could be the feed for a terribly low budget B movie, but in Miike's hands, of course, it will be something more interesting. It is quite a slow, thought-provoking film that is twisting together and trying not to force anything into the viewers' neck. Characters are rounded and interesting, and the plot is an interesting but rather loose frame for the story to hang on. All in all, a pretty low key bet until the action scenes, which show Miike's increased ability to control and choreograph the very nice action. Seeing the short presentation of Show & Riki in wire rigs is really fun - you can tell they had the right time <br /> <br /> The final of the movie is trying to link the 3 Dead Or Alive movies which is quite unnecessary because each one is truly independent. Miike's explanation of the connection, however, is very fun and fights the series quite nicely. <br /> <br /> Not as deep or well-developed as DOA2, not as scandalous and intense as DOA1 ... yet another good Miike movie though.
