Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I wonder why Cagney wasn't in the role. Maybe it was like angels with crooked facets? I think it's also another Dead End Kids story of bats, but I really appreciated them here, and this movie had a lot of great comic touches along with some good serious dramas. The boys work well with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole "swimming" scene that starts with no worries, but gets up too close to disaster. <br /> <br /> A negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly disappointed. As a detective, the fine actor seemed to go out here as a nun in a headquarters.
