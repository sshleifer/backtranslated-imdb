I remember driving in with my parent and sister. I was in grade 5, and still a child, and the drive closed 4 years later, but the film was still in my memory. An adult movie that a child finds entertaining. It is a brand of expertise. Hoffman is one of Hollywood's better actors, and this movie proves it. I like Billy lowering the ice stage and I can remember the SCTV version in there in the movie I factory itself. Remember Joe Flairty crying. Please email me if you like SCTV crap. It's not a bad movie, it's a story of a father and his son. Touch and interference, I love the part where Hoffman talks about Killroy and how the streets are changing. Worth another watch. 10.7
