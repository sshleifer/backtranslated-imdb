"Pearl Harbor, buddy." This movie is brilliant! Sure it doesn't exactly flow like a multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are incredible. I am one that goes for misery, like "Dumb and Dumber", "Airplane" and "Wet Hot American Summer" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies are just not written with this kind of occasional comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it is frankly amazing that more people do not know and praise this slapstick masterpiece! When you see this, you will easily find over 20 quotes from what you will find yourself quoting after-sales ... and after seeing it again, you'll find even more!
