Now this movie came on a working day at 230. The sweet little actress who played Billy first got my attention and after the first 15 minutes I was kept in captivity for my television at the end. It has you on the edge of your seat and then throws in clever comedies under the most strained sequences. The only drawback is that the story was not large enough to fill up half a movie, causing some sequences to pull slightly. Nevertheless, it was still very entertaining and I recommended it to all my colleagues the next day.
