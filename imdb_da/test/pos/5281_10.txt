Gake no Ue no Ponyo is a beautifully animated film and a relief from the many heartless, soulless CGI films made. Pastel and color ink backgrounds were a surprise after Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away) and Hauru no Ugoku Shiro (Howl's Moving Castle), so uniformly stylistic. The style worked well for the movie and was done exceptionally well. The time and effort to animate this is much appreciated as it gives the characters so much more life, detail and care it requires, making the film so much better. There are several amazing scenes throughout the movie that have lots of movement and action. The biggest for me to be a scene was Ponyo's sisters turning into massive wave as fish as she runs on them. The story is simple but rather well-written and played. The plot was focused on character issues and while it was not played out, as well as in Tonari no Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro) it is still fantastic. I felt that each character had an appropriate amount of screen time as opposed to Spirited Away, which was so jammed with distinctive signs that it could have been stretched out in a whole series. (The Radish Spirit. There was another whole movie right there!) My only real problem with the movie was the end. The way it is formulated in the English version at least looks like there will be a good test given to Skesuke, which turns out to be just Ponyo's mother promising him to love Ponyo. Even though more consideration is given to this, I get to believe that the translation may not be so accurate to the real meaning that the test is lifted and that it deeply means he really does. The movie seems to end suddenly. Apart from that the movie was great and I highly recommend it.
