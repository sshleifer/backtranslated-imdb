Believe me, I wanted this series to work, but the early departure of Kevin Kilner treated a near death blow after season 1. Robert Leeshock just wasn't that part and Jane Heitmeyer did an admirable job as lead, but the series was just too messy and confused at the time. I don't know what happened in season five, what a mess. Sometimes it's time to drop the red cape and just keep the sword in the bull if you know what I mean. The only consistent line that held the series together was the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two reels in silent ideological conflicts. If not for their talents and well-written dialogue, they would have been two strange bald chicks in a B-movie series. <br /> <br /> If only this series could be completed in season 4 and downloaded later by SyFy ...
