From the beginning of the movie, I thought I was trying to keep myself quiet so I didn't wake anyone in the house, this didn't go so much in the rest of the movie, I didn't find everything quite "laugh out loud" fun but still I found some things pretty funny. In the beginning, I had to hold on to laughter when he dropped the very slim hand grenade down the sleeve. Then there are scenes where you just want to smile, as when the razor falls through a roof in one occasion, I can see that it is quite fun, but in today's days and times that have been done quite a lot, it felt Not original, though, at the time I'm sure it was. I loved Hynkel's (Hitler's) outburst of raging German with the fine, subtle English translation. <br /> <br /> The final scene is discussed wildly because it is absolutely true and so very intelligently designed. Although the movie is seventy eight years old, the last scene is still relevant today, if it doesn't show how much a writer Chaplin is, then I don't know what it will be. The action in this scene in particular was quite good, the barber exceeded the message perfectly and makes you aware of the film's serious character while enjoying the humorous side. Another feature of this movie is the fact that this was such a brave movie that almost feels like it's time. Of course, Chaplin did not know what to do after 1940, he was not aware of the Holocaust (of course), he also went on record to say whether he had known he would not have made this film. In fact this film is so anti-Hitler interesting, it is more interesting that it was not anti-Germany, which would be very easy to have done back in those times, Chaplin could easily make this a propaganda movie, but instead something more, he made an honest movie. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend anyone who is distracted by this movie to see it, both those who have studied or studied Hitler and World War II to see this movie. It is entertaining to say the least, it doesn't have an annoying outdated feeling that some movies of the time did. In contrast to most "comedies", this movie actually has a message it tries to bring to you, watch this movie, you'd be better off viewing it.
