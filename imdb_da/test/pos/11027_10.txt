I watched this movie in 75, and this movie was a kind of open mind to me about how important it is to care for Nature and the Wild Life. When I got a dog in 83, I called him PUSH (In Movie..Avakun's dog) to never forget this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, I have a copy of this movie but are in Portuguese language and the quality is not as good as a DVD or a new VHS (I recorded almost 20 years ago and in SLP quickly. .So the quality is not so good ..) <br /> <br /> If anyone wants a copy .. I will try to convert to DVD and I can send you OK? <br /> <br /> Ot's a great movie and I agree that it is a movie that must always be seen. Waldemar Braz - Sao Paulo / Brazil
