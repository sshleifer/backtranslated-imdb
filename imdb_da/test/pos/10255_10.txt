Cooley High is considered one of my best all-time movies. It certainly reminds me that my youth's days grow up in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago in the early mid and late 1960s. What happened to Brenda and Pooter? Some have to track down the two. Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for his innocent wit. They both deserve to be recognized even 31 years after this film was debuted. I think many of the movie's fans would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this funny movie. I definitely think this movie should be entered in a kind of MOVIE HALL OF FAME. All cast of this movie was amazing. My opinion is of "Cooley High" is to return the hands of the times, it was the fun years.
