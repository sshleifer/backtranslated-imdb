I am an action movie fan, but until today I have never seen an example or ad for this movie in Italy, so I went to see "The Long Kiss Goodnight" on pay-TV hoping nothing special. <br /> <br /> But what a surprise! This movie is amazing! The only problem I found is the presence of some gaps in the plot, but the rest is the most entertaining, exciting and fun action movie ever made. <br /> <br /> The transformation of Samantha / Charly from ordinary wife-teacher that cold-blooded drug recover from amnesia seems to be a good idea. Action scenes and stunts are the best I have ever seen. Samuel L. Jackson adds some of the best lines I've ever heard, and his chemistry with Geena Davis is good. <br /> <br /> And what about Geena? She is wonderful, she plays the best action heroine ever seen and makes strong, compelling plays and amazing stunts. <br /> <br /> So, I think this movie had weak performances at box office and bad critics, because most reviewers and some of the public find it difficult to have strong female roles. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
