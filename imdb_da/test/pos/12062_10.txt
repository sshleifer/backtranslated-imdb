This was one of the few shows my wife and I agreed to see. I was sorry to hear that it was canceled, especially because I was unaware that the ratings were so poor. As far as I knew it was very good with many viewers. Almost all my friends and most of the people I spoke to saw the show. Now we are seeing either crappy shows or DVDs. How bad was the performance done? does anyone know the real results of show shows? I know that when it was Thursday, it was more difficult for me to catch. Thanks G * d for DVR's! <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was a real surprise to know that there will no longer be "The War At Home". If other networks see this, PLEASE PUT UP THE SHOW !!!! PLEASE!
