Milo is an overlooked & underrated horror flick from the late 90's, but the feeling and atmosphere is more than an 80's horror flick. Seems a bunch of little girls are being taken to "see things" at Milo's father, a gynecologist's office and as a reward to see what's in jars (yes a gynecologist plus something else ...) a girl plays "doctor" with Milo. Hmm, his first patient and he lost her. Now Milo is a scary little child who always wears a yellow rain slicker, rain or shine, and he speaks funny .... but that's not all that is strange about him. Fast forward to the present where these girls are adults and a wedding is planned for one of them, but the tragedy strikes and leaves a girl coming in out of town with a choice of whether to replace her friend as a schoolteacher or not she does. And then strange things begin again. Which of course involves this little child in a rain slicker. This is not too violent or graphic, but it has a clear foam that you won't find in many modern horror flicks, and it's worth seeing. One wonders why it's so hard to find some good horror flicks in this day and age, but here's one that is criminally overlooked and definitely worth your time if you check it out. 8 out of 10
