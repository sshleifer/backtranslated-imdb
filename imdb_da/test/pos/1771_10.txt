I watched this movie when I was very young living in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie and I wrote to Jean Peters in Hollywood, and I told her how much I enjoyed watching her in this movie. She sent me an autographed image. This film was directed by Jacques Tourneur and in addition to Jean Peters starring. It is also the stars Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget and Herbert Marshall. It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes. She also starred in "Viva Zapata" with Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn, who won an Oscar to play the role of Zapata's brother (Marlon Brando star as Zapata) (1952). And she also starred in "Captain from Castile" (1947) with Tyron Power. Since then I have tried to find a place where it is available, but so far I have not been successful. Does anyone have any suggestions on where to find and buy this movie? This comment contains spoilers, I'm not aware of it.
