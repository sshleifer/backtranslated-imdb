I love this movie! When I watched this movie on TV when I was a kid, the hell frightened me. After all, because mannequins give me the screams too. Jocelyn Jones (Molly) is an excellent actress. She uses her facial expressions, especially her eyes, to play frightened. Chuck Connors is great as Mr.Slausen. I was happy to see him play another role. The other actors in this movie are also good! Tanya Roberts (Becky) and Robin Sherwood (Eileen) are great actresses and I hope to see them in future movies, especially Jocelyn Jones! <br /> <br /> So if you love scary movies but are tired of seeing the same old, check out this movie!
