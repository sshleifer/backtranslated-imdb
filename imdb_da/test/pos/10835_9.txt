I do a dissertation on the blurring of the borders: the female cross negotiator and use Tipping the Velvet book as my main text, any comments on gender and sexual identity, gender and sexual confusion, gender as performance, gender as fiction, gender images, cross-dressing as a erotic imagination and as a revolution, the effect of the male costume, etc. etc will be greatly appreciated! But a little of that, has anyone seen Sergio Toledo's 1987 film Vera? It's about a young lesbian possibly transsexual cross dresser. I die to see it because I think it would be very helpful ... Does anyone know where I might get a copy of it? I've tried Amazon and a few other places but not lucky ...
