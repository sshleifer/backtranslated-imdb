This is a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold and snowy night. If you like a few laughs with your horror then it's the movie for you. The effects of a true cult classic. It has everything you would like to see in a horror movie. A beautiful girl, A hero, The buffoon, A MONSTER TRUCK and of course a family of mutant satanic kills. This is full of blood, gut and gore. I strongly recommend watching this in the early morning, and be careful who sees you entertained by the sounds of Monster Trucks, Bad {But Funny} One liners and our Hero eating eye ball stew. Not as good as the evil death, but a close second. Just remember WARNING ..... DO NOT EAT, BEFORE YOU SEE THIS MOVIE ...
