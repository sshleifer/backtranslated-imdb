Hitch is a light hearted comedy that will entertain you with some fine performances. Will Smith become a credible achievement as a cloak and dagger doctor who must remain invisible to protect his clients and his profession. Smith was excellent, never skimmed it up too much. The best piece of play goes to the actor (not known name) playing this accountant who has fallen for this woman who is out of her league. This actor did an excellent job of character development as he listens to Smith's instructions, but eventually he just can't be the one he really is. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's the main message for this movie. Be as you fall in love with, and you will be ok. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Will Smith meets this attractive lady, and Date Doctor gets the taste of her own medicine as he slowly falls for this woman. Don't know her name, but she was also good. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a lovely, light movie that is definitely worth watching.
