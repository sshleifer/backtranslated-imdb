This is another classic Seagal movie. He goes, no, cruises through the patriot just all the other Mega Seagal movies. Nothing even comes close to challenging Seagal in this movie except perhaps the part where he has to find a cure for this so-called 'plague' and he starts throwing things about the lab, but it all seems, I mean, let's see it its master Seagal, he has to win. What about his outfit in the movie, the masterpiece, he must have chosen it himself. It's great that everyone in the movie dies after being exposed to the virus, but Seagal doesn't get a cough. The incident at the end, when he kills the cool guy with the broken glass, genius, I suggest that Seagal thought of that one too. This movie is class clean and simple. great plot, big figures and Seagal.
