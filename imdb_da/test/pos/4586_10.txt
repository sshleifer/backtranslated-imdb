This movie is BRILLIANT. I can't remember this movie even in theaters, so it was a "straight to DVD" I have pretty low expectations, even though I'm a big fan of Mike Judge. It has some of the same kind of comic future satire as "Brazil" and "Demolition Man" but taken to the next level. <br /> <br /> So I cast; Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard, all of whom were brilliant in their roles. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, this movie won me over the first 5 minutes, showing above average that has fewer children and the poorest, stupid and sweet people who have many ignorant children and how this leads to some kind of reverse development. It takes this concept and then shows where we are facing this pollution of the gene pool. Unfortunately, I do not think it will take the 500 years as depicted, but probably only about 50. I already see the shocking rise in "mild retardation" in the population, media and culture. People who like classical music and art are ridiculed rather than respected. The lowest common denominator seems to rule, especially in Hollywood and on television (eg "Jackass the Movie" and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or humiliate yourself for money). <br /> <br /> All the political / social satire aside, this movie is also just LOW OUT LOUD fun! And I don't say that easily; a few movies actually make me "LOL" but this one did. <br /> <br /> Many of the best jokes are words / visuals in the background, so you really need to be aware of getting some of them. I even had to pause and zoom in for some of them (like when Joe got his government ID and for "hair" it said "yes" and for "eyes" it also said "yes"). The prison has also engraved on the front page "House for certain people" when the police in the movie (who, in fact, the police) call all "individuals" instead of people etc. It was again on the screen for just one moment ... this is one of The movies you can see over and over and dissect it to get through the fun teams. <br /> <br /> I also usually watch movies with the subtitles on and it clued me In some jokes that can pass your ears into the dialogue mix, the police are constantly talking about people "buying out" instead of "escaping" And there are many other misconceptions that just struck me up. But again, I may not have downloaded them right at the dialogue mixed with music / sound effects; It is very subtle but still fun. <br /> <br /> In addition, the special effects were really good for a sci-fi / social satire. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but overall, I think it's one of those movies that if you don't think it's fun, it's fun to have fun with you! I plan to recommend this to many, many people!
