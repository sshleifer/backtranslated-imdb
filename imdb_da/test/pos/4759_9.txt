I was born in '68 with not much parental guidance, what I saw on television (as a child in the 70s). I always loved this movie (and the French connection) and would always try to catch it when it was on (see Sunday's TV guide ahead of time). I bought it on DVD some years ago and have seen it twice since then and I have to say I love it! Roy S. was a great actress from the 70's (Jaws is one of my all-time favs, Marathon Man, etc.), and although 7-ups are not an Oscar-worthy movie, it puts you right in a while a place (NY, early 70s, like the French connection) and giving you some hard signs and a glimpse of life as a policeman at that time. And yes, the ticket is one of the very best.
