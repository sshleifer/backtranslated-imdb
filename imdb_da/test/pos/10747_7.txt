Project A II is a classic Jackie Chan movie featuring all the kung fu, crazy stunts and slapstick humor you expect. Not as good as the prequel but still it is a good movie if you just want something fun to watch. The story is simple, jackie chan versus the evil men. So if you want a movie you don't need to be a braniac to understand, I suggest this one.
