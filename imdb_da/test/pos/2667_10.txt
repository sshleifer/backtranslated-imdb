For all the confused of the length and pace of this movie ("as, why does he show spaceships docking for 15 minutes?"), Here is a word you might want to think about: <br /> <br /> Beauty. <br /> <br /> Beauty is an under-qualified concept. Sure, you will often see great photography and so on in movies. But when did you last watch a movie that contains beauty solely for the sake of it? There is a strange belief among filmmakers that everything that is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the movie's plot. A leader can show 15-minute spaceships without reason than they are beautiful, and doing so is neither illegal nor evil. <br /> <br /> '2001' requires you to look differently than you normally see movies. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty of the fact that there is no complex short or detailed characterization. Do not make me wrong, plots and figures are good, but they are not the very best and end everything. There are different kinds of movies, and to enjoy '2001' you have to tune your brain to another wavelength and indulge in the joy of beauty, PURE beauty, unimpeded by the banal conventions of everyday movies. <br /> <br /> "All species are quite useless" - Oscar Wilde.
