Yes, this show had a lot of male frontal nudity and yes, over the years the plot lines were over the top, melodramatic and very unrealistic, but it didn't matter because the show is amazing. You really get involved in the characters, and each character, no matter how small or larger, is completely cast. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine anyone else unless JK Simmons plays the neo-Nazi racist rapist leader, nor does Andre play Tobias Beecher except Lee Tergesen. The transformation of his character from season 1 to season 2 is fantastic. However, the sign that made Oz OZ was CHRIS KELLER (played by Christopher Meloni). He had no relations with others in prison except Beecher (well except Ronnie Barlog, but it was only to get Ronnie to stop playing with Keller's beloved, Beecher). Their relationship transcended sex, and Tom Fontana actually made us break the two and want them two together. <br /> <br /> I loved Vern's soft spot for his kids in the show and how Fontana made sympathetic characters out of all those shameful criminals we grew to adore, even Simon Adebesi. <br /> <br /> But some plot lines were incredible and unrealistic: * A guy builds a bomb in oz * Guys stand in a spotlight in their windows in their pods and look at other men who are deepening something in their minds - also over the top. * Drugs get in oz * Everyone in the rehab group used or sold drugs and Sister Pete never helped anyone in six years. * People are killed in the gym, provide cupboard and kitchen. * No one hurt Ryan's mother * Nobody fights Cyril outside the boxing ring (except for Vern of course) * Two inmates with tools standing alone in the elevator shaft and one of them dies without investigation. * Karl Metzger (guard) is killed and no one is investigating. * Governor holds all his press conferences in prison. * An inmate must do is say "I want to see Glenn" or "I want to see mcmanus" and they are taken to them without question. * People die every week in Oz * On the outside people are killing someone and getting 20, up for parole in eight, but if they kill someone on the inside, they almost go to death almost instantly * There is no on-site paid staff in the kitchen or postroom - inmates run both departments without question * aging drugs for inmates to replace as time earned * ryan has no friends or co-workers but he never gets hurt, killed, muttered, raped or beaten. * The boys NEVER flush the toilets when they go to the bathroom or throw up. * An NBA scout comes to jail for recruiting for an NBA player (yes right) <br /> <br /> But with all these bugs, this show is still great. It's cruel, brutal, sexy, angular, raw, and innovative. Dean Winters, Scott William Winters, JK Simmons, Christopher Meloni, Luiz Guzman, Adele (the guy who played Simon Adebisi), Eammon Walker, Lee Tergesen, Terry Kinney, MUMS, Man Alexander, LL Cool J etc. All are amazing and made the show worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend renting this on DVD. Season six comes out 9/06 (next month). The first five seasons are on DVD - watch them and watch them again with audio comments. I loved the director's comment with Chazz Palmentari. The sequence with Andy Schillinger runs down the cafeteria tables and then falls into the hole was a great, top notch shot !!!! Kudos! And Kathy Bates heads Family Business and the famous wrestling scene between Beecher and Keller - simply amazing !! Brilliant!!! It must be so strange for Meloni to touch the Tergene's private part in front of an icon like Kathy Bates in one scene !! Wow! Pull it off beautifully, the pun! <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for Oz: The Next Generation !!!! (like with Star Trek etc.) C'Mon !!! Let's get it started !!!!
