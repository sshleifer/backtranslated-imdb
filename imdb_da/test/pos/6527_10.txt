This is the first American movie I've seen this year, and I think it will be the biggest because of the feeling. As a teenager in America, Aaron is not as pop as before, most Americans I met said his song is fake, and he didn't even know how to shout. But pay attention, everyone he is a child, how many people can understand him. Being a pop fan is difficult, and being a pop star is more difficult. I think this time Aaron (JD) has shown something right to us. And I think people should learn to understand each other. On the other hand, I really like the music in the movie. I remember that the first song in the movie is "Saturday Night" and it also contains some Aaron's real live show and the other is "One Better" so I think if you enjoy this movie, maybe you will also be a pop fan . Finally, I hope you will have a good time ^ ^ A voice from a Chinese boy.
