This is such a reverent and studied movie, a classic among Hitchcock's many, it does not require any surprise to want to see it again. But you think: Can it stick, even though the big (and clever and amazing) trick of the plot is no surprise? <br /> <br /> Yes. <br /> <br /> Initially, there is the Start, a deeply beautiful and smooth tale of the right whole story, the core of it. Two taxis, two men shown with their shoes, each going on the train, then sitting across each other, and oops, a mistake, a little nudge, and the conversation begins, and we see the men themselves. They are interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The tone here is characteristic of Hitchcock as it is in many horror and thrill films - cheery and light. We get into the movie, that this will not be the case, so we are already worried. What's going on wrong? <br /> <br /> Much. In true Hitchcock fashion, it is a purely innocent man (almost always a man) who faces injustice, who is trapped by circumstances that threaten the most valuable to him. The innocent in this case is played tennis player Guy Haynes with an innocence that is credible - his collegial courtesy in the first scene, for example, when he understands the other man is a little cuckoo, is just what you or I might do. The not so innocent man is the self-absorbed and scary intelligent pampered child, Bruno Anthony, who plays with superb shine by Robert Walker. (This eerie performance is similar to that of another Hitchcock wacko, played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho.) So from the scene one, on the train (and the train is really beautiful!), Do we have the two drivers and we have the mind blowing and completely simple and ultimately devastating plot, from the first novel by Patricia Highsmith, who also wrote the books behind the two Mr. Ripley movie. And it doesn't hurt that the manuscript was written by Raymond Chandler himself, who knows something about economy and smart dialogue. And crime. <br /> <br /> And of course there is more than just the first scene. What to note? Well, the smarty of a senator's daughter (I thought she was amazing) is Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, who is still with us (from 2009, she also had a role in Psycho). And there's a distinctive site for a key scene in the movie - the Hamptons tennis courts known to us as the site of U.S. Open. The amazing last-full scene with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock moves into a kind of slow and steady assembly, building the excitement of making it surreal. The fear becomes positive with the laughing children and the old man crawls under it all. And when it collapses in a collapse - it's all the back project on a set, one of the more naturalistic uses of a director known not to worry about the realism of his back projections. <br /> <br /> Photography is the perfect Hollywood stunning without being so stylized (as in some noir films) that it is an object in itself. Look again at the first scene, or Haynes training (and editing) into the house for what the audience thinks is a murder. This is sophisticated construction. When we are not completely surprised that it is Bruno in bed, it only shows that the instructor has us on our toes. Something unexpected is always expected. <br /> <br /> Are there errors? Who knows? It depends on what kind of falsehood you can accept (or embrace) as beautiful style. The scene in which Bruno stifles the old woman at a party is both brilliant (the woman played by Norma Varden is a caricature so credible that it breathes away) and mistreated by his look at the senator's daughter and is triggered to a deadly trance by her glasses and her resemblance to his former victim. This is a mid-20th century idea of ​​psychology that penetrates many of Hitchcock's efforts. (At the end of Psycho, for starters.) The Wikipedia article wisely emphasizes the consistent doubling of things in the film, from the protagonists to the murder victims and the senator's daughter. This echoes in many small ways - two men jump him to the tennis court, two men accompany the victim to the amusement park and so on. Too much of this can be done, but it gives an aesthetic consistency over and under our consciousness. Don't forget, it's supposed to be two murders - it's the lack of the second murder, the inability to double, in that case, that makes Bruno rave. <br /> <br /> The Walker actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized the year before this film was shot and just afterwards he died of a reaction to a drug that used to calm one of his outbreaks. Although he appeared in other films, Strangers on a Train is easily his tour force. Farley Granger had a long career that never really saw him break into true star, though his style may have a particularly nervous sweetness that really works, especially in the night life. <br /> <br /> If you look at this for the first or third time, look for the chic and fun scene in the tennis match, where the crowds heads all move back and forth together - except Bruno's. He stares out without moving his head straight to us. As the trailer trailer says, after this movie, you are not talking to "strangers on a train".
