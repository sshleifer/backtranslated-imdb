"The Egyptian" is under the government of one of the most fascinating figures in the ancient world, Pharaoh Akhnaton, as thirteen centuries before Christ tried to introduce a monotheistic religion, Athens, to ancient Egypt. However, the protagonist is not Akhnaton, but rather the fictional Sinuhe. As a baby, Sinuhe is found mysteriously floating in a basket on the river Nile and adopted by the doctor Senmut and his wife. As he grows into crew he follows his adoptive father to the medical company. He first works as his father among the poor in the city, but he comes to prominence after he and his friend, the ambitious young soldier Horemheb, save Pharaoh's life on a hunting expedition in the desert. Sinuhe has been appointed Court Judge, but is obsessed with the Babylonian courtesan Nefer. Sinuhe not only destroys himself in vain for winning his love, but is also outraged when his neglect of his duties means he is unable to save Akhnaton's daughter. <br /> <br /> Sinuhe flies to exile, gaining healing success in neighboring countries, but returning to Egypt as he learns of a Hittite plot to invade. Although Akhnaton forgives him for his earlier offenses, Sinuhe finds himself in turmoil. Pharaoh's attempt to introduce a new religion has led to civil disputes between his followers and the priests of the ancient polytheistic belief, and he is too pacific of nature to take steps to confront the threat of the Hittite. Sinuhe becomes involved in a plot of Horemheb, now the Egyptian army general, and Akhnaton's sister Princess Baketamon disturbs Pharaoh and replaces him with a more effective monarch. <br /> <br /> The film's weaknesses stem mainly from its two romantic subplots. During the film, Sinuhe is revealed as the previously lost son of the former Pharaoh and half-brother of Akhnaton and Baketamon. It can therefore surprise a modern audience that she must fall in love with him; Marriage between brothers and sisters was not necessarily considered incestuous by the standards of Egyptian royalty, but the standards of the 1950s cinema audience were generally less liberal at this point. In any case, the Horemheb-Baketamon-Sinuhe love triangle is an unnecessary complication and detracts from the role of Baketamon in the film, the cold eyes, cynical Realpolitik. <br /> <br /> The Nefer subplot, which records most of the movie's first hour, is overwritten and overly melodramatic. Nefer is morally worthless but fascinating, and the role needs an actress with great beauty and also great dramatic skill to make her credible, especially when Nefer achieves the difficult task of winning Sinuhe away from a woman as lovely as Jean Simmons (who plays Merit, Sinuhe's rival for her feelings). It is therefore unfortunate that the role went to an actress who was comical scary like Bella Darvi, whose only qualification was that she was a mistress of the producer, Darryl F. Zanuck. Darvi was not only a wooden actress, but also spoke with a thick foreign accent that was made even more incomprehensible by a lisp. She was not even particularly attractive to the two legendary Hollywood beauties of the movie Simmons and Gene Tierney playing Baketamon. <br /> <br /> The movie is better when it concentrates on its main political and religious themes. The other actors are better than Darvi, although Peter Ustinov as Sinuhe's servant Kaptah makes the same mistake as in "Spartacus", trying to bring cartoon help to a movie that doesn't need it. His voice, however, was far too patrician for a "comic servant" role. <br /> <br /> Edmund Purdom, a little known British actor, was featured in the lead role when Marlon Brando pulled out at the last minute, but more than enough filled the big man's shoes, even though his acting style was quite different. He does well with the challenge of showing the changes in Sinuhe's character, from unworldly idealist to lovesick fool, to cursed cynic to the enlightened visionaries of the final scenes. Victor Mature was never the most expressive of actors, but he is well suited to Horemheb's role, a practical, down-to-earth actor. He's better here than he was in his second epic from 1954, "Demetrius and the gladiators". Simmons are luminously beautiful as Merit. Michael Wilding (hitherto best known to me as the second Mr Elizabeth Taylor) plays Akhnaton as a wild philosopher-king who ends up as a kind of holy stupid. His inability to make difficult decisions makes him an inappropriate ruler, but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice that gives him an air of moral grandeur far beyond those hoping to replace him on the throne. Although Athens had more in common with the deities' highest being than with the Old Testament of Jehovah or the Trinitarian Christian God, there is a deliberate attempt to draw parallels between atheism and Christianity. In the film, the Athenist symbol is "ankh", undoubtedly chosen for its similarity to a cross, but in reality it was an ordinary Egyptian hieroglyph for life, not unique to Athenism. Akhnaton's language often has a biblical ring to it; his comparison of himself to "wind flutes in the desert" is reminiscent of John the Baptist's "voice crying in the desert" (hence the title of this review). Sinuhe's discovery in the river is parallel to the Old Testament of Moses. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie Sinuhe, which has become the legacy of the dead Akhnaton's spirit, he achieves his own moral grandeur. The film's message is that while we may need practical action people like Horemheb, we also need visionaries and thinkers who are ready to ask the question "why?" For all its mistakes, "The Egyptian" is a film that is idealistic and humane in its approach to both religion and politics. 10.7
