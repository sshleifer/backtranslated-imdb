This is the final film of a trilogy by the brilliant Turkish director, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, whose last film Mayis Sikintisi - who was very Cehovian - was featured in prestigious film festivals. Unlike his previous film, the story of 'Uzak' is set on Istanbul, which is one of the world's most crowded cities. But in Ceylan's film we see only minor traces of the big crowd. Rather, he chooses to focus on two characters, a photographer and one of his relatives who come from his small village to find a job on transatlantic ships. The photographer, who - we understand it - has also immigrated to the city, seems to be inhabited by the customs of urban life, not just in the material sense. In his relationship with his relative, we first see him as caring and tolerant, but since he could not find a job, our suburbs begin to be disturbed to share his private "space" with someone whose departure date becomes ambiguous. I will not reveal the tactics he develops to pull his relative out of his life to prevent harm to your enjoyment, but it is enough to say that Ceylan shows us the tactics we acquire within the routine of the suburbic life ; 'tactics' to keep our own private space, 'tactics' not to communicate with other people, 'tactics' to prevent our relationships from becoming complex (from our own experience we believe it is complex enough). <br /> <br /> Ceylan's film presents a clear picture of what a human being is within the boundaries of modern (or post-modern?) city by portraying the two characters in different ways. But he does not condemn any of the two signs to do this, but he uses power films to emphasize this difference. For example, we always look at the character looking for new opportunities that come from the village in open spaces. Even within the house he prefers balcony as his favorite room. On the other hand, we always see the photographer within the enclosed spaces and generally in the home. Although there are more than 10 million people out there and many experiences, many interesting things to discover (or is there anyone?), He prefers to sit at home, watch TV, etc. His home is like his temple, a kind of sacred place. <br /> <br /> Anyone living in a big city and aware of the experience he lives through will find something that belongs to himself in Uzak. If you like this movie, I'm sure you'll like Ceylan's other two films, Mayis Sikintisi and Kasaba (The Town). Go find them!
