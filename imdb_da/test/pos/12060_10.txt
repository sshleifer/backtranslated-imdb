I have realized that many people have commented on the nature of this show to be racist and homophobic, but I don't feel that is what this show is about. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is about parents who were not ready for children and are now not ready for teenagers. This show helps bring humor to a very hard topic that is sometimes overlooked: parenting. <br /> <br /> Yes, we've all had shows that had families in it, for example: Family Matters, Step by Step, Family Ties, Full House .... but it would always have the same old recipe on it are episodes. "Steph" cuts off the school and gets caught by his father. They have a heart to heart conversation and music is played and it is over with a two-week grounding that after a "aww, dad ..." gets a smile and the show is over. Where is the comedy in such a situation? Where is Realism? With the war at home you get real situations from a real father's type of figure. Most parents looking at this show hear some of the lines the parents put out and they either laugh (because they know they have said it!) Or they nod their heads (because they know they have Thought it and never had the courage to say it! The war at home has situations that bring great comedy like a father who thinks his son is gay. It doesn't sound funny, most people think it makes the father homophobic, but the comedy comes in the lurking father trying to talk to his son to open up. Which parent knows the right thing to say, especially in a situation like this? I highly recommend this show to anyone I know, have a sense of humor, and especially to anyone who is a young parent or young when they had children. You relate to a show like this when you are either.
