I went into this movie and thought I didn't like it, but hoped to be surprised, but it was just as much like the movie that it was gloomy and hopeless. But don't forget me, Minghella delivers everyone a great epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes like that, they won't be disappointed and it will be one of those best movie of the year in their opinion. The action is of high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity oscar noms to Law, Kidman and Zellweger, although Portman's few scenes may be the most powerful in the movie. The location is beautiful and Minghella has an eye for a good shot. But for those like me who want the instructor to take them on the adventure instead of willingly, they can get away disappointed mainly because of Minghella and his adaptation. The movie is so completely bleak, it does what I consider to be a punching behind the epic, which is a movie that tries to hit hard with emotions, but makes it so extreme and so often that during the movie I didn't have it time to emotionally invest or has not been restored from an earlier stroke, and it became unrealistic and therefore too difficult to really care, not to mention predictable. Overall, "Cold Mountain" almost left me too drained to think of the good sides of the film, which all I can remember is death, which may have been an original motive, but end up being the focus of the characters.
