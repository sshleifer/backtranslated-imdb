For an 18 day movie shot and a budget less than 2 million, this little movie that deserves a 'best we could' prize. Interesting premises (apart from the usual meteor things) with solid perfs of a cast of familiar faces. 2 thumbs up. Advice to the other reviewer: Don't be afraid to say you liked something.
