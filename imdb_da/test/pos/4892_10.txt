I have never seen any of The League's work before the beginning of last year - even though I was jumping one night at the end of a series of three episodes. But this winter I fell in love with the show and its dark, eccentric and sometimes outrageous characters. So when I learned that they had made a movie where the show's beloved creators met their own characters, I couldn't order the DVD fast enough and almost tear it off my postman's hands when he delivered it. I was so excited to see what the gentlemen had done and how they had done it. <br /> <br /> And it was excellent! From the beginning, when Jeremy (Michael Sheen) is terrorized by Edward, Tubbs and Papa (Dyson, why didn't you play yourself? He's quite capable of viewing the infamous Highgate House of Horrors!), To Bernice berating one more from Her flock to Geoff, Herr Lipp and Hilary discover that they are characters, which is a great scene. The scenes set in 1690 are very comfortable, with Gents turning their hands to even more characters and a whole new plot. David Warner's turn as Doctor Pea is great, a little camp and a lot of fun. League has always been brilliant by blending humor with sadness and emotion - and the climax of this movie where Mr. Lipp is struggling with the idea that he and the other vasey residents are just fictional people who will never be able to change who they are or their purpose - and to witness how it breaks him down is really sad the beautiful and beautiful to see at the same time shows Ghent's talent - something they are horribly overlooked to today. <br /> <br /> And then you have the pretty clever end - where you sit strangely - with Joby Talbots beautiful themed music playing. And you know you've had a very clever and fun movie.
