Robin Williams shows his stand-up talents and strengthens his status as a comedian in this film about "what's wrong - in US politics and how can Hollywood try to influence itself without boring people". Of course, Hollywood uses movies with hidden or not-so-hidden agendas. I think this movie is for people who like stand-up and political discussion. And trailers of this movie were for everyone just to ensure that as many people as possible see this. Everyone knows that Hollywood is more liberal / democratic than bush & co, so they have to make these movies every now and then ... but maybe it was too obvious, at least I thought so to make any real change. <br /> <br /> Still good stand-up and fresh political questions and lectures ... I enjoyed it and thanks to IMDb.com reviews, I was pleasantly surprised when I left the cinema and yes, I laughed often. Sometimes just let it go and forget everything seriously .... watch this movie if you like good and smart stand-up or politics and you won't be offended by the many references on how things aren't good now. Rent it if it doesn't suit you.
