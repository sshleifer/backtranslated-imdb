I went to the cinema to see Claudine and loved every minute of it also threw and soundtrack. Diahann Carroll was never better than in this role. We saw Ms. Carroll downplayed her hardly saw her naked, smoking a cigarette, drinking beer and oh, she cursed. When this movie was shown on TV and finally cable, I would call my friends to see it. Just the soundtrack from the start of the movie is amazing all thanks to Gladys Knight and Pips. We saw a black woman struggling to raise her children, dealing with teenage pregnancy and everyday encountering a man whom she learns later, has problems with herself. Finally, this movie made it to DVD and well deserved.
