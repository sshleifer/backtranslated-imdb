Everyone agrees on the technical expertise of this movie of Jutra (whose life ended up so tragic). Of course, the content makes a difference if you are a Quebecker, and it explains some of the divergence of opinions. For me it is that cinema, what Vignault's "Mon pays, ce n'est pas un pays" is to sing. In addition, Jean Duceppe himself was part of the legendary Quebec. <br /> <br /> This movie can be contradicted by "CRAZY", a current Quebec release that is successful enough to be shown here in Spain and is also about the 1960s. Urban Quebec (Crazy) vs rural Quebec (Antoine). But also a movie that has to be something very different for foreigners and for people who know Quebec from within.
