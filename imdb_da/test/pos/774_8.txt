Loved this movie, what a hoot. Rupert and Julie are great with Rupert, who is almost poker against Julie's animation, which worked well. Laura did a good job as the indulgent mother. Christmas is of course wonderful as usual. While this movie will keep you laughing most, it also has an exciting side to it as it unravels the secrets of the protagonists' lives. Interestingly, it was right driving lessons like this can make you believe this is the main file in the movie, which is direct, though it could certainly be seen as "Ben" at the end of the wheelchair in its own life. Like most things that are fun in life, there is always the sad side, and there are some moving moments in this movie. Very fun movie and worth seeing.
