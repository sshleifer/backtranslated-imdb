Don't look in the basement is actually a very smart and thoughtful exploitation flick that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and poor play. Of course it is not a masterpiece of anyone, but it is a very funny little B-movie with a lot to offer and even many scary scenes that will remain in your head. As I said, the action could have been much better, but that's the case with most exploitation, so I can't really complain. The story is clever and has some good plot phrases that will keep you guessing. I thought gore was also very fun. There is just something good about older gore movies because they didn't have CGI again so they had to put it all up. See here a good time!
