I really enjoyed the Patriot. This film had less violence and was based on a real threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization. A line in the movie from the Wesley McLaren (Seagal) stuck out in my heart to be very true to our society, "Western medicine is in practice prolonging the disease, and I'm in the process of healing it." <br /> <br />
