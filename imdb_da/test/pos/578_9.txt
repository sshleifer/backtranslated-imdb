First of all, before I start my review, I just read every review for 'The Muppet Movie' here, and I can't believe anyone could give a negative review to a movie like this. (Fortunately, there was only one.) I mean, I can understand how someone might not like Star Wars because of the whole Sci-Fi genre, but not as a movie with some of the most lovable dolls in human history almost sorry. <br /> <br /> Okay, I want to step out of my soapbox now and review this movie. <br /> <br /> 'The Muppet Movie' came out when I was seven. All my friends wanted to see this as their birthday movie, so I think I saw it about four times in the first month in theaters. As a child, many things have attracted me to this and all the other Muppet movies and TV shows. The song was probably the most important. Most songs in 'The Muppet Movie' are classics. From "Rainbow Connection" to "I'm Going To Go Back There Someday", they are entertaining and thought-provoking. As an adult, I see 'The Muppet Movie' in almost a completely different light. Yes, the things that excited me about it as a child are still there, but these are the little jokes and things that are just fun. <br /> <br /> I think that when you think about it, Jim Henson is a sick man. <br /> <br /> Kermit is a seed and is in love with a sweet pig that wears purple gloves and can carve you into two pieces. Fozzie is a stand-up comedian bear. Gonzo is an "whatever" that is vanity in chickens. Then you have two old boys, heckle, a piano, a rock band with a maniac drummer, a Swedish chef you can't understand, and a number of other characters who are just eccentric. <br /> <br /> But for these reasons and more, Henson has entertained millions of children and adults, giving us everything special to see and remember. <br /> <br /> 'The Muppet Movie' will always remain in my heart for many reasons, but I think the greatest is because it is a movie, unlike many recent children's films that I have it good to have my kids watch. And I'm not bored with jokes that are stupid down to my children's level. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie that will surely be remembered forever.
