a very good episode, although it was not so devastating a finale as the end of season 1. The idea of ​​making it a Desmond flashback worked really well, and Henry Ian Cusick was great, maybe put the best performance throughout this series but my only complaint would be the Michael plot line felt very much like a subplot, and after three minutes the previous episode, I thought it would work more. But the strength of Cusick's character and performance pulled it through. Plot development, as always, left several questions, so replies like who the others, something we still don't know, and where they take jacks, Sawyer and Kate. What was the white light, what impact did it have? Are Locke, Eko and Desmond dead? as the hatch destroyed around them. If they are, it would be a big mistake because these three are the most interesting characters, and the series will suffer without them, and Terry O'Quinn has been fantastic in both series as Locke. An appropriate final for a better series than the first.
