One of my all-time favorite movies. Nothing can watch this movie for the first time. If I could go back in time and delete my memory or suffer from immediate amnesia, then I would enjoy this movie as much as I did the very first time. It's still fun the second and third times around, but I found myself appreciating humor more, as the shocks and excitement were not unexpected. If you want to watch a movie that you really can't predict the end of, I highly recommend this movie. Its chilling, shocking, full of excitement, and there's also lots of humor to help you through it too. If you see this movie and don't love it, I really ask your sanity!
