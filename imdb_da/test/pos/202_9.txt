In Moscow, the young couple are Veronika (T. Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) in deep love for each other. With World War II, Boris volunteers to join the army and is sent to the front the day before Veronika's birthday and they have no way of saying goodbye to each other. While waiting for Boris's news, Veronika is raped by Boris's cousin Mark (A. Shvorin) and they marry each other. But Veronika doesn't forget Boris and keeps waiting for him. <br /> <br /> "Letyat zhuravli" is an impressive and heartbreaking romance in wartime. The direction is excellent and uses ellipses along the story, including in the capital's stage when Veronika is raped by Mark. The camera work is great, with sophisticated planes and angles, and long journeys. The scenes in Veronika in the middle of mind, or in the train station with many figurants are awesome. The magnificent movie is highlighted by the reproduced picture of the DVD. T. Samojlova has an extremely beautiful face and a touching and sensitive performance. The speech in the last scene makes another good example of an anti-war film. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Quando Voam as Cegonhas" ("When Fly the Stork")
