The funniest show ever on television, though humor is not for everyone. I realize it would have been difficult to keep the show fresh if it had run longer, but it is a pity that only six episodes were filmed. Gags quickly fly from the opening circles to the end when you want to see Drebin and his boss, Ed Hocken, pretending to be in the freezer frame as the final credits rolled, under which the criminal (still) would see everyone else motionless and try to escape. In another episode, the building began to collapse around them as Drebin and Hocken remained in freezing mode. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen was comical brilliance like Frank Drebin and the perfect fit for this show ?? how he managed to keep a straight face through some of this is beyond me. Because the jokes came so often and quickly, you can see the episodes a 2nd and 3rd time and catch things you missed the first time. If you are like me, you can see them again and again and still find yourself laughing. Even the jokes that had no meaning or apparent had any reason for them, such as "Rex Hamilton as the Abraham Lincoln" mark in the opening announcement, somehow worked ?? Maybe they were thrown there just for that reason. <br /> <br /> If the old Quinn Martin detective / police programs of the 1970s were neglected, the Police Squad would return from a commercial break with the words "Act Two" displayed on screen immediately followed by "Yankees One "or another quip. The opening credits show the title of the episode on the screen, but the advertiser will pronounce a completely different title. My favorite jokes and lines from this series are far too many to list, but one of my favorites is when Drebin asks a down-on-luck box that has previously fought fights: "Do you think you can beat Champ? " The boxer responds, "I can make him blindfolded!" To which Drebin responds, "But what if he's not blindfolded?" A moment later, in the reference to the boxer's small, sniffy occasion, Drebin tells him, "I'll help you get out of this sewer." The next thing you see, Drebin pops up through a manhole in the street! In another episode, Drebin and Hocken ask about a bombing recipient's spiky alibi. Drebin, who does not believe in him, says: "Okay, let's say you were in the movies." After a short break, Drebin, Hocken and it suspected everyone on the camera and said jointly, "You went in the movies." A few moments later, when Drebin is forced to let the suspect bomber go free because of lack of evidence, he storms away and shouts shouting: "Tell the bomber to go!" What is next is a policeman who gives the thumb signal to a WWII style aircraft on a roll just outside the building! While there were many classic Drebin quotes, it was a particularly memorable one, "Sorry to disturb Mrs Mrs Twice. We would have come earlier, but your husband was not dead then." Another classic was, "I'm a locksmith, and I'm a locksmith." When a visibly shaken kidnapped victim's father asks Drebin, "What do I do?" ?? Drebin, in classic deadpan fashion, reacts back: "Well, as I understand it, you're in the textile industry." As I said, humor is not for everyone ?? Many people simply will not "get" it. During the short run of the show, I remember that the reaction is very mixed. Some people thought it was completely hysterical and one of the funniest things around, while others thought it was stupid and unfunny. For me, the Police Squad, even 20+ years later, is the funniest thing I've ever seen on television. For younger viewers who enjoy this type of humor, but who have never seen the Police Squad because they were too young, as the series originally broadcast, I highly recommend. I found the six episodes to be even more fun than the subsequent "Naked Gun" movies.
