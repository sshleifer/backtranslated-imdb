Stylish D: In the fate of fate, the fictional tale of the formation of the band tells Tenacious D and their quest to find the fate of fate, a guitar selection with supernatural powers made by Satan's tooth itself (played by Dave Grohl). JB (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Gass), joined by fate, must travel to the Rock N 'Roll Museum and steal the Pick of Destiny to become the greatest band on earth. The film is hilarious and gives undisturbed grin. Jack Black and Kyle Gass work together perfectly, have been true friends and colleagues for over 20 years. The film is partly a musical. All (or most) of the music was written and performed by The D. All songs are new material and many of them are classic. The soundtrack is definitely worth checking out. This movie is most appreciated by fans of Tenacious D, but if you're not a fan of The D, I still think you'll enjoy the movie. If you are a fan of D, then you should watch this movie. The play is not as bad as you might think, and laughing and greed never stops coming. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to make their socks rock and laugh as hard as they have been laughing for a long time. Watch for cameos by Dave Grohl, Ronnie James Dio, Meatloaf, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins, John C. Reilly and Neil Hamburger. Also stay tuned for an extra scene after the credits.
