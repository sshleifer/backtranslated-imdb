So again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh and such a joy to see. I have to change almost everything she does as I am a vegetarian ... but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so welcoming with her fans and still looks down to earth. The study audience seems to be quite small, but it just gives a more cozy environment. Some have written that the show sucks. I think it depends on your own interpretation of it and of her. If you notice the early 30 Minute Meals, you will see a completely different personality than in the last few years. I'm sure she also finds her comfort zone with this show. Good luck Rachael!
