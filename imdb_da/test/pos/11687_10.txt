One of the greatest successes of the fall of Western civilization, filmmaker Penelope Spheeris' indie breakthrough, is that it may appeal to non-punk fans about the hardcore ones. More importantly, it catches a moment in history before the movement became "marketable", as bands would play (or at least try to play in some cases) in ugly, dirty clubs for an audience that had so much self-respect as they had respect for the ties. For the tab, like myself, there are precious interviews with some of the quasi-legends in LA's punk-scum, some dead, some still alive and still hard-working on stage. <br /> <br /> Performances and interviews include The Circle Jerks, X, Black Flag (within Henry Rollins Days), Catholic Discipline, Fear, Alice Bag Band and most memorable (in my opinion) are Germs. Although I knew about a couple of the bands and artists in the movie (The Jerks and Black Flag mostly), I had only heard rumors of lead singer (the late Darby Crash), and from the footage in the movie he seems to be one of, if not epitopes of the punk movement. He does not take care too seriously, he loves to drink, sometimes when he speaks it is completely gibberish, and the attitude he brings on stage is both fun and freely shaped exciting. A performer like that would probably scare Steve Miller and Jackson Browne out of their skins. <br /> <br /> Deviation from Western civilization cannot turn on any non-punk fan seeking this movie (it's hard to find video), but it shouldn't necessarily turn them off either. As a kind of anthropologist who crept into the party, Spheeris gets these people's behavior down pat, their motives, their likes and hate, and the power that was their personalities on and off display. Some of them come almost as usual, some do not, but they are only offensive to those who are not open to things. In addition, the movie is a must-see for the kind of kids who think they are punk fans just because they listen to Good Charlotte and Blink-182: if you want the right scoop on the movement and genre of rock, you love to love, give the pioneers a chance.
