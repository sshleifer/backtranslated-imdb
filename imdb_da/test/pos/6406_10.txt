Key West, for short, was a time "deal tv" for my family. I would stop with Red Lobster and get a party tray for the night it was on. The irony of the situation was that I was working for a Fox affiliate at the time, and everyone at the station was mocked at them and did not renew the show. Everyone in the throw was excellent. Fisher Stevens ... perfect. Who could not fail to identify with an "everyman" who dreams of being an author in Key West? Jennifer Tilly was always remarkable (and she is a HECK of a Texas Hold'em Player). You can still find the pilot episode on YouTube. Wish they would send the hurricane one. The episode alone should have won an Emmy, as well as the rest of the cast.
