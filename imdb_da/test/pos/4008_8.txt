I watch the show every day, and it's very entertaining. It gives updates to tech news, video games virtually everything geek. They are also the official television stations of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, player or something really, you will enjoy this show. They certainly oped their game since the guy during my review (2006). It's the only place I get my tech info. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other, and the show always has segments that refer to things in the game, movies, cartoon ... Universe. If you know these universes, you will understand the jokes. Long story short, aots is a fun show that gives me and all the news of everything and everything you care about. I'm looking at it right now, as I write this, they are 'in' San Diego covering the red tire airstreams. Sweet.
