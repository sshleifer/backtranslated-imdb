After watching the Harry Potter films, I have been a fan of the trio actors Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; but we have been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides playing the same characters years or every other year by J.K. Rowling series. In essence, instead of a trio, the cameras and magazine articles concentrate more on Daniel and Emma, ​​being the leading male and only leading woman in the saga who leaves the end of Rupert's death. Regardless, each actor has time to shine, and Rupert's light hits him once in this movie. "Driving Lessons" is called Harold and Maude of this generation with Rupert Grint, who plays the role of Ben Marshall, a young British boy living with his dominant mother (Laura Linney) and a glance at a pastor whom he would like to have work in the summer, but who cannot find work, while taking his driving test (and failing) and writing poetry for a young girl who has no interest in him. <br /> <br /> Ben is looking for an ad in a church newspaper that the job requires to take care of an elderly lady. He takes the job and realizes that he is in favor of a fun of surprises like Evie (Julie Walters, Rupert's mother in the Harry Potter series) an out-of-work actress who is also a poet who gives Ben money for his money . They tie where and tell each other secrets with Evie, who acts as a child and enters mishief, where she pulls Ben together for a road trip. From their not only does Ben drive all the way from Britain to Scotland, when Evie is to recite at a local library, but at the same time an older lady falls for the young man where Ben begins to become a man. <br /> <There are mishaps and at the same time, Ben and Evie are delighted to say that I was very happy with the movie when it came out in theaters and I was impressed by Rupert Grint's play, especially if he showed the rest of The world that even though he brings a bit of Ron Weasley in Ben Marshall, no one stops the actor on his amazing performance.
