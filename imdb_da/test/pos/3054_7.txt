Not since Bette Davis's 1933 vehicle "Ex-Lady" I have seen a movie that was so much better than its star said it was! Most of the bum rap "Atoll K," et al. "Utopia," et al. "Robinson Crusoeland," et al. "Escapade" has over the years come from horror stories Stan Laurel told about his production. Considering that he suffered a stroke during the shooting so that death warmed over much of it (from the two shots together, you would never guess that Laurel survived Hardy by eight years) and was subsequently diagnosed with diabetes (once he adjusted His diet accordingly restored himself to health, one can understand why Laurel did not believe this movie was the most enjoyable experience of his life. Yes, it is defective: The cheapness of production turns out, the duplication is horrible, and Laurel and Hardy were too old to make the energetic slapstick of their biggest movie. But it's still really fun, and LÃ©o Johnson's story introduces elements of political satire (sometimes libertarian, sometimes communist) one would expect to see from more socially conscious comedians like Chaplin or Marx Brothers, but never from Laurel and Hardy. The film deserves the credit of being different (although the debt to Ealing Studios' classic "Passport to Pimlico", made a year earlier, is quite obvious) and to integrate Laurel and the Hardy comedy in a rather edgy context, quite different from anything they had used before. This is not a good movie, but it is certainly better than the eight daring to Fox and MGM they had made in the early 1940s. I suppose only the film's technical rarity kept it from serving the cult that follows among the anti-establishment baby-boomer youth Marx Brothers' Duck Soup acquired in the late 1960s / early 1970s.
