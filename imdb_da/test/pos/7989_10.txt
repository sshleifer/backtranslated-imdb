Batman Returns It is my opinion that the first Batman in the Batman series was only half of the movie Batman Returns' movie. In the first Batman by Tim Burton we only had Batman and The Joker both played wonderfully by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. <br /> <br /> In Batman Returns we have what I think is the most perfectly thrown Batman movie (even better than Dark Knight). Keaton returns as Batman and is perfect in the role that never goes far beyond the character of Batman, which is perfect in this movie when it comes to the two villains he is against. First you have Danny DeVito, who is lovely crazy like Penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat-Woman, as I dare say, is one of the most interesting and complex villains in Batman movies. I feel this way about Pfeiffer because of the way she becomes Cat-Woman, she starts as the rather pathetic mousy Selena Kyle and then really dives into the dark side of her mind, and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman who goes from trying to be a hero to a villain and then I think back to a hero in the end. Also in this fantastic cast you have the evil businessman Max Schreck played by the fantastic and legendary Christopher Walken. In a supportive role, there is something about this role that I love, and maybe it's Schrecks appearance in the movie that makes his performance better than it already is. Historically, I have to say that Batman Returns has done so much more this time, unlike the first Batman. Part of the reason I loved this story so much is that Burton dared to go in a much darker and twisted direction as opposed to Nicholson's over the top antics. You have the story of the penguin and how he tries to deceive the people of Gotam to make him the new hero and mayor of the city. Then you have Cat-Woman and her fight to decide what she really is and what to do with her new persona. When it comes to Batman, I feel that in this he is more ringleader who holds the two stories together, but of course kicking ass at the same time. <br /> <br /> The camera was film is dark and atmospheric like the story that goes on inside it. Gotham City never looks as good as it does on Blu-Ray and HD, so if you have the chance to see it this way, do it in every way because it really contributes to the overall experience of Batman Returns. <br /> <br /> So all in all I really feel for all Batman movies Batman Returns mean it or not when I think of the dark knight for me, because while I enjoyed that movie for Heath Ledger's amazing performance as Joker , I felt the movie was missing something. Batman Returns lacks nothing, so if you want to watch a fantastic movie with what I feel is a perfect cast, then Batman is turning on the Bat signal.
