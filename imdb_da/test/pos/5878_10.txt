While watching an everyday modern movie (The Runaway Bride) with my granddaughter (22 years old), she asked me, "Since you've seen movies since 1938, what's the best movie in your life?" Boy! What a choice! It took me all summer and thought of some flicks before I made my decision. It is "the best years of our lives". This movie has no errors. It's a movie where each of the lowercase part and dialogue is crucial to the whole story. There is not a single part of the film that could be omitted. The young girl fixes with her brothers a lack of hands, the man who comes home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas, a young man's depiction whose sole responsibility was as soda, which became the leader of a group of men and was awarded medals for his action. A woman who now has to adapt to the man whose life has been away from her for years. The realization of the people in the security at home ensured the victims these ordinary men made on their behalf. Look into life to love and live with a man without hands. A parent's first appearance and reaction to their son's new deformities. A man used to make decisions about life and death in an instant, and had to return to the path of plodding for a conservative bank loan structure. This is no sympathetic, tear-shaking, heart-strumming action. THIS WAS REAL LIFE! It could not have been portrayed differently. This, my friends, is how it was !! This could easily be considered a documentary. In this day of color film you should not be off black and white because it is one of the finest B / W movies, editing and control you will ever see. The casting was perfect. If I could, I would make it mandatory for anyone who takes history, film making, creative writing, sociology, family counseling or psychology to see and report on this amazing example of the filmmakers' art.
