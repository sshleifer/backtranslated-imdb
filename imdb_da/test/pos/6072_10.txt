In a critical scene, as Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is in the Cave of Swimmers, she writes something out loud by Hana (Juliette Binoche), in which she proclaims that "the light has gone out now and I am writing in the dark ... "A phrase of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematic brilliance of it far from tiring the English patient. With such a dramatic sweep that holds one's feet firmly and a force on the film that doesn't give up, this movie proudly celebrates the mysteries and romances of World War II and takes elements of Casablanca and Lawrence Of Arabia along with some independence in shape of Tuscany. The English patient effortlessly pulls the heartbeats and takes us through a mysterious first act, a romantic second action and a beautiful ... beautiful last action, and it's not "It's just the wonderful pace and setting, it's Ralph Fiennes' performance, that keeps us sympathetic, even though Count Almásy from the beginning turns out to be a thoroughly unlikely character. Usually written as a villain, he shows obsessed but ultimately human colors as a man consumed by a desperate love that he must fulfill. Many will criticize this film based on the so-called "glorification of fakes", but they do not know anything. The contrasts between the two periods (before and after the plane crash seen at the beginning) are spectacular, as the patient is the deplorable man suffering from Because of what he did, the evil that was once in him was absent, while the man before the collapse is an individual like any other. He wants this woman, but he can't have her, Fiennes brings out the human qualities Almásy somehow absolutely no other actor could. It couldn't have been a better actor for the job so please take those comments to heart, watch the movie, those who call it "boring" or "despicable" know nothing and should ashamed of such a one-dimensional perception of the film, a perception that they have neither studied nor corrected, and probably do not plan to correct it. Ever won The Best Picture Oscar, and for so many reasons, hidden in their poetic triumphs.
