This movie seems to have been overlooked by everyone. Someone should bring it out on VHS and DVD. It's an excellent movie and far better than the one with Brooke Shields, which was terrible. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons deserves more credit than she now gets days. It would be nice if all his films were offered on VHS or DVD. Jean Simmons was and still is a very good actress. She was definitely a beauty. In fact, she is still a beauty. She has also done very well on T.V. She is so much better than many of the players today.
