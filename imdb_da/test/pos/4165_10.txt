I want to make this short. It was a pleasure to see. It might or may not have been more effective if the characters had resembled their real life models, but besides this minor observation, I found the fantasy animals the most comfortable. Visuals were most amazing except for the second set of CG scenes that could have been omitted. I don't like computer generated animation anyway, it defeats the purpose of a biopic like this. See it, you will appreciate it too!
