I thought I wasted my precious 50 bucks and went to watch this movie. But at the serious request of my friend, who is a great fan of the Aparna Sen, I decided to look up the movie. Going to this cheap theater really disturbed me because I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theaters in town. Anywasy movie starts and surprisingly I didn't complain. <br /> <br /> A great story and some truly wonderful wonderful plays at Shabana Azmi and Konona Sen Sharma. Shabana Azmi a divorce that has dedicated her life to her mother and sister's sister. Concern Sen Sharma a schizophrenic (save me the spelling) who imagines all the time. Rahul Bose also gives a star performance. The story is that Mithi (Late Sharma) is a schizophrenic, and after getting violently raped at her field job as a reporter, her levels really rise, her fiancé leaves her for the person she stayed. Throughout her world comes down to her. Shabana Azmi, her eldest sister, takes care of her, and Mithi believes in her imagination that she has been married to her fiance, has 5 children, and they stay in 15. Park Avenue (which is really a place in New York) . The reason continues when Mithi becomes suicide when she thinks nobody believes in her, and she is being held in her home by her husband. As fate would have, Mithi and her fiance meet when they're both out on a trip. 11 years after the brutal rape, her fiance has no existence in her real world, she cannot recognize him. Her fiancé, now married and a father of two children, feels it is his duty to correct the wrong he did 11 years earlier, and he promises to take her to Park Avenue. And he does. He takes her to a place in Kolkata, which apparently resembles her husband's home. As Joydeep / Jojo (Rahul Bose) speaks her fiancé on her mobile phone, he loses mithi. Everyone is looking for her, but she is nowhere to be found. She finally gets what was denied her, her family, her own imaginative family in her own world on 15th Park Avenue. <br /> <br /> I must say it touched my heart. I myself am a fan of Aparna Sens's direction. The camera's work is fantastic. And the quality of performance is spelling limitation. Concern Sen Sharma gives a solid performance as the schizophrenic child. Shabana Azmi gives another mind blowing role as divorce eldest sister who has the burden of keeping the family. Rahul Bose, another nice and quiet role (I don't know why this guy doesn't get big breaks, he has so much potential). Finally the Aparna Sen, she still catches the audience, even though she is not in front of the camera and behind it. <br /> <br /> A very well deserved 8/10 ....
