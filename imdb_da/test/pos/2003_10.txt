(Possible spoilers included, but nothing critical given away.) <br /> <br /> I just watched this classic low-budget movie on video and was knocked out of the level of energy on the screen. All the actors make themselves proud, especially John Daniels, to see another of his films. Not only does this movie boast of amazing performances, but controls stylish sequences as when the baron throws someone out of a window, and we see a screen of glass falling into a swimming pool that breaks out of the fall man's impact I love The way slow-motion photography was used in the 70's cinema, dreamy and hypnotic. Cool and witty black dudes radiate large a liners, while slimy seedy lumps of white waste come to unpleasant ends. I love it, my rating 10 / 10. If this ever comes out on DVD, count me for a purchase.
