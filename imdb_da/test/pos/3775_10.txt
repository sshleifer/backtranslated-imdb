I first watched this movie in the early 80's and we used to have it on betamax. As we all know, betamax went the way for 8-pulled tape, sigh, it also had a good picture quality too. Anyways, I'm glad I found this movie again, I've been searching for it for over 10 years! This movie falls under the category of movies like Airplane: running jokes, onliners, fun actions (bodylanguage). Mark Blankfield is absolutely fun. His transformation from the shy Dr. Daniel Jekyll to the sex-crazed partyanimal Mr. Hyde is unforgettable, complete with gold tooth, chest hair and gold chains. The part I loved best was when he hijacked the car from this poor guy and then drove to Mrs. Woo Woo. Absolutely psychedelic experience without medication! If you need laughter therapy, it's the movie to do it. When I first saw it, I had tears in my eyes, and my stomach was hurt all the time laughing. This is a movie I could see again and again. I highly recommend it.
