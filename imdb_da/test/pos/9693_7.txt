This is not the kind of movie that really deserves critical attention. It's not going to win any Oscars - it's really not a very good movie at all. Heck, it's not even a movie - just a string of short obnoxious, widespread sketches stretched together in an attempt to make entertainment. And as much as all the critical bones in my body shout out to give this movie an erroneous score, gosh darn it, I'll give it a much better score. The kind of people who want to enjoy this movie are not the kind of people who really care about what critics have to say, so I will not give a snap critic of Jackass's quality of surreal existentialism that permeates and comments on how our society. ... oh forget it. <br /> <br /> What to say? There is no plot development, no character development - no real beginning - there is a half enjoyable end that is not nearly as fun as the shit that precedes it, and everything in between the range of inappropriate, bathroom humor as junior high kids are laughing at. It is actually quite fun. <br /> <br /> Leave at your doorstep all your predictions about a good movie. Jackass: Number two is just rough crap. It's really all that is. I give the filmmakers this, though they come up with some pretty imaginative things. You will probably crawl several times all the way through, will throw up a couple of times, wiggle and switch uncomfortably, as people on the screen make death and vomiting thoughts. Spy, dandruff, urine, sperm .... virtually all body fluids can be seen in Jackass: number two. There is nudity, sexual humor abounding, and so on and so on. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining. If you are the kind of person who finds these things fun then you will probably really like Jackass: Number Two. I laughed several times. As I said, it's pretty imaginative stuff. I never even wanted to vomit - even though I have a rather strong stomach. Just accept the movie's premise: A bunch of idiotic guys make strange moves to fun. When you get past it, accept it and go with it, you'll enjoy it. The only mistake in the movie is the sheer surplus of all the weird and obnoxious things. There are several very imaginative, very disturbing sketches, but it draws many places as they make them less interesting. At the end, things cease, but in the middle of the film draws the overall film's quality. In a half-hour television show, this is no problem, but with film length celluloid, boredom will inevitably occur at some point. After a while, the brutal dream is just desensitizing. On the other hand, number two is an entertaining, imaginative and above all disgusting comedy that will leave you feeling a sense of pain, nausea and cheerfulness. Go see it if you need to, but hey, if you know you don't like this kind of thing, don't bother. You just get disappointed.
