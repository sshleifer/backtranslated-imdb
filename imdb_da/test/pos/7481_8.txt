I love the premise, but it's replay value is only for certain parts (opening scene of course). Some characters are a bit monstrous, but they are entertaining nonetheless. I think Ballping sh-t push it. I know it was showing that Nick and Casey were living wrong in LA and showing why Casey stopped living, I just think the flashback story could have been better. Also, the Jamaican guy rapper in the phone is smart and entertaining, but once again I think the story was told sloppy. It really seems incredible. In fact, I think Swordfish (the second movie Woods has written) more than some of the parts on Thursday, because the government stops a secret all the time, and has organizations created that the public will never know about. <br /> <br /> Thursday is the best Quentinesque movie I've seen. I think Woods is imaginative, smart and has whites; But his work needs more maturity to get to the Natural Born Killer script (not Stone's movie) level. How old is he anyway?
