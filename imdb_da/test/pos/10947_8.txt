If you go into Twins Effect looking for a pure Hong Kong movie experience, you will be disappointed. This is not to say that it is bad, but it is NOT a traditional Hong Kong action movie that runs at a similar angle to Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. It's determinedly stupid and juvenile, so if you want a good serious action in Hong Kong, look at a John Woo or Yuen Woo Ping movie. This movie has a lot of flags for it's stupidity and I thought the first thing I should do would be to explain what you come in as it is disappointed with many purists. For the non-purists and those with more forgiving tastes, Twins Effect is a lovely silly kung-fu comedy. I liked it a lot for a number of reasons, not least it's wonderful female executives who spark each other in a thoroughly entertaining comedy double act. I think this is the first movie of the type they've been in, but they jump, kick and fly like spicy pros. The patented ridiculous handling is handled with great care and attention, and the film is deliberately written, making much of the movie laugh aloud. The comedy is really the most prominent thing here, and it is a subtle, gentle comedy that relies on words like lifeless objects that go under a la Stephen Chow. It must be said that slapstick is hugely fun too. The sequence of disco-dancing vampires is a total classic. <br /> <br /> The action is a mix of two genres really. It falls between 'period drama' wire-and-sword fighting (which comes in more towards the end) and Jackie Chan's comedy battle style that comes out with a mix that although a small derivative is sometimes always exciting to see and by And to throw up some genuine innovative encounters. <br /> <br /> All this is great and the movie is huge fun all the way through. Despite this, it has a few sticky points. For example, in many ways Twins Effect is much more westernized than kung-fu fans may be accustomed to, the inevitable comparison with the Blade series is certainly sound as an example, although Twins Effect is honestly much better than Leaves ever managed, especially for fighting. Personally, it was also a bit of a shame to see the excellent Anthony Wong (the hissful villain of John Woo's classic Hard Boiled) so underutilized, but the younger audience it is targeting is unlikely to notice this or actually know about Hard Boiled or his other movies, so this is just a personal touch. <br /> <br /> If you see this with an open mind, you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did, but be aware that it's a COMEDY, not a ball for the wall kung-fu movie . Be aware of it and you will be good.
