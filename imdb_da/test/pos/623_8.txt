Superbly made low budget thriller with more turns than you can shake a stick and lots of ghoulish humor along the way too. <br /> <br /> The player plays really well, even though Richard's self-centered film director is a bit difficult to take at times. The little two-stage como of Sir Alec Guinness, which radiates threat like Moscow's criminal czar, is simply the icing on the ice. Worth repeating viewing, but not on dark nights when you are alone!
