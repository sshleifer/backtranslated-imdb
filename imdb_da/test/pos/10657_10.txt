Battleship Potemkin is now the oldest movie I've seen, and it's also the first silent movie I've seen. I heard a lot of good things about this movie, so I got the tape out at home and I saw it. When it ended, I just thought this was a classic masterpiece. The story is based on the real Russian battleship Potemkin. You wouldn't believe it, but some of it was sad and disgusting. Sad to be that the mother dies and the pram rolls down the stairs and disgusting, they have to eat raw meats with stomach crabs in it. Today it is still considered to be one of the best quiet and Russian films ever made. I think everyone should see it (if they can.) You will be surprised at how good it is at the moment. It's a must see classic. 5.5.
