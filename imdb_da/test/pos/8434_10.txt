I wish Hollywood would make more movies like The China Syndrome. Because this one scores on each level. <br /> <br /> It has an intelligent, credible script. It shows you that it is not just nuclear power itself, but the money involved in what causes danger. And the film also gives you a fantastic back-scene look at how television is made. <br /> <br /> It scores like a thriller: The first time I saw it held it right on the edge of my seat. And it scores as a character movie: I really watched the main characters. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas, Wilford Brimley and most of all Jack Lemmon are good.
