I didn't have much faith in the beginning, but as a Costa Rican citizen I can confirm that the film shows the reality we live day by day and shows many things in our culture, like our way of talking, our music, our way to stand up for our rights without fear, without arms. <br /> <br /> I'm really proud of the job they did and how they didn't forget about the movie message they wanted us to receive, not care money but actually work on a short budget so we put appreciate the beautiful scenarios and the great photography. I strongly recommend watching this movie, you won't regret it.
