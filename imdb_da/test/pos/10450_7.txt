I've always seen this movie and I'm glad it's finally available on DVD, so more viewers can see what I've told them all these years. The story is about a high school virgin named Gary (Lawrence Monoson) who works at a pizza place as a birth boy, and he is associated with his friends David (Joe Rubbo) and Rick (Steve Antin). Gary notes Karen (Diane Franklin), who is the new girl in school and one morning he gives her a ride, and at this point he is completely in love. That night at a party he sees Rick with Karen, and now he's jealous of his best friend, but doesn't tell anyone about his true feelings. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Rick asks Gary if he can borrow his grandmothers vacant homes, but Gary makes an excuse, so Rick doesn't can get Karen alone. But one night Rick shouts to Gary that he nailed her to the football field and Gary gets furious. A few days later in the school library, Gary sees Rick and Karen and he asks Karen what is wrong. She tells him she is pregnant and that Rick has dumped her. Gary helps her take her to his grandmothers home and pay for her abortion. Finally, Gary Karen tells how he really feels about her, and she seems receptive to her feelings, but later she joins Karen and Rick together at a birthday party. Gary runs off without the girl! This movie ends with a much more realistic version of how life really is. No matter how nice you are, you don't necessarily get the girl. <br /> <br /> This movie was directed by Boaz Davidson, who would continue to be a rather competent action movie director, and he did two things right with this movie. First, he made sure that there was plenty of free nudity so that it could be translated into the young men who usually go to these movies. Second, he had the film ending with young Gary without Karen, and I think the men in the audience can relate to being screwed over, no matter how hard you try to win a girl's heart. Yes, this movie is silly and useful, but it's fun and sexy. Actor Louisa Moritz almost steals the movie as the sexy Carmela. Moritz was always a popular "B" level actress and you may remember her in "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest". Like the "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", this has a very good soundtrack and the songs being played reflect what is happening in history. But the core of this movie is two very good performances by Monoson and Franklin. There is key required by Franklin, but she still produces the grief of a young girl who is being dumped at a crucial time. She has always been a good actress and her natural charm is very clear in this movie. But it's still Monosons history, and you can't help feeling this guy. When the movie ends, it's his performance that stays with you. It's a solid work of acting that makes this more than just a teenage comedy. Even with the stupid scenarios for teenagers trying to get sex, this movie still manages to achieve what it wants. Underrated comedy hits bullseye.
