Nazarene of the recognized surrealist Bunuel is undoubtedly an attack on the Catholic Church and its loss of values. It's not a visual movie, and I think it would have played better on stage. Bunuel takes us through this man, the Nazarene, who lives as Christ lived; a true follower, ie. in poverty and without care for property and what the next day brings. Some may call it a parallel to the history of Christ, but any follower and practitioner of the word life must be like Christ in a way. But in reality, Bunuel also asks into the egoism of humanity and needs to sin and where goodness can save us all. It is a bold statement to do what can be experienced or recite to memory the movie to some. Truth be told The Nazarene is also selfish because he gives without having to return or ask for it. His egoism is his stupidity, and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coin, with the same face on each side. Many people represent sides of a coin in this movie, all with both faces the same. But the film is not as memorable as it ends and you can attack many of its ethical perforations and effusions within the film's own teachings. Not unique Bunuel, but a "surreal" dream sequence that bunuel steps in which the film's message is framed and worth noting it shows you the director's, Bunuel's ability.
