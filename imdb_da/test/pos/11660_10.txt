One of the best ever. Direction, photography, an exciting and dramatic story, wonderful soundtrack and most of all, the incredible credibility of Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn, the best and most underrated "under 40 generation" actor. After watching this movie, I believe if there is anyone who could have no doubt about giving death to another man, despite the ugly things he could have done?
