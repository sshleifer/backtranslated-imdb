'Heaven's Gate' is not a masterpiece that apparently was what it was necessary to be at first release to justify its great prize, and more importantly, the continuing uneasy dependence on Hollywood on the author's film making model. Still, "Heaven's Gate", which today is seen on DVD in a cut of 229 minutes, is a fantastic movie. It's a touch dull in pace. But at least it's the pace. Quite apart from the lack of construction that marks many films today, there have been many films that have been deliberately damaged in form by being hacked down without paying attention to the rhythm, so that the films become formless and confusing. Besides this, the criticism leveled on the film has been sought after quite lame. If the good guys and bad guys are also obviously out for a serious movie, and yes, Sam Waterston's mustachioede, fur-covered villain is the comic opera (and not the flat-level way of Bill The Butcher from 'Gangs of New York'), and yes, the urban population seems to be a touch of 'Fiddler On The Roof' on some occasions, so have made a few dozen serious films since then, including the 'Titanic' and the graceless 'Cold Mountain' (which carries certain similarities and is A remarkable failure in convincing qualities in relation to this film) can be cast for the very same reason. <br /> <br /> Despite accusations, the film has a plot, a very well-crafted plot on it. It simply does not bow to the standard form's "epic" quality by giving Titan heroes, fleets of subplots and confusion. It is experimenting in a way more like much smaller, modest films, by carefully captured moments of character interaction and well-structured burst explosions of common action, as with the opening at Harvard, and most notably the wonderful scene where the Johnson County people who are looking for a brilliant physical fiddler, celebrating on roller skates. <br /> <br /> "The Deer Hunter" was a critical and commercial success, but left the first half of inspired mosaics as the accumulation of details, and I believe in a way similar to criticism of Robert Penn Warren's novel "All The King's Men 'and its dictionary on Jacobean stunts, if Cimino had not so much understood the conventions of Hollywood epic, he could have made a particularly rare work of art based on honest visualization of people within their environment. In contrast, 'Heaven's Gate' manages to turn its narrative momentum and excitement upward in a slowly growing arc until the final explodes while not leaving the mosaic method. The central romantic triangle, for example, resists standard bends; A decent, intelligent but mentally defeated man, James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) is competing with a hot-shot but identity-challenged young rifle Nate Champion (Christopher Walken) at the hand of a young Madame, Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert); there is no self-confident bed-jump, no blow to the face, recriminations or typical sad-behind-moments, but more a sad and distant decision of Ella to choose the younger man whom she loves less because he is ready to make obligation. Ella emerges as the movie's true hero (Huppert's performance, although initially awkward, is really quite outstanding, balances a deep emotion with a hard-hammed spirit), first trying to save Nate and then pattern immigrant resistance in an entertaining defense. Subsequently, Averill is put into action as friends die. In fact, in the process of overcoming so many traps of clich√© and style, "Heaven's Gate" casts successfully and deliberately the depleted alien's heroes in so many 70's Westerners, depicting any, powerful, cheer-the-heroes rallying to a compromised but still relished victory. <br /> <br /> Finally, the social conflict in so many 70's Westerns is raging in a complete war; where capital tries to crush a final victory over the miscreants standing in the way, they suddenly find a mass and more powerful people's army led by the man who played the thoroughly destroyed Billy the Kid a decade before. That is what led to the film being described as the first Marxist Western, but really it just blossoms a theme of the genre that exists just before the 60s. Such different and classic old-school acts as William Wyler's 'The Westerner' and even 'Shane', horrible similar stories tell. It is simply here that the romantic myth of gunslings has been replaced by the romantic myth of people's rebellion. In a spectacular, exciting but realistic and thus chaotic finale, the marauding Cattlemen's camp is attacked, ringed by dust shoots marked by fallen horses, twisting bodies and gun fire. Averill puts her classical education at work eventually by stealing a Roman trick and bringing the cattleman to the brink of extinction before being rescued by the cavalry (another distinct seditious touch, but certainly not as offensive after 'Little Big Man's unrelenting portrayal of Native American massacres). It is really hard to think of a more heroic American vision of grassroots resistance. The film's only real dead spot is like an unnecessary coda, indicating Averill's possible relapse, a pretty potty piece of tragedy. <br /> <br /> Despite some flaws and a tedious part, 'Heaven's Gate' is an ultimate piece of work, a genuine attempt to create a modern Western and a new kind of epic. If you still have to be part of the choir that expects Cimino to be absurd in its behavior on sets and expenses, it is regrettable. When today flops like 'The Pluto Nash' and 'K-19 - The Widowmaker' adventures, nearly a hundred million dollars are sinking into drains, yet a bit of infamy is hanging on this movie, thinking of exactly what is ugly death meant. The attempt at original style, the poor sexuality, the very hard-hitting feeling of detail, the magnificent rigor of the film production and what is being filmed contrasts with what is lacking in so much modern Hollywood product.
