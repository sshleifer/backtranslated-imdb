I own a video store with hundreds of documentaries. I've seen lots of them and love all the great info out there. Only a small handful even comes close to offering information as important as this one. I have read through other people's reviews of this film and cannot help but notice that the most important things people criticize are irrelevant. Such as "It is very one-sided". Such a pathetic criticism, where in the society you see, you see the other side and if you still need help, go to globalpublicmedia.com. "It's the same people over and over again". Uh, one can make it believe that these people are the experts, so maybe they are the best people to interview. "Movie music is the same, headshot with few exceptions." If you want flash and glare, look at Micheal Moore if you want an info, see real documents like this. As you can clearly see, none of these complaints are relevant to the information contained. My guess is that these people just lack the point and won't give up there SUVs. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: See it. Learn from it and continue your education on such topics. These are very important things for everyone.
