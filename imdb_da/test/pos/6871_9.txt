Then one night on Tom Snyder's "Tomorrow" show, I saw Tom asking his guest Henry Morgan what he considered "perfect". Morgan replied, "Everything with Glenda Jackson." And even though I wouldn't consider this movie to be perfect, it bears it well. I was using the Hollywood clich√© not to make pictures like this anymore, but then I just saw "Up in the Air", another intelligent movie about 2 people over 35 who falls in love. However, it is where the similarities end. "House Calls" is just fun to see 2 pros like Matthau and Jackson knocked it off and seems quite natural while they are on it. I watched this movie in the theater in 1978 (in the mature age of 18) and it took me another 20 years to get all the jokes. Any movie that can make strokes out of the 1920s tennis-great Bill Tilden and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain would not play too well on the megaplex these days. Another thought: The original theatrical release highlighted a 'walk on the beach / in love' montage set to The Beatles / George Harrison tune, "Something." It seemed a little forced at that time, but that song has since been replaced by a rather generic Henry Mancini music cue for subsequent home video and cable release. Too bad, because that scene is just there, another victim of music licensing hell.
