This little girl reminiscent of several other films, but manages to keep her own style and mood. "Troll" & "Don't be afraid of darkness" come to mind. The tension builders were good and just crossed the line from G to PG. I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; In other films, I could predict the dialogue properly, but the writing in this movie made better choices. If you want a movie that is not gross but gives you some chills, this is a good choice.
