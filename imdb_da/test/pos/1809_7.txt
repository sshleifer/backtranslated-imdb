This typical teenagers movie is one of the best alongside the story is good, the music is well accompanied by the movie all the time. <br /> <br /> Although I don't enjoy classic movies, unless it's classic and better written, this one is outstanding. Perhaps the hairstyle and language should change a little, in the 80s I think that offensive language is still rarely heard. <br /> <br />
