A very interesting plot of the movie based on the short story "Waltz into Darkness" by the author Cornell Woolrich. It's a drama rather than a movie noir trying to send a message that love changes your own life, ie. your love for every person and the love you received from him / her. A wealthy man really changed his life for love while his partner finally realized that he was the only one who loved her. Belmondo played well as usual, while a somewhat young Michel Bouquet played his eternal role as a detective or police force. Frankly Bouquet was not that impressive in this movie, but less than it was Catherine Deneuve's performance. She was not as convincing in her role as a prostitute then lover / wife of Louis Mah√© (Belmondo). For those who like to visit the world, the film gives rise to seeing part of the Ascension Island and also the Lyon city in France.
