This movie is a fascinating drama about Making of a movie. The actor and the actor cannot really stand each other, but we build up a scene where they must have sex - for the first time, per script. The actor shows little emotion on or without the camera in the plot, except that she freezes in the early stages of a beach. The actor is self-absorbed and threatens in the direction of the director, Jeanne. I couldn't help pulling into the drama of 'how are these two going to their way through a sex scene?' The drama itself becomes more exciting than the actual nudity and foreplay made for the cameras. Not that Roxane Mesquida is not lovely and worth seeing naked! However, there is a beautiful young scene hand that goes through a few scenes as extra. I think it is her on the far left of one of the pictures (2 out of 9) here in IMDb. I don't even know if this girl is credited but when she passes by (fully dressed of course) in confidence in indifference with her short blonde hair - she's sexy! WHO IS THIS GIRL ???
