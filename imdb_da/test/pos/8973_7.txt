Now we certainly saw and I and many other people actually expected worse. It also had some good parts that I hadn't expected, it still managed in other areas. <br /> <br /> First, the play was above average. I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman in this movie and I liked Tom Hanks. Hoffman was the glue to this movie. If it wasn't for him, this movie would have crumbled and hit the bottom. His performance was by no means amazing, but absolutely necessary. He gave a good witty, cynical performance in what most other actors could easily have done in a clich√©. Tom Hanks really gave a nice loose performance and did not disappoint, but he certainly did not impress. What I couldn't stand was that Julia Roberts was involved in this movie. She was so big of a miscast that I have ever seen. For one, she is a bad actress, at least to me, she was young for her character and had to fall for the character she played. The management was average for me. I'm not really a big fan of the recent Mike Nichols movies, nor am I impressed by this one. It was made with such a Hollywoodish, cartoonish touch hat I couldn't stand. The worst part about it was that he was trying to make it a truly meaningful movie at the end. I love meaningful movies, but not when a movie tries to rush a scene or two at the end and show something that tries to justify the rest of the garbage throughout the movie. That's something Mike Nichols has seemed to have done a lot in his latest track record. The one impressive part of this movie was the writing. The dialogue was composed very well and was able to let the story play out. The script was what was able to really take this movie to an above-average level. In so many scenes I found myself partially writing. <br /> <br /> Well, that's some of what we saw the least. Many of the scenes were good in the movie if you get what I mean, but not much else than that. I liked that this movie didn't glorify everything America had done. It is obvious that throughout this war in Afghanistan, the United States gave weapons to the people who are now against us. This movie kind of show, we are also guilty of it. This shows that what may seem good in the short term may prove to be somewhat horrible in the future. This movie had a good original message, but it just didn't deliver it right. Overall it was entertaining.
