I don't know where this movie was shot, but because it was shot on the spot, it has the authenticity that this story deserves. It is the story of a young English woman captured by Japanese in South Asia at the beginning of 2. World War II, together with a group of other English women. There is no prison camp for women, so they are forced to march for months from place to place because the Japanese do not know what to do with them. The maturity and resilience of the English women, and the Australian soldier trying to help them, are at the heart of the film. This movie is very long, maybe 10 hours, so you can watch it as shown on PBS as a series that actually adds to the feeling of the endless journey this woman does from England, across this remote island and finally to Australia . History, filmography, location and actors combine to make this a movie that should not be missed. My only question is why this has not been released on DVD!
