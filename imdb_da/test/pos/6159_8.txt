Engaging entry from Europe on Czech fighter pilots flying to the RAF during World War II. It is always interesting as American to see a new view of well-known events in history. There is nothing terribly original or revolutionary about the style where this is filmed or the romantic love triangle that anchors the narrative. Yet it is convincing all the way through. There is a good balance between drama, romance, humor, action and symbolism, which is beautifully underestimated by the director and cast. This is a breath of fresh air after sitting through the bleak and boring Hollywood epic as "Pearl Harbor". A solid production around. This is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema.
