I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then, but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie "Mighty Joe Young." What attracted me to the "Wagon Master" was the great songs sung by "The Pioneer's sons". Merian C. Cooper, who produced the film, was the first to order original music to fit the mood of a particular scene and thus created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong. Steiner would later win an Oscar for the theme "Gone With the Wind." Cooper was also the producer of "Mighty Joe Young." If you remember, music was important to the big monkey, who would only respond to the sound of Stephan Foster's "Beautiful Dreamer". In 1947, Cooper would partner with John Ford, who instructed the "Wagon Master." Of all of Ford's famous western countries, this is a favorite of mine that includes his brother Francis and a sullen Janes Arness.
