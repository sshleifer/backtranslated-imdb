I only gave these nine stars instead of ten, because I really do not approve of pornography so much. Pornography has a useful purpose in society (can't say I can always think of one), but it does. Personal views set aside, I really thought this movie was pretty fun. I did not buy this movie because it was pornography I bought it because I am one of the 'Alice' obsessives who want to see something about 'Alice in Wonderland'. I own almost every version that is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this. I must admit that I was scandalized beyond my expectations and it would have been thoroughly offensive if it hadn't been so damn fun. Moreover, the music is really good and I like musicals. <br /> <br /> Not everyone can make a good music musical. anyone who has seen 'The First Nudie Musical' knows what a stink bomb was. Considering what a low budget Bill Osco was working on, 'Alice' is quite remarkable as a musical (it's better than some musicals made on expensive budgets). <br /> <br /> The movie cannot completely escape porno dirt. I usually watch the XXX version for full shock effect, and some of these scenes are scandalizing (scandalizing because we're talking about Lewis Carroll). I felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed by the scene where 'Alice' (Kristine DeBell) begins to masturbate. It made me feel like a voyeur. and the free-sex lesbian scenes with 'Alice' and the kitty cats were a bit too racial. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great sense of humor about everything. There is a particularly fun moment during the Queen's orgy when one of the actresses stands up and says "who am I going to get out of this movie?" Hilarious. I'm not sure I buy the whole sexy, is good for you. Ball your brains out philosophy here, but sex is human and no human being disgusts me. (I don't know if I really feel that way, but I couldn't resist saying that) Some people think everything should be about sex. I do not know. Jeez, just show something frick'in responsibility and decorum. This movie defines absolute points for the sexually-minded, but I wouldn't push your luck the next time you might really get someone to choke. I think we are dealing with children's literature here.
