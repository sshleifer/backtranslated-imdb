Peter Lorre was born to play Stephen Danel with lines like: "Mr. Smith, you shouldn't keep my wife that way." and "I told you not to keep the monkey in the house!" The poster for this movie is a cruel green and Peter Lorre is learning on the road that will never go to his penitentiary / island. This movie is not available on DVD, although it is a classic and very rarely shown on TV. What is the relationship between Stephen Danel and the monkey? Why does the monkey disturb him so much. We never know. The movie must be colored by someone and the excerpts must be made in a Kinks video. The film was re-released in the 1950s, and only a few of the Peter Lorre biographies use any text on this movie. Casablanca was just around the corner. Bogart could have been on the island, but they probably had no budget for him
