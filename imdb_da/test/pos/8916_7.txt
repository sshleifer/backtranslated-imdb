If you are looking for an erotic masterpiece, this is not the case. If you are looking for a comic masterpiece, this is not the case. If you're looking for some hardcore, it's not. <br /> <br /> Saying an example of the art of European erotic comedy from the early mid-1970s, it is. <br /> <br /> I see many people complain about the quality, understand it was made in 1974. Yes the women are not in line with the modern ideal of attraction. They are not ugly women at all, but they do not have the same look that is idealized in our silicone culture. Yes, the duplication is not great, but they speak German, and anyone who speaks any German will realize that copying a word with 12 syllables is rather difficult. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the DVD before the latest release it is marketed with 2 covers in the 80s and recently 90s adult stars. The movie is an R-movie, so those who complain about hardcore should have understood this, the movie was edited from the original, but it was also edited before it ran in the drive-in at the end of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie as a young man and judging by some comments, many in the same boat got a glimpse at Cinemax. Many people become disturbed when they later live up to their previous memories. It is understandable given the reality and the nakedness wrapped in today's eroticism. <br /> <br /> Comparing 2069 with a modern soft-core erotic comedy, you may be disappointed. The movie while outlandish is actually quite fluid, and the jokes, while generally induendos and double meanings still cease and still can provide a chuckle. If you compare it to a hardcore movie, you will be further disappointed compared to today you see very little. It is still one of the best examples of the 1970s Bottoms Up and The Other Cinderella of European Erotic / Comedic Cinema.
