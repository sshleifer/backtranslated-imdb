I did not know what to expect from this very popular (and hilarious) Swedish comedy and satire team when they released their first feature film. More wide satire? Now we get four contemporary, extraordinarily memorable stories about family pain, especially generation gaps and paternity. But it is drama, fortunately, and what drama! Epic in its scope, as each episode is from carefully picked, geographically diverse parts of Sweden. But each story can seriously carry a whole movie if it is expanded separately. <br /> <br /> It's dark, twisted, harrowing, yet massively entertaining and breathtakingly accomplished. Script, acting and filmography are absolutely world-class, as three hours seem to come by! There are four shades of mastery, and one of the best films in the cinema history of the nations. It is Sweden's answer to "Short Cut" or "Magnolia" if you want, and immediately like them! 9 out of 10 from Ozjeppe
