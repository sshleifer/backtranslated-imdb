SCREAM's success resulted in a brand new horror flicks wave. I'm happy about it as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of the new horror movies. BOC is a huge package of horror. Colorful, fast and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) as it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted film about couples. We have the cute young lovers as opposed to killing crazy dolls. Very inventive!
