This is probably one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. It has action, but not this ball-flying, good guys - villains, van ponds - stallone action, but quick, realistic and nervous action, it has a plot because until the end of the movie you do not know how this will end, it has characters, helpan quinn, donald sutherland and ben kingsley are just perfect, and it is exciting, this movie just won't let you go until you've seen the end of it. <br /> <br /> Although there are few signs, I have no difficulty keeping my attention on history, and for history it is basic (not too clancy-difficult, but simple and raw) and realistic. <br /> <br /> If you are in a movie with a good story, some action and great plays, see this and I promise you won't go away until you've seen the end of it. The whole end of it.
