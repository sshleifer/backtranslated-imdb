The "Best In Show" follows the stories of a handful of human participants as they prepare for one of the biggest dog shows in the calendar. Any amateur psychologist would say that unconditional love and obsession with a pet is a sign of something missing from one's life, and each of the characters somehow fills this clich√©. There is the former High School Hottie who is now married to a geeky man, the childless, label-occupied yuppie couple, the lonely outdoor man, the young wife of a wealthy old codger (along with her short-haired dog trainer) and the gay couple. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie fun, but the way it shows is these stereotypes in a completely credible way - almost loving, in many cases. Every ridiculous thing that one of the characters says or says - with their dog as innocent Easter - seems like the kind of behavior you would totally expect to see in a dog show. The biggest laugh comes from the comment team in an American style sports advertiser, comparing moments in a dog show to parts of a baseball game and his English, dog academic, foil. The geeky man's attempt as his blonde wife meets with an amazing number of men from her past is also always good for a chuckle, as does the yuppie's demented behavior when pressure builds, while their dog remains completely immaculate. <br /> <br /> Well worth seeing - though cats are more your bag.
