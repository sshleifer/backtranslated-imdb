Dear Readers, 2001: A Space Odyssey is Kubrick at its best ... although I really can't say that Space Odyssey is his only movie I've ever seen. But it's still a good movie. Strange but good. The film is in three actions, like the short story ... which is surprising since the author wrote the script. In any case, we first start with the simple but spectacular opening with also the Sparach Zarathustra blaring on the speakers. Then it comes boring beyond the 'Dawn of Man' sequence. Then there is the odd 'Finding of the Monolith' sequence on the Moon, played for Strauss Blue Danube. Finally, it is good with spaceships scenes and HAL goes into trouble and kills people. Then things die down and we have the 'Entering the Monolith' sequence which was way too long and the ultra-like end. Although 2001: A Space Odyssey is a good movie. It's not Star Wars, Stargate, Terminator or The Abyss, but it cuts. My compliments to the chef, Mr. Kubrick. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
