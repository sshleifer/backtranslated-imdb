The third film in a cycle of unparalleled glorious film and the third masterpiece in a row, "Joshuu Sasori: Kemono-beya" aka. "Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable" (aka. "Sasori: The Living Animal" where I live) in 1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some aspects, but it is similar (or perhaps surpasses them) in flash. The entire original Sasori series with the wonderful Meiko Kaji stands out as the absolute highlight of the WIP cinema, and all the films, especially the first three, combine unique Utilization and Kunsthus cinema as no other movie does. "Beast Stable" is the third and penultimate "Sasori" movie with Meiko Kaji, the last to director Shunya Ito and in my opinion the greatest of them all. The first movie "Joshuu 701-gô: Sasori" from 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of Exploitation cinema and simply Definition of Exploitation-Art. In the equally brilliant first successor, Joshuu added Sasori: Dai-41 zakkyo-bô "Ito more surrealism and symbolism. and have even more social criticism than its predecessors. Topics such as poverty, forced prostitution, and exploitation of the poor are key issues in the film. <br /> <br /> This third "Sasori" movie is brilliant and sublime in all aspects and undoubtedly the largest of the generally brilliant cycle (for me this is the one with the first as a close second.) Once again, "Best Stable" is both very artistic and very exploitative. The visually stunning movie has a huge amount of brutal violence And sleaze again, as well as sequences of tremendous surrealistic beauty, the astonishingly beautiful Meiko Kaji is once again brilliant in his role as Nami Matsushima (aka. Sasori) .I absolutely adore this wonderful actress and I'm sure that I'm not the only one who does it. The rest of the show is also great, especially Mikio Narita is great as a police officer obsessed with catching Sasori. The musical score is the same in all three films, with "Urami-Bushi", which Meiko Kaji himself sang as the main theme, which is great as the point is simply set, pure perfection. As its predecessors, "Beast Stable" is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of Exploitation-Art, which no serious film teacher can afford to miss. The whole Sasori bike is high on my personal favorite list. "Beast Stable" is undoubtedly the most amazing masterpiece of them all! 10.10
