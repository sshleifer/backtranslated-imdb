Soderbergh is a fabulous instructor, but nothing he could defy could beat the amazing throw he gathered for this object of successors. He clearly knew that he came from get-go. The term "star-vehicle" has traditionally been used to refer to a film that builds around a star. What this movie does is just a whole bunch of Hollywood hot shots and make them shine even brighter than before. The last scene says it all - all the stars have nothing to do and nothing is said. We're just going to see them socialize as if it were a reality show scene where George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Don Cheadle just hang out that they are. So the story is not at all important - at least it is not here the film's greatest pleasures come from. If you want a smart heist movie, rather stick to 11. But if star-gazing turns you on, it will make your day.
