This 3-hour epic (seems much shorter) explores the will of power and conquest and the conflicting motives underlying that quest by tracking two parallel lives: the emperor Q'in, whose desire to unite the Chinese feudal states has its basis in noble goals but is aimed at violent repression, isolation and ultimate powerlessness; and the killer Jing ke, a mercenary killer who will recognize the unintended consequences of murder and find some form of salvation. As with all the great art, this can be understood on many levels. The film evoked images and ideas from Homer, Euripides, Machiavelli, Shakespeare and Freud. <br /> <br /> The story itself is true (I check it out at britannica.com!), so this movie will appeal to history buffs. It is ironic that Q'in spent much of his last years in a vain search for immortality (not shown on the screen but in accordance with the plot). <br /> <br /> The film can also be seen as an allegorium of Maoism and the Cultural Revolution. Through the film, one can understand that the past 50 years of Chinese history have had their precedent in the last 3000. Fortunately for the audience, these complex ideas are developed in a film rich in images, action and pageant. The fights alone are worth the price of admission.
