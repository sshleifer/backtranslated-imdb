I avoided this movie as a boy because I thought it would be boring, no fighting or shooting, police, robbers, cowboys or Indians. It was definitely not a cool movie to like. So I didn't see TRC until I was in my twenties and found it one of the most beautiful, captivating movies I've seen. All the actors deliver the characterization perfectly, and each feeling is drawn from the viewer scene after stage. The recording and direction is misleadingly simple, but feels so natural and pulled me all the way into the story. My two favorite scenes are Bobbies birthday party and the stage on the station's platform at the end, aimed and perfected to perfection. The quality and formulation of Jenny Aguters voice when she calls, "Daddy! My Dad!" wrenches feelings from the viewer Tears roar in my eyes as I think about it. <br /> <br /> This adaptation is not just a movie, it is a piece of valuable art, but also the perfect example of what all filmmakers Must be striving to achieve the creation of an emotional experience.
