When the war did not go well for the Soviet Union, Stalin accepted volunteers from the prisons and used the prisoners as shock troops. This is the story of such a battalion. There are small waves, political prisoners, soldiers kicked out of other units, gray-haired veterans from the white army, plus some dangerous criminals. They are thrown into battle, insufficient, uneducated, and facing the threat of NKVD if they show signs of cowardice or failure. <br /> <br /> The special effects are rudimentary, and many of the small characters are one-dimensional, but the overall story is very human and runny. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen a version with subtitles or duplicates. Viewing the show requires liberal use of the pause button and explanations from a native Russian.
