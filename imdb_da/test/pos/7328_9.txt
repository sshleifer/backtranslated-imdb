I can't say this movie deserves ten because I would lie. I loved this movie when I saw it! It carries the unique bond of a friendship between a teenager and a dolphin. While it doesn't show the sweetness that Jesse and Willy had in Free Willy, it gives an exciting movie that the whole family will enjoy! If you love marine animals or if you just love a perfect family movie, this movie is for you! Flippers definitely show us how the sweet dolphins are and they are playful and could easily be pets if everyone had a large enough pool! I love whales and dolphins, so of course this movie works for me. I think the producers should have chosen another shark instead of the hammerhead to improve the antagonist part of the story. Maybe a big white one? FLIPPER IS MAGNIFICENT! So check it out!
