Got the chance to see this at a friend's house today and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. Not that it has ever bothered me since I love low budget sci-fi like Dr Who, Blake's 7 and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland wasn't a big budget affair, so even though money helps, it takes more than throwing money on things to make them good. The story is easy in the beginning with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and they have to land on the nearest planet. They then discover that the prisoner has done so too, he is a hard-to-know case, and that's just the start of their trouble. The effects, apart from firearms, are minimalist and add to the movie without overwhelming it. Computer effects look a little silly at times, but serve their purpose well and add to the story, lending a futuristic sense of procedure. Movies like me, Robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being pretty much over substance and substituting special effects for a plot that too many of Hollywood's offerings. <br /> <br /> While none of the actors get Oscar material, it's tightly scripted and shot, and in an hour and ten minutes it's not welcome. The characters do not get much fuss, but they did not do in the Predator, as it looks like in the feeling. Grandpa Mike Mitchell is a good stand for Arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn. Some people may be annoyed by lack of explanation towards the end, but I like it. Unlike many movies and shows that leave things inexplicable, it is not so unclear that you cannot handle it at all, and I would like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is further explored. <br /> A small movie from an entertaining team made on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour. If this is what they can do on a shoestring, I would like to see what they would do with a little more money, and hope the film industry and the talented armchair critics do not knock out all of their creativity first. /> <br /> Recommended.
