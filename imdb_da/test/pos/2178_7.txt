This film was certainly not very sophisticated. No, humor was actually stupid now when I think about it. But while I think about it, I laughed that it turns out that decent comedy doesn't have to be very deep. Fatty Arbuckle is the decisive star of this short, despite the fact that Buster Keaton has appeared in movies as well. He is the butcher in an old-fashioned grocery store. There were many stupid things in the store, and I think I laughed most about the coffee grinder sequence - you just have to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> Anyway later, Fatty's boyfriend is forced to go to a girls school and because he can't stand, he dresses in a row and infiltrates the school. Arbuckle is a nasty woman! So, for stupid and unsophisticated fun, watch this movie. It will not change your life and is a very small picture, but it is also fun.
