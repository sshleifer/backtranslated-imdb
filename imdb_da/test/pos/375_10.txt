When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, it was a harbinger for the majority of the film that became public that he was back on top of his form. From 1946 to 1950, his films were not box office successes, and his contractual agreement with David O. Selznick ended because of this. In fact, he made some really good movies during the period, such as. NOTE, SPELLBOUND, UNDER CAPRICORN, ROPE, and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. But while NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND were wanted, the audience was rejected by Hitch's attempt at trial: his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable as it was among psychiatrists. But the long-time experiment in the ROPE confused the public (ignoring the film's merits), and Hitches' willingness to get the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback did not suffer - much more disliked to be - in STAGESTRUCK. A question of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released, like the scandal of the star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) made it seem a mistake (as it was not). PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that really suffered in that favor. <br /> <br /> With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, Hitchcock shot away from the special tricks that interest him in recent movies. Instead, he concentrated on his favorite voices with shared guilt and wrong identity. Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, the story of how Guy Haines, a professional tennis player, meets a fan of his - Bruno Anthony, is a playboy - traveling on a cross-country train at the same time as the athlete. Bruno is talkative and fawning, and Guy sees him as one of the typical fans he has met ... if he is a little eccentric, with his talk of being on the first rocket to outer space. But Bruno knows all about Guy's personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam and is in love with Anne Morton, a senator's daughter. Bruno knows that Miriam will not divorce her successful celebrity man. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his grandfather, who constantly criticizes him. Then Bruno (a kind of cuff) mentions an idea he has about two men - technically strangers - exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect, inseparable crimes instead of fumbling them. Guy listens to the idea - and agrees that is an interesting idea. The train reaches Guy's destination and his last comment is as a validation of the idea. He just doesn't understand that the "eccentric" Bruno is a sociopath, and believes Guy has just agreed on the two who kill each other's enemy! It's a wonderfully simple plot indeed. Bruno, of course, kills Miriam, but he fully expects Guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his grandfather. Guy is horrified - and worse, he thinks he's the police officer's number one suspicion. When, in order to encourage Guy, mention that he has the latter's lighter (he slammed it on the train) and can plant it at the murder scene, Guy finds himself in deeper trouble - how to avoid the police and how to control (if possible) it insane Bruno? <br /> <br /> Hitch has always carefully planned the shots of his films, so from the start we both see our "heroes" from their feet heading towards their fateful train train. There are constant cross contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn in each other's paths. It is like fate drawing them together. Yet both have their own personality - and Hitch, with a typical twist, actually makes the evil Bruno more of an attractive figure. His scheme can be vicious (it will kill two people if successful, and he will make Guy live up to the deal no matter what) but he has a lifestyle. A suspicion that when a guy also had one, but his marriage's failure, along with his now dating a socially prominent woman, has made him more careful and boring than he was. The throw is also good. Robert Walker probably had his finest role in this movie (just a year before his death). It was far from the homespun boy next door when you were away or clock. His lithe figure also looked pretty elegant in stories in several scenes. As Guy Farley Granger acts as a cousin of his killer in ROPE, especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious of the authorities (since his former role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicious of Jimmy Stewart). As for the ladies, Kasie Rogers is exactly like Miriam - which allows the audience to be prepared for her death (in a famous order shot in reflections of her glasses), so they actually cheering Bruno in his evil act. Patricia Hitchcock appears as the younger sister of Anne (Ruth Roman), who has a similar resemblance to Miriam, and by a social attack interrupts Bruno. She plays this rare role well. Ruth Roman strongly supports Granger, but her role is limiting because she is establishing in her background and somewhat low key figures. Other supporting artists, Leo G. Caroll as senator, Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) such as Bruno's dotty mother and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from Walker, are all advantageously expelled - all on a master's hand.
