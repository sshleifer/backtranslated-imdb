I think is a great and a very funny movie. The story is so fun. The daughter Nicole brings her father Andre in some very embarrassing situations. In an attempt to impress the dream boy, the daughter tells her her father is her boyfriend. You just have to see !! Heigl is lovely as Nicole, maybe too lovely; I'm not sure why she should lie to hug someone? Gerard Depardieu Acts very big in this comedy film, he is so funny to see. If you like comedy and romantic movies, just watch this !!! I think you can watch this movie many times and you will still have a good laugh. <br /> <br /> In an effort to impress the boys' dreams, the girl dreams that her father is her lover.
