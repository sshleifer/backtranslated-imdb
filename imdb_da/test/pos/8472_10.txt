Ray is one of those movies that pauses you. You are actually thinking about what you have heard or are thinking about what you are reading about this man and it does not even come close. During my first screening of Ray, I forgot that I saw a movie, I felt like a serene empty, looking at this man's life through a window. This movie is so compelling, it pulls you in and it involves your every emotion you go through an emotional roller coaster ride, and when it is over you, you won't do it again as soon as it has the kind of emotional stroke that others movie missing. Jamie Foxx deserved his Oscar and rightly so, his performance is spectacular, and it should be kept up to the standard for anyone who wants to make a bio pic anytime soon. This movie is as good as it is the subject of, both deserving the titles classic and legend.
