This film from the well-known Czech director and author's collaborator Petr Jarchovský is remarkable for his special, but annoying and distracting detail. With its theme and title from a Robert Graves poem, it's about a woman with more men and some unpleasant relatives in her life trying to survive and protect her two children, the 15-year-old Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and little blond asthmatic Cuba (Adam Misik). The poem is much in evidence, but the theme - it gets a little lost. Marcela (Anna Geislerová), Beauty and Jarda (Roman Luknár) has lost everything in the Prague floods in 2002 and has nothing left, it seems, but good sex as they go on with such revenge in their small occasion that Lucina and Cuba, in front of the telly, must keep their ears against the noise. Honey bees enjoy such explicit and skating on the edge of embarrassment or shock. There is no good explanation precisely why, but economic desperation has caused Jarda to treat stolen cars in the large garage adjacent to his flatlet. His car thief cohort runs out of a posh Volvo, the unpleasant Benes (Josef Abrham) has left the keys in the ignition while visiting a large estate he owns. Benes is a super nice guy, but not fooled. His Volvo is led to track by satellite in cases like this, and it leads the leaders directly to Jardas garage, and he and his cohorts are in jail. <br /> <br /> "Beauty in trouble flies to the good angel on whom she can rely," Graves poem begins. But in reality, this fracas leads Benes to Marcela when he meets her at the police station. He introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and stains her with a picture book about Tuscany, where he, although born in Prague, owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life. He is here to regain the house in Prague now occupied by a couple with an old and weak mother whom he allows to remain. Benes' every gesture is benevolent, though he does not prevent Jarda from going to jail. Under the circumstances, Marcela has to retire with Lucina and Cuba to depend on the mothers' love, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and Zdenas current man, much tougher mercy, the scary diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer) - who, for the children, begin committing the cardinal sin to consuming his diet cakes, turns out to be uncle from hell. Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the movie at this time and never lets it go. Even in the last scene, he is a figure of learning struggle. Surprisingly, the unpleasant Richard does not sexually abuse one or both children. He insists that Marcela should come out on his own, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing, he and Richard become unlikely allies. Unclear - perhaps inappropriate. Why should Benes like him? But what is Benes whole story? About some things, the movie gives too much information and about others, not enough. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the "good angel", Benes is unlikely kind - and a polished, handsome, and elderly man whose manners fit his Italian upbringing. It is only at the end when he is pushed to the borders of his Prague property by the incredible residents, he proves that he is not one who will not lie down and go over. <br /> <br /> Also being treated is Jardin's religious fanatic mother Sdena (Jana Brejchova), and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to look at. But she's just another wild card that doesn't amplify the tire. <br /> <br /> The poem is set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on the screen by the accordionist vocalist Raduza, first in a small scene, then in a more extended one staged by a prison performance witnessed by Jarda and the car thief pal. If you honor Work as a writer, you can enjoy this order; otherwise it tends to feel free. Also included are a number of songs by Glen Hansard / Marketa Irglova from the Oscar-winning Irish music movie 'Once', including the latter's theme song, "Falling." They feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their knowledge of 'Once' - even though this film came first. <br /> <br /> Working people arrest; even little Koba has its Shakespeare child moments and a wealth of charm; But the director and his author do not seem unable to resist the temptation to break down and over-expand. Property trouble Bene's endures can be useful to show that he has a hard side. But such a detailed demonstration was not necessary. The action is fine, and there is a wonderful quirkiness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex and money are lost in shuffle and Marcela's conflicts, and how she solves them never becomes clear. It's nice that there is no resolution and truth to the theme and to Graves poems that Marcela still has hot sex with Jarda during a trip to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her children. But there are too many questions left about what to do with the unpleasant Richard or of Jada's annoying pious mother (Emília Vásáryová). How suddenly do we learn Koba gets letters from "India", which is said to be from his father, who is in prison? When did interesting details happen quickly in. This seems like a world where you can't see the forest for the trees.
