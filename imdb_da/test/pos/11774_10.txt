Hardware Wars is a hilarious, 12-minute short film episode of the original Star Wars movie, released just a few months after Star Wars in 1977. This movie uses home appliances like spaceships and Star Wars look-a-like actors to send you scrolls Around the floor in uncontrollable fits laughter. This film has won many awards at film festivals and was the movie that inspired Mel Brooks to write his Star Wars parody called "Spaceballs". <br /> <br /> This is my favorite parody movie and I recommend it to anyone who is familiar with Star Wars and has a good sense of humor. <br /> <br />
