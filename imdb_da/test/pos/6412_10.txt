This movie, one of the best I have ever seen, speaks of communication. It throws us in a lively Taipei, dyed in cold colors where the rain falls incessantly; a DAMP world. It shows us the story of two people living in this world, a man and a woman. A case, or fate, connects their existence, but they cannot open each other with words. Characters are the mirror of society's difficulties in interpersonal relationships. An uncommunication that has been taken to the extreme limits here. All characters only replace a few words during the movie, dialogues are almost absent, and when some words are spoken, they are often weak and empty far away from describing people's true feelings. So the evolution of the story, the revelation of the character's feelings is developed (brilliant idea!) Of the musical excavations, only seemingly meaningless, speckle the film. The progress of the sentimental event and the drama of female protagonist leads us to a great end, highly symbolic. A film quite different from the usual, a smart realization of a great talented director. PS. Forgive me for my bad grammar !!
