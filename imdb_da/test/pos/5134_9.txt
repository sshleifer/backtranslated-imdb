In "Hoot", Mullet Fingers are engaged in sabotage to stop the pancake house. The problem is that the builders just start again, and he must take more drastic measures. When confronted with the dogs, he scares them with snakes, not before he is bitten by a dog and has to go to hospital. <br /> <br /> Roy at bedtime asks his father working on the justice department how he deals with villains. His father says it involves the tedious steps of looking through papers, because sooner or later they all slip together. You can see this with Enron and WorldCom. Roy looks at documents pertaining to the pancake house and finds a suppressed document (he must enter the company's trailer), so when the police see it, he has the law on his side. Unlike when he escaped the police. <br /> <br /> Remember, as mentioned earlier, Roy is not always legal and when the company man kills owls (illegally), Mullet Finger takes direct action. He can't wait for the law (Mullet Fingers are in hiding). The film suggests that you have to work in the system.
