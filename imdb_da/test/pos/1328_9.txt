The twelve of the ocean is probably better than the Ocean's pupil. I know most people would disagree, but I liked it more. After three years it was good to see the band back. The reason behind heist is a little more inspired second time. I see why they stole from Benedict (Andy Garcia) in the last movie. This movie has the slightly more motivation the second time. The twelve of the ocean is more entertaining and cooler than the Ocean's student. With a fun comedy by Topher Grace who said "I just went in the new Dennis Quaid movie" and other things. I think Ocean's Twelve is probably the best in the series. Plot: One year after Ocean's Twelve, Terry Benedict (the guy who robbed the last movie) is back and says that if Ocean's eleven do not pay him back the money, they stole, he has to call the police. So Danny Ocean and the gang go to Europe, where Rusty meets his old cop-girlfriend Isabelle. After she meets him again, she begins to follow them around. The band also learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are. <br /> <br /> With many fun scenes like when Tess (Julia Roberts) goes to Europe and pretends to be Julia Roberts, Ocean's Twelve is a beautiful smart movie. It is cooler, more fun, and more entertaining than the Ocean student.
