Slipknot is a hardcore rock band from Des Moines, Iowa. Nine band members who all need custom boilers, and personal, homemade masks (eg # 6's clown mask, # 0's different gas masks, # 8s tattered + torn krash test dummy mask with dreadlocks). The music itself seems to be in the fine lines between sane and otherwise, but is performed so brilliantly and psychotically. <br /> <br /> "Welcome to our neighborhood" sounds rather a generic title, but the recording itself is something else. Interviews with the band, audio bits from their latest, self-contained albums, 2 live performances and a banned-for-MTV music video (a brilliant tribute to the classic Kubrick movie "The Shining"), watch the movie not even half an hour, But it is definitely worth it. It's perfect for introducing any metal / hardcore fan to Slipknot.
