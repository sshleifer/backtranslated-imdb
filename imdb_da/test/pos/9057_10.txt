This is really a good movie. Full of love and humor, it forces the audience to really care about the characters and participate in their journey. Michael Parness managed to bring together a big caste of best players, a minor miracle to a first movie. Without a doubt, they were moved to help him tell this beautiful story. David Krumoltz carries the film with his undervalued intensity and honesty. Natasha Lyonne is unpredictable, exasperating, and yet quite gracious as Grace. Also a great tour of Karen Black (great to see her on the screen again) as Grace's bile but sympathetic mother. There is cutting knowledge all the way through, which allows us relief from laughter when we face life's pain. The action is impeccable, editing tight, direction inspired, and the music creates an appropriate mood of mood. Considering the current Hollywood Blockbuster craze, full of big budgets, big names, car crashes and special effects, Max & Grace is a refreshing departure. Give yourself a treat and watch this movie.
