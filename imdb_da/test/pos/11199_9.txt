Perhaps many viewers who became frustrated by this movie live their lives without thinking deeply about life itself. What I want to point out here is that "distant" is not just an art house film, but one of the best art house films. From all the art-house films I've seen, "distant" is the one that really stands out as an excellent gold piece. It is even fair to say that the film's filmography and depiction of human emotion surpasses Tarkovsky's nostalgia. A commentator got it right that sex, a pet, common feature among foreign films, is surprisingly lacking "distant" and in a good way. What is most remarkable about "distant" is that it captures the details of life that we usually ignore and the rich essence of our existence, which is often buried under the quilt and visual extravaganza in our commercial world. Fortunately, "distant" does not have much to save the audience, and what we see on the screen is a harsh portrait of people.
