Okay, so maybe the imitations of Jay Leno and David Letterman aren't bothered, but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they operate behind the screen. Bob Balaban and Treat Williams are excellent as Warren Littlefield and Micheal Ovitz. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't go for joke and punchline, but it's still fun. Kathy Bates in particular is fantastic as Leno's leader. <br /> <br /> Fun, great, interesting, very attentive, this is a good TV movie.
