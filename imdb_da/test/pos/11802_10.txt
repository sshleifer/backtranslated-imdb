Cure is one of the few films I rated 10 out of 10. I think everything is flawless for me in this movie. I saw it almost a year ago, and yet I remember many of the scenes, especially the last touching scene that comes with the credits. The two boy actors clearly gave everything they could and it contributed a great deal to great story making the movie perfect. The message is clear - friendship, and it appears all the way. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say here. Simplicity is one of the things I love so much about this movie. And of course it is fun and moving at the same time that suits people of all ages. <br /> <br /> 10/10, nicely finished!
