This is a wonderful look, you should excuse the pun, with 22 women talking about breasts - theirs, their mothers, other women's, and how they affect so many aspects of their lives. Young girls, old women and everyone in between (with all shapes, sizes, configurations, etc.) talking about developing, responding, celebrating, hiding, improving or reducing their breasts. It's charming, lovely, sad, fun and everything in between. Intercut with documentaries and clips from the famous old "young women's movies" that the girls were taken to the cafeteria to watch, interviews are a fascinating window for men who love women and their breasts in what the other half has to say when They don't know you're listening.
