John Travolta was excellent as "Michael" in the movie of the same name. I don't think that a better portrayal could have been done. The movie was fun but touching. Michael is a very "human angel" (if that is so). Andie MacDowell is great in her role as a reporter as she goes from disbelief to faith. Bill Hurt and Robert Pastorelli are good as co-workers who are bent on proving the hoax of the angel on earth. Each of the supporters is great, especially the older woman (I don't know her screen name) that plays Michael's mother! One of the cutest movies I've seen this year ... I could see this movie dozens of times!
