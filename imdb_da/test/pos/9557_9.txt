"Best in Show" is definitely Christopher Guests' funniest and deepest movie. The characters are excellently portrayed and the connection between the pet and the owner adds a new level of comedy to the movie. I've been a fan of Guest since Spinal Tap, but in this movie he has really achieved what he set up to do in "mock-umentary", a genre he invented and has now perfected.
