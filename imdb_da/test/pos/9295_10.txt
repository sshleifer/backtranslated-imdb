No matter which country you are in, you should buy this show, certainly it is Australian, and if you have ever seen any attempt at our comedy, they suck pretty much, but with chaser they are not boring forty-year-old men making bad saying, they are a team of people talking about current affairs (pretty much in Australia) making fun of our crap ads, making fun of our politicians and so on. <br /> <br /> The boys also had a show in 2002 called Cnnnn, which was not as successful as the war, which only started this year, so all they talk about is current news that is really good considering No matter how boring or tragic it is, they try to shine a little humorously on things.
