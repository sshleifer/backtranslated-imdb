This movie is a fantastic remake of the original with the same title. The movie was cool, despite the fact that I hate new ones! All cast was amazing. It has great cast and a fantastic plot !! The main plot is a man who is poisoned, and he has to solve his own murder, okay? Dennis Quaid is the man who is "DOA" (in other words Dead On Arrival). He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect !! Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him. The movie is pretty quick and full of action. You can see two other great stars in Meg Ryan (City Of Angels, Courage Under Fire) and Daniel Stern (Home Alone, Very Bad Things, Bushwhacked) to support roles in this amazing, cool remake of a classic movie !!
