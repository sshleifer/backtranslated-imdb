There are several ways to misunderstand this movie, and a few of them have been shown in some of the previous comments. This is a movie to be analyzed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not compared to the opera, book or other Carmen movies seen before. It just stands by itself and I have to say that this Carmen does very well. It is a mistake to compare, because it is the first step to denying movies the chance to be autonomous creative works of art. Vicente Aranda is a master of the atmosphere and the art direction, costumes and photography are extremely well-formulated to achieve a pleasurable aesthetic experience. Let's take it as it is. <br /> <br /> And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Some complaints about the typical Spanish clichés in the movie. Well the story is extremely well studied and you can see the results of the very serious work in all scenes. It is not only an accurate portrait of the "black Spain" of knife and espadrille that Goya portrayed so vividly, but it is also the part of history seen by a foreigner fascinated by the folklore side of this society. In fact, anyone who does not want to see any cliché about Spain should not buy a ticket to see Carmen, but in this case, these clichés are presented before they become one and the way to see them is to get rid of our own prejudices . <br /> <br /> Another important requirement to understand this movie properly is to speak the language. It is not acceptable to criticize any actor performance for not understanding his or her lines. If the whole rest of the audience did, the problem is probably somewhere else. Paz Vega has an immaculate diction with her Andalusian accent, and all she says is understandable and credible. Her Argentine partner, Leonardo Sbaraglia, also gives a convincing portrait of the Basque officer who became a "bandolero" and her accent is very well-read. <br /> <br /> No less important is to have a minimal open access to the material. Saying that Paz Vega is "awful" suggests that the author of the sentence entered the theater for the wrong reasons. We already had a critic in Spain in one of the most prestigious papers that used to recommend us pictures that he found homosexual without mentioning it explicitly. And it wasn't quite fair for the rest of us, especially for those who hadn't discovered that the man wrote with parts of his anatomy that many readers didn't necessarily have to take care of. I do not suggest at all that the reviewer had the same motivation, but expectations must have been different, as those among those who went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role, because that is what we got. Paz Vega IS Carmen, and an excellent, in Vicente Aranda's movie.
