Nightbreed is definitely my most preferred movie I have used more than one band as it is. Make-up is great, the story is lovely. It takes a few different terms and is not quite as deep as the story is based (Cabal, by Clive Barker), but for a movie adaptation it remains very sandy for source material. The only problem with this movie was the manufacturer's unsuccessful attempt to make it a teen film film, and thus the altered end to allow for sequels * eye rolls *. Apparently, one day we get a director's cut that will (I hope) clear up this bit of nonsense. Until then, I would suggest it to anyone who likes dark fantasy type horror as opposed to Freddy / Jason / Micheal type slashers. I really don't know what would be comparable ...
