"Jaded" addresses the complex issue of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In smaller hands, it would be degenerate into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. However, this director has managed to draw a textured multilayer study out of a certain other point of view. <br/> <br /> Since the director / writer is a woman and chief detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-painting film. It is not. Being a sexual predator is gender neutral. The nakedness of this movie is not erotic. Rape is not brutally sexual. We look at victims and not titulation. <br /> <br /> The gifted cast rings are true. For a movie that is so little known, I was surprised at the quality of the performances. They are good. Carla Gugino and Rya Kihlstedt are incredible. <br /> <br /> Somehow, this movie was lost. Maybe it's too wise for his own good. It's a "must see". Highly recommend. The sexual thriller of a thinking person.
