OK, I got the DVD statement last week and I'm finally getting around to sending my reviews, but I liked this sequel in many ways. Zombie Bloodbath 2: Rage of the Undead. OKAY. The one movie with a fast clip has some really good effects and some really well-finished atmosphere and style. I would actually go on record saying that this can be one of the most stylish DV shot flicks I've bought. For the most part, I get pretty angry at DV movies to be boring and look like soap operas. Even a movie like Bonesickness that I like has incredible stretches of DULL. Not this movie. It never stops long enough to let you catch the weather. Though I wouldn't say I liked it better than the first movie, I would say that Sheets certainly improved technically in the two years between movies. This one has better gore, the inevitable zombie feeding scenes, scumbag characters, and a few recurring actors (although their roles are different) mainly Jerry Angell as a pretty good psychopath with a killer mullet from hell. The shots are more ambitious as well as the script this time because you can tell Sheets are trying to pull much more than he did in the first movie. Some of it works, and some of it doesn't, but I have to say that at least he wasn't just trying to make a bigger version of the first movie. This time there was no mention of a power plant of chemical waste, only Satanism and the occult who bring the undead to life again. So I say kudos to Mr. Sheets to try to do something different with this one. I give this movie two bloody thumbs up!
