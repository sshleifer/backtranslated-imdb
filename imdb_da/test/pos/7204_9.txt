I was fortunate to see this sequel before the original because I am not sure I would have gone out of the way to see it if the opposite was true. I found "Mission Cléopâtre" better than its predecessor for various reasons, but the biggest one is this: it was almost word for word an adaptation of a book, not an amalgam as the first movie. The physical resemblance to some characters for their animated self was very fun, especially the bad guy (whose name moves me, but he is the other architect). I don't know how this movie played in English; my native language is french so i didn't have that problem ... i imagine some of the jokes were not so easy to translate. I've learned something over the years, it's better to watch a movie with the subtitles than at the doubles, maybe you don't understand what's said, but you won't lose the rhythm and I think it's important too. I would recommend this movie to anyone who truly loves "Astérix et Obélix".
