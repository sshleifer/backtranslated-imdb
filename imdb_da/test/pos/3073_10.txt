If you don't like Mel Brooks, you won't like this movie. It's a given. Why someone doesn't like his movie is unknown to me, but for those who can't see the light, just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Everyone else: This is a classic. The whole cast is perfect: Carey Elwes is a dashing, clever, British Robin Hood, Amy Yasbeck appropriately transcends Marion, Richard Lewis is his usual distracted, annoyed self, Roger Rees is a brilliant combination of flustering and violence like "Mervyn" Sheriff of Rottingham and Dave Chapelle, Eric Allan Kramer, Mark Blankfield and the unfortunate underused Matthew Poretta are the perfect happy men. There are similarities with rumbold, blowing saddles ... and every other Mel Brooks movie. But why do you want him to change his style when it seems so terribly good? The pop culture references in this movie are old enough to be fun again ... from a 16-year-old, at least. It is complete and complete parody, every second a game of grin. Some of them don't work, but most do it and good. I discovered new jokes the fifth and sixth time I watched movies! <br /> <br /> Of course, if you are bursting with constant visual and verbal gags, it's not your style you don't like it here. This is not an Oscar winner, it's Mel Brooks. You know what it is when you get into it. If you want nonstop laughter, then surprisingly well-developed characters and catchphrases to last in life.
