hi, looking for a movie for the family to watch on a Friday night? Can't find what you're looking for? I thought it was a very comfortable movie. Good for the whole family. I found out that it had a remarkably rare combination of being appealing to both adults and children. It was brilliant, to say the least. Bruce Willi's play was top class, there was a lot of humor in it and generally a great movie. In my opinion, it is a must-see movie. And I don't think that about a lot of movies, believe me when I say that it takes a lot for a movie to make me think about it. Obviously, there was a lot of work done by Bruce Willis and thrown to finish this movie. Excellent story, good acting, and again, generally a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
