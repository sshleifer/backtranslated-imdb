Face it, people - "DK3" is more challenging, innovative and wise than its predecessor. Challenging - its levels are ridiculously difficult for a considerable amount of time. A particularly difficult level is called "Lightning Lookout" where you can be hit by lightning at any time. Innovative - it opened many doors. Sin SNES died out not long after this title. And wisely - The level names range from trademark word-play-words ("Lake Orangatanga") to witty references that the game's target audience will not come for many years to come ("Bleak's House"). <br /> <br /> What irritates me about most people's criticism of this game comes mainly to two words: Kiddy Kong. He is a worthy "little buddy" successor to Diddy King, and certainly deserves not to be referred to as "the delayed monkey." "DK3" will remain a classic until the end of time.
