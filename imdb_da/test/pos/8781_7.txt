Cummings is mistakenly accused of sabotage and going on lamb, looking for the real culprit. The well-known Hitchcock theme for a man who is mistakenly accused of a crime is played nicely in this entertaining ticket that has elements in the "Thirty Nine Steps" and "North of the Northwest", even though it is not as good as one of these classics. There are some impressive sets of pieces, including the finale of the Statue of Liberty. The reason is impossible and convincing, and after a fantastic start it seems to run out of steam. Cummings likes if it's a bit stiff in the lead. Lane is the blonde, but not the black row of the director's later film. Supporting roles are generally well played.
