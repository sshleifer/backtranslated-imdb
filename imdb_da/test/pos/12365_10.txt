The choir (1921), a classic film with cult status among the silent films, directed by Victor Sjöstrøm, who also plays the male role, is based on a story from Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf. The film tells the story of the brutal drunkard David Holm, who beat up his wife, neglects his children, seduces his brother to drink and is blind to the love of the nurse Edit (Astrid Holm). David sits at the end of the year with his bursting friends in the city's park and tells the story of Phantom Chariot (The Carlsman): Who dies in New Year's Eve as the last before dawn, should earn a year as a driving force for death and release the dying souls from their bodies. But David struggles with his friends, suffers from bleeding and sinks on the ground. Meanwhile, Phantom is approaching Carriage. The driver is none other than David's late friend Georges, who seduced him into alcohol and died a year earlier. When David refuses to get on the cart, Georges strengthens him. Together they drive to the stations where people live as a result of David. They visit the nurse Edit, whose love of David he could not recognize and who he infected with tuberculosis so she now dies. But her unconditional love for David will save her soul. Filled with their spirit, they come to David's wife and children. David is able to prevent his wife from killing herself and her children because she does not see a way out of the misery where David has thrown her. They also visit David's brother, who has committed a murder after being seduced to drink from David. David asks Georges to go back into his body because he finally sees his way wrong. When it was Georges who had seduced him once to drink, David's desire was given, he got another chance, and Georges must be a year more driver of Phantom Carriage to pay for his own sins. This movie probably belongs to the strongest and most impressive films ever made. After all, it is still not available on international DVD.
