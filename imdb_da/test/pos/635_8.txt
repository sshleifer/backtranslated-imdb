I couldn't stop watching this movie, even though it was far past my bedtime. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Hitchcock are deserved - this thing really plays with you. There is a fantastic line between genuine, instant excitement and a dark, distant humor. Like many of Hitch's heroes, our drowsy mute witness has innocently turned into something terribly horrific - and we are taken on a trip with her, on turns that completely identify and feel her fears, and vice versa, in thrilling excitement as she is placed further in danger. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have put a lot of care into this work. Right from the opening shots, they engage and challenge you to determine what is genuine and what is manufacture; who is to trust and who is a monster. The plot turns and turns unpredictably. Suspense is created with a combination of carefully selected camera work, imagery, music - but the eyes of most individuals who send raw fears right into you. <br /> <br /> A warning: Something scary is really going on, as well as some nudity. Horror scenes are done in an emotional way that makes them far more scary and disturbing than in any teen slasher pic. And a teen slasher pic is not. The characters are quirky and feel like real people, for one thing - a couple (including the heroine) you can even find endearing as I did. There are no mistakes, you see a movie made for adults. I mean, Alec Guinness is in it, short and you know he didn't have to work! <br /> <br /> Pop this into the VCR one night when you can't sleep. . . and don't want to, yet.
