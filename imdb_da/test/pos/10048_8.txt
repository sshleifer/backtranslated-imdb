Although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining, the imagination is sometimes more enjoyable than real life, and nothing can be more real than Errol Flynn, who plays Custer. This is still the best film made about Custer. Max Steiner's music is magnificent, and also through the film is the Irish song "Gerry Owen", which was a favorite of Custer's game. The movie must have more villains because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in Arthur Kennedy. The relationship between Flynn and De Havilland flows out of their movie like no other, and director Raoul Walsh with his experience in scenes with many actors is at its best.
