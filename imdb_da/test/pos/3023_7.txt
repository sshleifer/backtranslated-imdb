A serial killer, Carl Stargher, has kidnapped and murdered young women by letting them drown in a water-filled cell. He is arrested by the FBI, but is in a coma, and his latest kidnapping victim is waiting in a cell timed to fill with water. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the above premise and you will see that there is a very much seen everything before looking at it. The magic magic of Mark Protosevit is that he changes a hoary old chestnut plot into something completely different from what you expect. If I mentioned the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to get into Stargher's mind, a completely different movie sets up <br /> <br /> It would not be enough to make CELL a different class by thriller, but director Tarsem Singh creates a visually striking surreal thriller. The cinematography of Paul Laufer, where opaque primary colors are at the forefront, is amazing, but Singh doesn't end there, things like costume design where Stargher walks around his idiosyncratic universe, wearing lavish costumes, has a visual effect that does this much more than a run of a mill player <br /> <br /> What stops the CELL becoming a classic movie, but it is you who are becoming more and more aware that the whole movie is about the pictures rather than having a natural story. We see a third sign, an FBI man entering Stargher's domain, but it looks more like a constructed plot just to introduce the audience to more astonishing but very disturbing moments. It should also be pointed out that this is a rather disturbing thriller with an atmosphere that is very depressing and it stops the movie from being if it is not fun and then involves. A scene where an FBI agent tells a case where a pedophile beats a rap to later cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair that you might come to the off button. You should see a massive amount of thrillers until you see another as disturbing as this one
