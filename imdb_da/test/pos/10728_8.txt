I thought this movie was quite good and quite entertaining for a movie that was heavy on emotions. I agree with what another user wrote about the script being sympathetic to the three main characters. I think that's what made the movie good. Nor did it bother Mr. or Mrs. Kramer, and it was refreshing, I think seeing two people essentially work the problem out on their own and eventually do the best for Billy. And even though it was a bit strange, I also liked the music in this movie. For some reason, the music seemed appropriate for the journey that the three main characters went to. This movie flowed quite well and did not complain as some emotionally heavy films tend to do. It dealt with a serious situation, but did not take it seriously. It simply told the story in a straightforward way, and it worked quite well.
