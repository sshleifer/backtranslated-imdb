For most of us, life is an unfolding process of love. For others like Soo-mi, however, it is dominated by darkness and fear. Based on the Korean folk tale Jangha and Hongryun, Kim Ji-woo's brilliant gothic horror story revolves around a Tale of Two Sisters around two sisters, Soo-mi (Lim Su-jeong) and Soo-Yeon (Mun Geon-Yeong) are part of a dysfunctional family living together in a creepy Victorian mansion. The feeling is alienated from the world, they cling to each other to survive with the older Soo-mi who obsessively protect the younger Soo-Yeon from danger. For Soo-mi, which, however, does not express the circumstances of his mother's death, mental illness and a mind mean odds with reality. While we may acknowledge staples as haunted houses with apparent observations, doors that open and close alone, a cruel and indulgent governor and other high-level events, a number of two sisters explore excellent deeper psychological meanings, including the inability to let go. on inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge. Soo-mi says "Do you know what is really scary? You will forget something. Dry it all out of your mind, but you never can. It can't go away you see. And ... and it follows you around as a ghost." There is a timeline, but it is left to the viewer to rave up. The plot cannot be summarized, only suggested, and the film doubts us what happens on the screen, is objective or subjective. <br /> <br /> In the film's opening, Soo-mi, a obviously disturbed young woman, is being questioned by a doctor in an attitude similar to a mental institution. When the doctor asks her to describe what happened "that day", the movie flashes back when Soo-mi and Soo-Yeon return to their father Moo-hyeon (Kim Kap-su) and founder Eun-joo (Yum Jung Ah). The founder is hostile and erratic, and the danger is passive and distant, but it is obvious that it is Soo-mi who really hurts. As the girls try to adjust, they are constantly afraid of being present in the house, which can be nightmares or supernatural occurrences. <br /> <br /> Soo-mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed, hovering over her and oozing black blood, a dinner scene, where the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and cramps , a monster comes from between one of the sister's legs, people mysteriously disappear from photographs and many other maniacal schizophrenic units to keep the viewer trembling at the edge of insanity. While we notice that much of the story is the projection of the spirit of the other, we do not know who and the film keeps us constantly challenged, at least until an important hint comes in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> Shot in beautiful low light cinematography, a Tale of Two Sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that transcends all the frightening, and there are plenty. It is joking in more than one sense of the word, and its pictures can stare back at you when you least expect or want them. While the film may not give the weary much to the light of light, it shows us where we can end if we choose the dark. In some observer's words, "the blame is never the answer - whether it owes you or others. The answer is rather to step out of judgment - both yourself and others. Forgiveness and understanding have great healing ability."
