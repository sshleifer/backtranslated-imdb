I first saw this movie in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney, when it was fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - these days actors acted "naturally" and you "felt" for them in their respective roles. A "glossy" movie in the period - conditions in it are still relevant to today's world, but now the sexes are at the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment shown earlier. Soundtrack music is wonderful, and it is a joy that the film result released monthly the CD in January 2005. Shame scenes were cut before the release - even if two hours you want more! I have registered with Amazon for the DVD (they now have a special page). To watch this movie in CinemaScope after forty-six years of pan and scan will be great. Twentieth Century Fox, please look at your catalogs of fifties CinemaScope productions for DVD - there's a big market out there. I await arrival from the United States in March 2004 Vanity Fair Special article about the movie, which is said to be fifteen pages with many pictures on sets. Bowl.
