Written by brilliant Monkee television writers Gerald Gardner and Dee Caruso, from where the roads were the last of the "Jerry Lewis" films until "almost" almost a decade later. Jerry's comedy is apparently an acquired taste, and by the way, he can sometimes be his own worst enemy when he strengthens as a producer / instructor - but even in the most dramatic films there are always moments of glimpse. <br /> <br /> WHAT YOU CHOOSE to be entertaining, entertaining and yes, fun. It's something unlike any of the typical Lewis movies. The pace is very optimistic, and there are many good supporting players - a kind of JERRY DOES HOGANS HEROES. It all looks a bit like an unsold TV pilot and you will either love it or hate it --- but hopefully you will like it
