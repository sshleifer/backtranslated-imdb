The greatest game ever played (TGGEP, 2005) is an incredibly uplifting, contagious underdog movie that never (really) transitions to sappiness or heavyhandedness. Yes, it requires more freedoms that most Hollywood movies do, but these freedoms are forgiven as they actually add to the enjoyment of the movie, not detract from it. In fact, there are many truthful moments in it. You can really tell that it is a "rocky" type movie from the movie, but who cares? Directed by none other than Bill Paxton (I know right?!), It's professionally done and immensely tough! <br /> <br /> TGGEP tells the story of Francis Ouimet (played with confidence, cockiness and class of superstar-to-be Shia LaBeouf), an amateur golfer from an Irish-French working class immigrant family living in Brookline, MA. in the early 1900s. Ouimet qualifies to play in 1913 U.S. Open. Included in his competition is the legendary Harry Vardon (the game with huge class, dignity and the wildness of Stephen Dillane). Ironically, Vardon is the 2nd underdog in this flick! The film starts in the 1870s Scotland, where land developers tell the youth that they are building a golf course in his home and that golf is a game that is not as if anyone like him. Francis undergoes some of the same prejudices as a boy in the early 1900s Brookline. The stories converge in Open 1913. What is ironic is that even as an adult and several great champions, Vardon is still exposed to British society because of his upbringing. Francis learned a lot about golf from reading Vardon's books on the subject, and Vardon is his idol growing up. Unknown to Vardon, they actually met back in 1900 in Boston, after Vardon, who won that year's Open, was touring when Francis was only 7. <br /> <br /> In addition to Francis and Vardon, participants in the 1913 also entered Vardon's friend and master Brit Ted Ray (boisterous Stephen Marcus) and classless, chattering two-hour defense master John McDermott (Michael Weaver). The film really does a good job of showing the different personalities of these men. Redhead Marnie McPhail is indratiatingly serene and amazing as Francis's supportive Irish mum and veteran Elias Koteas gives a strict, reserved, taciturn performance as his French father. Addtionally, the young young Josh Flitter (like Francis' pint-sized 10-year-old caddy Eddie) almost instantly steals the procedure. <br /> <br /> Paxton throws in many modern details, such as special effects zooming in shots to show the scoreboard for the players and CGI for many of the golf shots to keep the movie exciting and at a pace not to make the movie too much for a while. But the film still convinces us of a certain time and place. What's interesting is that while Rocky-like, it's all based on a true story! So the end is satisfactory on so many levels. An entertaining movie about golf in the early 1900s ... Wow!
