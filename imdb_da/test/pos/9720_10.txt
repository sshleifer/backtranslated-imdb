Each story has a lesson for young and old. But what I have to say can ruin a future story. But I think what I have to say is for everyone; Just for a specific episode: The Soldier and Death. Okay ... of all the stories is the one sticking out to me, "The Soldier and Death" because it was the meaning of my life I realized that life was terminal. I'm not kidding. The venting was on my 8 1/2 birthday ... and I will always remember it. I couldn't remember his title until tonight, but I new synopsis. (May 15, 1988) <br /> <br /> It is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part of life. It is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact. I am living proof (currently 28 years old) that children can accept this fact and from time to time remind adults ... <br /> <br /> I write this with tears in my eyes. Heath Ledger - a wonderful actor my own age - died today. It reminded me of many lessons I have learned in my life. So I'm writing this as a reminder to Young and Old ... no one is immune to what's in store for us. <br /> <br /> I hate to say death has to happen, but this story was the first time I saw Death as not a bad thing; But part of life was quite literal in this story. I can't help it. It was a life-changing moment for me and will always be. <br /> <br /> And for that ... <br /> <br /> I love you Jim Henson (and I still remember a lot of your work in life until the day you died and your memorial Muppet Show) and thank you Brian Henson for keeping the workshop alive !!! Honestly, I thank all your staff, editors and interns. <br /> <br /> The scene is just a stage / And a show is just a show / But fantasy will create magic / the eternal world will know. <br /> <br /> Thanks !!! <br /> <br /> (And to anyone who doubts me ... Dance, Magic Dance)
