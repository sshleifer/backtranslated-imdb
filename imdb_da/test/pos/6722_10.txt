Daisy Movie Review by James Mudge from beyondhollywood.com On paper, "Daisy" sounds like an Asian movie fan's dream that is right, directed by "Infernal Affairs" with Healer Andrew Lau and staring everyone's favorite sassy girl, popular Korean actress Jeon Ji Hyun . Unfortunately, despite the talent involved and the fact that the crew flew halfway around the world to shoot in Amsterdam, the film shows a bit of disappointment as it is a cliché-dreaming drama that meets in misery and self-esteem. <br /> <br /> The plot follows Hye Young (Jeon Ji Hyun), a fairly naive Korean girl living in Amsterdam, using her life in her grandfather's antique shop and making portraits for tourists. One day she starts receiving flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer whom she believes to be a mysterious man from her past who had once built her a lovely little bridge. One day she meets Jeong Woo (Lee Seong Jae, also in "Holiday" and "Public Enemy"), who is not familiar with her, is actually an Interpol agent who traces Asian criminals in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> With Hye Young assuming Jeong Woo is responsible for the flowers, the two fall very slowly into a coastal romantic relationship. It turns out, however, that the man sending flowers is actually Park Yi (Jung Woo Sung, from "Sad Movie" and "Musa"), an assassin working for a Chinese crime syndicate. Inevitably, the love triangle becomes tragic, and the two men end up turning out while poor Hye Young tries to find out which of the two is the love of her life. <br /> <br /> Although "Daisy" is apparently a love story, it has the feel of a funeral, with a slow, gloomy pace and a plot that piles on the misery. Half of the movie's running time is recorded with scenes of the characters staring slowly out of windows into the rain, with silence only destroyed by bouts of self-pitying narration. Director Lau seems to be under the impression that the movie is a major Shakespeare tragedy, rather than another gloomy hit-man love story. As such, the procedure has a rather pretentious air, despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and mainly based on clever cliché borrowed liberally from e.g. "Fulltime Killer" and John Woo's classic "The Killer". Almost all aspects of the movie are shaken by anxiety, with the three main characters suffering as if the weight of the world were on their shoulders and deviant will do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations. In particular, Park Yi, such a kind of overly emotional, socially retarded assassin, is so beloved by modern cinema, slightly ridiculous, from his blatant incompetence at work to his hilarious attempts to discuss Impressionist painting with Hye Young or his love of flowering. This dull passivity makes the film's central romance somewhat difficult to swallow, and Luc's attempt to evoke the feeling that it is the fate that brings the characters together comes across more equally randomly. <br /> <br /> Fans of Jeon Ji Hyun should note that her character is much closer to her role in the supernatural drama "The Uninvited" than "My Sassy Girl" or "Windstruck" and while trying her best to draw a couple of crazy faces here and there, her performance film enjoys glossy production values, and Lau benefits from the Amsterdam scene and contrasts with the city's gray, almost gothic beauty and innocent blue skies and blooming fields in the countryside. Unfortunately, he tends to over-slow slow motion to some of the emotional scenes that, when combined with some of the image card images, give the film the feeling at times with a perfume advertisement. There are a few scenes of surprisingly violent action, although these are few and far between, and even though they are well-staged, they seem to have been thrown as an afterthought and do little more than raise the pulse short. <br /> <br /> Despite its mistakes, "Daisy" shows up and the story almost speaks for itself, mostly out of a morbid fascination not to see which of the men Hye Young will end up, but to see who will lie in dying her arms. The self-reliant melodrama works well enough to cross all the right boxes to the genre, and the movie works perfectly as a pleasantly shiny, uneven romance. It is worth noting that the DVD has the director's cut of the film, which at one time indicates that it is significantly different from the theatrical version, which not only adds 25 minutes but reorganizes some of the scenes, making the story less linear . Although this new version may be too long, it is certainly superior as the film without these changes would have been even more conventional and would have suffered from even milder character development. <br /> <br /> Wai Keung Lau (director) / Jae-young Kwak (manuscript) CAST: Woo-sung Jung ??.
