A western through and through. As the title character portrayed by Glenn Ford says, "No, I don't want to fight, but I want if it's forced on me." This movie is about being intelligent, strong and fighting for one's faith. With courage, never stop striving for what you feel is right. Great action and mostly fast paced. Good to see Brian Keith in this role and Edward G. Robinson as an older Western man. Glenn Ford lives up to his western image. Thoroughly enjoyable films include strategic non-military warfare. It is, of course, violent, as the title states, but not too graphic as in the computer-generated ear films. It's mostly about strong personality clashes.
