Published as KING BOXER in the UK <br /> <br /> This movie was essentially the FIRST kung fu movie to go on general release in the UK. Many of us had ratcheted through Kurosawa's astonishingly gritty and involved dramas and were accustomed to oriental films being beautifully shot and lit, with some limited pacing, all like flipping through an album of very fine stills that are just moving. <br /> <br /> Along the run Run Run Shaw and co. with their widescreen "home video" production values ​​and astonishingly mature for parody, and all the rules have changed. KIng Boxer was the first in through the door and left a clearly marked track for others to follow with his feet planted well on top of the burned footprints. <br /> <br /> Despite hokey plots, pantomime acting, cheesy jump cuts and spaghetti western style snap-stepped zooms, this movie was amazing. Beautiful without being lavish and with the most brilliant battle choreography ever to reach a screen. We loved the violent violence, the anxiety, the testosterone. The giant artists among us found some of the techniques fascinating, if flamboyant and often stupid. It was so much different from the Japanese stuff we all knew, and it had a lovely acrobatic grace that perfectly complemented the disease and blood-covered floors. Delightful. <br /> <br /> At that time, the "KIng Lear" scene was a milestone in schlock "You Terrible Bastards .. My **** !!" Now it's a little less shocking, but still a bit of a gut grain. <br /> <br /> We didn't notice any women in sight being absolutely one-dimensional. Having seen several genre films, it now stands out as a tender thumb, but at that time it didn't matter <br /> <br /> This movie defined what would quickly become the kung-fu movie clichés. Everybody. Look at it and remember that until it broke out on the western screens, there was no genre for it to enter. It was unique and amazing. It was the first Kung Fu movie and it's still the best for me and many others.
