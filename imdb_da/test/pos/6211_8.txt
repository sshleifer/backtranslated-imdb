When I first saw Colleen Moore it was in the excellent series of silent films called "Hollywood". There she was in 1980, her hair was hard as it was in the twenties, a sparkling, witty and charismatic older lady - the very definition of "presence". Then I saw her fabulous silent comedy work in movies like "Ella Cinders" and "Orchids and Ermine". So the disappointing gloomy talkie "The Scarlet Letter". And now she is in "The Power and the Glory", giving an excellence of staggering power, and working expert with one of the talking cinema's finest actors - Spencer Tracy. <br /> <br /> I found the movie a little lacking in glory history-wise, but Moore and Tracy give such glorious notions that history hardly seems to matter. Both actors age from youth to old age during the film - and this is mostly done by acting alone with minimal make-up and hair changes. Moore is almost unrecognizable as the older wife, and the scene where she finds out her husband is to see a younger woman being one of the most wonderfully performed scenes I've ever seen. She does most of the scene without dialogue, which is where her silent acting gives her the edge, even over Tracy. Contrast this with her lovely cartoon in another silent sequence when she is a young woman, and Tracy struggles to propose her. Astonishing! What this movie shows more than anything else is how shameful it is that Hollywood lets this remarkable actress slip through her fingers and spend most of her life in retirement.
