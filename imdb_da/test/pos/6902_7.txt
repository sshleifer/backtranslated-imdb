This movie was fun if all on board. It mainly follows the comic villain of two tombs in the 19th century England moving from a conventional body stumbling to act in vampires, zombies and dead Roswell aliens. (I have no idea what Roswell alien did in there, nor do the producers think I am.) <br /> <br /> But was it fun? You can believe that. Even Ron Perlman, who is often kissed by Direct to DVD Death, was pretty good at this one as a priest, who turns out to be the main character of a rival gang of body carvers. <br /> <br /> Seeing this fun little movie and a good example of what you can do when you have no more than life ego on both sides of the camera is a real pleasure.
