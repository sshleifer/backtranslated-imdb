This cozy French movie deals with a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an African island near Madagascar named Louis (Jean Paul Belmondo). He is a single man who sees wife, then announces a bride and gets a beautiful woman named Julia (Catherine Deneuve). When she looks spontaneously, turns out to be much more attractive than expected. He marries Julia, but she suddenly disappears. A French eye privately (Michael Bouquet) is hired by Julia's sister, and soon he is on the track of his former spouse. Later, Louis meets her in a dance hall under a different name. Despite the romantic delusion and everything goes Louis told with his enigmatic wife. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great drama full of betrayal, deception, killing, theft and Hitchcockian excitement. Good performances by Jean Paul Belmondo as a young proprietary by a cigarette firm that seems determined to fall under the spelling of a femme fatale and a wonderful Catherine Deneuve as a suspected heroine. The movie gets more references to the American cinema, but Truffaut (400 strokes) was a great movie gamer, like: Johnny Guitar, Colorado Jim, Bogart and Hitchcock. The United States version was cut several minutes and deserves an urgent restoration and remastering. Loosely based on the short story "Waltz in darkness" by Cornell Woolrich (Bagrude and screenwriter of Alfred Hitchcock time), who was also adapted in Truffaut's bride had variety. Colorless filmography by Denys Clerval (Stolen kisses) and atmospheric musical score by Antoine Duhamel, Truffaut's usual musician. This is one of the best of his exciting movie along with ¨Farenheit 451 and Shoot the piano player¨. Remade of a subordinate version of Michael Christofer (2001) with Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie and Jack Thompson, full of erotic and bright scenes.
