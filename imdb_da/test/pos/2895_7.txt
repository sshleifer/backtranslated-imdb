A long delayed concert edition, Rush-in-Rio DVD, is both compelling and disappointing. This smooth two-disc set shows Rush at their finest. After 30 years of honing their unique sound, it's great to have this record of one of the most talented rock bands ever. The concert has over two dozen songs, a documentary and three songs that feature multi-angle viewing. Packed in a double folded holder with sleeve and a little effort, it is very well priced for the amount of material it contains. I'm a Rush fan from the late 70's to the early eighties and this DVD comes through great, with half of the show highlighting songs from the era. I will not list the songs if you will be surprised. If you participated in the steam trail, you know what to play. <br /> <br /> Playing in Rio for their biggest audience ever, Rush is a great crowd pleaser here. It was actually one of the first things I noticed that was peculiar to this show. During most of this two hour concert you hear and see the audience, actively chanting and dancing wildly to the music. Initially, it is encouraging to see the fans give Rush a well-deserved answer. But after several songs I was ready to hear and see more of the band and less of the audience. This is by no means a slam of the Rio crowd. More power for them! It is a criticism of the final editing of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my second and main reason "I hate it". The video editing is horrible in my opinion. Save for multiple angles with bonus cuts, the whole show is a crazy visible chaos. It's like the director wanted to see how spastic he could handle it. I count changing camera angles on average between every four seconds, all the time! After three or four songs, my head and eyes were ready for a break. It's too bad because I wanted to have put through the whole show as I could at the concert last year. Perhaps this quick editing is the latest craze for concert DVDs, but I really think it's an annoyance and detraction from the overall experience. As mentioned before, I wouldn't mind it for a song or two, but the whole visual aspect of this disc hurried or rushed. It's really ironic because all the previous concert clips I've seen from Rush, mainly from Moving Pictures, are strictly straightforward, with little shift back and forth. It's almost boring, visually speaking. This DVD has taken it to the other extreme. I know a lot of colored-in-wool rush fans will violently disagree with my statements, but that's just my impression of it. Bottom line: If you are a Rush fan, then you want me to buy this DVD, regardless of my review or anyone else. I would still have bought it after I had read my review. Just don't expect a "normal" concert. Who knows, the above things can't bother you.
