We will never see this movie broadcast by HBO in the near future, if at all. If someone somehow comes across it in a video store, just take it before others do it, for I doubt if it will ever be released again. <br /> <br /> An incredible and timely film about the first attack on the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993 and how the state agencies working are identifying and stopping terrorists from doing harm and harm to US citizens and American real estate fell to the job and allowed it to happen. <br /> <br /> Bone chilling since we all now know that the terrorists arrested at the end of the movie would not be the end of our nightmare that resurrected on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> The film brought back everything that went wrong in 1992-93 that allowed the first tragedy on the WTC to happen. Yet, it took another eight years to realize that we should have learned from the first WTC attack to be more vigilant and ready to prevent the second and far more devastating attack on the World Trade Center. I found this movie harder to look for the events of 9/11 and then the video of the 9/11 attacks itself. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this movie is not seeing it alone. The final end is so powerful and prophetic that it would leave you in a shock situation by knowing what we know today and possibly need someone who is with you but not see the movie to get medical help.
