This movie for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the violent thriller / mystery / murder movies that are in the river. It is about real people who make the best of their lives. They are just Indian and the protagonists are in law enforcement. The realistic play and the great scenery are more than what makes it a little unnoticed. The soundtrack is by BC Smith, who also made the soundtrack to Coyote Waits, and it's great. Adam Beach plays a tribal policeman who is a bit unhappy and Wes Studi is the magnificent professional detective. There are many other fine, either support or como roles by Graham Greene, Tantoo Cardinal, etc. We also saw Coyote Waits, another adaptation of a Hillerman novel, and we also enjoyed it a lot.
