Okay, maybe this movie is not a revolution. But it's a very good piece of entertainment, and it's Liv Tyler's variation of Alicia Silverstone's "Clueless" or Cameron Diaz "There's Something About Mary". Life plays a femme fatale, who just wants her own house and all kinds of material comfort in it. And well, she does everything to get it just ... even crimes. Many crimes. And she releases every boyfriend who doesn't cooperate to get these things. Besides, she doesn't mind having some extra boyfriends beyond her current boyfriend. This movie is even more fun to see if you know that Life is actually a star sign cancer - and cancer is reported to be very domestic. So the character Liv played here is actually a parody of a cancer! <br /> <br /> I was alone in the cinema when I saw this one. It was quite pleasant because I could laugh as loud as I wanted all the time - but it also felt weird as if nobody was actually interested in this movie? <br /> <br /> I liked it very much. The action was between very good to excellent, especially the main actors how brilliant. There where enough jokes, many of the black sorts and good dialogues. <br /> <br /> This is a garbage game and it is full of black humor. If you like this kind of movie, try this one!
