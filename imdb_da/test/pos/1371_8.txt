I think this movie was made for the not so great sum of Â£ 8000, but it didn't really show. There was nothing amusing about the production or the play, the signs were gritty and real and the location could have been a desert area in the world rather than a not too hot beach just north of Aberdeen. The actors were quite acceptable as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious, desolate and unclear planet, none of them seemed to be particularly friendly to each other, but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their peers alive. There was no great explanation for what was happening, which can really be interpreted so much of the plot was left to your imagination, rather than The Big Empty, which was a movie I also enjoyed. I found out that I was very warmed to most signs, there were some unintentionally entertaining moments, the men were so common that you felt empathy with them, and the climax and ending of the movie was quite exciting. I think Mr Stirton and his crew should be quite proud of themselves. I've seen worse movies with a budget of millions.
