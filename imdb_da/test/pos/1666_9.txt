I heard they were to reinvent this French classic in 2007, and I see it is evolving for 2011. It's a shame when Hollywood kicked author / director Jules Dassin out because of the infamous blacklist. They should not have the right to resume any of his films. <br /> <br /> I love "caper" movies and "movie noir" and this combines the best of both. <br /> <br /> Tony (Jean Servais) comes out after making a nickel, and after beating his old boyfriend (Marie Sabouret), he plans a great score with his friends Mario (Robert Manuel) and Yes (Carl MÃ¶hner). What Makes This a Great Caper Flick is paying attention to details in planning the robbery. You see it reflected in George Clooney Vegas hijackers. Nothing is left to chance. The captain goes well, but Grutter (Marcel Lupovici) sends his sons, Robert Hossein and Pierre Grasset after Tony and the gang. After blowing it with Mario, they kidnap Jos's son. Lots of bullets fly before it's over. <br /> <br /> An amazing movie by a fantastic instructor. The standard by which other caper films are measured.
