Despite what its critics felt, I enjoyed immensely for just what it is. Eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum. Soderberg has made the artificial hard edge thing before, won the Oscars, is at the top of his game. Ocean 12 is easy, commercial, fluffy, Steve's Day on Midway if you want. I'm not generally a fan of Zeta-Jones, but I have to admit that Kate is STUNNING in this movie. It ends screaming for a coming trequel, and I will be one of the millions flocking to see 120 minutes of George and Brad and Matt parlay through Clooney's tombs in Lago di Como as they fade some rich bad guys again and again. If we tolerated 3 installments of the Lord of the Rings, I ask if we can throw over Clooney's salt and pepper lid just once more.
