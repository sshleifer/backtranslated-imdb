John Schelereser's career as a film director was extraordinary. We had seen this movie when it first came out but wanted to watch it again when it was showing on cable recently. The film has a faded look as you see it today, but it is still interesting because of the two main characters' intense performances. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, don't read anymore. <br /> <br /> Chris and Daulton were two childhood friends who came from upper middle class backgrounds. Chris went into a seminar to be a priest, but gave up. Daulton became a little time drug user and trafficker. The two lives seem to run parallel, as the couple becomes involved in an illegal activity that will prove their short-sightedness. In fact, it shows how both young men are miscalculated in their attempts to trick the CIA and the Soviet Union. These two were, in a way, so naive in thinking that they could pull something that was bigger and better equipped people could not even imagine being done. <br /> <br /> Chris's motivation is legitimate as he feels furious about discovering the subordinate role of the agency with which he works in other nations, in this case Australia, something he finds in pure coincidence. When he involves Daulton, we know everything is doomed because no one in drugs, like he is, will ever respond to anything. In fact, Chris and Daulton had no idea of ​​the extent of what they were trying to do or the consequences. <br /> <br /> In this period of time, Timothy Hutton was an actor who went to places. He had proven that he had talent in his work in other films, so it was a natural choice for Mr Schlesinger to choose him, a choice that pays off well. Sean Penn was also a young actor who showed an intensity that had not been seen before. In fact, at times, Mr. Penn us about a young Robert Mitchum in the process. Both players' contributions to the movie are incredible. One cannot believe who could have played this duo, but them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Falcon and Snowman" too distant past.
