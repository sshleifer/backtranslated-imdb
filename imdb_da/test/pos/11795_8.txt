Working night shift in a seedy police station stumbling through life in an alcoholic drop, Detective Mickey Hayden can hardly be said to have a firm grasp of reality at first, but when a bump on the head releases scary psychic visions, things get really strange . Soon he is on the track of a serial killer and unraveling the mystery of his beautiful first victim, the unpleasant Alice. A cursed burnout role seems tailored to Keifer Sutherland and he does it most of it. The reason is typical serial-erroneous things, but it has enough features, twists, and real surprises to raise it above the usual genre price and even make up for a painfully low budget. (You wonder what this movie might have been if there were money for a few rewrites and a few more take.) All in all, 'After Alice' is a pleasurable diversion for everyone, but for fans of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' Books are a real treat. From the topsy-turvy reality, where things are rarely what they think, to more obvious references - a killer named 'The Jabberwocky' who leaves playing cards on his sacrificial bodies - there is an 'Alice' reference on each turn. Below is a list of those I discovered. Since you've found them, it's half fun I've marked them as spoilers. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Cast of Characters <br /> <br /> Mickey - Somehow Alice walks through strange landscapes and meets odd characters, but Harvey recognizes His true nature, identifies him as the unhappy, growling white knight. <br /> <br /> John Hatter (Mickey's boss) - Is he really 'sour'? You're the judge <br /> <br /> Claudette - An African American transvestite. Obviously, the black queen <br /> <br /> Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her the Red Queen, but her brutal nature suggests, more specifically, Queen of Hearts. <br /> <br /> Gideon Wood - Suspected of being the Jabberwocky killer, his ambiguous role is clearer for a snark (or a boojum perhaps). <br /> <br /> Harvey - His role as an unofficial guide to 'Wonderland' and his name, evocative of another famous cinematic rabbit, makes me believe he should be the white rabbit <br /> <br / > Dr. Vera Swann - Her last name and relationship with Mickey suggests the white queen. <br /> <br /> Other connections <br /> <br /> Mickey's adventures begin as he chases a man in white and falls down a (rabbit) hole. <br /> <br /> Mickey drunken tells his cat to stop laughing at him (Cheshire Cat). <br /> <br /> The killer is revealed "through the appearance of glass". <br /> <br /> Climatic showdown ends in a swirl of playing cards, as did Alice's adventure in the book. The statues in the garden look like giant chess pieces.
