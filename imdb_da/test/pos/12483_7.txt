This movie is so lovingly made that you will be part of it forever. The licks are straight, but not without evil, the goods are transparent and the males are hardly there. Even the "cabaret" is so naive that they make you daydream with nostalgia in relation to everything available on television. Leaves are fine, if a little one-sided. Louis Jouvet is perfect, you just can't have a better copper. He has the best line: "My father cleaned the dirt of others and I do the same". Susy Delair is unbearable, but I think in part that it is the songs, the wardrobe and the hairdresser. Simone Renant, on the contrary, makes a big femme fatal if it is a little quiet. I didn't realize she could be a lesbian like IMDb user dbdumonteil, and others rightly suggest.
