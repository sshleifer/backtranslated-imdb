This movie surprised me. For years, I have avoided many of Harold Lloyd's sound images (as well as Keaton's) because they have a generally well-deserved reputation of being miserable to the silent films because the basic formula has been lost. But when I watched this movie, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I actually liked it ... when I accepted it, it really wasn't a "Harold Lloyd" movie (despite being starred in it) . This is because even though it is nothing like the style of his previous film, it is very original and Lloyd is not bad at playing a completely different kind of character. As I mentioned above, the formula for old movies is almost completely missing here. Lloyd doesn't do the old, well-known stuntwork, the romance is unlike his early screen romances, and the plot is simply odd! Instead of the usual roles, he is the son of a Chinese missionary who returns to America for the first time since he was a little boy. Because of this, even though he resembles an American (except his white suits and discovery helmet), he thinks and works much like someone who is Chinese. In many ways he is very naive over America and is like an innocent among wolves. Early on, he meets a man who turns out to be a local party manager. This boss NEVER produces a losing candidate for the Mayor's race - because he is bought and paid by the corrupt mayor to produce a "token" candidate who has no chance of winning. Well, the old geezer, whom they traditionally drive to the office, just died and he decides to drive the naive Lloyd - he has no prayer to win! Well, the unthinkable happens and Lloyd wins !!! This and Lloyd's decision to clean up the city greatly disturbs the old political machine and they stop nothing to destroy honest Lloyd. LÃ¸yd is on his way to prison on a trumped corruption fee. He creates a system that is 100% impossible and very illegal for signing notices from the villains. But despite this, it's incredibly fun and a great end. So my advice is at the end, just suspend the unbeliever and enjoy. <br /> <br /> An important note: This movie is absolutely not politically correct. The word "chink" is used repeatedly. I found it offensive, but given the times I ignored it as you should. However, if you are one who does not like being angry, I suggest you never see movies anyway - as you are bound to be offended again and again.
