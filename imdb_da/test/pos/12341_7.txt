Thorn-BMI is out of service before they stopped making movies, they made a chiller of a movie. Using E.S.P. and telekinesis as the foundation of the daughter whose father mastered a terrible power. Only in the father's death did Olivia find that her father, Raymar from Raymarkovitch, had really murdered 6 girls and planned two others using Psyhic Vampirism's technique. <br /> <br /> Our picture starts with 6 coroner carts pulling in and music to match the gruesome discovery of the 6 girls. They all died with their eyes wide open in a closet. In the walls were all kinds of objects, the gentlemen men took up an old man when blue lightning hit the ceiling that caused a circular hole to form, only made the movie more bizarre! <br /> <br /> If you like extremely shocking scenes this for you. Unless you can see dead bodies from many years ago in each level of decay, do not see it without a friendly companion. Like "The Changeling" it has some heart that stops horror in it. I gave this a rating of 7 in color, the actor Meg Tilly debuted in this movie if you can find it see it.
