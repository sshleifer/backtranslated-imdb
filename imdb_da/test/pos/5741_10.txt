My partner and I sat down to watch this movie over a bottle of wine on Saturday, and although we originally had our reservations when the story started, it was actually quite poignant. The scene in which one of the characters brutally murdered by knitting needles was particularly shocking and echoing the work of Korean New Wave writer Park Chan Wook. The chosen weapon was a special championship and made us look into the 'Granny' psyche, which changed the connotations into a loving, warm grandmother into a murderous garden. The dialogue was incredibly moving and lyrical in expressing the innermost paranoia protagonist. Pavlosky's choice of mise scene also enhances the unpleasant and manic atmosphere of the night events that combine with Oscar's worthy performances to create a chilling and thought-provoking masterpiece. The end, which I will not spoil for you here, reminded my partner and me of the M Night Shyamal's institutional masterpiece The Sixth Sense for the mind that changes the twist that has left me thinking weeks after viewing. Absolutely one to see, repeatedly!
