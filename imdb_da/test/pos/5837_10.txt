Oz is without a doubt my favorite program of the time! The best word to describe it is "genius"! the writing, the play, the story lines .. all about this show is absolutely amazing! <br /> <br /> I just discovered the show and I became addicted to it right away and I was really surprised that it didn't get the recognition it really deserves. It's violent, and most of the characters aren't meant for you to like them, but the show is written in such an excellent way that lets you look past the violence and criminals and see them as real people. They are the lowest forms of foam, but it still finds a way to allow you to understand many of the characters and even worry about their stories. The violence in the show is necessary for it to be as realistic as possible, but the notion is not about the violence that some people believe. It's really a work of art, and I'm sure who ever gives it a chance will love it as much as I do.
