Beginning in 1942, Sherlock Holme's character portrayed by Basil Rathbone was set in the then "modern" Britain. Many Holmes purists have praised the first two entries in the series (produced by FOX), but dismissed the 12 features that followed. I for one was never an avid reader and therefore I appreciate these movies as they are without any initial bias. In fact, the Second World War setting for this entry places it as a piece with British propaganda throughout the film. The implementation of the modern Holmes is handled with much more care than the previous post (Sherlock Holmes and Terror Voice) and fares much better for two reasons. First, Roy William Neil is ready to rule (and would be for the rest of the series), and second, though Holmes is plagued by the Nazis, Professor Moriarty brings this feeling more like a battle between the intellect between two rivals. Lionel Atwill's performance has been criticized by many as far inferior to George Zucco and Henry Daniel, but I feel as though it is more manuscript than the character interpretation. Especially after seeing, Atwill was very capable of being much more diverse and excited about other horror roles. Basil Rathbone on the other hand is unusual in this post. He seems to enjoy himself in Holme's role, but for that I owe the writing. For example: The introduction of Holmes in Terror Voice is trying hard to immediately determine how brilliantly intelligent Holmes is as soon as he is on the screen, while this movie shows Holme's brilliant deduction, but also his shortcomings. Even in the climax, Holmes originally hand over, only for then that his blood slowly drained from his body. Now there are a few flaws in this movie, I thought I could point out. First, the opening; Aren't the Germans fooled a little too easily? Maybe it's just me, but the book's salesman just rolls into the bar, saying he'll get Tobel not only to answer the door after several weeks, but let him come in and then go for a walk with him? What!? Secondly, Tobel seems to be endangering everyone around him. Leaving the secret boom units with genius researchers. Leaves the note with her fiance. Like what did he think? He threatened them all. I thought he was this amazing scientist trying to save England? And it's not the whole concept of "use it on them before they use it on us" a bit hard. Obvious propaganda Thirdly, how was it in God's name that Holmes should fit in the bottom of his chest? It's really small! In fact, the whole performance of Holmes to find Moriarty in ex-con disguise really doesn't explain itself as well. I've watched this movie well over fifty times, and there are still parts like this that I find performed in a very confusing way. Fourth, okay, so Holmes finds out that the first three scientists have died, one assumes immediately that Moriarty could not know the name of the fourth man because he was not dead yet. Well, if Holmes didn't know the name, how could he assume it? The guy might well have been down in a lake. Lucky guess Fifth, again with the confusion. When Holmes presumably dies on Moriarty's control panel, how can he recover? He was sure to act as if he lost a few bloodpots, but not enough to stop him from saving the day. Despite these mistakes, this is a very entertaining movie. The aprons are well-finished, the dancing men's mystery is well done (especially Holmes and Moriarty's back-to-back scenes, in addition to analyzing them) and Dennis Hoey as inspector Lestrade is always a plus. And as a final note, the wonder scene still puts me, I always thought it was one of the most successful sequences in the whole movie. Overall, this movie holds a special place with me as it was the one who solidified my Rathbone as Holmes's obsession. A classic. 10.7.
