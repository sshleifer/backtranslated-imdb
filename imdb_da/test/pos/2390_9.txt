As an independent Long Island independent film producer and having had two theatrical releases under my producing / controlling belt, I had always been told how much I could learn by seeing a FRED CARPENTER production, so I was lucky enough to having his "Eddie Monroe" as my dedication to his amazing budgeting, production, casting, settings and masterful conductors. My heart went for it's characters, it's history and was completely won over by trick / switch ending that brought the movie's plot to work! The location was wonderfully chosen and human feelings in its characters brought a realistic link to my bond with all the elements that Mr Carpenter used throughout his and his film!
