This was a great movie and the sequel had to know our socks !!! The action will be non-stop and I just bought the special edition DVD with the animated background story similar to Animatrix. This will put Vin Diesel back in the limelight and hopefully get him the coveted role in Spider Man 3 as Venom. He would be the most logical choice for the role. Back to PB this movie, although it is an indie thriller, it has a fantastic story and characters with backgrounds that scream for you to want to learn more. If they were to make books or comics, it would be a good read. There was one thing I felt was a little under finished. The end it needed some work, but not all movies would have the best end.
