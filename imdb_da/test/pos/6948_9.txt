This show came to Canada via PBS in the mid 90s and I really loved it then. Even 10 years later, they see various news networks, I can't help but think of the cynical manipulation that takes place in the names of reviews and the various "show ponies" we all see on television as depicted in various Frontline episodes. The scripts are tightly written and the actors all have impeccable comics, and none of them are obsessed with an idiotic laughter. There is very fun material here really well done, and we do not need to know when to laugh and what to laugh about. I don't understand why this show never went off in North America as it really is a gem! I was really excited to see the available DVDs even though they are PAL format. I figured I would rip them to my computer and then see the converted files. I took a chance and ordered it from ABC ?? 6 to 8 weeks later I had all 3 seasons. Even better, it worked on my NTSC DVD player. I suppose any player bought in the last 2 years doing xvid / divx will play them. Good cases! Ten years later, the episodes all keep really good! You don't need to know anything about Australian politics for getting humor, as it all will be known to Western audiences. My wife and I had a 10-day Frontline party and are still throwing weeks later after seeing all 39 episodes
