I enjoyed Ramin Bahrani's Man Push Cart, and this movie is just as good. This slice of life is almost a documentary about how life on the edges is lived. <br /> <br /> Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales are doing an excellent job as a 12-year-old brother and a 16-year-old sister who lives in a small room over a car dealership. There are no parents; they are alone survivors. Ali complements his income by stealing auto parts, selling bootleg DVDs and selling sweets on the subway. Izzie complements her income by selling herself. They are trying to make money for, but their own truck. <br /> <br /> You are tempted to express indignation at the fact that these two children are left to cope with themselves, and it can certainly be very sad that Izzie sells her body to willing truckers, but the fact is that this exists today in the world's richest country, not an underdeveloped country. Save the rhythm and do something.
