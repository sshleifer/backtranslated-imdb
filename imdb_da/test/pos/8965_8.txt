... with a single action. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson, congressman, is a real character. During the 1990s, when communism in the Soviet Union broke the Berlin Wall and the war against Afghanistan (with the Soviets) over. He did it, a single denial of money, and everything went down. He must be remembered, so here it is. His memorial. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Fun, dramatic, snob, political or just boring. Anyways, it's a smart movie about political life, about ruling the world and, above all, a lesson to the world. A lesson to all politicians out there, a critical point of view that refers to countries that support wars with money, weapons and words. <br /> <br /> Lesson learned - The world is not a good place to live
