"Four Daughters" introduced John Garfield to the audience, and that's what is most remembered about this movie today. Unlike some actors appearing in several films before their screen gems, Garfield instantly established himself with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and talking about fate being against him. It's actually the story of four girls, their widower (Claude Rains) and their various suitors, one of whom, Felix, is played by beautiful Jeffrey Lynn. He's the one they all have in love with, but he's in love with Buff (Priscilla Lane). Then she meets ne'er-do-well-Mickey Borden, who also falls for her. When Buff realizes that one of her sisters is in love with Felix, she leaves him at the altar and marries Mickey. <br /> <br /> This is a rather formal story given the life (and successors) of the actor. Garfield has already been mentioned, but Priscilla Lane was by far the strongest of daughters, the most interesting and the best actress. Jeffrey Lynn was a fresh and handsome man and this movie got him on the right foot with Warners. But true star was not to be. Like many others in the era, he entered the service, and when he came out, he had a bronze star, but not much of a career. He later entered television and real estate. Claude Rains is warm and wonderful as the patriarch. <br /> <br /> So popular were "Four Daughters", as it inspired "Fire Wives" and "Four Mothers" and reunited much of the cast in "Daughters Brave" where the actors played various characters. <br /> <br /> Very comfortable, a nice memory of simpler and probably happier times, and a chance to watch John Garfield in his first movie.
