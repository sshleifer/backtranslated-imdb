'Steamboat Willie (1928)' is often mistakenly spied on as the first Mickey Mouse movie, though that title actually goes to 'Plane Crazy (1928)'. The source that burns this common misconception is yet another episode of "The Simpsons" that places Itchy Mouse's origins in a concise 1928 map called Steamboat Itchy, of course, a parody of this cartoon. Interestingly, 'Steamboat Willie' was even a parody that spoiled the latest Buster Keaton edition, 'Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928), although the connection extends slightly beyond the title and the general history setting. In this Walt Disney card, Mickey Mouse takes charge of a river-steamboat, much to the annoyance of Captain Pete, the cat who, with saliva, throws him aside. But Mickey is not going into nastiness. Far from the quirky, healthy Mickey that recent generations have had, this little mouse is only concerned with numero uno, which causes pain and dissatisfaction on a number of farm animals to provide music for its own amusement. <br /> <br /> First there is the grinning parrot that polishes a bucket and a large potato to the head. Then turn a goat at the tail to give music ("Turkey in the straw") from a guitar it has turned off. A cat swung around at the tail, a goose scattered around its neck, and a pig started viciously. For a children's cartoon, "Steamboat Willie" directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, it certainly has some humorous humor, although I also noticed similar elements (though not quite so much) in some later Disney shorts that "Gulliver Mickey (1934)." Let's not forget Minnie Mouse, of course, who is suffering treatment that she could sue for sexual harassment today, the jokes may be raw and the animation may be even more, but this cartoon delivers a bucket of grin and it's easy to see Why this little rodent became one of the most beloved characters in cinema history, if you're a fan of Mickey Mouse or Disney in general, this is a steamboat you can't afford to miss.
