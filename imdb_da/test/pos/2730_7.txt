I have to say it was a disappointment. All in all it is great to see how the Aparna Sen has dealt with the issue of schizophrenia, I am not very knowledgeable about this and got what it was depicted in a beautiful mind, and here also the interesting portrayal. <br /> <br /> But the thing that caused me to shake off was the artificial dialogue and the use of English. It is true that a new class is being formed / has been formed in India, who speaks English English, even at home, but I am sure it is not as formal as in the movie. In addition, the Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem to speak much in English. Charu's Bihari tone dialogue was apparently much more realistic and digestible. <br /> <br /> The other thing is about the abstract flavor she has tried to give to the movie. I like open-ended movies, but here were many loose ends. Its like cut pieces are joined together to make the movie. Also, there was no central theme in the movie. Schizophernia was certainly the main line, but mixed sister-sister, mother-daughter, addition of doctor-azmi relationship, no real use of brother, Bose-Bose's wife relations ..... everyone was not required and got the audience loose on what actually she tried to portray. In general, a clock for people who like off-beat movies should be avoided for those who just watch movies as an entertainment tool.
