Hallelujah !!!! ? Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border (s) to show how Bogota and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage who is sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly adorned by Hollywood and others. How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second largest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the United States), or that it has a live film and television industry (not to say anything about Ugly Betty) that it is capital, Bogota (Pop 9 Million) is the "Capital of the World" or That This beautiful city hosts the world's largest international theater festival? I hope Doug Liman, Simon Kinberg (-Mr. & Mrs. Smith), Robert Zemeckis, Diane Thomas (Romancing the Stone) one day visit Bogota to see how wonderful it really is and focus on Bogota's cultural vitality and diversity , instead of myopically producing films like Maria Full of Grace, which Joshua Marston benefited from (for this amazing movie) without having to think through the ontological damage, his film would help continue with Colombia "unreasonably tarnished image" . /> - At least you'll enjoy Bluff a lot! -Oh, and thank you IMDb for your priceless / great work !!!
