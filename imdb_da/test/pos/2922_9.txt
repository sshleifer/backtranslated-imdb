It often happens while an adult film grows up, impresses a youth. It not only lasts a lifetime but inspires him to study old cultures as a career. That was the case with the 1954 movie titled "The Egyptian." The audience was confused with the sets, costumes and great plays of this film, so much other movies soon followed in as vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who left parents less after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not difficult to wonder why he wants to spend his life and ask questions. The boy Sinuhe (Sin-oh road), meaning "One who is alone" (Edmund Purdom) grows into crew and continues to ask why, even though he graduates from The School of Life to become a doctor. During his formative years, he acquires a lifelong friend named Kaptah, brilliantly played by (Peter Ustinov), and Horemheb (Victor Mature), traveling from a simple officer of the guard to the army army. His life offers everything from a rapid rise in social status to condemning criminals, rejecting, a wondering healer, and finally to a life station he had never expected. Fine plays go to Jean Simmons as Merit, Michael Wilding as Akhnaton, Bella Darvi as the temples, Nefer and John Carradine as a memorable tomb robber. Tommy Rettig, plays Thoth, son of Egypt. In his last years, he discovers 'the only one who is alone' the answer he had sought throughout his life, which he brings to his son, now in the care of his lifelong friend. Excellent movie! ****
