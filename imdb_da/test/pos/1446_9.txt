Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict returning to his Chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic. He plans to stay away from the drug and find work as a drummer, but he cannot avoid running into his old friends. He was initially arrested for no drug-related fee, but because he was caught in an illegal poker game. His ability for poker has earned him the nickname The Man with Golden Arm, and the men who run the game, one of them is his former heroin relationship, want him to act again. Meanwhile, Frank will take care of a woman he injured in a car accident, Zosch (Eleanor Parker), and make his old girlfriend, Molly (Kim Novak). The movie is great to put us in the mental state of Sinatra. When he felt confident in himself at the start of the movie, I felt good to him. But when a promised phone call doesn't come one day, he falls into depression and goes back to the taste. Later, when he finally comes to audition, he comes out completely. His embarrassment when he cannot play the right pace is devastating. He had such great dreams, and the other musicians didn't even pay attention to him as he hurried out of space. The movie is moving fast, and it shows Frank's drug problem in a realistic light without becoming a social message image. The actors are uniformly fine. Elmer Bernstein's score is one of the best in his time. The only thing I don't like about the movie is the end. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although I really like the character of Zosch and Parker is very good in the movie, could have done a little more to fill out his story. The end is a little too pat. Although there is probably a pathos that will remain with the signs after the film closes, Zosch's death ties all the loose ends up a little too nicely. Frank is free to love Molly and he won't go to jail. Also, his dealer is dead, so at least the immediate threat is gone. Well, I think in Hollywood there is always a desire to tie everything together in a nice little package. It damages the movie a bit, but as it stands, it is still one of the best and most adult movies about drug abuse I can think of. 10.9.
