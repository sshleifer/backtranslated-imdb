Director Don Siegel really impressed me with this movie. It is heavily shot, graphically without being visually graphical, well-pervaded by all concerned and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a work, almost expected normality hitherto not seen in any other movie of this reviewer. I didn't know what to expect to sit down to see this: a civil war movie or some 70-inch soft core with Eastwood falling on a school for girls in the south. But it really is not one of those things, but rather research and exploration and descent into the minds of men and women - a dark commentary on what is at the heart of civilized. As a reviewer previously noted, none - none - of the characters are sympathetic to the end of the film, yet each one is interesting, complex and enigmatic. Eastwood plays Cpl. McBurney, a Union soldier found by young Pamelyn Ferdin (you recognize this voice as soon as you hear it), a girl at a school of manners led by Geraldine Page in the midst of the chaos that was the civil war - especially in the south. In parallel, Page, Elizabeth Hartman, lovely young seductive Carol, and even Ferdin (Amy) teach emotional / sexual ties to Eastwood - each with their own needs and secrets and problems. Eastwood is not a good man. He plays girls out of each other and always tries to get the sexual advantage. In the performance we get some really interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest. Beguiled, for me, is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front. This can be (except Invasion of the Body Snatchers) Siegel's best movie. It is certainly one of Eastwood's best real performances. The site is always so good, and Hartman, Feinard, et al. is excellent. The Gothic man's school set is effectively claustrophobic. Some of the sexual laced scenes interfere. And what happens to Eastwood is a leg of much of the competition for creepy, eerie, demented movies.
