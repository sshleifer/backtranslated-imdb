It is difficult today and in the United States to understand this film. We have nothing to really compare it to. Here's an attempt at comparison: It's like in recent years with Saddam's rule that a filmmaker in Iraq could somehow make a movie that for the first time ever showed life as it really lived in the country. The life of the ordinary young girl, with all the terror and oppression blown away. Then the film was exhibited freely in Iraq. If you could imagine the unlikely event, you might have an idea of ​​what was going on with this movie in the last year of the Soviet Union. Before this film, Soviet cinema was very censored. Soviet films would only show an ideal life in the worker's paradise. So suddenly this. Alcoholism, random sex, the ugly wasteland that was the Soviet city, the swelling pollution, the proletariat who sacrifice each other and themselves, the complete hopelessness - that's all there. People were stunned. Soviet women would often cry during the performance. Many will say that this is the story of their lives. It was a cultural earthquake that filmmakers only dream of achieving. It undoubtedly accelerated the break-up of the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Read reviews here, I can see few understand this movie. One says it was groundbreaking because it contained real sex. To the Soviet viewers at that time, the sex was a minor event in that it depicted reality for the first time in Soviet cinema. <br /> <br /> Others compare it to current movies as "as good as it gets". You can also compare Homer's Illiad with the latest John Grissam novel. They simply do not compare. This is not just a movie, this was a social document and a transforming social strength. It should be viewed that way, or you do not understand the movie. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers see it as a movie about a dysfunctional Russian family. One even says it's hard to be sad about Vera, because she holds back her family. The point is that Vera and her family are symbols of all Soviet life. There was nowhere to go because the family down the block and in the next town were the same. This was the life of the Soviet Union for most people. <br /> <br /> This is a multi-level movie: As a drama, it traces the despair landscape as a social document showing the living conditions of a political document, showing the people's attitude and many of the reasons for The break-up of the Soviet Union and as a moral document show the evil of a dictatorship that is out of control and the atrocities that victims will practice on each other. <br /> <br /> Little Vera clearly shows the human toll that socialism ultimately takes its victims despite the good intentions that the system may have. In this way, it contributed to ending the Soviet regime and thus contributing to one of the major changes in modern history. This movie achieves what only a few movies have ever achieved. It's not just a fantastic representation of the story, but it also becomes a force in the shaped history.
