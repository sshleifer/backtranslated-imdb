although i liked this western, i must say this is not one of my favorite john ford westerns. for me it just lacks a particular element that most of his other movies (those I have seen anyway) possess ) I'm exactly what it is. It's not something tangible. Sometimes the story of a Mormon trains used by a band of forbidden acts as a hide from a subsequent bag. Ford uses many of his fasting here. These are some interesting characters, some beautiful scenes, a bit of action and excitement. It all adds up to a clear experience. It is certainly not boring. Just up to the usual John Ford standard. For me, the Wagon Master is a 7/10
