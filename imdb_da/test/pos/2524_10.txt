The story takes place on the streets of Sao Paoulo in Brazil, where a young boy named Pixote grows up alone without his parents. Left disturbed and without direction, Pixote is taken into a child asylum with other youth from the street. Behind closed doors, awful things arise within the staff and in the children's groups. And there is one last trigger that gets the spot blown up, the last event that makes Pixote and his friends decide to break out and escape. From there, a journey overwhelmed with strong tied friendships, friendships broken apart, love and hatred, criminal activities, and simply chilling on the beach begins and speaks of things, something like you and I sometimes. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is perfect in many ways because it touches you on so many levels, it did anyway with me. The document-like style used to portray Pixote and his surroundings seems more realistic, and the actors who really are street children and have lived in the same life help mankind under the conditions that seem more natural. It also has a social comment on child abuse, but I think what makes the film so great that the pressure is on history and not on the political views. The last scene I find the best piece from the movie hits me as something beyond anything I've seen before. So full of emotion and yet so unintentional makes this movie a truthful, credible, unbearable, unforgettable story. A truly heartbreaking masterpiece that is so undervalued! <br /> <br /> My vote: 10/10
