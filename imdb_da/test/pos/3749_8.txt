A woman and her aunt go to Scotland to find her evasive fiancee. This is a very malignant film due to its degradation, but until then it is interesting, well-behaved, scary and with fine-set design (by William Cameron Menzies developed for 3-D projection). Veronica Hurst is captivating and distinguished, a kind of British Marilyn Monroe who is still in love with Richard Carlson, who hides a family secret in his forbidden castle; there are even bats in the bell! It moves separately to the final extraordinary set when Hurst and her aunt (Katherine Emery, also the narrator) sneak out of the castle at night to venture into the maze and find what they are looking for in the center. As a child I always remembered this order - there is nothing scary (or claustrophobic) than not finding the way out of a 10 foot high maze of hedges. Of course, the two women are separated and set the stage for exciting excitement with horrible music. The final result is mildly disappointing as Carlson's epilogue at the end gives some meaning to all the progressive, even provocative, sympathy. Worth to see.
