For some reason some shows just fail ... some deserved, some not ... Buddy Faro was a smart show with interesting characters and dark humor that was fun to see ... Maybe it was never meant to be a big one hit it, but it had a "quirkiness" about what made it comfortable ... that being said, it looks like I might have been the only one looking .... Dennis Farina and Frank Whaley were cast perfectly in their respective roles ... production quality and writing were great, and Vegas was the perfect backdrop ... hopefully the first and only season will be released on DVD as I think it deserves some notoriety ... maybe at least do it on TV Country .... toast
