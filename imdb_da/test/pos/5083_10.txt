I watched the movie yesterday and was shocked by it, but even more shocked by some of the comments I have read here. One person wrote that it was ambiguous whether the torture victim was guilty or not - therefore ... A person wrote that since he was not a US citizen, therefore ... Some note that the people of the Middle East hate us and want We died, therefore ... Then we say that it is correct to torture a person guilty of a crime? Is it correct to torture someone who is not a US citizen? Do we think it is right to torture someone who might hate us and want us dead? Do we think that written in the Geneva Convention, the Declaration on Human Rights and the Constitution of the United States, that "torture is wrong, but some torture is less wrong than others?" When will it be "right" to torture? Therefore, this film is powerful - it is ambiguous, but not about torture. Torture is always wrong, and if we are willing to do it, even for justice and "national security" or "freedom and democracy" then we are wrong and we are evil; We do exactly what we blame our enemies to do (and we call them "wrong" in the same breath.) My favorite line in the movie was "if you don't want to compromise on joining Amnesty International." Straight on.
