I've seen this movie maybe 100 times, never get tired of it. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 7 years old and it has left a mark in my memories since then. It is an enchanting love story that brings out the sun in most people, even in the darkest times. I think this is a "must see" movie and one of Anthony Quinn's best performances ever. I just wanted the TV channels to send this movie more often. It has inspired me in a good way and will probably do so for many others. If there was any actor I wanted to meet, it would have been Anthony Quinn. There will never be a like of him on the silver screen, ever. Want Anthony Quinn still alive. May God bless his soul.
