Many believe this movie is a baseball movie. Such people are disappointed because it is about a baseball player, but the movie is not about baseball. Some believe that this movie is a romantic comedy and is disappointed because the relationship is not really developed. This movie is not a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie is about culture. An arrogant American major leaguer and a strict traditional Japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they cannot understand each other. It is after they are able to break through the cultural barrier that they are successful. The ball player becomes more Japanese in his team mentality and the manager more American in allowing individual performance and they meet in the middle. Baseball and romance are subordinate to this criticism of the two cultures. Many who have no understanding of Japanese thinking miss this, and think it is a movie of baseball or romance and sees the clash of culture as mild comedy help. It's not --- the cultural collapse is the film's grave. Based on my own experience and understanding of the Japanese culture, I believe that this movie did well, because it did not exaggerate the Japanese culture or exaggerate it in its depiction. Overall, I think this is an enjoyable and relaxing movie if you understand what it really is about.
