This is an excellent movie, but Momento (Nolan's second big budget film) is much better. I would recommend people to go to Momento, and then if they like it, watch this movie. The film is shot in black and white, which I was a little annoyed with at first, but once in the movie you understand, black and white is the best way to watch the movie. It is extremely gripping and reasonably easy to understand, even though the way it is made is extremely clever. Elements in the story I think are a little bad, but the movie is definitely worth seeing again. To conclude that the movie has a clever plot, clever phrases, very good actors and considering the film's budget, I have to say that it's pretty amazing.
