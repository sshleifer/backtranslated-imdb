This movie is where the Batman franchise should have stopped. Although I will admit that the ideas behind "Batman Forever" were excellent and could have been easily realized by a competent director, as it turned out this was not the case. Apparently Warner Brothers leaders were disappointed with how dark this second Batman movie from Tim Burton appeared. Aside from the idiocy of expecting something else from Burton and the conservative cowardice in their subsequent decision to make the franchise a tribute to the 60s television series, I do not understand how "Batman Returns" can at all be considered disappointing. /> <br /> That's true, it's not quite like the first movie - though it repairs all the minor flaws in style found in "Batman", a weaker script that divides the resistance between not just two, but Three characters invite unflattering comparisons with the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as Joker in the first movie. Still, it remains a gorgeously dark movie that is really the way Batman was always intent on and extremely satisfying. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton returns as Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, associated with nouveau riche tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, the German German actor of the 1920s), his partner in -crime Oswald Cobblepot, Penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup is reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's "Richard III") and Selina Kyle, Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) whom Wayne romanticises both as himself and as Batman. The four protagonists distinguish themselves in excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while Keaton and Pfeiffer together explore the darker side of dual identities. <br /> <br /> There are some exciting concepts in this movie. About the only weakness I can really point out is some limpness to the script in some places that I think are mostly due to the way this movie is a four-cornered battle. There is simply not enough time to investigate what is going on. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this is a wonderful movie. I highly recommend watching this with the first, and then crying for how good the series could have been if it continued under Burton and Keaton.
