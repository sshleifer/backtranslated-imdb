This movie sets the standard for all rockbiopics to follow. It achieved this through the leaders' energetic beliefs, the camera's stability (avoiding rock-video clich√©s that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), close editing and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as a human rather than a symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor gaps in the plot and random details that are slightly unnecessary, and there will always be debate between families of the personally involved with the specifications. But the question here, as in the much more recent "I walk the Line" or Carpenter's famous TV Elvis biopic of the same era, is whether the importance of the practitioner's life in his time and place as a catalyst for fans ideals and appreciation is manifested in the performance, and this is clearly the case here. We get away from this movie understanding not just how Buddy Holly became a star, but why. I can't see what else you would want from the movie.
