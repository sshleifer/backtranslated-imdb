I got a DVD of public enemies and expected to be the 2009 version, but it wasn't - it was here! Sure, it wasn't the biggest movie I have ever seen - in no way mean - but hey people, it was worth 2.8 out of 10! When I saw the immense assessment on IMDb, I wondered what to get, but when the disk was in the player, I sat down to watch it. As other commentators have pointed out, public enemies are NOT a historical movie per se - and I noticed that unlike the 2009 version (which I haven't seen yet), IMDb doesn't categorize it as such. <br /> Come on people! It's a story based on some real people - that's all! If I wanted a story reading, I would sit by this computer and read Wikipedia or something. Ma Barker (real name Arizona - or Arrie - Barker) was never even accused of any crime, and as other commentators have already pointed out, she has probably never even participated in her sons' activities. They sent her to the movies when they were "working"! (I hope she wasn't as critical as some of those who saw this movie!) Theresa Russell had the too easy task of portraying a 17-year-old woman until her death at the age of 52 - from a young girl running from home to the hardened mother of four hoodlins. I think she did pretty well. The naughty little smile she used in more than one scene was classic! OK, I would agree with some critics that the direction of this movie was below par and I sympathize with the actors over it. Theresa should have told the director to forget the topless shots - they do not contribute to the story. Perhaps some major star stars could have injected some of their own expertise to overcome the bad direction, while the other graduates were not so brave. Who knows? <br /> <br /> But even though this was not blocking at all, it was more than 2.8 !! I have all my DVDs on a personal database where I score them BEFORE looking at the IMDb score (although it sometimes affects small changes later). I take what I get on my own rather than keep a movie against others of the same genre, and the one I felt was entertaining enough to get 6.8. (Yes, I accept that such a practice tends to depend on my mood at that time, but then it is not the case for those who vote for IMDb?) But you may imagine my surprise when I looked on IMDb and saw the pitiful score that came here. <br /> <br /> Because of the surprise, I decided to read a few of the other comments hoping to understand the low rating and I noticed that they are quite polarized. I agreed with those who said the movie was worth seeing and came to the conclusion that some people are just hard to please. Well, since some were quite bad, why don't they come out and make some better movies? I will look forward to the gems they should be able to show! On the other hand, if they can't do that, why don't they just keep up?
