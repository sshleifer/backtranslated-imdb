'Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul' is one of the best music documentaries I've seen lately and is more than a movie about music. It is also a musical declaration of love for a fabulous city, one of Europe's largest cities and the world, one of the most important cities for Europe's history and for Islam, the city that can bridges in the future Europe and the Middle East or can again mean , as has already happened in history, the outcome of two worlds. <br /> <br /> There is the music. The interesting approach that the film takes with regard to music is that it starts from modern music, and we hear a lot of (good) rock and rap in the first third of the film. Once, as a backward movement of time, the soundtrack takes us to the roots, to Turkish traditional music, to commercial romances and to the exotic instruments that are basic elements of Turkish music. In such a complex and conflict-ridden country as Turkey, the film does not avoid some of the political aspects censored by the military rule in the 80s or the relevance of the minority songs, especially the Kurdish. One of the best musical moments is actually provided by a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice song in a cathedral-shaped hamam (Turkish bath). <br /> <br /> You need to love the city and its music at the end of the viewing and hearing of this movie. I've never been to Istanbul, but after watching this movie, I'm sure I'll be visiting this place soon.
