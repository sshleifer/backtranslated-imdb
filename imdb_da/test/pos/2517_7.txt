Another decent offer from Vince Gilligan pen. <br /> <br /> A pre-"Malcolm in the middle" Bryan Cranston plays Patrick Crump, a swollen guy who eventually hijacks Mulder via gun point and has him driving west at high speed. It has something to do with his major head rings (& possible fatal burns - his wife just experienced it) and the pressure seems to be relieved to go to the left coast. Only Mulder could relate to this guy's situation and actually bind himself with his prisoner before the whole trip is complete. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Scully seems to have resolved the matter with a possible remedy for Mr. Crump and will meet them by the sea. Check it out to see if our Dynamic Duo can join the Pacific and somehow correct Mr. Crump's big problem.
