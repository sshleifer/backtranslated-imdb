The story of an obsessed lover (Shahrukh Khan) and the lengths he goes to get his true love (Juhi Chawla) already married to his husband (Sunny Deol). The film is considered one of Shahrukh Khan's best performances and won him recognition from both critics and audiences. Fear that your love cannot be reciprocated, fear that you may lose the one you love, fear that your loved one might have a change in heart. In short, fear is the villain in every love story. <br /> <br /> But in 'Darr', fear is the ultimate expression of passion, obsession, and sacrifice. 'Darr' is Rahul's (Shahrukh Khan) story whose love and obsession with Kiran (Juhi Chawla) releases him from all fear of life and death. 'Darr' is Sunil's (Sunny Deol) story, whose lasting love and passion for Kiran gives him the courage to face the fear of death. And finally, 'Darr' is Kiran's story caught between a man's love and another man's occupation. She fears one and fear of the other. One stands for love, the other for life. In this struggle between love and life, the highest victory is love, because love always wins in life and death. Simply "Darr" is one of the best Indian movies ever made.
