I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references to this in North America as a porn movie. Our obsession with what should or should be considered pornographic remains a relic of the "Guide," which the Hayes Committee gave filmmakers many, many years ago, and it is now real time that we transform it into the past. So far, we have not gone far beyond creating a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, both of which carry the same pornographic label. It is time for all of us to recognize that neither the R-rated (soft porn?) Release version of this movie or the untitled version (hard porn?) Available on DVD was in any way pornographic. <br /> <br /> In legal terms, pornography is defined by its ability to dispel or corrupt. Many classic books such as Lady Chatterley's beloved, Fanny Hill, Women in Love, The Oory or Moll Flanders history have been prosecuted for pornographic content, tried by the jury and cleared out of this definition, but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal equivalence and using a simpler test that is too strict when applied to books or films that are very close to the line but serves to quickly remove most others from any form of pornography. Although the Hayes code would have characterized AIW as unacceptable both for nudity and for its depictions of sexual activity, most today, today, accepting the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to promote the development of long-term stable family relationships where participants find real fulfillment, it cannot be considered pornographic (it does not mean that works showing unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognized as pornographic, only because they may need a more sophisticated assessment). In AIW, we have a film about a young female librarian who has had a pretty doctor's upbringing, and keeps her attorney in arm's length because of a feeling that this is what morals require her to do. After being too frustrated by this and threatening to leave her, she falls asleep and dreams she is transported to a Wonderland (close to Lewis Carrol), where all she meets is completely uninhibited about their sexual needs. She is shocked, but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them, as long as she finds her prejudices melting away. She wakes up when her boyfriend returns to interrupt their affair, but her attitude toward him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored and the movie ends with those who "happily ever" live with their children in a home with a white picket fence and a family dog ​​- an end clearly aimed at the romantics who remain very young at heart. <br /> <br /> Pornographic? - Barely!. <br /> <br /> Suitable for children? - Well, not quite, unless they have very progressive parents. <br /> <br /> R rating? - PG would be more appropriate today. <br /> <br /> Entertaining to viewers in most age groups? - Yes, but the movie has its faults - these are discussed in many of the comments here on IMDb, but most commentators have appreciated and enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I think the only pornography associated with this movie was reported claims by an anti-pornography activist of "scientific evidence" that a magazine image of Kristin deBell was a photographic montage of images of a ten-year face with different body parts of adult models. These and other comments have seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress, but today the film is about to become a cult classic. Several home video productions have been released in both VHS and DVD formats; the latter was a DVD that contained both the R-rated and non-classified versions of the movie, which was released by Subversive Cinema in 2007. Examples of this were easily available until a few months ago, now they are almost exhausted and the mail order vendors, who still have copies in stock sell them at many times their original price - a situation that usually quickly results in a new DVD release. This continued interest nearly 35 years after the original film was released points to almost classic status. <br /> <br /> Commentators on this database are expected to give other viewers a useful guide on whether a movie is worth watching or even collecting - my comments here were meant to underline the ongoing industry damage that is still due pressure on major studies to respect the self-censorship recommendations of the Hayes Committee. On this database, such general comments are very quickly marked by readers as "not helpful" and I rarely do them. But fortunately, I still have room to add that this movie is, in my opinion, quite unusual and worth watching or even buying. It's wrong, but Kristine deBell gives a good performance, and the film gives a rather unique and rewarding experience. Overall, I would rate it on 7 stars and will buy a copy of the next DVD edition if and when it appears. If Mrs deBell is still alive today, I would like to hear her comments on both the attempts to suppress this film and the late recognition it has gradually achieved.
