I found this movie to be educational, entertaining and very moving. I was impressed when I learned how much justice Arbor had contributed to during her time in Kosovo. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is much under rated and it is good to see her again in a Canadian production. Other easily recognizable stars are Leslie Hope (24) and John Corbett (Sex in the City.) <br /> <br /> Although the story in this movie may not be quite true, I left with a desire to learn more about the word arbor. An amazing movie for inspiring young women. <br /> <br /> I say the movie is a "must see".
