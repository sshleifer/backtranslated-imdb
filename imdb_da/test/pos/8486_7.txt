I saw Ray when it first came out. Why? Partly because of advertising hype, secondly because I just loved that heel outa Ray Charles music. But he wasn't around when his biggest thing in music and his life happened, I wanted to learn more about man's life. And in this movie I did it. His dependence on drugs was something I didn't know and the film tells us. <br /> <br /> But here's the case while this was a decent autobiographical movie ... I can't say it was a "big" movie. I saw "Malcolm X" and was blown away. Same with "What has love to do with it" and "Birds". The performance of each of these films was excellent. I was not only drawn into the main characters of these films - who did incredible jobs - but also those around them. It helps to make a picture for me. I felt that in some parts of this movie was low and heavy handed to emotional appeal. And yes, I admit to certain parts of the movie, I almost fell asleep. And the movie was too long. And the movie excluded several "other" important details about Ray Charles's life that would have made the movie flow better. The movie was "chopped" for me in certain parts. And the movie seemed to end with a bump, not a bang - certain parts, including the end played as a dressed up "Lifetime" cable network movie for me. I expect more outa cinema. <br /> <br /> So - where does my ambivalence come in? With Jamie Foxx's performance. Overall, he did it okay. Not Denzel Washington's Malcolm X or Angela Bassett's Tina Turner is spectacular, but ... okay. <br /> <br /> Sorry people, but for me there were several points in the movie where I saw Jamie Foxx's interpretation of Ray Charles, and in others - thanks to the amazing camera angles and lighting - he saw "Ray Charles". But I've noticed ... the action. An actor must make you believe he is the character he plays. Not low caricature of the character. Did I think Jamie Foxx was Ray on the screen? Sometimes yes - sometimes no. <br /> <br /> Deserved Jamie Foxx and Golden Globe? You betcha. Does he deserve an Oscar ...? Depends on who he is against. He has a few bigger competitors there and he can just edge them out. But then again ... maybe not. If Jamie Foxx doesn't win, I won't get up and say "he was robbed". I don't really feel like he had been. <br /> <br /> This was a decent movie with decent performances and a decent story. A "great" autobiographical movie of late Ray Charles? No. Somewhere out there, I feel there is a big movie about Ray Charles, just waiting to be made and an actor who will blow you away completely in it.
