This movie was a lot of fun with just a little gore. These are two digging robberies that start business as usual when they discover that there is another client they can serve. This changes the direction of the bodies they collect. The film is told by the youngest of the two as he explains the business to a priest before being sent to beheaded. His partner had already been beheaded. The priest is obliged to abandon the last confession, and it takes the form of a story. There are some animations thrown in, giving it a Tales From the Crypt feel. In history, we meet another group of burial birds, all of whom fear, but at some point the younger of the two is offered a job so that it calms some of the hostility between the groups. When a woman joins the two men, she crosses the border and gets them into trouble with the dreaded grave birds. The story leads to the meeting of the two groups, which led to the arrest of the man who confesses and the man who has already lost his head.
