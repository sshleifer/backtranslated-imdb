On a routine mission in Iraq, a group of part-time soldiers is restoring a computer hard drive from an Alqueda training camp describing the location of weapon expert Dr Walsh. After witnessing the end of his top secret weapon development program, Dr. Walsh an alternative source of funding and creates a new research deep in the infamous Belzan forest in Chechnya, where he develops weapons and sells them to Chechen rebels. Delta's team is sent on a black ops mission to retrieve the doctor and his technology before the Russians find him and his lab. What the Delta team soon discovers is that doctors are the latest weapons being a bunch of large carnivorous bats that have been genetically modified to develop a taste for human flesh. I found this movie to be much better than what I expected. There is plenty of action and lots of blood. It is more or less what you would expect from a creative function. The action is not great, but it is acceptable. I've probably seen worse. Overall it is an enjoyable movie for what it is. A good popcorn movie.
