This is the classic case of a brilliant film seen for the sake of the American public because it did not have Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenneger as a leading man - Adrian Quinn has a better dual performance, it was right you heard the double performance of this movies than any of them have ever pulled away in their career! Anyway, now for the review ... The task is loosely based on the story of Carlos Jackal, a 1970s radical that terrorized Europe for years before finally being arrested by French agents. In this adaptation, an American naval officer (Adrian Quinn) is left in Israel when he is arrested by Mossad (Islesle's crack intelligence / counter-terrorism agency) and raised the question because he looks straight ahead as the hunt is the one extremely ostentatious part of the movie, but believe me it does not detract from the great value of this movie). Once discovered, Mr Ramirez is not Jackal, but he is recruited by a hardened CIA agent named Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, who makes his usual grizzled mysterious government figure routine but in a fantastic way) who has spent his life on The hunting hunt and the series of events that follow will capture anyone watching this movie - it is chock full of big-acting, without all the usual action movie clich√©s and one-liners and a great plot that will surprise anyone. The three leading men - Quinn, Sutherland and Kingsley - carry this movie much longer than their modest budget would have allowed anyone else to fill their shoes. Also kudos to the director and his staff are the camera's angles and filmography easier, especially in action scenes. The task is better than anyone who can rent it could ever expect, it is a shame that the film did badly in the cashier's office, or we can see a sequel to this amazing espionage thriller. 9/10 stars, this reviewer strongly recommends it to all potential viewers!
