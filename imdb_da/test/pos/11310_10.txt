"Medusa: Dare to be truthful" is a monstrous fun parody that is a good companion to the original, "Madonna: Truth or Dare". Julie Brown's brilliant creation spears Madonna's very entertaining documentary (though not exactly bold, insight, honest, or truthful) with a belief in detail right down to the packaging. I highly recommend this to Madonna fans, Julie Brown fans or anyone who has sharp and smart parody.
