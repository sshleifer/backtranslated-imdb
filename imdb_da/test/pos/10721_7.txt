Going beyond words is this heartbreaking story of a divorce that results in a tragic parenting over a seven-year-old boy. One of Kramer v. Kramer's great forces is its writer Robert Benton, who has wonderfully adapted Avery Corman's novel to the big screen. He keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic, while delivering all the drama right from the heart. His talent for telling emotional tales like this was to prove himself again with "Places in the Heart" where he showed, as in "Kramer v. Kramer", that he has a natural ability to work with children. The second strong point of the picture is the amazing play that deserved four of the film's nine Oscar nominations, two of which went away winners. One of them was Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor) who is fantastic as a frustrated businessman Ted Kramer, a man who forgot his wife is a person. As said, wife Joanne claimed Meryl Streep the supportive actress Oscar for a strong, sensitive depiction of a woman who had lost herself in eight years of marriage. Also nominated was Jane Alexander for his wonderful trip as Kramer's good friend Margaret. Finally the words of the plays must go to young Justin Henry whose incredible moving performance will find you choking tears over and over again, and a thoroughly deserved Oscar nomination came his way. <br /> <br /> Brilliant is also Nestor Almendros cinematography and Jerry Greenberg's timely editing, while Henry Purcell's classic piece is used to influence. <br /> <br /> It's really a touching story about how a father and son will trust each other when their wife and mother leaf. They grow together, get to know each other and form a whole new and wonderful relationship. Ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new outlook on life, and slowly comes to realize why Joanne has to go. Of course, if nothing else, "Kramer v. Kramer" shows that no one wins when it comes to a parental land over a young child, especially not the child himself. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 10, 1995 - TV <br /> <br /> Strong drama from Avery Corman's story of heartache in a custody of foreign parents, both of whom feel they have the best interests of the child. Apart from a fantastic manuscript and stunningly controlled direction, both from Robert Benton, it is the superlative cast that makes this image such a winner. Hoffman is brilliant as Ted Kramer, the man torn between his top career and his son, whom he desperately wants to keep. Also excellent is Streep, whom the woman lost in eight years of marriage, which had to go out before she turned into a person. In support of these two is a very strong Jane Alexander as common friend Margaret, an excellent Justin Henry as the boy caught in the middle, and a top cast of extras. This very emotional heart-rending drama more than deserved it is the 1979 Academy Awards for Best Movies, Best Actor (Hoffman) and Best Supporting Actress (Streep). <br /> <br /> Wednesday, February 28, 1996 - TV
