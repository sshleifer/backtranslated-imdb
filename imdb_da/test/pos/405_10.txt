Note: After writing this review, I see that this listing is actually about the TV series and not the original movie. My mistake. I thought IMDb for a database for movies, not TV shows. But since most people want to watch this movie under BAGDAD CAFE and not OUT OF ROSENHEIM, which weird is the name this movie is listed on IMDb, I will leave this comment here. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I missed something, but when I read the other review, it seemed to be quite a review of the CBS series - which may have been loosely based on this movie. I didn't see the TV shows, and I like it or not, but one thing I'm sure is that it's very different from this movie. This movie is not like a TV show at all, and Whoopie Goldberg is not in it or other famous Hollywood stars (except Jack Palance, who was very charming in his role). <br /> <br /> This is a terribly sweet movie that thinks "out of the box." It is not at all like a Hollywood formula film, which is probably why (what is a good word for idiots?) Who decides to market movies or not decided not to market it. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie caught my heart and imagination from get-go. From the music (which is just part of the time, so you can't really call it a musical) to the cinematography of the really cool story. A German or Bavarian woman (very pretty and pretty plump) is in an argument with the other German or Bavarian man with whom she travels through the California desert and shares roads with him - he leaves in the car and she leaves to get along even on a deserted and desert-like highway out in the middle of nowhere. She finds the small and fake but charming Baghdad Cafe, in Baghdad, California, and checks in. The rest of the story is magic. I will not try to describe this movie because I want you to enjoy every surprise. <br /> <br /> Warning: If you're racist or against big women, you don't like this movie, as main romantic lead is a big woman and characters of brown and red skin have big roles and are included as "part of the mix" without any racism involved. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 10 for originality, entertainment and pure joy.
