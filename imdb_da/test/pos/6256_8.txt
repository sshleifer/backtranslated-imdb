Okay, it wasn't the biggest horror movie I've ever seen in my life. However, despite being a lower budget, it is a pretty decent movie. The monsters are unique and trustworthy. Heck, they're even a little scary in the scenes, showing them briefly and destroying this poor family. Although, when you finally see the monsters completely, do you really think "WTF!? They are bitty things after them?!" The only part that really disturbed me is when * sniff * the killed cat! Not the cat, no, why? Seriously, if you're looking for hardcore violence and doing, it's not the movie for you. Go Rent The mountains have eyes or something along these lines. If you have small children, I would not recommend seeing this with themselves; probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room.
