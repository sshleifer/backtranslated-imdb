The fact that there was so much business is ironic, as the whole point of the program was to highlight the way the media treats such "taboo" topics, such as pedophilia. The newsdesk set, the suits, the alley presenters, the men on the stage shout for things you can see behind them, the pointless cgi graphs and statistics, it was all a satire, a very very funny satire. the way c-list celebrity will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them it will be good for their career ("there is no evidence of it but it is scientific fact"). It can be hard to see (with milly dowler and cambridgeshire girls as well as 9/11), but satire must challenge, and we shouldn't be afraid to stand up to the obvious crowbar hunger and overcoming media, just because it's a delicate case. How this show failed to win any TV awards for it is intelligence, observation, courage, acting and thought provocation is shameful, but as seeing it will show you, not at least surprisingly.
