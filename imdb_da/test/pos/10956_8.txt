Hi; Belmondo! Look, there is Anna Karina! Great American improvised New Wave (or Independent, you want to call it that), not as good as Godard or Truffaut, and not flawless, but hey such realism, style, warmth and humor. I love the NY accent; "You do not know anything!"; "Forget it". Like the French new wave, it is about young people; party, fall in love or just hang around. Lelia Goldoni is so sweet; she is cute; wonderful. Ben Carruthers also good, reminds me of Belmondo. A movie you don't forget. <br /> <br /> A stable 26.5 out of 31 ;-)
