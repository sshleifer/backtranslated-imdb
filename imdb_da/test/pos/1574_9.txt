Until I made a web search on "What Alice Found", I didn't realize that the movie's name is embedded in the title of one of Lewis Carroll's books. The book's complete title is "Through the look-glass (and what is there)". <br /> <br /> Alice of the movie comes from a completely different background than Lewis Carroll's Alice. However, her fresh and self-assured character is the same. The movie Alice begins as a young woman in New Hampshire who steals money from her robbing boss and leaves for Miami, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins. She meets a middle-aged couple in a home (the man's retired from the military) who saves her from a strange man at a road stop and from the car's degradation (perhaps caused by their mechanisms). <br /> <br /> As it turns out, the couple is heavily involved in stopping prostitution and seeing cute, young Alice as a promising recruitment. The wife (played by Judith Ivey in a show that is worthy of a great price) buys Alice sexy clothes and shows her how to use hot makeup. Initially Alice accepts passively his ministries, and with the couple's instructions he makes several tricks. The meeting shown in detail is quite different from most cinematic sex, but can typically be what most often happens in real life. The man is shy and reverent and apologizes for "finishing" too quickly. What is wonderful about Alice (and differently from her prototypes from Clarissa to Sister Carrie) is that she learns from her experiences and claims herself. That's how it is. Prostitution is everywhere. People are neither good nor bad. Alice leaves home with her well-deserved money and a sense of mutual respect.
