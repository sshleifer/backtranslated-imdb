This film characterizes the early 80's and FUN !! I remember watching this movie on HBO when I was a kid, and that was my favorite movie. Since it was a while ago, no one had ever met what it was. So, if the time my roommate had said she had seen it too, and that it was her favorite, they started printing again !! Luckily I have a copy now !! If anyone ever wants to see the biggest (cheesy) scavenger hunt that was probably the beginning of ideas of hazing for frats, this movie is it !!! (Watcher - must have a serious love for cheesy 80's type of movie !!)
