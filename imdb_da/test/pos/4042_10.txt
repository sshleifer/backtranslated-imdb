First, I remember vaguely being told this story in elementary school, about 6 or 7 years ago, so I'm a little familiar with the story. Many of it, however, has changed, and there are many differences and errors (sometimes unnecessary) in the movie that die hard fans will not appreciate. <br /> <br /> But overall, I really love this movie. I first saw it near Christmas about 2 years ago (good 1st part) and caught it all over again at Christmas, probably on the same channel. I was very impressed, it can sometimes be a little overdrawn and long, but with an engaging story making it decent to perform (especially from frosty Fonda and Hobbs) and beautiful scenery, costume and touch with magic, make this a truly special movie - which I really like about Christmas. <br /> <br /> In spite of the differences from the book, I think the movie makes it good to incorporate new themes and ideas (seasons with autumn, winter, etc. I think a new thief character to represent the fall) throughout The picture, when you notice, is pretty scary and excellently executed. <br /> <br /> I live in the UK so I've been waiting a long time on the DVD, and fortunately I saw an ad showing a number of free DVDs offered in the Daily Mail newspaper that I Not usually get so I got in yesterday's edition and finally have my DVD. If you have missed it and want this rare DVD for region 2, I suggest you collect tokens from the Daily Mail and send them out as your DVD will be delivered at Christmas. <br /> <br /> So, for a bit of escape into the Christmas season this year, grab your fire, have fun and look at this as you and children will really enjoy this amazing movie. If you don't, it will probably be repeated on Channel 4 this Christmas, so record it!
