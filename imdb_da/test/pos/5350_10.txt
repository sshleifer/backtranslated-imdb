In 1989, Aardman Animations introduced the two heroes of The Grand Day Out. In 1993, they fought for an evil penguin in The Wrong Trousers. And in 1995 they had to rescue sheep from a vicious robot dog in A Close Shave. In 2005, they are back and they have to fight something that used to be sweet and dingy in the curse of Were-Rabbit. In this full feature film Wallace and Gromit work in Anit-Pesto, a pest control. There will be a huge vegetable competition, but rabbits continue to eat the neighbor's vegies. Wallace and Gromit take care of that problem. But Wallace had an idea. He will brainwash the rabbits with his machine. After doing so, something suddenly eats all the roads in the neighborhood, and that's great. It's up to Wallace and Gromit to save the day. As a fan of these two characters, I was impressed. It kept what the previous three chapters had, and instead added many Hollywood actors to voice-overs, they didn't say a name for the job and the boy, they did a great job. Wallace and Gromit have not changed. Wallace is still the cheese-loving freak he always was, and Gromit is the silent newspaper reading dog. Also the script was not too shabby as other family films were. There is a twist of who the rabbit is really. The direction from Nick Park (the director of the 3 previous chapters) does a really good job with the story. Instead of adding the Hollywood formula to it, he just took the style of the previous chapters and added a bit of a dark fantasy twist to it. Well, Nick. The rabbits are also fun and cute, but the funniest rabbit in the movie is the one that has the mix of Wallace in him. The signs were not bad, and they were not annoying, but they will never top Wallace and Gromit. The animation is actually amazing and wonderful. I have never seen a clay animated movie that is so amazing since the Chicken. Overall, fans of the two knuckleheads (including teens) will love this amazing movie. It is a well-finished film that will have an Oscar next year. Hooray, Wallace and Gromit. 10.10
