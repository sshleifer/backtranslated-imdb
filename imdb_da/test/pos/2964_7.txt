A love story for me is whether I like the characters or also if they click on each other. Matt is rather unlikeable: remote, braggart, apparently lazy and a misogynist. He has been badly injured by his dysfunctional mother, and it makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction - he was trustworthy. He overcompensates that afterwards he has nails Amy. He seems so cool about Amy that he knocks out twice. When they talk, he can't show her who he really is. She empathizes and then stonewalls him in just the right moments. She seems so mature and strong that the features that come out later did not seem to fit. (For me.) I found her to be incredibly sexy and beautiful. . . girl next door nicely, I call it. So I would like this movie unless it really turned up. <br /> <br /> Funny things happened to the coach, but Matt's relationship with the other coach was inspiring. Football scenes at the end were confusing. Matt does not carry the ball but seems to be a block back. People, he's not the right size! He is fifty pounds for light for that position. But I thought his action was good. I measure it by the way I wanted to twist my neck a few times during his scenes with Meredith Monroe. The movie was okay. Meredith M was better than okay.
