Now it might have something to do with seeing this movie at a low point in my life when I was really trying to figure out where I went and what I needed to make me happy, but this movie spoke really to me. Jane is an everywoman: though she has so many positive things for her, she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life. She is strong and intelligent, but she was cheated by reaching her potential by an unfortunate accident and living another choice life. She seeks new challenges and happiness and desperately seeks to fill the gap in the heart. Dreya Weber is an exquisite Jane. As we travel with her, we feel the depth of her despair, the torture of her desperation and finally the strength of her beliefs. The beautiful Addie Yungmee is also very well cast and an asset to the production. Allison Mackie is a scene stealing as a fun character with impeccable timing. I highly recommend this movie; Although it is a low budget, it has large budget writing and production values. PS-big air scenes with two beautiful sexy women. Women will love the story and the characters, but there is also something for the men here. :)
