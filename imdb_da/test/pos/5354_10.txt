There are a few aspects to Park's movies, and especially Wallace & Gromit, which I would say make them so great. The first is subtlety and observation whose flagship is the character of Gromit. He does not speak, he makes no noise, all he has is his eyes, forehead and body position, and with these he orders the film. Park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression. Comedy and emotions are conveyed through the subtle movements, and it works great well. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie you need to pay attention to the entire screen. Normally, you will be guided to things in the movies, the screen will not be too much, there will not be many things to take your eyes off of the main idea or action. Park seems to need to look the other way with its films. He throws extra content into the audience, acting in the background, to the side of the screen, just outside the screen, and there is almost always something in the foreground to spot. His film is about more views and discoveries, they are layered with jokes and help actions. <br /> <br /> Throughout this movie there are layers of things going on the screen, jokes in the foreground perhaps on a jar label and background shadows that give away action. You can imagine that for Park, the movies have always been an event and the movies he loves are the ones he wants to see over and over again. That is what shows in his film and through his most beloved characters. Then there are the bizarre and crazy inventions that Wallace does, something reflected in the story and the twists of plot, everything is bizarre and out of the wall, but it seems so normal in this world. You can imagine that inside Park is Wallace's mind. <br /> <br /> There is also one thing that makes these movies so unique, that is modeling and precise hand animation. I must admit I was worried when I knew Dreamworks was involved in this movie and I thought they would bring their computer animation experience to the forefront. What I was afraid of was Wallace & Gromit, who became CGI units, or at least CGI was used to clear up the modeling that brought the movie. <br /> <br /> Not so. You can still see thumbnails and tool marks on the characters, and far from distracting from the movie, this adds as much to a true sense of it and a sense of physical depth to the characters and scene on the screen. <br /> <br /> So what about the movie? Now I have to say that the plot twist was something I had thought of well before the movie was in the cinema, and it came as no surprise, but it does not affect my pleasure a little. In fact, the angry looks unfold, and the imagination time for the discovery and reactions was all, and it just so sucked me in as if it were a thriller, but yet I was laughing. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was fascinating in various ways. To see the animation completed, how wild the inventions are, how Wallace comes into trouble and Gromit gets him out where all cross references are in the movie and where all the jokes are! I have to admit to talking to my friends afterwards, I couldn't believe how much I had missed. <br /> <br /> There is something else in this movie than with the others who are a new level of adult humor in here, and I don't mean rude jokes (though there are a couple who are just as British, You don't laugh, I mean jokes that simply fly over the kids' heads, but turn adults into the face. The kind you are used to seeing comes out of a place like Pixar. This adds even more appeal to the movie. <br /> <br /> Okay, let me try to be a little negative here. I did not notice the voices in this movie, you know how you normally listen to the actors and see if you can recognize them? Well, I was just too wrapped up in the movie to look after or to see who they were ... okay, it's not negative. Let me try again. The main plot was not as strong and poignant as I had expected, and I found myself trapped in the side stories and the characters themselves ... again ... it's not a bad thing, the movie was just so much real entertainment. I honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie, probably the worst thing I could say is that the title sequence at the end is pretty repetitive ... until the final title! Really, that's the worst thing I can say. The story is very fun, well looked after, well written, well done. There are many fantastic characters here, not just Wallace & Gromit. There is so much on the screen, so many references and jokes (check out Lady Tottingham's dresses), cheese jokes everywhere, jokes for the whole family. The characters are amazingly absorbent and you will find that you have taken them before you realize. There is so much in this movie for everyone. There is so much I could say and write about, but I know it quickly turns into a back-slapping exercise for Park and Aardman, it would also become a series of "this bit was really fun" and "there is little, when ... "and what I would rather do is tell you this is a great movie, to watch it and to experience it all for yourself. However, I would say that the bunnies are excellent!
