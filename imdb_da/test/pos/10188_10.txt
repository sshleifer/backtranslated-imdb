I'm not a Disney fan at all, but I happen to be in Orlando for a friend's wedding. So my travel partner and I went to Disney for a few days. I haven't seen a good 3-D effect in, yes .. always. So I usually try to stay away from these presentations. The 3-D effect in this was so good. I'm an adult man of 38 and even I wanted to try to reach out and touch. It's so good! Word of advice. At the end you see the back of the theater on the wall. Put it that way ... the first time I saw that the effect didn't work. So I told my friend ... "It would have been good if ...." My friend said, "That's exactly what happens. It doesn't work for some reason." It's a great show. You will not be disappointed !!!
