I sell the dead circles around convicted tomb robber Arthur Blake. Blake's friend and other tomb robber Willie Grimes have just been executed, and Blake will follow after the next morning. While sitting in his cell waiting for his execution, a priest named Far Duffy comes in and asks him if he will tell everything he has seen as a rough robber. He then goes on to give father Duffy a quasi-biography of his more interesting exploits. <br /> <br /> The reason is basically multiple events that are bound only by chronology. This prevents the viewer from getting bored, but it also makes events less significant, as you can easily add or remove many scenes without noticing much. Though it was wrong, overall I thought this method added the fun loving nature of the movie and kept it very entertaining. Most of the different stories are good, especially the alien, Murphy's and the vampire, but others were not that big. The play isn't amazing, but I didn't find it bad at any point. Dominic Monaghan had a good performance as he managed to be serious as it was important and also play very well into the movie's comic parts. <br /> <br /> The characters were not very profound, but they were all interesting. I also enjoyed how a number of bad guys were done in an over-the-top almost cartoon way. The part with Murphy's and their gang's story is invaluable. So overall, I sell the dead very successfully along with horror, comedy and sci-fi in a mish mash of fun and excitement. It's one of the more interesting and original movies I've seen for a while, and it's unfortunate that independent movies like this don't get more recognition.
