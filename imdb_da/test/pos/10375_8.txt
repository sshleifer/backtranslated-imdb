David Suchet is Agatha Christie's late Detective Poirot in "After the Funeral", produced in 2005. Anyone who has heard David Suchet speak to his own British accent knows what a shock is, because his accent as Poirot is so perfect and organic for the character. Suchet is the Poirot of Agatha Christie's books, and although I acknowledge a love for Peter Ustinov in the role, his notion has little to do with what Christie wrote. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Poirot is being asked by a lawyer to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients. Driving on the train, the lawyer tells the events after death - a strange will matures the expected heir and the statement of the husband's sister that he was murdered. When Poirot meets with the family, he discovers horror, many secrets, another will and murder. The story is excellent with rich production values ​​and a wonderful detailed depiction of the time period. All that play is amazing, especially from Monica Dolan, who plays Miss Gilchrist. Poirot here is without Hastings, his beautiful office or Miss Lemon, but he's still effective. <br /> <br /> I had the privilege of seeing David Suchet on Broadway in "Amadeus". Breathtaking. What an actor - when he plays Poirot, I just see IS Poirot.
