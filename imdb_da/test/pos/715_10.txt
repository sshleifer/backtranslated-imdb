I saw this the second night at a local station because I didn't want to see tripe as "American Idol". Peter Strauss gives a great performance as a judge called 'Rain' Murphy, who holds himself. He admits his crime and makes no bones that he does not feel ashamed of it. His cell is afraid of any comfort that other inmates have books and pictures. The only time he feels in another zone is running. He does it often and can drive a kilometer in under four minutes. When a collegiate trainer hears about it, he will boast him for a shot in the Olympics. In the beginning, 'Rain' wants no part of this, but when his best friend is killed, he shows interest. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie season. Strauss is very good (what did you expect, any less?) And Michael Mann shows hints of greatness that would come full bloom years later. This movie had that kind of realism (probably because it was filmed among prisoners). It almost feels like this was a true story. The extra casting is good. There are many notable names like Brian Dennehy, Roger E. Mosley and Richard Moll as well. <br /> <br /> My heart sank as some pompous boards wouldn't let him run because he didn't make it feel bad for his crime. His final act made me stand up and cheer. When they took their dreams away, he took them back hard. This was back when television films were actually good. 'The Jericho Mile' is a gem of a movie. ESPN Classic, PLEASE SHOW THIS FILM !!!
