An off beat but very nice performance by John Travolta sets off this very fun comedy. His interpretation of the archangel is like a scuffy, womanizing, overweight ladies man. And he certainly has a fascinating effect on the women he meets on his trip to Chicago. John Hurt is very low entered in his role as Chief Reporter for Chicago Tabloid Owner, Bob Hoskins. Angie MacDowell plays a great role as she did her part in "Four Weddings and Funeral." Maureen Stapleton is neat in a cameo. Her commentary, "Michael does not suffer fool", is just one of many memorable moments. Bob Hoskins is the only one of the leading performing artists who fails to connect, slightly away from the wall. Essentially you are there to see Michael take on a bull, immerse waitresses and lady dancers in a western style restaurant, and fully demonstrate that he is totally free soul. It's a memorable comedy that's worth more than one view.
