Beautiful, emotional and subtle. I watch this movie at an art center with a smaller screen in a movie room with 95% of older people. I want a bigger movie theater that Lowes around here would show it. Great filmography by Wong and Christopher Doyle. Since I understand Cantonese, it is much easier for me to understand the movie. As simple as the story goes, many English-speaking viewers did not get the whole story. Three old ladies next to me keep yapping and have no traces of the movie. <br /> <br /> Spoiler; They were surprising when I mentioned that Mr. Chow slept with Mrs. Chen and they have a son. She went to Singapore and tried to tell him, but didn't. <br /> <br /> Spoiler <br /> <br /> Mandarin translation of file title actually means blooming as moment or memory. The term usually used to describe beautiful and wonderful memory that was uncorrected and short. The whole movie fits most of the title. Not to mention the flourishing "Cheung Sam". My favorite scene was definitely the street corner in the alley. It looks so beautiful, the sun is shining on the old and faded wall, at night in the dark, in the rain, really a poetic moment. I felt a strong sense of intimacy in their relationship as they stood against the wall and spoke quietly. I felt a terrible heartache when Mr Chow raised his departure pattern and Mrs Chen wept on his shoulder .... Bravo Wong Kar-Wai! As much as I like this, Chungking Express is still my favorite. But I also want to give this one 10. As a point of reference, CTHD only got 7. <br /> <br /> If you love art, you'll love this movie. Do not miss it.
