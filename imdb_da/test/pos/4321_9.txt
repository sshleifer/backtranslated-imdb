The lost writers have surpassed themselves. Season two finals are even more heartbreaking and intense than the finals for season 1. Locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him, but can he possibly escape from the island? He has to stay alive. I have no doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge. This final has left more questions than the previous finals; and I can't wait for the fall. <br /> <br /> A side note: What is the purpose of writing a review just to write all the spoilers? Where is the pleasure of destroying the surprise of everyone else? The current review on this site is nothing but a great fat spoiler celebration, poorly constructed in barely readable English with the express purpose of making anyone angry. Good work.
