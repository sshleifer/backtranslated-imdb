Incredibly close to the real life feelings and feelings captured by Joseph Mazzello as a hemophiliac child hit by AIDS and his new young neighbor, a will-be hard redneck played to perfection by Brad Renfro. Although the story may seem a little farfetched (the two boys are trying to flee hundreds of miles to find a doctor who claims to have cure for AIDS), emotions, actions and interactions of all people involved are tragically close to real life. Being a "big brother" to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released, I highly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in a child's AIDS life. Outstanding direction by Peter Horton creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship, disease, prejudice and the final farewell of two friends who struggled hard to overcome adversity.
