This two set is incredible! If you are like me and never had the opportunity to watch the band live, then it is the second best. Jimmy Page, which in my opinion is the second best guitarist ever to walk on the Earth's surface (second only to Slowfingers themselves), he puts a fantastic show in every piece of footage in this movie. John Paul Jones, although not looking up front, puts a hell of a show. Although in the living atmosphere, his rhythmic baselines are not defined as they are on studio recordings, except of course in songs such as Dazed and Confused, or what is and what should never be, but his wide range of institutional talent is well represented in these DVDs. John Bonham is John Bonham, what can I say? There is no comparison, his beats stand out like no other, and this DVD is a proof. Last but not least, Robert Plant awakens, which no one else can cry. If you've ever read Hammer of the Gods, you'll wonder what Side was when he first met Robert Plant, why the hell isn't this guy already famous? And then my review, excuse and spelling or grammar errors, Zeppelin clips are completed.
