It's less visceral than the only other Tsai movie I've seen ("Vive L'amour"), but the idea of ​​doorways (holes) in the feelings and existence of others is depicted alive here as Tsai shoots long shots, usually as with long moves, suggesting a sense of alienation in Taipei. The musical interludes, inspired by Grace Chang, are confusing but welcome mile markers that add new dimensions to the slowly evolving relationship between the young man on top and the woman underneath. It is not necessarily an easy movie to watch (although it is not heavily handled in any way), so I will warn all informal viewers looking for some "indie" entertainment (like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie). But if you want to know something about isolation among city dwellers in Taiwan, and something more universal about city sales and romantic longing, look at the movie file right away.
