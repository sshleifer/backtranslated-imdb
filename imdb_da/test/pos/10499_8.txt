There is not much that can be said about this flick .... the plot is quite simple: Two police officers (who also happen to be lovers) use a brothel as an effort to catch a criminal by "lady of the house", the game of hardcore pornstar Chloe. As anyone can guess, there are a few plot twists and some blurry alliances, but the writing was just awful, even for a softcore movie. I've read some previous posts about Nicole Hilbig's accent (she plays the female policeman). Yes, it's hard to understand what she says at times, but I think I've put it. I sniffed some around .... I think she's from Germany, and thus her odd-sounding accent. She gives an impression herself without speaking, but ... she has a nice body. <br /> <br /> There were a couple of "rear" sex scenes in this movie that were pretty graphic for a softcore movie. ... excellent work there. The three-way stage towards the end was not bad either. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> I knew the female policeman was going to be a part-time call girl at the end. She enjoyed her three way way too much. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * <br /> <br /> I don't want to nitpick about the story too much, as this is a low budget, direct-to-video softcore flick. But it looks like I've seen too many movies in this genre with a similar story. Women: B (Chloe and Hilbig were okay as eyes-so) Sex: B + (scenes were a little short but good) History: C (a recycle list, but what works, eh?) Overall: B-
