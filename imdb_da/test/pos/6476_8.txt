"Knute Rockne All American", the biopic about the famous Notre Dame beloved coach Knute Rockne, is an excellent sports movie to watch. Without seeing it, we were amazed at the technique used in the film by director Lloyd Bacon, showing that he was ahead of his time in shooting football matches. The result is a vivid picture of the man responsible for the legacy of the Knute Rockne collegiate sport. <br /> <br /> The film presents Rockne from his humble origins in Chicago for his studies at the famous Notre Dame University in South Bend, Indiana. He was an ambitious man who had a vision of how the game should be played. Fortunately, he went to give his beloved Notre Dame the glory he was after. Pat O'Brien looks a little older when he starts as a freshman. In fact, he doesn't change much in the whole movie, but he is good as Mr. Rockne. Pat O'Brien shows he could inspire players under him by just being a grandfather. Gale Page plays Bonnie Rockne, the wise woman who understood her husband's call in life. Ronald Reagan plays George "The Gipper" Gipp, who was a legend who died too young but left a legacy behind. Donald Crisp makes a great contribution as father John Callahan, who was Rocknes mentor at the university. <br /> <br /> This movie will delight not only sports because of LLoyd Bacon's direction and the fast pace he gives to the movie.
