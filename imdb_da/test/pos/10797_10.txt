In one of the more under-watched films in the late 1980s, at a time when Oliver Stone drove high with Platoon and Wall Street (and before his opus born on the fourth of July), he wrote and ruled it look at the radios world, especially a radio host in the middle of Texas. This man is Barry Champlain, once in a career trip from Eric Bogosian, who wrote the original game and also wrote the script. Barry is like a mix of Howard Stern and one of the pundits you hear on the radio stations many of us can turn off. He has ideas about his mind and opinions, and he is not only afraid to talk to them, but also to stand up against telephone callers. In fact, the callers are the driving force of the film, which Barry must fight against the mindless, the indecent, the racist, and the purely absent minded. As this happens, he must also fight with his boss (Alec Baldwin) and a hit or miss deal to go nationwide outside the border of the southern road station he's in. <br /> <br /> While you've seen the movie I felt curious to see how it would have been done on stage (I could imagine it was a one-man show since Bogosian has had several on the side), the film's direction is phenomenal. Stone has been known, almost typecast, as director who loves quick cuts, the limitless effects of assembly and effects with the style of camera work and other small tricks that give his films in the 90s a distinctive, almost author-look. But in the 80s, he had this energy and feverish quality for the film's appearance, and was not as scary as the other films. To add the right intensity that is within the studio and the main room of Barry Champlain, he and the DP make the Robert Richardson the room to be claustrophobic at times, gritty, uncertain, and certainly on the edge. The scenes in the middle of the movie, when Barry is not in the studio, are quite standard, but the style along with the fabric in the radio scenes is among the best I've seen from the Stone / Richardson combination. <Br /> <br /> And you can't miscalculate the notion of Bogosian, which can be unpleasant, offensive, angry, passive, and everything we love and hate in radio programs. There is also a fun, near-distracting supportive role for Michael Wincott as Kent / Michael / Joe, who prank him one night, and the next is invited to the studio. These scenes are a little unpleasant for a viewer, but it goes a long way in the subculture's main room in the 80s that Barry is so fascinated that he is critical of it. Stoner must not "get it" but as he says to him "it's your show". It is actually difficult to cover everything that goes on within the talk and there is a lot of it. But it's never boring, and like Champlain itself, it's not easy to ignore. And when Bogosian enters his climatic tire in the air, with the background around in a continuous 360-spin, it becomes intoxicating and a reason why freedom of speech is so powerful. Stone has been synonymous with a film-maker of hot-button issues that take on issues that were or are still controversial, giving them a life-force that is not always great, but is all his own. Here his competencies and ambitions do not get in the way of the Bogosian - it is reinforced if there is something that makes a very good view of what is essentially a close-up show, which in itself is already well-written.
