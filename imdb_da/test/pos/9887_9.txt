Many movies try to take universal themes and make a comedy; but few will rise to the apartment as "Checking Out." The movie is brilliant. The dialogue is well-written and true to form. The action is just fine. Peter Falk has given a really good performance - as an actor as an actor. He is able to carry the cast to greatness. Another great achievement is given by Laura San Giacomo. She is such an exciting actress. Her performances take a surprise. She delivers whatever role she is asked to give - from Wacko in Stephen King's "The Stand" to her television shows. But "Checking Out" allows her to shine. It's a role she has to play. The film is brilliantly directed by Jeff Hare. He was able to bring out the best in his throw and his direction - in every aspect - made the movie a wonderful treasure. Jeff Hare was able to make a difficult theme ridiculous and yet deep. He gives us a close and personal look at why indie films should be made. The director's knowledge of his cast and script is extended to the finished film. The results are amazing. Hopefully it will be available to large audiences, because this is one you will not miss. It has the potential to be sleeping here in 2005 - in the fashion of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding."
