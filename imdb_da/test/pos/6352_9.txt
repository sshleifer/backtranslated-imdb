Excellent introspective / interpersonal piece that really had some teeth for it without feeling hopeless or worse, manipulative and artificially satisfying. Can also be a good double function with American Beauty. Best performance to date I've seen from Anita Mui, and every actor in this seems like a power plant. Hats off to Ann Hui for the direction and Ivy Ho for the brilliant script. Seriously one of the best dramas I've seen in a while, especially if you have a taste for classical literature ALA poetry. Again, excellent.
