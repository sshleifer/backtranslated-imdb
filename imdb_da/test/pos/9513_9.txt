As a play, it is hard to fault Nihon chinbotsu. The Japanese people have benefited from their intimate relationship with the ocean, and the film's concept implies that an entire world and lifestyle is in danger - thanks to its volcanic heritage. From reality it is quite stupid to have a drama where all of Japan disappears under the waves; Why just Japan? <br /> <br /> Instead, suppose we have the movie world burned by acting (and popcorn), and some may find this right influence. Compared to adventures with Japanese radioactive monsters, it looks like more mature and better paced. The emotional element is underplayed and it really works. (It does lose a bit with the overblown theme song on the climax.) <br /> <br /> Is Nihon chinbotsu trustworthy? Probably not, but the exciting outbursts and the relaxed pacing make it a more enjoyable entertainment one would expect one night.
