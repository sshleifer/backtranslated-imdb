Madonna turns into action again and she fails again! Who is the girl released only a year after the huge flop of Shangai Surprise and two after the successful cult movie Desperately seeks Susan. She chose to act in it to forget the flop of the previous film, not suspecting that the latter could also be a flop. The film received a poor acceptance of American critics and audiences, while in Europe it was a success. Madonna says, "Some people don't want her to succeed both as a pop star and a movie star." The Soundtrack album, where she sings four tracks, sells well, and the title track single was hit all over the world, just as in the World Tour. The truth is that Madonna failed as an actress because the script was rather weak. Butit is not that bad, especially for those who like the 80s: It's such a shake, trash can, colorful and happy action movie! At the end it is very fun to see it.
