This movie would have shamed the typical Hollywood "tearjerkers". The portrayed emotions are subdued and undervalued in a very pleasant way. The plot is clich√© enough with a major role in terminal disease (this is not a spoiler and was well established quite early in the film) The method of execution is somehow unique from most love stories you've ever seen - not even a kiss was exchanged And yet you will feel the immense flow of love between the two leaders. In the beginning, I assumed this "limitation of emotion" to be something analogous to the typical "eastern values", but later decided it. <br /> <br /> This movie is so underestimated that if you compare it to movies like "Cinema Paradiso", CP would have felt overtly manipulative by comparison. So it's certainly not everyone's cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Having watched the movie, I have this strong feeling that Hollywood loves movies (or loves movies all the way to be precise) has been glorious romance or passion and feeling it as "love." I'm sure we all have our own definitions, and I don't want to say that these qualities are mutually exclusive. But I would dare say that the movie will let you wonder if there is any extra dimension you have with you. It is very obvious that I enjoy this movie a lot. Considering the fact that the film is so common in appearance, it is paradoxically one of the more "cinematic" films I saw last.
