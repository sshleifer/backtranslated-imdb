I first heard about this movie from a friend. She loved it and always looked at it. When she told me and said how old it was, I immediately decided I didn't like it. I was so wrong. Dirty Dancing was such a great movie! I love the music and the dance. I bought the soundtrack and DVD immediately after watching it. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray were brilliant in it. They caught the emotions and feelings of the characters as well. They were both so good dancers. After watching the movie I wanted to dance like them, and hopefully I will go to ballroom and Latin dance soon. I've become a fan of that kind of dance and are now hooked on all the movies and programs about it. Dirty Dancing revealed my passion for dance and music. My favorite parts of the movie is when Baby enters the staff's headquarters and sees them dancing and of course the last scene where Baby and Johnny dance together in front of everyone. I think everyone should see Dirty Dancing at least once in their lifetime. If they don't, it's their loss !!
