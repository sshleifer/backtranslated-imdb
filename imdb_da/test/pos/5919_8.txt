This film recreates Lindbergh's historic aircraft across the Atlantic while touching episodes in his aviation career through flashbacks. Stewart was about 20 years old to play the young flier, but his fine performance, especially in the solo flight sequences, makes this a less ambiguous one. Waxman's rousing score is a big plus. Despite the long running time, Wilder manages to make it quite exciting and can maintain the drama even though the result is known. What a year 1957 was for Wilder: he also wrote and directed "Love in the afternoon" and "Witness the prosecution". And his next two were "Some Like It Hot" and "The Apartment." What a race!
