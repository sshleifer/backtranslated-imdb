Alfred Hitchcock's remake of "The Man Who Went Too Much" is not considered to be as good as the original, but for me it is one of the best movies ever. I prefer it to "Vertigo" and "Rear Window." As "North By Northwest", it is the story of an average man who involuntarily is thrown into a world of international intrigue. James Stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he fails an international spy. He will do everything possible to make sure that he gets his son back and protects his family. <br /> <br /> While the original was good on time, it's hard to look to today's standards. Remake has excellent production quality, a bold Doris Day, and a really creepy villain. <br /> <br /> Don't bother renting this one because you want to see it over and over again.
