I participated in a screening of "Fierce People" at the 2006 Woodstock Film Festival. I hesitate to feel it a "premiere" of any kind since it was shot in the spring of 2004 and had its world premiere at Tribeca in 2005. It played several festivals that year. The release seemed imminent, then it disappeared. Poof. Disappeared. Or it seemed to be the film-forming public. The smokers of a theatrical or DVD release have popped up now and then, but all turned out to be unfounded. Then, this screening was announced. Maybe you can call it a "re-premiere?" It felt like I was witnessing a buried treasure. And what a treasure it was. I suppose you could characterize "Fierce People" as a com-in-time drama. But it also has elements of comedy and tragedy, as well as mystery. And a little farce thrown in. In short, the reality. It makes it difficult to pigeonhole, which puts it more into the category of an indie as opposed to a Hollywood movie. But its high production values, large budget measurements and star caliber molding work in contrast to the indie mark. So let's call it a hybrid. And perhaps it has been "lost". It counts categorization. <br /> <br /> Meet Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin), 15, whose father is absent. In fact, Finn has never known him. But he sees him and hears him through the collection of home videos sent from South America. Father is a famous anthropologist, and has made a name for himself by creating a store with Yanomani, the tribe "Fierce People" that lives to kill and grow well. All their activities are built around the two "tasks" and Finn is imprisoned. Mother liz (diane lane) is also somewhat absent. Although physically present, she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol. Then Finn becomes an adult in his little lonely world with his film reels. <br /> <br /> One summer, Mother decides to pull Finn along with her into the wilderness of New Jersey. A massage therapist has given mother a wealthy client, Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland, in a tour de force performance), and he has invited her to an extended house call on her palatial property. Osborne's "tribe" includes a selection of eccentric rich children, servants and village idiots, among whom Finn finds himself as part of his own anthropological study. Will his experience with father's movies help him survive as a guest of this tribe? Will he be accepted? Or will he be regarded as an outsider who at the same time struggles with his own identity as a youth? Such is the language of the language, and I assume it would be, if not for the dark subbelly, that director Griffin Dunne and author Dirk Wittenborn have infused in this amazing story. <br /> <br /> With Anton Yelkin's voice transmission, Finn must learn to go back to being a teenager, he never really had a chance to be, stop being a parent of his mother, allow newborn mother to be parent to him and learn responsibility on the road to adulthood as it should have taken place all the time. Still, he has to make this transformation into a dangerous, dark world where playing with fire is foolishness to this broken family. This is primarily a story-driven movie, and Griffin Dunne highlighted so much in intro to the movie. He bought the rights to Wittenborn's novel, even as it was written, and Wittenborn's own manuscript comes to life in the masterful Dunnes hands in a way that is a wonders. <br /> <br /> This is also basically a character-driven movie, and Sutherland has never been better. His star, like Osborne, becomes stunned around me and will probably leave you amazed. Diane Lane's character ultimately shows so many personalities that it's hard to imagine another actor pulling it so well. She is breathtaking. But more than anything, "Fierce People" is Anton Yelkin's film. He has a long CV as a children's actor, but very little like a teenager. Apart from the little known "House of D" (also a gem), he is best known as Byrd on TV's "Huff." In January he is seen in "Alpha Dog" (also on the shelf since 2004, a movie I watched Sundance this year, and where he is "heart and soul"). His performance here goes far beyond what one would expect from such a young, and is nothing short of spectacular. <br /> <br /> This complex, quirky movie has been out of sight long enough. "Fierce People" is a treasure filled with light and shade, comedy and tragedy, joy and pathos, but most of them are wondering.
