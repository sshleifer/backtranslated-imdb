This movie is not about soda, nor is it the French connection. The seven ups are a group of elite policemen who use tactics that are not consistent with the NYPD protocol. Scheider leads the group with his posse or regular looking joes. They run surveillance on a local costra nostra cartel, and things go wrong when a policeman is found. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Richard Lynch, the most vicious man in film (Invasion: America, Little Nikita) and his partner end up killing the chief of police accidentally and escaping from Scheider in the coolest hunting scene I've seen , Bullitt and French Connection are not as good as the one on the West Side to George Washington and on the Palisades Parkway in New Jersey. <br /> <br /> Stunt drivers are great, and Lynch is free even though he looks scared out of the dangerous journey. Roy Scheider is almost killed when his car crashes into the rear Mack truck ripping his vehicle's roof. <br /> <br /> Things come to mind and you have to watch out for such a sequence. Fast movement and intense, fresh for thirty years.
