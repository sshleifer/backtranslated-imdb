I remember when this movie came out and saw it a couple of times on VHS. I was so happy when it was finally released on DVD. I was hoping for widescreen but at that time would take what was available. I love how they used color in the movie, the outdoor scenes are so vibrant with color. The trees are the greenest I've ever seen. Most of the film was shot in Stillwater, Minnesota, a beautiful town located on St. Croix River. They really have to investigate movie recording sites because they did a good job. The story is well written and directed. I would rate this as one of Peter Horton's best. I'm also surprised that Andrew Dintenfass (director of photography) hasn't done more. He did an incredible job. The actor also rises up there. It's great to see two actors of such a young age pulling out this type of movie. Annabella Sciorra did a good job as Dexter's mother. Who wouldn't have her as a mother.
