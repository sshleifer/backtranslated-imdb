I really like this movie. I don't like it just because it's a great early 80's movie with a big soundtrack, but I found out that it has some thoughtful moments. They are just moments; not the whole movie. It is certainly not "less than zero". The scenarios typically address peer pressure and also with more difficult problems, such as betrayal of trust. These problems are not easily solved or forgotten by the signs. Certain scenes will stand out and invite reflection on one's own teen experiences, and how these experiences may have influenced one's character and prospects as an adult. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and think about the problems young adults face and about your own experiences. Or you may just be aware of the boy's attempt to eradicate himself! :) Whatever it is a good movie.
