This movie is definitely one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told at a steady pace, most of it not told by words, but by cinematic expressions. Perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music brings creatures of human imagination in both realistic and poetic fashion. The story itself is quite simple at first glance. As the title suggests, there is an archetypal journey, a motif repeated for thousands of years. This motif was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time and beyond, but also had a rich philosophical significance. The film is a poetic consideration of most exciting eternal questions. It's not just an odyssey of a person; It is an odyssey of our kind. The film is amazing by itself, but in my case the impression of it will always be mixed with it from the book. I have read it at the age of 10 and really do not think of problems such as 'what is the relationship between humanity's development and the development of human morality'. But the impression was big enough to make me fall to the whole genre of science fiction. The day I learned '2001' only got special effects Oscar and was not even nominated for the best picture the day when the 'Academy Award' became two words that matter to me.
