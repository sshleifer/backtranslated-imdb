I want to know if anyone knows how to get a copy of the movie, "It's the Way of the World". It's been about 30 years since I've seen this movie and I want to see it again. Earth Wind & Fire transcends the nation globally with their inspirational music and themes. It was unfortunate that this group did not go as their colleagues in the early 70s, but as mentioned earlier racial tension existed in the United States, which prohibited offset exposure to African American musical groups. It is good to see that Earth Wind & Fire continues their success. I would like to add this movie to my collection. Someone helps me if possible. Thank you for your attention. Milton Shaw
