I felt that this movie had many good qualities. The cinematography was certainly different and revealed the stage aspect of the set and story. The original characters as actors were definitely an achievement, and I felt most played quite convincingly, of course they play, but certainly unique. The cultural aspects can leave many disappointed as a knowledge of Chinese and Oriental culture will respond to many questions regarding parent / child relationship and stigmatization that goes with any drug use. I found the Jia Hongsheng story interesting. On a downward note, the story in Beijing and some of the fashion and music series in the early 90s, even though this was made in 2001, is really cheesy sometimes (The Beatles crap, etc.). Either way, not a top ten or twenty, but if it's on the television, check it out.
