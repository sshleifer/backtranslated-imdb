It is important and only reasonable to remember that at the time of this brief, a state of war existed between the United States and Japan's empire. In addition, the huge accident created by the war, as well as the Bataan Death March and other incidents, and the only surprising thing about this brief and others is that there were no more of them. Another thing: My only problem with this short is that it seems to be fun, but it is not. I'm not sure anyone associated with it really tried to make the jokes work or even care about. It would have been much better if they had done what Disney did with Education for Death and been absolutely serious. But this short becomes a bad rap and should not be judged out of context. Times were different and this is an important consideration. Any widespread energy trying to save the world from a three-year comic strip should take a step back. As I use energy to defend the same cartoon. This should be available to interested parties, even if they are not in high turnover. Not a nice comic, but sometimes life is not nice. recommended
