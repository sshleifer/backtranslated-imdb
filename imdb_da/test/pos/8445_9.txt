As long as you don't mind paying a little more attention than usual for other movies, it's one of the best thrillers you'll ever see. The film depicts an event that can arise in real life; nothing in it actually seems fictitious. It also depicts how people can react in real life. <br /> <br /> In fact, it depicts these so well that it seems like real life. Combine it with the lack of a soundtrack and you've almost got the best news-like movie you've ever seen. Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are particularly good at this masterpiece at the end of the 70s and cause concern over her end and true tragic shame on his end. I recommend it to anyone who likes thrillers.
