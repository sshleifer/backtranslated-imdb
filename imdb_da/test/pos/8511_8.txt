Although Never Say Never Again (NSNA) has a weak soundtrack, it is far superior to its competition at that time, "Octopussy." Never Say Never Again is an updated and improved version of Thunderball (Connery's least popular bond flick). NSNA is rich in wise dialogue, humor, smarts, sex appeal, and one of the best and most compelling evil in the entire Bond series. In addition, NSNA has a very talented young and beautiful Kim Basinger. British comedy fans will also recognize the actor (Attwood), known as "Mr. Bean." I didn't want to buy any of the Moore pictures for this one. But the former Connery / Bond action (with the exception of "Thunderball") is superior. <br /> <br />
