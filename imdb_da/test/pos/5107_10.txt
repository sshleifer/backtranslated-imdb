When it opened in London in Christmas 1969, this musical version of James Hilton's famous story was drubbed by the critics. The same reception met it when it opened in the US, causing MGM to pull its "Roadshow" status and cut almost all its songs. What a mistake !!! <br /> <br /> Looking years later, when the trendy world of the 60s and 70s has settled on itself, this version of GOODBYE, MR.CHIPS, is a total joy. First of all, like "Chipping", Peter O'Toole gives one of his greatest performances. To see him turn from the hated, cold, numb Latin teacher in a boy's school, to a man who can finally see the colors of the world (after falling down and marrying the musical star Catherine Briskit) is to see a genius work. (If you can, see ARABIA LOVE, LION IN WINTER, MY FAVORITE YEAR and CHIPS back in a number of days or weeks. Then you'll see what a really great actor O'Toole is and how magnificent he is in CHIPS.) <br /> <br /> Catherine, as played by the glowing Petula Clark at the height of her popularity, is somebody's dream come true; beautiful, loving, understanding, with a good voice to start. Most songs are beautiful and fit perfectly with the story, while the direction from the late Herbert Ross brings the matter to life wonderfully. Okay, this movie may be a bit too romantic for some people, but for those who are looking for a beautifully acted, sung and directed love story, look no further. (If you can get your hands on the laser disc wide version even better. I am eagerly waiting for CHIPS 'debut on DVD.)
