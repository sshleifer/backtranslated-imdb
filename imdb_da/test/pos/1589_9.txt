This is an amazing, yet free adaptation of Thomas Mann's novel with the same title. Dirk Bogarde gives his finest screen performance - he himself believed it. The dialogue is minimal, so his face must record the nuances of his terrible character - a composer (a writer in the short story - the only major change) who travels to Venice in 1910. Visconti breaks in the beauty depiction, it goes by and Visconti mixes Mahlers music and imagery seamlessly in its finest movie since "The Leopard" (another anesthetic film that greatly influences Coppola's Sicily in "Godfather").
