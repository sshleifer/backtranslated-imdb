I saw the perfect storm and thought of another Wolfgang Peterson movie that is much better - this one. Although certainly not based on a true story, you are Fire of Fire, how to make a movie. It has a great story with a great cast. Malkovich won a well-deserved Oscar for his achievements as the eerie killer with a courage for the government, he earned too well. Eastwood is good as the tortured secret service, and Russo is easy on the eyes. If you haven't seen this, you should definitely rent it or buy it as I did. Definitely one of the best criminal thrillers in the last decade. 9.10
