It is quite obvious to see it today and appreciate how far we have come into what we expect from movies, and at the same time appreciate how many basic concepts were created. <br /> <br /> Here we have a full storytelling talking movie - the sound and the pictures are pushed to their time constraints. The frame is limited to about belt height and open - no face close-ups. <br /> <br /> The compositions are remarkable; There is an early over-the-shoulder cross cut scene to highlight the dialogue; there is a treacherous descent into a canyon with some harrowing perspective angles; a sun-bleached skeleton lies in the dust as wheels and legs march in the upper part of the frame; the excitement of the showdown between the hero and the bad guy is recorded visually by filming over the long axis of a large tree lying between them; and over and over - early visual treats are immense. <br /> <br /> Today, it is disturbing to see young Wayne wearing a movie, without the ego or the way of disguise. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Walsh recognized the self-reference: the subject is the journey of a different group of pilgrims; Those shown on the screen are a diverse group of stage actors, vaudeville comedians, shell game artists, and probably carny barkers and ten-in-one show veterans. They all travel to blow a trail for how movies will be made. <br /> <br /> This is at least a view worth appreciating the source of so many visual ideas borrowed in later movies.
