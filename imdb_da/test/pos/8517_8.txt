If you can see a Bond movie from 1983 that is not as good as Octopussy and still enjoys it. <br /> <br /> If you can accept production values ​​that are not so much above the level of a TV movie. <br /> <br /> If you can see Sean Connery with wrinkles on his forehead under an obvious toupee and still see James Bond. <br /> <br /> If you get past a colorless Basinger, a weaker Largo and a jolly Q. <br /> <br /> If you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score, not up with Barry at his worst day. <br /> <br /> If you don't believe in the hyperbolic reviews it was released on release. <br /> <br /> If you can meet a poker stroke and a video game with pleasure and enjoy both, the same thing. Its never to say never again and everything that is in it. <br /> <br /> And that's more, you'll enjoy it, my son!
