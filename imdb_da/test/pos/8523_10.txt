In 1983, 2 Bond films were made, one was the official Bond movie Octopussy with Roger Moore, who stood as James Bond for the first time in Live and Let Die, and the other was the unofficial Bond movie Never Say Never Again with Sean Connery, who played the role of James Bond for the first time in Dr. No, this movie was also the first 007 James Bond movie to be made. Never Say Never Again is called unofficial because the company that made the other James Bond movies didn't do this. Never Say Never Again is also a remake of 1965 007 movie Thunderball. There are several differences in Never Say Never Again that let you know it wasn't made by EON.
