This movie is all a Tenacious D fan can hope for. Director Liam Lynch collaborated with "D" is a collection of epic proportions. Of course, you must understand the humor and format of Tenacious D. When I saw it, there were not too many laughs from the audience, but the reason is not lack of humor or intelligent jokes. This movie seems to have been released to an unsuspecting audience who has not announced the musical duo. This film remains true to its roots. For the few of you who have seen the HBO TV series and heard the album, they have not forgotten what their audience loves. Like the TV show, people have noticed from the trailer JB and the KG apartment scenes and of course the open Mic evenings that every Tenacious D episode would start and end. The soundtrack is phenomenal and every song blows you away. <br /> <br /> ... and Dave Grohl plays a fantastic devil. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect movie for those looking for a hard time and a rocking musical.
