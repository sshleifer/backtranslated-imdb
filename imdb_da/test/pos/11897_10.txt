This movie was a modern scarface.It had me on my toes.This movie is one of the rare epic movies that makes you want a sequel. I especially liked Damian Chapa his performance deserved an academic award, which he deserved for his blood blood performance. The only thing I didn't like was behind the scenes because it didn't show the intensity the movie had, and I'd like to have seen less famous scenes. But the movie was amazing and it's in my top ten movies all the time. When the play was amazing, there wasn't a bad scene in the movie, I loved it, Jennifer Tilly was perfect as well as all the cast. I can't see how anyone wanted I didn't like this movie, it was a great one. Finally, one must see.
