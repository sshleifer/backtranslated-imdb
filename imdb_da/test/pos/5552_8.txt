Pickle was the most underrated film of the decade. Despite my best efforts at home, it is still seen as a bad movie. I say to hell with everyone on this. Everyone does not understand that it is partly a comedy with a dramatic twist in the end. Danny Aiello plays a burnt-out instructor with perfection and conveys a sad depressed man. The scene when trying to record a last message is quite good. Interventions of Stones movies are quite fun. "This is Harry Stone and today I become a man!" All in all a nice and unfortunately misunderstood movie. Plus a great cameo by Little Richard. Hysterically fun! I hope more people see this movie because 202 people are not enough to agree. <br /> <br /> -Silence Dogood
