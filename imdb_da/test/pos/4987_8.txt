"The Violent Men" marked Rudolph Mat√©'s finest collaboration with Glenn Ford in an intensely satisfying drama of robust primitive justice? <br /> <br /> Ford is John Parrish, a former Cavalry captain who is itching to get married and start a new life ?? His fiance Caroline Vail (May Wynn) is desperate to move east, and to see him sell his spread to Lee Wilkison (Edward G. Robinson). <br /> <br /> Parrish isn't even much of a cattleman ?? but he understands that there is something big built up in the valley ?? In the army, they used to call it 'enemy pressure'. First, Cole Wilkison (Brian Keith) comes back from Texas to help his brother drive anchor ?? So does a hard child with a fancy gun (Richard Jaeckel) show on the Wilkison payday ?? So are all the small ranchers forced out and get the same kind of offer ?? Parrish saw himself running like they did or stand and fight <br /> But can he easily deal with a man who sends six killers to shoot an old man in the back? Can he easily argue for a man who started with a few hectares of land and now owns almost the entire valley? <br /> <br /> All that grass and sand has ever meant to the former Confederate chieftain over the last three years? It was a place to regain its health ?? Parrish confirms: "What happens in this valley is no concern for me." And much to the disappointment of the remaining ranchers and farmers who push him to stay, does he decide to accept Wilkison's offer to fulfill the promise he made to his fiancee? <br /> <br /> When Lee's younger brother Cole made the wrong move, trying to push Parrish out, making his appearance by lynching one of his ranchers, Parrish became angry and warned the two brothers that he would stay and will fight them for the privilege of being alone <br /> <br /> Brian Keith plays the treacherous brother who is behind the murder ... He dreams of having position and respect in driving a day Anchor ?? <br /> <br /> Lee's ambitious wife Martha (Barbara Stanwyck) secretly hates her and her husband ??

Robinson is good enough as the Anchor's crippled owner who promised the whole valley to his wife, unaware that she has an affair with her younger brother ?? <br /> <br /> Dianne Foster is too sensitive as the innocent adult daughter well aware of her mother's burdens ?? <br /> <br /> "The Violent Men" uses the wide screen technology to emphasize the scale and power of this horrible action drama, making it a perfect example of the genre's most enduring classics ??
