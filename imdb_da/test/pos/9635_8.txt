OK ... ths movie (like Segal's last couple of movies) goes beyond "knock them down, kick them in the groin, shoot them in the face, avenge the evil ones, to hurt my sister's niece's cousin" Ting Seagal was in a some time. Geepers, Steven started thinking and using his bucks to make movies with real ideas in them. SAFE .... there is plenty of action in this flick, but also some thought and heart. It's not an Oscar-flick, but it's worth doing, unless the viewer is so brain-dead that it hurts to think longer than a second. It's worth renting .. or two !!
