The theme song often goes through my head after all these years. I was never much of a TV watcher, probably because I just got into my busy teenage years when my family bought our first set in 1948 and it never became a part of my life. But from the first episode of Lawman I was hooked, and that's the only TV show I've ever planned my week around. Intelligent, trustworthy, well-written and well-behaved, and John Russell is still the most beautiful man I've ever seen. (Peter Brown was also not a dog: o) <br /> I agree that it is one of the most underestimated television series all the time. I hope I can find some episodes for my grandchildren to see.
