Easy Lucio Fulci's most respected film, "Do Not Torture a Duckling", is very famous for its edgy subject, cruel imagery and strong history. Terror commits a small Italian village, which young boys start turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and certain authorities as well as a dedicated detective in mystery. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Another? Unlike most tabs' frequent representation on the film's violent content - I consider it much more plot-driven; with only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards). In no aspect does it detract from the positive attribute of this movie. Fulci proves himself fully capable of separating a hell of a dark and disturbing giallo with childbirth, black magic and of course a lovely full set o 'knockers ... Although I am particularly pleased with Fulci's "Lizard in a Woman's Skin "and" New York Ripper "," Torture a Duckling "dominate the giallo genre as a mood and convincing murder mystery!
