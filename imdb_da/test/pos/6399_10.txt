The biggest problem faced by the TV program Key West was that it was announced incorrectly. If you saw the ads you would think it was a jiggle how, and be very disappointed. It was a much more complex show than that. <br /> <br /> I happened to be in Key West just before Hurricane Andrew hit, and I think I actually found myself having a drink or two with some of those thrown in Rum Runners. It was of course before the show hit. I saw the sailboat that was in the opening, walk a few times and chatted with the guy you see that chopped coconuts in the opening too. He was a real local. Yes, I would like to see this on DVD.
