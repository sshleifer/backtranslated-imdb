Although I don't like cricket at all, and I have seen this movie 13 years ago, I still think it is one of the best movies to come alive. I remember the day I came home from my school and sat down to have my lunch, I watched the movie's opening titles and then .... I was so immersed in that I felt I was there, it really hit me personally. I still remember how I felt when I first saw it, I felt that the poor boy was my friend and went through the same youth experience we had these days. what i really liked about that movie is the main theme of a "shy" boy who fantasizes about "kissing" his dreamy, no offense, but if it was an american movie, you would definitely see - at some point in time climax "shy" boy "love" to her girl, and I really can not understand these conflicting concepts so far ... I have a simple request, if anyone knows how to get the movie on a DVD by mail, please let me know that I need a shot of memories. Thanks
