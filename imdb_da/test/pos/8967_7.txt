Mike Nichol's film "Charlie Wilson's War", set in the 1980s, tells the story of how the title character (played by Tom Hanks) managed to wage a war with Russkies by Afghan forces. Of course, we know how well it turned out in the long run, but fortunately the film does not slip over the unpleasant after-effects. The cast is starring with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts is among the most bankable stars in Hollywood. As a bonus, you have the versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman in a characteristic memorable support role, where he received an unjustified Oscar nomination. I'm not much of a fan of Roberts, but Hanks is always reliable. Nevertheless, I can't quite buy into him as a drug-using woman, although the real Charlie Wilson seems as adorable as Hanks. Except for the big three, there is not much worth noting, even from a recognizable name like Amy Adams. <br /> <br /> The story is engaging and enhanced by a fine script from Aaron Sorkin. The verbal interaction between the protagonists is excellent and has come across memorable lines. The later events that were set in motion by the war are not ignored, although the booking scenes, called Wilson, appear to be too serious to achieve the bittersweet feeling that was likely to be calculated. On the whole, the Nichols' direction is laborious and follows the action of the act admirably. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that Charlie Wilson herself has errors, but it is still incredibly sympathetic. Certainly recommended for fans of the three stars and for those seeking an engaging political drama with a light hearted feeling.
