This was a very fun and fast movie. I saw it more than once and kept my rental around to show others. I just want to take this opportunity to ask someone, how does HK manufacturers choose their subtitle translators? I'm most curious. Please contact me. <br /> <br /> Again, to return to review, it's a really beautiful movie with lots of content, features that resemble classics, even though they're full of slapsticks. Reminiscent of the Mexican comedies of Cantinflas. <br /> <br /> The movie does not disappoint the director's fans who have noticed that he is particularly interested in Chinese themes, trying to come to characteristics that are rarely explored. The conductor overall collection is a way to look inside the culture in a disarmed way. <br /> <br /> And I can't see how his funny girl in Chinese party could be top.
