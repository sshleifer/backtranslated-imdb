The fact that after 50 years it is still a very watchful film, says a lot about it. It is more intelligent and interesting than almost any newer movie of the same genre you can find and has some brave sense of innocence to it. I'm not a big fan of this type of movie, but I could see it all without getting bored, making it a great movie to watch with someone who doesn't necessarily share your taste in movies. I liked the black and white palette, the excellent casting, the clever heist scene that keeps you guessing which trick they will pull next, and ending up like everyone else. When you look at the heist sequence, you become aware of the power of clarity, which unfortunately is not fulfilled in today's cinema.
