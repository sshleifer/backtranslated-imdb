The Green Butchers or The Green Butchers as it is called in English is a very dark comedy about two losers working for a popular butcher. They are concerned about their bosses criticism and decide to start a business alone. Their store is expensive and it doesn't even have electricity anywhere. And to make matters worse, they don't have any customers (as their former boss predicted). When the man pays them a visit to their store, he challenges them to give the meat a dinner party he organizes. <br /> <br /> Another tragic accident happens. One of the butchers locks the electrician into the freezer chamber when he closes the store. The man dies, and the neurotic one of the two butchers decides to cut fillets out of the electrician's thigh and serves it for the evening party instead of calling the police. It's an incredible success. Nevertheless, each person in the village will taste the incredible "chicken". Overwhelmed by his sudden success, the butcher sees no other option but to kill more people whom he can sell as a chicken. <br /> <br /> I guess the subject of cannibalism cannot be enjoyed by everyone, especially not because it is shown with a lot of humor. Personally, I liked it very much. It shows perfectly how far some people would go to social acceptance and get out of their isolation. It may sound a bit slow, but I'm sure you'd be surprised to see how people actually work. <br /> <br /> In addition to the original topic, I was also fond of the actors' performances and humor. There is no overwhelmed that you might expect in this kind of movie, it's all very sober and realistic (I think it's typical of Scandinavians and Scandinavian movies). The same for humor. I'm sure I wouldn't have liked it as much as I did now, if humor had been over the top or with much farting, vomiting ... as you often see in American movies. I loved this movie and I give it an 8/10.
