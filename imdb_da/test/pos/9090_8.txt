Flatliners have all the ingredients of a good Joel Schumacher movie - intelligent, youthful characters, great filmography, a gripping story and great performances. It's escapist fun, but it's done very well and resonates with a positive spiritual message despite the unpleasant preferences. <br /> <br /> Schumacher has the ability to spot talented young actors, and all the main five here have gone on to bigger things (see castel). Their credible performances help raise this film well above average. Kiefer Sutherland shines in his selfish fellow student role. <br /> <br /> The chemistry really stimulates the right side of the brain, which is what I love about Schumacher; His use of light and location creates images that hold fast. A disturbing nightmare atmosphere is created that disturbs you as you watch the movie and haunt you when you go to bed - reminded me of The Lost Boys. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that takes a fantastic premise - inquisitive students want to find out what is after death and successfully follow it in a scary, poignant tale of redemption. One of Schumacher's best; highly recommended.
