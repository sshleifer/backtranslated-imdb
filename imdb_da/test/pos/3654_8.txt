I watched this movie at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats. The movie is incredibly beautiful and smoothly flowing to a first movie. The direction is self-confident, especially with the locals, who were recruited for extras and bits. While the plot and history line are elemental to non-existent, the joy of seeing performances and scenery pleases the lack. The soundtrack to this movie is a major attraction for world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration. It was not revealed in Q&A, but I imagine Hollywood could take a lesson in budget film making by learning from this director.
