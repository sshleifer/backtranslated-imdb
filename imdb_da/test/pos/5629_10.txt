My companions were amazed to find that this movie was a documentary. It was so funny, it seemed the script, but it gives a touching picture of the real life in the indie film scene. We felt moved to buy Coven and wanted to meet Mark and Mike. As a college student, this film gave us a cramped estimate of real life.
