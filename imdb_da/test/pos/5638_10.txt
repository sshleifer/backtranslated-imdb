This documentary is the most mesmerizing movie I've seen for a long time. I must have had it for a whole day. The selected material included in the play floats incredibly well and develops three characters that are impossible to ever forget. The different layers of these people peel back to make a strange moving movie about endurance, loyalty and determination. These signs ended surprisingly fascinating and the movie is unforgettable.
