He's an avid Vijay fan. I've never seen another movie of his that is as good as this. <br /> <br /> It has all the usual cliches one can expect from a commercial entertainer. A hero who is poor in studies, but a star in his forte, ie. Kabbadi. His friends must fill in the comedy quota. A heroine in a life and death situation. A villain, as I say, is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist. High octane hunting and action sequences. Music that can do a dance. And above all, it's a perfect story to keep all of the above factors within an enjoyable circle. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The director gives no chance of the audience loosening. He just goes from a nail on his head to the next. And you can see the brighter side of Vijay in this movie he rarely performs. <br /> <br /> Everyone said ..... This movie was and will be perfect for many years to come ....
