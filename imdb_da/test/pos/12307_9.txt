Watched this movie on the NFT in London, where it was shown as part of BFI's John Huston season. I wasn't really sure what to expect, and the first few minutes of the movie gave up very little. In fact, the rest of the movie continued to give away! No real plot, no action, no excitement, very little drama and apart from a short part at the end no scenery. The result of the lack of all these features, however, was a wonderful movie. I don't quite understand why, but I think its underestimated character made the movie almost perfect. The play, the script and most importantly, the casting was all in place, and I can't remember going away from a movie theater so well, but I still can't figure out why. I just know I will get the DVD (this is one of the movies that I will definitely be as good on the small screen as the movie experience, provided you can find somewhere quiet to watch it! ) And I'll see it again soon. I would also like to find out what my family and friends are thinking about it. I am sure it will not be everyone's choice, but I am convinced that a large number will agree with my opinion. 9 out of 10.
