My one-line summary suggests that this is not a good movie, but it is not true. I liked the movie, but probably expected too much. <br /> <br /> Adele, who is heavily portrayed by Susan Sarandon, did not appear as a very sympathetic character. She is fleeting and irresponsible for what would be an unforgettable degree if it were not for the great love she has for her daughter. This is the only thing she knows how to do without. Adesel's daughter, Anna, is a sad girl who is so busy making up her mother's shortcomings that she doesn't seem to be just 14-17 years old. Of course, this makes Natalie Portman the perfect choice for playing Anna, as she never seems to be 14-17 years old. Portman pulls this role off with such ease that you almost forget that she hasn't made movies for 20 years. Yet, even with the two solid leaders, Wayne Wang never seems to attract the audience as he did with The Joy Luck Luck and even more with Smoke. Although I have not read the book, the film feels as if it has made necessary changes in history to bring it to the big screen, which can cause the story to be followed up with the emotional pulse. I enjoyed the movie for fun to watch two wonderful actresses do their job, but I never lost in the experience and I was never related to their situation.
