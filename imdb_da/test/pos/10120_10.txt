I just got home from seeing "Radio". I have not seen such an inspiring story for a long time. My kids are 8 and 5 years old, and I would like to take them so that they can "feel" the message I did - you must seek out the best in people and love them for who they are, not judge them for their differences. Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris deserve both Academy Awards for this movie. I don't know why we can't get more movies like this, rather than the junk that is served daily at theaters.
