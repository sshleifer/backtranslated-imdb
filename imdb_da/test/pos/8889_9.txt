If you had a mother who described you like that, just look to bump her off yourself. That's how Danny DeVito feels about Anne Ramsey, it's just how to put the plan into action. <br /> <br /> And his creative writing class taught by Professor Billy Crystal gives him the idea. It and a view of Alfred Hitchcock's classic Strangers On A Train, which gives DeVito the idea to change murder with Crystal, who hates his wife, Kate Mulgrew, who doesn't just cheat him out of an idea for a book he wanted to write but is also continuing with hunky Tony Ciccone. <br /> <br /> Throw Momma From The Train plays kind of strangers on a train, as DeVito seems to have done its end of the murder. But Crystal has a little trouble putting Ramsey down even with Danny's help. That woman may have to kill, but she will take a lot of it. <br /> <br /> The only academic recognition that Throw Momma received from the train was an Oscar nomination for Anne Ramsey for the best supporting actress. Ramsey lost to Olympia Dukakis for Moonstruck, but the movie proved to be her finest hour. Ramsey already had sore throat, which would eventually kill her the following year, but looking at the list of credits she managed to collect even after Throw Momma from the train, she worked straight to the end. <br /> <br /> I've seen interviews with both stars by Throw Momma From The Train, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, and both have happily admitted that Anne Ramsey's performance as a mother from hell both made the movie a success and was Stole it from under them. Their recognition of Ramsey's talent and performance is the best possible tribute. <br /> <br /> If Marion Lorne in Strangers On A Train had been something like Anne Ramsey here, Farley Granger would be happy to join Robert Walker in disposing of her. Throwing Momma off a train is one of the best black comedies out there, shouldn't be missed.
