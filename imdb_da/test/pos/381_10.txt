Looking back on Alfred Hitchcock's career, it is never surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry. It is probably a sign of how his time before Hitchcock was, always trying to push the envelope and never throw with a movie made simply for the purpose of being entertaining, but always with a deeper, more exciting motive on his mind. Strangers on a train, one of Hitchcock's first and more underrated hits, is a perfect example of these traits - an entertaining and exciting story, even when seen over 50 years later, yes, but so carefully and intelligently constructed day as a masterpiece in film technology. <br /> <br /> Probably one of the pioneering "thrilling thrillers", Strangers on a Train, may come across as a bit dated in some aspects, but it retains any kind of beautifully crafted excitement as it came back in 1951 (if perhaps a little less shocking). The brilliant use of film and lighting as well as fast and careful editing is what really makes the film stand out and draws all sorts of tensions and keeps the audience's focus even in slower scenes. If there ever was any doubt as to what a simple masterful filmmaker Hitchcock was, then just seeing five minutes of strangers on a train enough to reject such feelings; Each shot is so carefully selected and constructed that everyone serves to drive the story forward in a particularly innovative way. Unfortunately, there are certain moments in the story that are scary out of space enough to throw our focus away from the amazing movie and editing - Bruno is able to reach the bottom of a sewer grid is simply incredible and the figure of A stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly uncontrolled carousel gives unintentional comedian relief in what is meant to be the movie's most tense and engaging scene. These are only short moments, but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise star-stored film. <br /> <br /> But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is the premise of history. As Hollywood movies at the end run the risk of getting down and down the turgid cliché for clichés, it is wonderfully refreshing to see a 50-year-old movie with a precondition that actually comes across as clever and original. Sure it's pretty straightforward, but the concept of "swapping murder" is simply one that wouldn't fly in today's and age-old films, making it even more enjoyable to watch; The film's brilliant manuscript keeps the action flowing at a fast pace, while giving us some wonderfully memorable lines all the time. One cannot help but notice the deeper themes that Hitchcock also refers to throughout, especially the concept of "darkness in the heart of mankind", demonstrated by the fact that older ladies are fascinated and elated by the prospect of murder, as well as Brunos own cavalry attitude towards death. Hitch also works in many moments of dark humor (Bruno pops a child's balloon with his cigarette is invaluable) and irony, shooting exciting scenes in happy, light surroundings, like the iconic carnival scenes, to create an even more frightening atmosphere. This can be a thrill thriller, yes, but ignoring the brain underneath it would be simply unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The antagonistic figure of Bruno (emerged to pervert perfection by Robert Walker, unfortunately in his last movie role but easily steals the movie from his admittably very talented contributing members) is undoubtedly what makes Strangers on a train as memorable as the sign is a marvel to see. Here we have a simply beautifully crafted villainous figure, the more exciting it is to know how common and modest he seems. Instead of cuddling the madman and countering the hero at any possible moment, Bruno is a quiet, controlled, psychotic mess. He speaks of murder in such an off-tone, but retains a passionate glory in his eye as he discusses various forms of killing people. Bruno might seem to represent "Id", which Freud would say, the inner, darker, and uninhibited aspects of humanity. It makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure, Guy Haines, and how bland and uninteresting he seems, almost as if driving home the prospect of evil is much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> In spite of this implied message, Hitch still turns around our feelings enough that we throw for Guy at every turn and greet every new obstacle he has to overcome. It is a testament to the actor Farley Granger's talent that despite Robert Walker's villain easily stealing the show, Granger comes entirely to be sympathetic and still puts our support even when they fall in exchange for being a far less convincing character . Excellent support is given by Ruth Roman, who manages to overcome the cliché and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure, Kasey Rogers gives a great achievement as Guy's horrifying manipulative and hedonistic first wife and Patricia Hitchcock proving that she is far more talented than just being "the director's daughter" would mean. The stunning cast (led by a simply wonderful Walker) brings the movie to life and adds so much more value to the movie than just Hitchcock's stunning stylism. <br /> All in all, Strangers on a Train can still get too dated for certain viewers, but it is still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems to be released for half century ago. Once again, Hitchcock proves its unparalleled mastery of excitement and film technology, and the movie's surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is worth looking at alone. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to make an excellently crafted but amazingly entertaining movie experience! <br /> <br /> -9/10
