Family Guy has been fun for so long, but I would like to lose the sharp and random humor at the beginning of season 6. Although I enjoyed Blue Harvest, it seemed as if the remaining episodes were "wrapping" episodes where the producers made little effort to meet Family Guy's reputation for American social satire. <br /> <br /> I've seen all the episodes from season 7 and I was totally surprised and happy that Family Guy has found their true colors again. Season 7 delivers many amazing episodes and with many jokes about current situations in America, which is exactly what we need right now - more fun. I feel that the Simpsons have lost their spark all together, this show, however, has made a great recovery from going down to prove how perfectly satirical they can be. Good work!
