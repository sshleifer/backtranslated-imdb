Hayao Miyazaki has captured the imagination of the audience young and old all over the globe, and his latest biographical artwork is "Ponyo", a children's event recording on story elements from The Little Mermaid. Of course, other Miyazaki classics such as "Spirited Away" and his last film, "Howl's Moving Castle", "Ponyo" are filled with creativity that can only be appreciated by adults, but it is clearly more of a children's story than recent efforts. It is a magical story that is best described as beautiful and lovable, aiming for charm rather than conflict. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" is the story of a bug-eyed childish-looking fish of the same name, the daughter of an underwater wizard, longing to escape from the sea and become a little girl. When she does, she quickly looks forward to a young boy named Sosuke. In the process, she gets strong magic and throws the world out of balance between land and sea, and a big storm drops most of the cliff, where Sosuke lives with her mother, and threatens to end the world. /> <br /> Like "Howl's Moving Castle", Walt Disney retrieved "Ponyo" for an American release and called it over with an impressive selection of Western voices, even by choosing homemade products in the youngest siblings of the Disney band Jonas Brothers ( Frankie Jonas) and Miley Cyrus (younger sister Noah) to Sosuke and Ponyo respectively. Also sound figures are Liam Neeson (Fujimoto, Ponyo's father), Tina Fey (Lisa, Sosuke's mother), Matt Damon (Sosuke's father), Cate Blanchett (Ponyo's sea goddess mother) and a trio of fun, older women played by Betty White, Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. The effort is definitely there to make this movie appeal to the American audience, and Disney is approaching. <br /> <br /> However, voices are of little importance in a Miyazaki movie about visual creativity. A fan of transformations and animating fluid and fluid movement, creating a fairy tale that takes place partially underwater, must have been a pleasure for Miyazaki to work with and perhaps even his entire motivation to choose this story. Among the highlights are water drops that Fujimoto sends for Ponyo, which moves like live waves, as well as a number of other fantastic sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make "Ponyo" as awing as any other Miyazaki movie. <br /> <br /> However, as a children's story, "Ponyo" concentrates its efforts on being sweet. The discovery of true friendship and love between Sosuke and Ponyo is heart-warming, although Noah Cyrus cries out childishly when Ponyo tends to surround human life, it can be a little annoying. But as lovely as many of the imaginative elements and loving relationships there is very little resistance or danger. Former Miyazaki movies have clear bad guys, but the conflict in "Ponyo" actually shrinks as the story goes together. Sosuke thinks he has lost his mother at some point, and in the background is the idea that the world is going out and people are ashamed of the polluting sea, but "Ponyo" is mostly free of tension. Most wise, its climax is opaque, despite how it generally likes all the characters. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" will surely satisfy Miyazaki's fans in every way with their imagination, and newcomers will still be beaten by his simple but visually ambitious storytelling, but this is obviously more of a children's movie that is best for families and others who love imagination regardless of form or audience. It is not quite what you would expect from Miyazaki considering his recent work, but it is sure to be remembered as another of his beloved stories. ~ Steven C <br /> Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
