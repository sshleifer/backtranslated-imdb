On Monday, earlier this week, sometime in July, I happened to be under the influence of the sweet leaf, and I was a scarecrow, wanted to see something scary. I was thinking of The Ammityville Horror 2, but I got something better. I was with my friend's house and he had VHS Evil Ed. No cover or anything he didn't even see for himself, but he told me it was about "A guy who gets crazy and kills many people." Well, this movie was very shocking, I have never seen the actual brutal character of sadistic violence until this movie, burying Ted Bundy and Ed Gein both! It's also quite fun with references to The Evil Dead Trilogy (and plus The Evil Dead 2 poster is everywhere in the movie!) The film is about Edward, an obsessive-compulsive, good guy, who happens to be the movie editor. He is then lent to another department of the building and sent to the posh yet violent world by Sam Campbell, Splatter and Gore Department. Sam Campbell, Eddy's new boss, tells Eddy about the big break on his movie, the gruesome Loose Limbs series, and he needs Eddy to make the movie somewhat less intense so they can be seen all over Europe. Eddy soon regrets when he sends the pictures and scenes to him from the lonely suburban house for work, and then there is quite a nightmare. Imagine yourself in his place! The action is amazing, over-doubling is a bit of fun (Sam Campbell's voice is often found fun, the same with the other actors). However, overdubbing the job was pretty good, I give this movie a 10/10 and it's a good introduction to the Gore subgenre of Horror. Very good, nightmare, bloody ....... Just watch it yourself. <br /> <br /> movie quote: "Where in f ** k is my Beaver rapeseed scene?!"
