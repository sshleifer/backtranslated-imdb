Roy Andersson has managed to do something that counts almost all conventions of what a movie should be, a work of art that is both beautiful, fun and evocative at the same time. The end result is a moving, if somewhat broken tale of humanity in its simplest and most honest form. It is unlikely to appeal to everyone, in fact humor is so fine-tuned that many are unlikely to come on their wavelength. The almost absurd lengths, awkward silence and consistent shots will surely ward off even the most willing to the audience. But it is within these implacable narratives and unconventional thoughts that Andersson is a world where every person seems to take center stage in his own absurd way. Each scene is absorbed by the desolate surroundings, with the signs apparently left alone in their own wonder. It is a difficult piece to see at times, not least because, like many of its scenes, it requires patience. But while some might get it on an artistic throne, others will just look at confusion. It's a movie that mixes discreet humor with one's own heart
