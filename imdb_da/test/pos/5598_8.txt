In this peculiar movie, the themes are dealt with at the end of days and Satan versus Jesus in a new way. Jesus does not want to open the last two seals, and Satan is countered in his attempt to get another soul in hell ... Armageddon, Armageddon and Jehoshaphat turn out to be a company! And the book of life is a little difficult to open. <br /> <br /> What is memorable about this movie is the sharp picture, out-of-focus shots and light effects that are effective, but sometimes annoying. And of course, Donovan is great as a disillusioned Jesus trying to express what the world and its people have become! Then see if you get the chance!
