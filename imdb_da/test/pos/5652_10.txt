The greatest achievement of this film is that, although racist unipolar, the film still manages to cut a bordauer of war images leaving a lasting identification with the one who can see it and the one present at present. Although good movies may have the ability to universalize their subjects, which is often a difficult thing to do; Big movies have the ability to universalize their unipolar topics, which is what this movie does. <br /> <br /> Instead of cutting out a coherence of unity, the film portrays the Japanese in the ill-fated finale of Phillipine's war front in February 1945, creating signs of pacifism or war, but rather showing signs of war's feelings, death. destruction, victory and war with the bloody hands of the defeated. Too different and superior to films like the Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, both needed a satirical method of trivializing and depersonalizing the American troops and using all races as a fight, which is fine but not as big as a movie that uses a race and view that would look fascist if it was created in America, to convey the fate of the war sky and show what it really is. <br /> <br /> The only way the protagonist makes it through this movie to the end is being sick, hence inedible; Therefore, through this character through our illness, his saving face, we see the end of 2. world war in philippines in February 1945, and how Americans, Japanese and Filipinos came together in bloody acts of war where you live to die. <br /> <br /> The film is obviously influenced by a neo-realistic way of cinematic depiction, which is original and beneficial to a viewer, whether now or now, for the neo-realistic techniques that it employs, all war gravel meditating form, whether pacifism or "militaristic responsibility". Like Germania Anno Zero, by Roberto Rossellini, a story comes out of the environment and the conditions associated with it. <br /> <br /> The opening of the film, with the two-way discussion between the two Japanese soldiers, pre-shapes and reechoes events. Through this opening, we feel that the fight is human against man and man with man; it shows that they trust each other to meet the enemy in the previous battles, but now, in this opening or "pivot" of the Japanese experience in the Philippines, new information is sent to the main character Tamura, giving a presentation of a cannibal addiction to each other if they want to survive. The jungle is greedy, wet and thick, and the sky is not rarely cloudy and sloping. We teem with stragglers though puddles and ants, as sick as the land around them. Named cadavers are stretched everywhere. Now and then you can't tell if they are bodies, rocks or corn. Apparently there is no difference here, everything is dead and sick. Everything is about to die. Everything they have learned to feed on is rare monkeys and dead bodies of fallen comrades and / or nameless enemies. <br /> <br /> Often, Tamura meets another fallen near death. Although they crushed in spirit and crushed his, some bid their bodies up to eat, but he refuses; he will still, like Hiroshi Kawaguchi as Nishi in Giants and Toys, not fall into the dignity of dignity and Japanese morality; for that is all he really has to endure for his survival, a dignity of his own. Therefore, when Nagamatsu dissects a soldier for consumption, he shoots him because of it. Tamura can be used for killing, but for killed and sudden illness he cannot decipher. He is neither a good man nor a bad man. He wants to survive, but will not go the extra mile beyond simple corpse killing. He himself was dead on the battlefield, he is not happy to wade and wipe the weak for his survival. The disease he carries, he sees everywhere in everyone; and unfortunately he lacks the ethical reasoning to think either thinking completely about others, as he cannot give up his body for them since his infectious disease or think completely about himself, seeing the disease in everyone but still killing them even if they Do not hurt. Seen in his attack on the two Filipinos in the cottage. He can't see anyone. No one can see anyone. The only one sees a dislike of disease and a contradiction of health, the heart of survival instincts. <br /> <br /> Often, an arm is pointing to the left of the screen against what is to be hoped for in so far Thule's freedom. Yet, it is blocked by American soldiers, where the Japanese stragglers disappear to die slowly in this effortless dirt. Even a church tower appears which reflects the light of an invisible sun. But upon closer inspection, crows crawl wildly about it; Also religion is an air of poison. <br /> <br /> Nobi, the Japanese title of the film, provides more evidence of the themes, or feelings of the movie: seriousness of fate, the existence of existence under leadership and living controlled by others. Its actual English-speaking translation is the subject of a heavy debate among historians, since non-choral translates it as "slave" and "slavery", while many Koreans claim that nobi was not a slave system but a servant class system that does not meet slavery . One way to typically escape scary poverty. This improves on the war theme and the symbolism of the soldier. It is not important to ask ourselves what the purpose is of what will be our winning story? Should we be safe to let it roll without conscious effort for change? Isn't it who we fight, age old story questions, but rather why do we fight? Fires on the plain are with Eiji Funakoshi, Osamu Takizawa and Mickey Curtis; based on a novel by Shohei Ooka. In Japanese with subtitles.
