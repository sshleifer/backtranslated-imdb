If Hollywood had the public's well-being at heart, we would see 20 films a year with the kind of healthy strength that lies behind this movie. There is more experience of personal growth in this movie, and while the characters are still very human, even the lessons learned are not that greed will win you or make-to-others-whatever-you-want-as-long -like-you It's what our sad, desensitized life needs, more sensibly ... more love ... more do-it-yourself-as-you-would-have-done-to-you ... more HOPE. (Thanks Ursula!) This movie has an intelligent humor, not "yo 'mama" cracks that run violently in the so-called comedies. People need to feel good. This movie will make you feel good and possibly inspire you to improve your life and the lives of others. Side note Each person counts in ticket sales. This is a truly independent movie. If you want more quality movies, support them.
