I am 13 years old and I write this review in my mother's sign. She will write her own review later. <br /> <br /> This is my all-time favorite movie. It was filmed in England in 1944. I saw it so many times when I was little that I worn the video tape out. I love this movie and it changed my life! The beautiful landscapes. The mighty, tart, thoroughbred horse. The plain little Irish village with the young girl who would do what no other girl had ever done compete in The Grand National Steeplechase in London with her most beloved horse, The Pirate. It all made me ride horses (as I've done now for 7 years) and learn everything I could about their races so I could also draw and paint them. It is a groundbreaking film about winning against all odds, overcoming your fears, believing in yourself and achieving difficult goals by working very hard. The horse racing scene was also one of the best ever made, and I have seen many films with horse racing. I never get tired of watching this movie. Everything about it is perfect. Especially if you are a young girl and passionate about horses!
