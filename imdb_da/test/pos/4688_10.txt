Hi, I have to say you have some wrong information about the series here. The main author was Richard Carpenter, he created the series. Later, there were some other writers, but they did only a few episodes. <br /> <br /> The first director who made most of the series (I think complete series 1) was Ian Sharp, who created Robins Sherwood. <br /> <br /> Clanned really some of the material and they read the scripts. I know for sure, because Richard Carpenter told it at a Con in England last year. <br /> <br /> I think this is a masterpiece of TV entertainment because it has great characters and cast, great costumes and great story lines. For me, I'm still one of the best TV shows ever!
