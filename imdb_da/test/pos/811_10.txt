I first saw this movie back in the early 90s and immediately fell in love with it. richard benjamin and his wife paula made the 1981 movie "Saturday the 14th" in 1981, before making this film in 1983. I think they work quite well together. This movie made me laugh at several occasions. It also has a young molly ringwald, which would later continue in the late 1980s to make films as beautiful in pink and sixteen candles. It's fun to see her a little younger. not seen by many people. I don't even think the average movie fan has ever heard of this movie. but when I first came across it, I was glad I did. I gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars that I believe it is a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy. Lastly, I would like to say that it is not available on DVD, so I downloaded a VHS copy on ebay, so if you are interested, you can probably find one there. It may be in the $ 20- $ 30 dollar range, but I do have $ 12 bucks. I wish they would eventually release this on DVD.
