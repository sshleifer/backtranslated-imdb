I do not know if it is fair for me to review this. I'm not a fan of free violence. I never understood the movie industry to make heroes out of mob members and cold-blooded killers. When The Godfather came out, I thought they had broken the mold, but the decades have produced a number of well-behaved mobs with big stars and directors making them. This is of course low budget, but it is certainly well done. At some point in all these, I want to take a bath. If such signs actually exist, it is difficult for the soul. I always intellectualize that humanity will rise above this kind of thing. This kind of crude oil must be stopped. I hope that the people who go to the movies like this are more voyeuristic and less resident. I have the same in the same way about slasher movies. Why do we have a fascination with death and dismemberment? In fairness I judge this on the actor and the director, and for what it is, it seems to work pretty well.
