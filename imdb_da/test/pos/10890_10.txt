We all have the game Halo and Socom and GTA and Resi etc. But none of them can stand up to GE007. The game itself is amazing. I literally burned out my N64 playing this amazing game along with Zelda OOT. This game alone built the shape that is essential for all modern shooters. on the other hand, multi-player is great. The story mode itself is worth playing a hundred times and more. It's a great game for when your table and you just want to shoot up some people and there are endless unlocks. (cheats, aztec, egyptian, god knows how many multiplayer charries and the three difficulties as well as the famous "007" problems our modern games are good, but when you sit down and play this game, you get a sense of few other games can give you, and with the online opportunities for newer shooters, we rarely see this old two in two death styles and when we do, it's not nearly as good as this game, and when you get bored with the story, There are endless mysteries, glitches and easter eggs to be found and exploited. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the greatest shooting games all the time.
