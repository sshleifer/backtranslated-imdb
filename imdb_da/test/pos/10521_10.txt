Another who threw off the radar at most. This little B-produced gem is so full of new ideas in an old genre and so totally refreshing and inventive that a terrible sense of missing cojones in today's cinema slowly overtakes your body. The final set is so innovative in its attitude and style that it prefers everyone from Tarantino to John Woo. Oh, and if you think "dying lines" are all cliches, wait for the dying line of FF. A piece of dialogue that could have struck you with laughter takes your heart. A real pleasure. Search it and see it. You won't be sad.
