LACKAWANNA BLUES is an entertaining, exciting, emotionally charged HBO TV movie based on childhood memories of actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson (who also appears in a small role). This delightful movie experience is centered on Santiago-Hudson's childhood nurse, Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a strong, big-hearted black woman who ran into a New York guesthouse during the 1950s. Nanny was a one-woman social service organization whose guesthouse was full of drunks, derelicts, cripples, addicts, misfits, and anyone else in town who needed a hand-up instead of a hand-out. The essence of the story is about the nanny's relationship with young Ruben (beautifully played by Marcus Franklin), a boy whose divorcing parents could not properly reap the boy, so the nanny took him in. S. Epatha Merkeson, who for many years has wasted Lieutenant Van Bure's ruthless role on NBC's LAW & ORDER, turns into a powerhouse performance like Nanny, the neighbour's mother figure, whose guesthouse became a symbol of the shaded black people of the city. Brand Zone is nothing short of magnificent, in a performance that gave her a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award. Brandon is backed by an impressive star star that includes Terrance Howard (brilliant and heartbreaking as Nanny's husband), Louis Gossett Jr., Rosie Perez, Jimmy Smits, Delroy Lindo, Macy Gray, Michael K. Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Henry Simmons, Patricia Wettig, Ernie Hudson, Mos Def and Hill Harper as the adult Ruben. Colorful and exciting, beautifully photographed and exquisitely scored, this is a kind of movie experience that works at all levels, but if for some reason it is worth watching for the electrifying role of S. Epatha Brandon, which gets the role of life and make the most of it.
