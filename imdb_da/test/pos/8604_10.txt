This is a fairly faithful adaptation of Masuji Ibuses novel, "Black Rain." Like the book, it is very moving and thought-provoking. The story is about a few attempts to see their niece successfully married. They have trouble finding suitors because of rumors that she is suffering from radiation disease, after going through Hiroshima on the day of bombing. Well filmed, well-acted, moving, tragic, scary and fun.
