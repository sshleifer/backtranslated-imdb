I know little or nothing about astronomy, yet; I was initially a little skeptical about the plot of this movie. It follows three children, all of whom were born during a solar eclipse and then have no feelings and thus (of course) become ruthless serial killers. Basically, the reason sounds ridiculous, but when you realize that a solar eclipse blocks out Saturn, and as you know, Saturn's emotional planet is all in place. makes full sense, and it is then that you know that you do not just see another silly 80's slasher with an honest brain plot. Thank goodness for that! However, the Bloody Birthday is seriously based on a ridiculous premise, but it does more than the original one. Having a bunch of children walking around slaughter is perhaps not the most brilliant championship ever seen in the cinema, but when you get the choice between this and another boring Friday the 13th clone - I know what I would choose. <br /> <br /> Also, the movie helps out of the hole that some people would think it's silly plot dug it in, the fact that it is extremely entertaining. Many slashers become formal too fast, and the audience ends up looking just to see something doing. This movie, however, keeps pace with some gorgeous, creepy performances by the kids (which stuck to gruesome kid-classics like The Damned Village), a constant stream of sick humor and a small but impressive type of movie, the thrill of tension and excitement. One thing I liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weapons. There is nothing worse than a slasher, where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again (coughing Halloween cough), but this is not the case here as Bloody Birthday finds space for everything from jumping rope to bow and arrows. There was no room for a chainsaw, which is a big shame, but I don't think every movie can have a chainsaw in it.
