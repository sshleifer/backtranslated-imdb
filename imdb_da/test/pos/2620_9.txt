This episode of Charmed changed everything! The show is about to finish the third season and the whole hell breaks loose in this episode. The charms bring an innocent by the name of Dr. Griffiths to the manor, protecting him from Shax, The Sources Assassin. When Shax attacks, he explodes like a tornado and then corporealizes in his demon skin. He blasts Prue throwing a wall that completely knocks her out and almost kills her. Then Piper Piper threw what is left of the wall. Phoebe comes from the loft and says that the mocking spell before Shax came to kill the doctor. But being one's power, it just sows him. Leo is going to cure the other sisters, and Prue will find Shax and destroy him for real. Phoebe, meanwhile, is trying to find Cole in the underworld. When Prue and Piper go out into the street to find the demon, the demon finds them. After their fight, the hedges understand that a camera caught everything! When they return to Manor, they try to fight with the media, and after they have defeated Shax, a witch who has passed, shoots coca piper. Prue uses her telekinesis to move people out of the way so she can get to the hospital. But they get their too late, and Piper dies. And just as Prue is being shot, the time is back to where they bring Dr. Griffiths to the manor. Shax blows in and blasts Prue and Piper. But Phoebe is still in the Underworld, so Shax kills the doctor and blasts out of the manor. When Leo finally comes, he can't cure Prue. Prue is dead and there is also the power of three powers. For now. Personally. this episode was sad. Prue was the only one of them. I would love to have its power of telekinesis. I really don't think Phoebe should go to the underworld, because if she didn't, Shax wouldn't have killed Prue. But Paige brings the Power of Three back together and I'm happy with the show's progress
