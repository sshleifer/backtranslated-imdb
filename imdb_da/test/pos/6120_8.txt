Out of any category, this is a demented and over the edge film, even in today's standards. The movie is totally in crap-o-rama, this movie will blow your mind (and something else too!) The amount of hilarious bad taste and sleaze is amazing. The dialogue is breathtakingly fast and campy. You will either love or hate this movie, but give it a go. I've seen it 4 times and love it completely. Divine is striving to be the dirty person alive, but it is also her rivals in this obscene and obnoxious (but fun) and stylish little movie. <br /> <br /> The divine was phenomenal, and "she" will always be missed a lot. Edith Massey makes the unforgettable performance as "egg yolks" and don't forget the energetic Mink chairs! <br /> <br /> About crazy s ** t! <br /> <br /> Also recommended for you sick little puppies; <br /> <br /> Female Problems <br /> <br /> Desperate Living <br /> <br /> Polyester
