Sorry to repeat me again and again, but here's another great Columbo episode. I think that's why I'm such a fan - most episodes are really good! The best episodes always have a standout function of some sort, and in this case, the killer and his accomplice may be the youngest ever Columbo villains. After seeing many episodes where Columbo and his opponent seem like close friends, it's good to see an episode where temples fray and bad emotions rise to the surface. It just gives an episode a little more drama and bites. Columbo is quickly on the fact that the two students who claim to help him do not so much secretly laugh at him and feed him with false traces. He plays happily with consciously turning up for them to underestimate him! But of course he knows immediately when they talk baloney. The murder itself is another complicated, in line with The Bye Bye Sky High IQ episode, with a sophisticated chain reaction of events that manages to kill the intended target while assassins get an apparently watertight alibi. In the intervening years between 1978 and 1990, technology has moved from record players and four-crackers to remote control of car lock systems and hidden cameras. <br /> <br /> Stephen Caffrey puts on a great performance like Justin Rowe, the unpleasant, spoiled student. Gary Hershberger is low-key, but good as his "yes man" friend Cooper Redman. And it's nice to see Robert Culp as Mr Rowe, Justin's father. <br /> <br /> A very satisfying episode in every way.
