Michael Kehoe has achieved a good experience, especially since it is only his second start as an author, producer and director. Generally, "first hour" lacks vision and direction when halving a larger production, but "Dominion" proves that Mr. Kehoe goes in Hollywood! Set with beautiful scenery, Dominion has experienced cast members (especially Thomerson & James) who communicate Kehoe's vast vision with extraordinary clarity. Few movies can mix the slasher / horror genre with a real action / adventure feel, but Dominion completed it completely. This movie certainly qualifies as one of the leading films in both of these categories. If you're looking for quick action with more than one excitement modicum, look no further. I look forward to Kehow's future projects with great enthusiasm. Well done!!!
