I think this movie has become an important overview of the most terrible aspect of the East German regime - the imprisonment of its people knows what the regime called its antifascist protection wall. It is a document of desperation and courage not to miss. However, I would like to comment on the actual location of this escape. It did not happen in or around Berlin as assumed by some respondents and was nothing to do directly with the Berlin Wall. The flying balloon was flown over the iron curtain, which not only divided Germany, but it split the whole of Europe at that time. The balloon departed from PÃ¶ssneck, 170 km southwest of Berlin in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and flew 14 miles to Naila in Bavaria and freedom in West Germany. The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall later that year. While the balloon flight created entertaining thrill cinema, it should remain as a monument to those who lost their lives while trying to escape from East Berlin, other parts of the GDR, or other Soviet-led states.
