I haven't seen this movie since it came out in the mid 70's, but I remember it as a very realistic portrayal of the music industry (right up there with Paul Simon's "One Trick Pony" .. another very underrated movie IMO) <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel does an excellent job as a producer caught between the music he believes in and the commercial "tripe" record company "suits" wants him to work with. <br /> <br /> Having used my entire career in the music industry as a composer / organizer / producer, I can truly prove the verisimilitude this movie possesses. <br /> <br /> If it ever came out on DVD scary, I would buy it!
