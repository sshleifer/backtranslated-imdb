This is an excellent movie and I want them to put it on DVD for people to buy. It's hard to try to catch it on TV all the time. As you do not know when one of the stations decides to fly it. Can anyone tell me which file company is doing so I can write to them and see if they will release it to the public? I only caught the last hour and a half yesterday, and I only got to see it sometime last year. My sisters and I are all looking for it in every store that sells videos. John Denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot line is amazing. They put out some much older movies, and I think it's good, but there are a few that they haven't posted, and I think if we could contact the producers and vote our requests, we can get some of them posted on DVD.
