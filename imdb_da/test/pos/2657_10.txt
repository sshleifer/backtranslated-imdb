This movie is not just good, it's great. Besides giving us good performances, original plot, amazing special effects, thought-provoking messages and much more, it was a so far invisible world for the public. This is the first sci-fi movie that takes us into our galaxy's unknown space with such amazing effects and minds that burst reality that the audience remains without words. I am only 16 years old and therefore I grew up in a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies. But I was still, and I mean, blown away by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. The visual effects were just one of the benefits of this movie, the camera in true Kubrick style was stunning and enchanting. It feels like you are consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). The effects, the camera and the large size of this movie caught me by my guards, even though I had seen the review before I bought it. But this movie has more to it than this. The meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you wish, even though I think there are some clear points about humanity (also Kubrick style). How humanity at the top of its development is just maintenance on board and therefore not necessarily of the computer, one of humanistic tools. How we look like babies in space, learn to walk once more, lose control of our tools in zero gravity and add equipment like fish out of water. On top of evolution, we set ourselves in the endless adventure as simple primates. Many may think that the movie's length and slow pace are boring? ridicule? or just a waste of time. But before you can jump to these conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with quiet music and a spaceship in the middle of the room for several minutes. This is to illustrate the beauty of it. Beauty, beauty is in many cases not given legitimate respect to the viewers. Kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we don't go after it and relax, we can't enjoy this movie as it was intended. This is not a regular movie, we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies, it takes time, thoughts and above all engagement and emotions to see. All this together makes this one of the greatest results in the world of moving images. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.
