Seen in Paris in the year 1910, a retired old rich opera singer decides to give her happiness to her beautiful cat duchess (pronounced by Eva Gabor) and her kittens, but the jealous butler Edgar comes up with a plan when he kidnaps cats and leaves them on the country. Fortunately, they help them with the help of a streetwise and independent tomcat, named Thomas O'Malley (pronounced by Phil Harris), that they come home especially to meet some of his good friends like the swinging "Scat Cat" (disappeared by Scatman Crothers) and try to foil Edgar plans. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining and edgy post-Walt Disney's death movie with a couple of great jazzy tunes like the memorable "Everyone Will Be a Cat", good voice and some great animations for that time even in these computer animation times . Not one of the greatest Disney animated movies, but a cool Disney animated fave and one of the few gems of it is the day that works well, highly recommended.
