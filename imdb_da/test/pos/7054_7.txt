I liked this movie for the most part, but have to say that if there were anyone else besides Bill Murray in the lead, it wouldn't have been so good. He brings an energy to the role that this movie enters into a notch than it would have been otherwise. I have mainly had pranks drawn on one advisor and there are also other humorous things in this movie also as hotdog eating competition. This film would also set the scene for summer camp movies with the competition at the end. Almost every camp movie has either this or the troubled or troubled children's plot or a combination of both. This series would also take a rather strange shift in tone, as this one and two are both family-friendly movies, while part three and four are more adult oriented, more like the old teen art comedies of the time. It did the opposite of the Police Academy films that went from R to PG-13 to PG movies. This series goes from opposite to R. Still this first and only good is worth some chuckles largely due to Bill Murray.
