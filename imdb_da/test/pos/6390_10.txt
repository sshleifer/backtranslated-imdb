It gives the ordinary guy / girl the chance to be on television song as their favorite stars. <br /> <br /> For most of the time, they sound like a singer they are meant to portray. <br /> <br /> Another twist to it - A team of makeup people and customers dress up the competitor as the singer. They may not look like them, but the likelihood of getting someone who sounds like a person who looks exactly the same as them is very slim. It's a fun for your Saturday night - and the participants are raging wannabes as they are at another TV song show. The fact that there are no prizes involved and that is fun means that it will attract another type of person. The only gripe I have is with the Kids version - they seem to have made the round of stage schools - what happened to the normal kids?
