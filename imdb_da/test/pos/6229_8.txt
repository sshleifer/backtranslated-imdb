A group of young adults are stranded behind, where the only place nearby is a museum full of wax dumplings, and the only form of help is the lovable local Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors). As night falls, the children are picked in record time. <br /> <br /> A strange, freaky B movie that combines the creepiness of backwoods settings with the plot of overly vivid mannequins (making this a good update to "organs of the wax museum" genre) This is an intense shock party in line with "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". (It should not come as any surprise that TCSM art director Robert A. Burns repeats this duty here and his eye for great decoration always comes in handy.) Pino Donaggio's score is even chilling; Accompanied by the creepy photography of Nicholas von Sternberg, it drains the film in oppressive atmosphere. Plot twists vary in level of success; There was one I saw a mile away and one that actually surprised me, and I was more happier for it. One of the best moments is shared with us almost right in front, as the first chump victim is trapped in a space with objects flying on his own will. Capper is a large impalement of tubes with blood that drips from the end. <br /> <br /> Star Connors offers an engaging performance as our down-home good ol 'boy antagonist, while younger co-stars, predictably, cannot perform at the same level, even though Jocelyn Jones is a sympathetic and complete surely prominent lady who has enough appeal to judge as a sympathetic queen-in-distress. Co-star Tanya Roberts (a brunette in this movie) is okay for support. (If I had a problem with this movie, it's just that the victims are a little too stupid. Then it doesn't make much difference to many horror movies from the 80s.) Future noteworthy names among the credits are future directors Ted Nicolaou, who was editor Here, Ron Underwood (who made a big debut almost a dozen years later with "Tremors") as assistant director and veteran makeup artist Ve Neill, who has made many films and won three Oscar pages. <Although some horror fans may be disappointed with the lack of nudity and sexual elements, it is otherwise a nice little surprise that debut director David Schmoeller lives with conviction and gusto. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
