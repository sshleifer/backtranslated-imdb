The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways, ranging from more or less traditional points of view to dealing with art for more post-modern approaches that can dissolve the game by postcolonial, feminist, gender or deconstructivist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me pretty cold is that I had no idea what he was about. What is the underlying vision / idea / concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much longer than revenge tragedy, punk show, but there is probably more to it, isn't it? This is not to say that there is no vision here, just that I was hard-pressed to discover it. Be it possible, there are still things to enjoy. The punk flavor is refreshing and fun. Toyah Wilcox like Miranda and Jack Birkett as Caliban are wonderful. I was very worried about Williams as Prospero ... not enough magic, I suppose. The shifts between the old monastery / castle and the (very English) world outside can be a little disturbing at times, but I think it is intentional. All in all interesting, but not quite the success I had hoped it could be (especially after seeing Jarman's Caravaggio).
