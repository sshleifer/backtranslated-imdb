I thought this movie was great if you didn't take it too seriously. Just sit back and enjoy Hilary Swank in all its grandeur and laugh when the monks go to Boston, MA. I also think this movie has a good message of self-control and inner strength. Plus Mr. Myagi was so sweet, I wish he would teach me karate!
