8/2008. When I originally wrote my comments shortly after I first watched this movie, I took a critical view, feeling that Lemmon and Matthau had basically "phoned in" their beliefs that paired them in a way they had done several times before. br /> <br /> But after seeing it again, it seemed different, especially considering that none of the two main megastars lived much longer after the release. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Spiner, all the eight main characters are artists with great experience and also inevitably much more "in tune" than we have seen in many of their other movies and TV work. But isn't that nearly everyone? <br /> <br /> See it again, while it certainly won't be considered a "classic" in any of their careers, it's a fun movie with a lot of interesting scenes from my point of view reminding me that many movies, games, etc. can often be viewed either very critically or instead of seeing the brighter side without expecting a movie to be another "Citizen Kane", "Casablance" or (with respect to the two leaders ), another original "Odd Couple." It will also give a continued piece of nostalgia to Lemmon and Matthau, as well as the others in the casting.
