My dad took me to watch this movie when it was released in 1976. I was just a kid and it scared crapen out of me. So much so that I had to leave the theater under a special claustrophobic tunnel scene as it was too intense for me !!! I went home to my family's safety. I saw the film all the way through as I got older and thoroughly enjoyed it. Shame on the men in monster suits. If you overlook the fairness of the production and dive deeper, you will find an excellent performance of Cushing, a fantastic opening score, a good photography and the always reliable Mr.Douglas McClure, my childhood hero! British police forces guarding Whitehouse at the end! Titty bang bang cave woman! Monsters with beak! Actors in monster suits are sliding on wires! This has it all! Superb.
