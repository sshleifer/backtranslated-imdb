What a great movie this is. I found it full of the wonderfully unexpected pain of being a single father of a teenage girl. And it is located in a tropical island 'paradise' well. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardeiux brings his special European flair to this story of a divorced father of a teenage girl. They are vacationing together and she is starting to add to the excitement of the island in many unexpected ways. But you will have to watch the movie for yourself to see all the hilarious situations they find for themselves. <br /> <br /> There are a few cult classics that all teenagers should see. This movie must be added to the list. In addition to Dirty Dancing, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Rocky Horror Picture Show and Animal House, my dad needs the heroic film study. Look as if you had a teenage daughter and you are rolling with laughter. Watch it with your teenage daughter and prepare to laugh for months.
