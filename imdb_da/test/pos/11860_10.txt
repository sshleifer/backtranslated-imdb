I first saw this movie at a premiere party in Mr Zwart's hometown of Fredrikstad. There, between directors, musicians and other Norwegian celebrities, I laughed and laughed ... I just couldn't stop. If you like a comedy with black humor, sharp lines and excellent acting - this is a flick you have to see! It's like mixing "True Romance" with "The Wedding Singer" and adding a dash of "Food about you" Hilarios! <br /> <br /> 10 points!
