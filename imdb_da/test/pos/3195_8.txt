I was reminded to see this program as a young boy in Australia in the 60's and enjoyed it on DVD again as a 50-year-old father of young children. Although the evil boys are mostly superficial signs and are part of violence, I am very happy that my 6 and 8 year old children can see this because the key characters are deep, friendly and honorable, the Japanese culture shines through, violence is not gory, no glories in it, and the program is beautiful to see. It does not promote nightmares, but instead it shows much of the culture that must primarily influence the Jedi knight's design in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The quality of the DVDs leaves something to be desired. Video perfectionists will not like this. It is strongly reminiscent of something that is held on 16mm film and projected on the wall of some basement ... which it may be. The soundtrack is also lacking in the quality we have expected from the home theater. However, my children only noticed that it was not in color, and I suppose they only noticed it because we had recently talked about how old things are often like that. The beauty of Mt Fuji is evident even in B&W. Something in the 18th century sets the quality of the atmosphere as if you are looking into the past through a time window. All in all, this program is better than most things in the air and a much better advertisement for Japanese television than Pokemon, but you can consider it of marginal value if you had no experience seeing it back in the 60s. My score of 8/10 takes its age into consideration.
