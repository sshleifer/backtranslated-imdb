I saw this series in London TV in 1999 and was blown away. As another user commented - That was what I wanted to see when I first looked at "Jurassic Park" - Life and death of dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary. The CG is very lively, and the diversity of the dinosaurs and habitats shown also makes it very educational. The series takes all the actual knowledge of dinosaurs, adding many good ideas of "what it might have been" to compensate for what looks like a documentary series. What I missed was a small little curve constantly in a corner of the screen that moved between "fiction" and "facts" along with the narrative and pictures, because you often wonder how much trained guesses and how much is pure imagination. <br /> <br /> To get some traces of facts and fiction, you need to see 50 minutes of "Making Of," which is not only very educational about the CG process and collects and includes the paleontologists' knowledge in the series, but also is very fun (dinosaurs smoke cigarettes and complain about CG animators). I highly recommend watching this series before joining the upcoming Disney Dinosaur movie or watching a Jurassic Park (like) movie again. It will definitely make you much more critical of these movies. Disney Trailers looked particularly bad.
