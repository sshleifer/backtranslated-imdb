Gregory Peck and Gig Young compete for the same girl, and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they are due to him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort where they are violated by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers whom he considers to be the earth's foam and the actors playing these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren, a Westerner specialist, author, director, and producer. The idea of ​​using this type of men as heroes inspired many films that came out later, including "The Dirty Dozen" made in 1967.
