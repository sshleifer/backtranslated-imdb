So fun is the perfect way to describe this 12 minute spoof on the original Star Wars. Hardware Wars is incredibly fun. It is presented as a trailer of Space Epic Hardware Wars. The wit is this: Imagine Star Wars played by bad actors and incredibly bad special effects. The characters include "Intergalactic Boy Wonder" Fluke Starbucker, "Ace Mercenary and Intergalactic Wise Guy" ham salad, Darph Nader, "villain" and a host of other amazing characters. It is impossible not to laugh while watching this 12-minute treasure. It's stupid, but it's fun. You will laugh from start to finish and you will feel the need to see it again and again and again and again ... And you will laugh every time you see it !!! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. The funniest 12 minutes ever made. You'd think it took a moment!
