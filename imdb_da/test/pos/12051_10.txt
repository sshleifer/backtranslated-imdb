The film is a very good movie. One of the best from Yash raj movies. The direction is incredible. The script is brilliant. The story is excellent. It tells of Rahul, who is obsessed with Kiran's college. He is a full blown psycho doing things like talking to his mother on a phone (yet she died 15 years ago) etc. The Kiran is engaged to Sunil. Rahul does everything he can to get her. He even tries to kill Sunil, but he survives. He even goes to the place where they go to their honeymoon. The movie is every nerve's delight.Shahrukh is amazing, Juhi is pretty good, Sunny is average, Anupham is okay, and that's Tanvi, Dalip did well. The film belongs to Srk. The dialogues are brilliant (Shahrukh them and much if not the overbearing and comedy). "Jaadu Teri Nazar" and "Tu Mere Samne" are absolutely melodic tracks.
