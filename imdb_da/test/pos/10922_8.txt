Some movies want to make us think, some will span us, some will experience us. But sometimes a movie will only make us laugh, and "In & Out" will certainly succeed in this section. Indiana High School Teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) will marry fellow teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) in three days, but the whole city is more excited about the Oscar nomination of former resident Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon). But when Cameron wins an Oscar to play a gay soldier, he thanks his gay teacher, Howard, for inspiration. What follows is Howard denies it in a hilarious set of mishaps in a real scrubbing way. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline is amazing and exudes gay stereotypes. Joan Cusack really has a good ability to use screws. Debbie Reynolds is absolutely hilarious as Howard's mother. And Bob Newhart is also a hoot as the homophobic principal. <br /> <br /> The children's movie author Paul Rudnick really achieves a delicate balance here. He knows the stereotypes and exploits them in a way that is mostly tolerable to conservative Midwesterns and yet mostly unofficial to the gay audience. It's not exactly progressive, but it's fun and unofficial and definitely a step from the previous year's "The Birdcage."
