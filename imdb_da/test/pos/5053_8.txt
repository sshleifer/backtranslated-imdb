Foremost, if you are tired, the first hour may be slow. The set-up of the story has a natural relaxed pace, unlucky - giving us time to appreciate the kind of everyday life and situations that the protagonists are in. Once you've come to the monastery segment of the story, the event will keep you hooked: how will things show themselves what will happen to our precious Fanda (portrayed to the utterly silent perfection of the veteran Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský), how will his wife (wonderfully played by Stella Zázvorková) treat him, what happens to Fanda's dear friend Ed ( played by Stanislav Zindulka - a matching sidekick to Brodský), and Jára's son with selfish hidden agenda, blind to his parents' kindness (sigh!) Vladimír Michálek wisely oriented the movie with sprinkles of humor, preserving the insightful script of Jirí Hubac. Thanks to clear subtitling, I could notice any complaining phrase, Fanda's wife extract, which is a touch of 'caring' that shows / buried itself between the lines - and so the judicial judge observed. Fanda is '76 of 80 'and love for their persistent (engaging) marriage manifests itself in their arguing arguments. His playmate can be contagious. <br /> <br /> This is "Growing Old Together 101" for (at least) the fifties, and the experience of sons and daughters not taking the parents for granted. You may need to reconsider whether you assume 'home for the elderly', is a means to an end, so to speak. The movie gently calls us to live life to the fullest while we can. (Hint: There is pleasure in continuing and seeing the final credits.) <br /> <br /> We are fortunate to see an occasional Czech film. Sverák ("Kolya") father and son's 2001 "Dark Blue World" revealed with pathos. It is good to take it slow now and then and appreciate a strange gem - its subtitles, scenery, melodic scores and an engaging human story with elegant performances. "Autumn Spring" (aka Babí Léto) is available on DVD. Enjoy!
