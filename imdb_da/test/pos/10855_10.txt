"Tipping The Velvet" is one of the modern television productions that shows that something TV can be as good or even better (as it is) than what you see in your local theater. <br /> <br /> To read the plot, read this and if you want other details skip to the next section. This is the unforgettable portrait of an unconventional young girl named Nan who works as a naive oyster girl until she discovers her repressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named Kitty, who dresses like a man to her scene profession. The young girl soon ends up acting like another male imitator and they are a big hit. Soon both of them begin on a widespread affair. Kitty is eventually encapsulated in a marriage of convenience and ravages young Nan's heart. From then on, Nan works as a male prostitute prostitute for men seeking to have sex with boys, then she becomes the private sex slave to the evil and sadomasochistic Diana, where Nan experiences severe emotional abuse. When it ends badly, Nan is back in the street where she is reminiscent of a young woman named Florence; a kindhearted socialist who had the true potential of being a wonderful partner. This is where Nan will discover socialism and learn to come back to fame. The Region 1 transfer has outstanding picture quality, a very good scene selection, an eloquent photo gallery and a fun interview between author Sara Waters and the movie writer Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> The sets, costumes, movies and music are beautiful. The action, writing and control are extremely strong and filled with realism, class and originality. I loved the movie and the novel. Section III in the film is very different in the film than in the novel, because section III of the novel is written down, but is not screen material. I want to be brave and say that I love the film's interpretation of it much more. <br /> <br /> This breathtaking historical genius combines drama, comedy, eroticism and romance into living perfection in a way that both moves deeply and spiritually uplifting. For any mature and open adult who has ever felt the pleasures, pains and power to fall in love and live to the fullest. A revolutionary production; an absolute must-see!
