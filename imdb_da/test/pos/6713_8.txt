Tobe Hooper (fresh off mainstream success with 'Poltergeist') aims at the sky this time. 'Lifeforce' is an adaptation of Colin Wilson's 'Space Vampires'. The script of 'Alien's Dan O' Bannon and Don Jakoby varies a little, I was told: The futuristic story was made modern and Hailey's Comet was added to coincide with its actual passage through the ground a few weeks after the movie's release (so I "The story relates to a shuttle mission (commander of Steve Railsback) sent to investigate Hailey's Comet as it passes by Earth. Everything goes out without a hitch but by reaching the comet, it is discovered that a foreign ship is hidden in the comet's comet. The massive structure and discovering dried-out bat-like creatures, looking deeper into the ship, has found a chamber containing three humanoids (two nude men and a rather retrieving naked lady too) in odd stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat in tow. <br /> A little later, the ship returns to Earth but it cannot be contacted by NASA and another shuttle is launched to determine the status of Mission docking with Churchill discovers that a massive fire has apparently killed the crew and all flight data. But the three humanoids remain. But it is learned that an escape pod had been launched, but whose whereabouts are unknown. <br /> <br /> They soon discover the origin of the alien when the very attractive space vampire queen arises from her slumber to easily seduce the life force of the men around her. If you suck face with her, she makes you like them, and if you do not feed after two hours, you dry out and become dust. The goal of the three is to drain enough of the people's essence into power and maintain them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to also waste them. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the overpopulation survives re-entry into the podium (crash landing in Texas no less) and now has a mental connection to her royal hotness, the queen and can use it to find the hidden queen she and it Surviving male attempts to soften London dry by their souls. Tobe Hooper (of 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' (1974)) does an admirable job in what should be his greatest production to date. The production brings together many fine technicians from the entire film industry. Production designer John Graysmark (fresh from 'The Bounty (1984)') each uses four steps at Elsree Studios to create the ship's spacious interior and such. Cinematographer Alan Hume returns to science fiction after a stint on 'Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi' (1983) and three consecutive James Bond episodes. Hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the great effects. Oscar winner John Dykstra innovator of the pioneering effects of the original 'Star Wars' (1977) manages to push the envelope once again to create some highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. Heck himself maestro Henry Mancini falls in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feeling. In the working department, it falls largely on the shoulders of Steve Railsback and newcomer Mathilda May (vampire queen). Railsback always brings an edge to the characters he plays and can play nuts like no business. It comes in hand when his mind worsens when the queen's grip tightens on his soul. Gorgeous French actress May doesn't have a lot of many lines (was there more than ten?) But her often naked presence never gets old and you have to give her kudos to have jinglebells to pull it off. Almost much, the whole queen is there to do is feed and to do so, she must seduce you with her sexual presence. Job accomplished and where do I sign up to be a victim? I really enjoyed how they tweaked the old vampire clich√©s and still managed to make it seem fresh but still easily recognizable. Almost everything stands here: bats (their true form resembles a big bat), coffins (the stasis fields resemble those), transformations (they scan your mind and may be something), massive sexual appeal (Miss May ??. Duh) for Not to mention they even include the old standby stake-the-heart (this time a bit of a lead dagger to the energy center a little under the heart). The only thing they didn't touch was religion, but I think the vampires who use the cathedral at the end as home base can just be a bit of a look and a nod. In short (yes just 800 words later) 'Lifeforce' is an excellent science fiction and horror combination that gives tribute to the vampire theme while adding some nice different wrinkles. The effect and scale of production is enough to keep the summer film types engaged (at least at that time) and horror and sci-fi fans involved. 4 out of 5.
