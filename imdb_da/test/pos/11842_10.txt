I hope Robert Redford continues to make more films like this. Hillerman's books are wonderful, and as a young child raised in the southwest, his stories came home! Adam Beach is a very under-rated and under-used actor. Wake up Hollywood, not everyone thinks your Mel Gibson is cool! Many film-makers today want to watch movies that make you think. I've seen the whole Redford / Hillerman series. They are thoughtful, scenic and have great grounds. I hope that if enough people write to Robert Redford, he can decide to make a few more! Thanks Adam Beach and Tony Hillerman for great entertainment! If anyone gets a chance to read Tony Hillerman's latest book, do it! It is well. I also recommend traveling through Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Stop at each point of view and follow the setting of Hillerman's books. Fantastic experience.
