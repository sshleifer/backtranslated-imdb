I enjoyed some of the older doctors as many years ago, so when the new one came out, I just had to check it out. I was so happy - with the characters, the story lines, the updated look, I was hooked! From season 1 (27 for the old fans) to season 2 (28), it's just getting better. It also ties well with the old shows, although you don't have to know the old shows to enjoy this newer version. <br /> <br /> Although there has been a change of cast, I highly recommend Doctor Who - with Chris Eccleston AND with David Tennant. <br /> <br /> I like that they have given the characters so much depth. The doctor seems more vulnerable in this series, perhaps because he is the last TimeLord. The range of emotions Chris and David show is truly remarkable, and I felt their pain, anger, and sense of adventure with them. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper (Rose) brings a very human element to every episode, even though she is much better than I would be. With his talent, Billie will go a long way in the industry.
