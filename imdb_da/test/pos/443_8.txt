I watched this movie three times at different ages in my life and have always enjoyed it very much. This Can-Can is an authentic explosion of Joie de Vivre, which Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly musically, but in a French way. And a Jean Renoir good tribute to his time, his friends, lovers, music and dances. It is at the same time a show business chronicle of that age, full of love and French mood. It is for a clear tribute to Impressionism (people who like Impressionist painters will like this picture). It is especially a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and of course to Jean Renoir's father, Pierre-Auguste. You will find hearing a trustworthy and beautifully colored recreation of some Renoir master work. Excellent casting, scenery, sound effects and music. Although it tells us about the creation of the Parisian Moulin Rouge, it is of course a fiction story (and not particularly original, as it falls into the very good, moral that the show must continue). But the Jean Renoir production is great. <br /> <br />
