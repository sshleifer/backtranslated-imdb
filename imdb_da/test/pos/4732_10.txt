If you appreciate your freedom! <br /> <br /> I first became interested in The Branch Davidian debacle after reading an article in the British journal "Fortean Times". Want to learn more, I rented this documentary and after seeing it, I was stunned by what I saw. This movie peaked my interest in the subject and I have read several books on the subject since then. This movie is a must see for people who only know facts as reported in the so-called "mainstream" media. The baldfaced lies, double talk and contradictory statements by officials and politicians shown in this film will make you think twice about calling people who question the government's actions in this failure "nuts" "loonies" and "coke." <br /> <br /> What is frightening is that I know of some people who consider themselves open "intellectual" and liberal "liberals" who are still convinced that the government did the right thing at Waco and refuses to see this film or read any of the books on the subject. They continue to insist that it is not worth their time because it is all propaganda from cantilever, Clinton hates, religious fanatics, right-wing anarchist nuts. A publication from an organization consisting of many so-called "great minds" who claim to be dedicated to promoting "reason", "common sense" and "rationalism" condemned the film, claiming that it would poison people's minds and strongly suggested that this film should be suppressed. They even suggested Davidians if it had come. I don't want to mention his name since I'm a sweep. If you are one of those who read this (of course, you probably won't read this anyway), I can only say it's a shame you won't open your mind.
