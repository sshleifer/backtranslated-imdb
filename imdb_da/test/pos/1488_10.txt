Mr. Bean has shaped the face of British television comedy. He has proven that you do not need evil words or jokes, a massive budget, great intelligence or even any intelligence to do something brilliant. And Mr. Bean is one of the characters you just can't forget. Some of these episodes had me in stitches - yes, they are not realistic at all, and they are all quite stupid, but to be honest, realism is one of the barriers. Bean has broken on the road to greatness. Rowan Atkinson and co. ready to always make interesting new ideas - and hilarious new gags - remember Mr. Bean drove his green Mini while sitting on a couch on the roof? Mr. Bean is one of the things that will never be weak - the film was not as good as this, but Bean has introduced a clear new sense of humor to the world, and both children and adults will marvel at their tremendous fun factor. "Extras" and "Little Britain" can be condemned - it's British comedy at its best and most original. These escapades will never be old! 10.10
