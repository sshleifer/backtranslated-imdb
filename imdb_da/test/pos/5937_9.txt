I've had both Van Dykes over the years and was happy to see them again. <br /> <br /> Just as cute and fun and easy to see and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Dick was good when he was younger, but I enjoyed him more when he got older. <br /> <br /> Son Berry has been a good one to follow in his father's footsteps. <br /> <br /> Together they make a good team and work well together. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed that I haven't found another Murder 101 listed anywhere. <br /> <br /> I've seen both of them shown. I hope for more as it really is an enjoyable duo to see. <br /> <br /> You can definitely tell Berry follows in his father's footsteps, they are talking the same and having the same ways. <br /> <br /> Want to enjoy something they do separately. <br /> <br /> Will be sure to see something they do alone and together.
