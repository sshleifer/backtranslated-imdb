This royal Rumble basically had the message of breaking these days. Gimmick and image are more popular than wrestling ability. <br /> <br /> HBK vs Edge. Really good game. Very hot for Edge who just started out as a heel again and what better way to go into a fight with HBK. It was a bit slower at the end than usual. Overall, the match will be 6/10. Undertaker vs Hedinreich. Not a good game. Undertaker had to carry Hedinreich through this battle, which seemed to be really lost and turned up his movements. It was interesting to see Raws Gene Snitsky and a little later Kane came into this fight. Overall, the fans seemed more interested when the match ended. 2/10 Kurt Angle vs JBL vs Big Show. This fight was slow at first but was pretty good at the end when Angle managed to speed up the match. Kurt Angle moved some really good wrestling and proves that he is the best break out of the match. JBL and Big Show put on a slow fight. The end to this match was poor. Over this fight was a 5/10 mainlly because of Kurt Angle. Randy Orton vs HHH. Good fight, surprising heat to Randy Orton, who was the face of this battle. Randy turned out to be able to cross the line with any top star. This fight also marked the first battle HHH has wrestled where no one runs down and saves him from a loss. All over this match was about a 6/10. <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble match was OK. Some surprises. Some not so good surprises. I was very sorry that Kurt Angle didn't get enough time in this fight. But throughout this fight, a guy I never thought would be pushed so soon. I don't want to tell you who wins. I give this match an 8/10
