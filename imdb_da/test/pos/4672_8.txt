The movie is really good, it doesn't use violence or sex, etc. To sell itself as other movies, but instead just uses a really decent plot (based on the original by Michael Caine) and some great actors to make a fun, action movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. One thing that made me enjoy this movie even more was that it had some actors that I really like as Edward Norton (who I last saw in the 26th hour I also liked), Jason Statham ( carrier also enjoyed it) and Seth Green, who I think is great, his role as Shawn Fanning's roommate called "The Napster" is fun, and his hacking skills play a major role in the headline centering on a major traffic profile in LA. The car's chases are really decent, and the high-tech equipment used by the thieves is interesting and very impressive. I haven't seen the original so I can't really compare it too, but I liked this very much and would highly recommend this movie to everyone, it's not a movie where you have to like the specific genre that suits everyone I felt good about this movie, it had a really good ending and was generally really fun to watch. I give it 8/10. Go look at it!
