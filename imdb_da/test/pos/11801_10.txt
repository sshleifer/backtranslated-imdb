Let me start by saying that I was very surprised at the production value of this movie. I managed to catch an early show, and I have to say that this is the best (if not only) Christian movie to hit theaters since The Passion. Don't let PG-13 rating scare you, the rating is appropriate because of the serious issues being dealt with in this movie (divorce, teenage pregnancy, drug use and suicide), but nothing in the movie is free. This is definitely a movie that a youth youth group could see without disturbing (most) parents, and the message is wonderful. The best part is that this is not a movie for Christians, it is a family movie without the cheesy 7th heavenly mood. <br /> <br /> The laughs are there and several times in the theater were all laughing, the pieces of humor were natural and did not seem to be scripted or forced, and it made good pacing in such a serious movie. Teenagers and young adults, both religious and otherwise, will be able to identify with many if not all the characters in the film, and I was surprised to see such problems dealt with in this kind of movie. The reason is not in any way predictable, and in the end it is closer to home than many will admit. Fortunately, Christians are not shown, since all powerful know that it is all the word, but instead people just try to understand life. People make mistakes, and no one is perfect, not even in this movie ... not with a long shot. The play is top notch, the writing surface on, and you are not hit over head with all the preaching Christian rhetoric. This is a great movie that makes you and your teens think, speak, and maybe put their own morals (or lack thereof). To watch a quality family movie in January, check your local lists for this movie and learn something about yourself. <br /> <br /> And I'm a 25 year old man who just wanted to watch a free movie.
