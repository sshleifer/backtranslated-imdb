"Tale of Two Sisters" should be one of the craziest movies I've seen recently. In the end, there is no real supernatural element, despite what you expect throughout the film. The story seems to be about two sisters who, by returning to their father's home after some form of absence (later revealed to have been in a mental institution), are forced to deal with not only an apparent schizophrenic and possibly bi-polar grandmother who knocks out at the younger of the girls when the mood hits her and cheerfully tells them that she has made a special dinner at another time. But some presence is still inexplicable. It was later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in her older sister's troubled mind, who was unable to rescue her and her voice-mother, who were poor enough to let her die. Much about the strange family's specifications are not revealed in the movie, but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and an insidious hint of confusion. Absolutely not easy view; Look at this when you really want to think about what you've seen. It's a hell of a puzzle.
