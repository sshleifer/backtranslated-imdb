Filmed less than a year after Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the subject was fresh in the cast, director and audience. Most of the cast are real soldiers and officers right back from the war. The Soviet army cooperated quite a bit during recording, which is strange. <br /> <br /> The Afghan intervention was a bloody and pointless war where even the generals had forgotten the reasons for the bloodshed. This film shows the excitement and cruelty of military life, the emotional atrophy experienced by the troops and the pain that hugged a small nation torn by war and civil war. <br /> <br /> There is no shortage of powerful scenes. One of the first is recordings of steel coffins placed on a transport tied to the Soviet Union. Soldiers go about their work while an officer quietly ticks off the destinations: Moscow, Rostov, Donetsk, Baltic Sea. <br /> <br /> An earlier comment describes the last scene with May. Bandura as illogical. It is quite logical and in the spirit of the film: the only human relationship Bandura held was with the Afghan family, whom he accidentally kills in the attack. After losing his only puff to the war's futility, Bandura turns his back on the boy (and his gun) in departure for his destiny. I especially liked the last scene: a bunch of MI-28s rising over the mountains as a pilot's voice shouts: "Uhodim! Uhodim rebyata! br /> Afhanskii Izlom is an excellent movie - brutally honest and unholliwood as they come.
