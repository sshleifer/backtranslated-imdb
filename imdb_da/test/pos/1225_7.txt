New guy at a hooded car company is spoken of getting involved in a hooded car hoisted by his co-drivers to score some quick money. The problem is that they really don't have much of a plan, and when complications arise, things become mortal. <br /> <br /> Fast-moving popcorn action movies have a lot to do with it. First off the film is under 90 minutes, so the movie doesn't really have time to mash in the plot. It cranks everything up and just goes. Next, the film has some beautiful action sequences, so you move toward the edge of a seat. Finally, the movie features a star play that includes Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Lawrence Fishburne. It is a first rate cast that sells and covers the stories of short progress. <br /> <br /> This is not brain surgery it is a popcorn movie and at that level it scores a lot. Worth a visit.
