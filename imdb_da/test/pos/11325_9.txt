This lasted several years despite the late hour it was on. <br /> <br /> Like many 80's criminal dramas, it looked cold. Both physically and figuratively. However, this is not a bad thing. And the (of course) low budget actually worked in its favor. Gritty in a time when "smooth" was in. <br /> <br /> Allan Royal's wraparound segments as the news writer gave it a slight edge. <br /> <br /> The only actors I remembered were Scott Nyland (Earthquake) and Tony Rosato (SCTV). The cast of barely known was a good thing because you could see the group as a whole and not as a lot of people supporting a 'star'. And yes it is a young Clark Johnson (Homicide) in a recurring spot. I hope a DVD release is in the future. Someone out there wants to have it?
