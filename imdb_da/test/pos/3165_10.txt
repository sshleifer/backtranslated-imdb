I saw it in Europa plex. Great film !! <br /> <br /> This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the flesh of modern times. The protagonist Jim Kirk, runs an opaque RV over America, often stops to fill his gas nozzles. He is medieval and confused. He burns his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chats. He is the flesh: agitated and sometimes separated, rather ignorant of the growing tension around him, but feels uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The spirit tightens the movie through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and passes in the visual field. The spirit eventually collides with the flesh, and Kirk goes down and cannot understand what has happened to him. He has been in denial of how bad things have become because of his abomination to all of us, for we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh. We are all in the same denial, and then like Kirk we are in danger of going down and being blown away by desert sand like him.
