Richard Abernethie, a very wealthy man, is dead and his family has gathered for his funeral. Included in the funeral party is Abernathie's youngest sister Cora Galaccio. While none of the family has seen Cora for at least 20 years, everyone agrees that Cora was always a little different. So when Cora says something about Abemethie being murdered, most laugh at one of Cora's eccentrics. But, of course, someone takes Cora seriously. The next day, Cora was found dead in her bed after being beaten tremendously. Is there a connection between the two deaths? It's up to Hercule Poirot to find a killer. After the funeral is one of the most well-composed episodes of the entire Poirot series. I've always been a fan of this particular Agatha Christie book, and from what I remember, the movie is just as true to Christie's source material as any of the Poirot installments. The mystique is top notch with lots of tracks, suspects and red herring. And as I have previously written, I always enjoy a Christie story, where Hercule Poirot gathers everyone in a salon for the final disclosure. It may be old-fashioned, but that's how I like it. Get over the plot, technical and artistic After the funeral is a winner. Set, edit, direction and movie are as good as you find in one of these movies. The action is just as impressive. I expect an enjoyable performance from David Suchet as Poirot, and he does not disappoint here. The rest of the molding is just as strong with Monica Dolan, which gives a particularly remarkable performance. Apart from a less quibble with the fast fire road characters being introduced, I have no real complaints. It's a good show all around.
