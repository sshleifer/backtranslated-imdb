Human Traffic is undoubtedly the most original and compelling movie I've seen for a long time. It documents 2 days in a teen's life, bored with their everyday lives and deaths and takes ecstasy on raves at weekends. It is hilariously fun and extremely sensational and sometimes very sad. In the same genre as 'Trainspotting' it has a fantastic soundtrack and has hot young rising British stars. The film was made on a smaller budget and I look forward to future offers from Writer / Director Justin Kerrigan when his talent is discovered by the big filmmakers.
