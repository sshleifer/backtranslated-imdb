Music videos are often ignored in any discussion about movies, where most people consider them to be a minor art form. While a large majority are just flashy clips to advertise a popular practitioner's latest hit single, a precious couple is really rising above the rest, becoming artworks in itself. {Everything directed by Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry is always worth watching. While "art" is not exactly the word I would use to describe Michael Jackson's 'Thriller (1983)', it is an intensely sympathetic hybrid of horror and music and an outrageous fighting short film that remains remarkably nourishing 25 years later. The thirteen minute music video, both the longest and most expensive ever at the time of its release, was directed by John Landis, a filmmaker, I'm not terribly familiar with, even though 'The Blues Brothers (1980)' is a classic and I hear that 'An American werewolf in London (1981)' is a terrific entertaining scare / comedy. <br /> <br /> Whether the Thriller actually qualifies as a music video is destined for debate outlining its long duration {although Jackson enhanced this effort with the 'Ghosts' of 1997} and the fact that the title song consists of less than half of the total playing time. The video opens with a short film-in-a-movie, which Michael, in a quiet and luminous night, shows to his girlfriend (Ola Ray) that he is "different" from other guys and transformed into a fierce werewolf as the night clouds part to reveal a full moon. When he probably deapits the unlucky heroine, we come across Michael and his girlfriend in the cinema, and actually see this drama unfold in a horror picture. When the girl gets scared, they both leave the cinema and start going home, where Michael starts singing the opening lines in his latest song, "Thriller". But when a shadow of bloodthirsty zombies emerges from the local cemetery {their entry ghoulishly told by Vincent Price}, the situation begins to become interesting. <br /> <br /> It is hard to put my finger on why 'Thriller' is considered one of the greatest of all music videos. It may not just be that the song itself is very fun, and Michael Jackson ?? although he has since been shot by all the comedians' jokes for his peculiar personality and actions ?? There is no doubt that he is an excellent singer and performer. Perhaps a decent explanation for the film's popularity is the incredible amount of work that must have gone into it; nothing like it had ever been seen before and it is still something of a wonder in the world of music videos. The horrific monster make-up effects were designed by Rick Baker and are surprisingly graphic for a music clip, though all done with a good sense of fun. Several moments create some really exciting tensions that successfully capture the atmosphere of the movies it parodies (though always with a cheesy twist on the usual formula). You can simply never watch a zombie movie again in the same way!
