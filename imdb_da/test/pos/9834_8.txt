True, there are some goofs for those who want to find them. They are not important, though. <br /> <br /> The main feature of this movie is watching veteran actors make their craft. Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful and plays well the part of a strong woman, but one that has been hurt. The same for Harrison Ford, which for the ladies is as good as Kristin is afraid of us. <br /> <br /> Their pain in the hands of their incredible spouses brings them together in an awkward way, but one where they find support in each other. How they evoke their evil feelings and their humanity within their screen is why these are such sought-after performing artists. The viewer cannot help but feel what they are feeling, nor can it help them rejoice when they are together. Yes, there are several action scenes that involve anger corrupting the police, but they only eat it a little, and are not an essential part of the movie. <br /> <br /> For the lover of music, Dave Grusin gives a great jazz-based background with trumpets Terrence Blanchard. As the actors, Grusin shows why he is one of the most sought after musical consultants in the film industry. Blanchard shows why he is one of the premiere trumpeters on stage. <br /> <br /> Not a movie for lovers of gut, blood and gore. But for those who want to see much of what makes us feel inside, see a beautiful English actress with big, expressive blue eyes who can act as Harrison Ford for the endless soothing accompaniment with Dave Grusin and Terrence Blanchard. This is a move to see with someone you love. Preferably in bed. I thought it deserved at least an 8.
