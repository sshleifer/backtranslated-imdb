The purpose of being a classic before it was even conceptualized. This game deserves all the recognition it deserves. At a time when first-person shooters like the Quake III Arena and the Unreal Tournament garner all the attention of computer players, graphic adventures are a dying race. With great saying and humor, The Curse of Monkey Island is a game that people of all ages will enjoy. Life can only be improved after playing The Curse of Monkey Island. * Prediction * The sequel Escape from Monkey Island is already destined to be a classic too. I guarantee it.
