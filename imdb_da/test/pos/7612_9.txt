I love this movie so much. It always makes me cry. If you appreciate Drew Barrymore half as much as I do, you'll love this movie. It has all the essentials I'm looking for in a movie. It has good actors, good characters, good humor ... also many heartwarming moments. The flashback moments when we see Josie in high school make me cry. Every time. I'm sure you like this one, not judging by the fact that it looks like a teenage movie, even though it is somehow a teenager movie. Sure, if you're a guy and all you see is hardcore special effect movies only in the top 250 movies all the time, then it's not for you. But if you like romantic comedies, you won't forget after seeing it, pick it up at a video store and enjoy: Drew Barrymore is amazing in this!
