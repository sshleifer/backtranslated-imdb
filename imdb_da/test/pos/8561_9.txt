I agree that this movie reached its goals perfectly. I saw it at Showtime late at night as a teenager, and again at college. I thought it was fun. And there are boobs everywhere! It seems that in the late 70s and 80s there were lots of this type of movie made, from R-rated movies like "Porkys" to soft-core "Au Pair Girls"; It is a shame that they seem to have fallen by the way of popularity. What made HOTS good was that, as one of the two previous films, it is very fun. HOTS is like a girl-power version of "Animal House", with the girls forming a sorority of sorts and engaging in campus bedlam. On a side note, anyone who has designed "Hooters" girls outfits must surely have seen this movie.
