OK, so this movie may not have won any Oscars, but it's not a bad movie. The original "D.O.A." is undoubtedly a better movie, but that does not mean that this movie is bad. The movie stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles when he first became really famous for "The Right Stuff" made him a star, and a very nice looking Meg Ryan as she was still quite famous. <br /> <br /> This is more of an "update" of the 1950 movie, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too are different. The reason is basically the same. A man (this time an English professor at the University of Texas in Austin) is poisoned and he has only 24 hours to figure out who poisoned him and why. Meg Ryan plays a young college student trying to help him. Jane Kaczmarek plays Quaid's alienated wife, with a low key but intense achievement; She steals every scene she is in. Daniel Stern (also in an early role before "Home Alone" made him famous) plays Quaids colleague. Charlotte Rampling is also fine in a supportive role. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is top class; The movie is stylish, with a fast pace that keeps you guessing at the end. <br /> <br /> I think it's a movie that's definitely worth seeing as a thriller, and as a modern version of a classic movie.
