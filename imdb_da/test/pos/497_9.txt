I loved it. In fact, I saw it again and again and I could see it again. This movie doesn't get boring. <br /> <br /> The vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie. It's a well done job, great for today's generation. Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me when she wants and what a sexy accent she has. Donal Logue gives great comic relief. <br /> <br /> This vampire movie is like no other. I can't wait for Blade 2.
