Crimson begins with a sweet jazzy music, so I liked it right away, but when the film went on, I began to wonder if the music was not the best part. We have some thieves pulling a jewel hoist, and when doing something wrong, the alarm is triggered and the police are chasing them and when the car turns on a road block one of the twenties (Paul Nash, Jacinto Molina, the he is here) gets shot. Now it seems he may die, but with the help of a drunk doctor and his crazy friend (and wife), he is rescued, with some of the brains of some nightclub owner named "The Sadist". The sadist is unlucky because the gentlemen who kidnapped him lost their knife to remove the head, so to add disgrace to injury (or in this case death) they remove the head by a train and leave the body to the authorities to find, oops. Once the brain transplant is complete, Naschy wants to harass any woman who comes close to him because he now has the idea of ​​his donor. Well, of course, it is quite unlikely and contains medical equipment that seems to have been bought at Radio Shack, and generally it is quite cheesy and dizzy. But it has a good early 70's look and it's the music cool. This is not so much a horror movie, but more a thriller with lots of warriors fighting it out over grass and babes and other things, but it's strangely entertaining in ways I can't begin to describe. 7 out of 10
