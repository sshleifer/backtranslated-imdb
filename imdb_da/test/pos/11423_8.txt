Stan as a bullfight, and a good one, is quite a surprise. Normally overshadowed by Oliver Hardy, this quiet card gives him the opportunity to take the lead and the limelight. One can only conclude that his character "Rhubarb Vaselino" was a parody of the many Rudolph Valentino films in this era. Be prepared to laugh yourself stupidly in some of the dialogues, and watch for the special effects. I saw this on DVD in a Vol. 1 & 2 collection.
