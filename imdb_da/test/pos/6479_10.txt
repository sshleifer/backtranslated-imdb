You don't have to be a Notre Dame football fan to enjoy this because I'm not .... but as a football fan in general it was fun to watch. It almost makes me a Fighting Irish devotee. If you can't get caught up in the feelings of this movie, the gridiron fan or not, you better check your heart rate because this is an emotional movie with some very touching scenes. As a sports fan, I loved watching the classic recording of early college games. They had some pretty wild games with many sides. They interspersed this recording with Pat O'Brien featured as a major Knute Rockne on the sidelines and some of the players, such as George Gipp (Ronald Reagan). <br /> <br /> Reagan gets pretty good billing in this movie, but his part is really not that big. O'Brien is the only actor with a major role in this. The rest - all playing fine characters - include Gale Page as Rocknes wife "Bonnie;" Donald Crisp, as Notre Dame's "Father John Callahan;" Albert Bassermann as chemistry professor "Father Nieuwland" and Reagan, as Gipp, perhaps Notre Dames most talented and famous player ever. What this movie is pretty, balances the personal story with the football. Neither angle is exaggerated. The characters here are all the people you can row because there are no bad guys. On my last appearance, it was interesting to discover Johnny Sheffield - Taran's son - playing Rockne at the age of seven and seeing George Reeves, television's superman, as one of the players. <br /> <br /> There have been very few football films made in Hollywood, for some reason and precious few good ones. This is one of them.
