Abbott and Costello talents shine in the happily childish version of "Jack and the Beanstalk". The use of sepia tone and color, music and choreography, song and dance, the transition of players from one role to the other, as well as various other aspects of this very fine film make it clear that techniques and styles used to "The Wizard of Oz" is played with here. And it works really well for our innocent duo. There are some other things involved that make this movie a treat for me ... Buddy Baer's, Max Baer Jr. by "The Beverly Hillbillies" uncle, appearance as policeman and giant. Pat Costello, Lou's brother, has been involved in script writing. These things help make this movie fun. However, it has it down. I think the choreography is poorly done. But the sweet tunes and accompanying vowels help to degrade the rather sloppy dance number. Some of the players, the love couple (prince and princess) to be precise are not very good in their trade. But these things are a little price to pay for an otherwise pretty enjoyable walk down the yellow brick ... I mean ... climb the prayer floor.
