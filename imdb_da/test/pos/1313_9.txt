Mishima: A life of four chapters is an art house biography of Yukio Mishima, the famous Japanese writer, similar to Paul Schrader's former character Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver): both are lonely people who are searching for their place in their community and when they realize the world Do not need them, they try to destroy their surrounding universe. <br /> <br /> If you want to learn about Mishima's life, then you won't find a lot of information here because it shows he didn't live a very interesting life (except his last day), but if you want to understand his personality, then it is the best movie of its kind, as most of the film is adapting his novels and also gives guidance to his thoughts. This film shows that Mishima was a person who witnessed Japanese culture that he was very fond of and with his final act he tried to save traditions and prove to himself that he is a true warrior, but he realized that a person he was just a man without power to change events.
