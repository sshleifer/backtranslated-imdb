This is a movie that really makes you think of your life, our culture, family structures and situational actions. I will not give the plot in this post, I think others have hit me already. I hope that even if you read opinions on this site, you will take the chance and see this movie for yourself. I went to watch this movie with my husband and a friend and I must say after the movie was over there was total silence in the theater. After a few minutes I looked behind me, and everyone in the theater stared at the screen, lost in mind. This will deeply immerse you in your psychological abyss to consider more things: <br /> <br /> How much does society affect my life and the life of my generation? How long does anyone have to pay for errors they have made? <br /> <br /> Is there another chance given, has it ever been realized? <br /> <br /> Is it better to live in a box or not to live at all? <br /> <br /> My questions aren't meant to show my approval or disapproval of Leland's actions. I don't want my opinion on them in any way dictate what you want to take away from this movie so I don't give it. See it for yourself. I'm still lost in mind and trying to answer my many questions from the movie. I enjoyed it very much and hope you will too. This movie does not attempt to answer questions, condemn any action or promote any punishment. This film is trying to get us all to evaluate our lives and take the pink colored glasses that most of us see through the world. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie. 9 out of 10 stars
