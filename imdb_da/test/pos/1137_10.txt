I watched this movie once a long time, only once, and I didn't know where it came from and I looked for about six years to find it, and I finally found it here on IMDb.com! Just the whole concept of the movie is amazing, I think it has something to do with a race of bioengineered creatures that hold tabs on us and our planet, but there is one person who endures being assimilated in accordance. And the way he does it, to stay away from being tracked and placed, is what keeps the movie entertaining. I can't remember exactly how it ended, but I remember it was finished with a great climax and a good twist.
