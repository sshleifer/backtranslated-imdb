This is the first movie I've seen from Singapore and it's great. If you don't know much about Asia, its language and its culture, then this movie may be a little confusing to the uninformed people. As an Asian-American, dual-oriented in two Asian languages ​​(one of which is Mandarin) and has taken some Asian American studies, this movie was easier for me to understand, but even without that kind of knowledge, I believe that this Movie is still available to its foreign audiences as long as you remember it's a forthcoming movie type. The movie is definitely worth watching so you get the chance to see what kind of trouble Singapore's young teenage boys are struggling with and dealing with. This is a fantastic upcoming movie, but filmed and shown in a more artistic and original way. The actors are excellent.
