Historical drama is one of the areas where the British just can't beat. So even though I'm not a big fan of the genre, I can usually be convinced to see something a bit about it being British and with decent actors. <br /> <br /> I've never read any of Sarah Waters, of course, I have to do something. Therefore, I didn't really know what to expect from this. I had heard that there would be a lesbian love story, but not much more. While I watched it, I found it to be much more interesting than I had expected. Without saying too much, the twists of the plot are unexpected as well as well-made. Although there was almost a twist for many somewhere, it took me a moment to get everything right. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are good, the actors are very solid and the pace is decent, though I found it to be a little slow in the last half hour. It may just be myself, I usually have a problem with movies pulling on after the plot is more or less finished. All in all, this is a pretty entertaining three hours. I recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas.
