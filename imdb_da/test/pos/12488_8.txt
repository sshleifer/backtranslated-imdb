A lovely, humorous mix of music halls (in the first third most of the time) and the police's procedural mystery as the stories of the various suspects begin to collapse. The final exposure of the murder can come as a surprise if you do not look closely. A quiet look at Paris by the time. You can ignore the final scene (Hollywood end). Louis Jouvet is best as the police inspector, who seems to just go through, but is really on top of things.
