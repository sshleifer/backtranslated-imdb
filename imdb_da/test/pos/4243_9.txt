The bride of Chucky begins late one night as officer Bob Bailey (Vince Corazza) sneaks into the evidence room of his police station and among all the horror movie in joke props he steals the remnants of the Chucky doll, which serial killer Charles Lee Ray retains in the original Child's Play (1988). He drives the remains to an isolated area where Ray's ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) carries Bailey's neck and takes the remains back to her trailer. There Tiffany stitching and stapling Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) again and using a 'voodoo for dummies' book brings him back to the murderous life. Thing doesn't go as Tiffany had hoped & Chucky turns out not to be the dream man, so she locks him in a game pen where Chucky is less than happy. While Tiffany takes a bath, Chucky lets go, electrocutes here and uses this book to bring her back to life in the form of a women's doll dressed as a bride. Neither will get stuck in plastic bodies and will work together to get to a cemetery in New Jersey, where Ray's natural body was buried with the amulet, which was needed to change their spirits back into human bodies. The bodies of Tiffany's neighbor Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl), who are both fled from Jade's corrupt uncle, police officer Warren Kincaid (John Ritter), will do well ... <br /> <br / > Directed by Ronny Yu I love Bride of Chucky. The script by Don Mancini is fun, very fast moving, very entertaining and refers to lots of other horror movies of good affection. From the opening sequence, where we see Jason Voorhees hockey mask from Friday the 13th movie, Freddy Krueger masks the razor glove from A Nightmare on the Elm Street series and Michael Myers from the Halloween franchise. For the clips used by the Bride of Frankenstein (1935), when it almost recreates the same scene. The bride of Chucky never takes herself seriously, it's just as good, there are lots of a liners, self referential gags that Scream (1996) made trendy a few years earlier, and it doesn't seem to be scared to poke fun on himself and the horror genre in general. I love the scene when Jesse & Jade has a cliched slushy romantic conversation that Chucky hears and he makes fun derogatory comments and movements throughout. It is not to say that there is not a wonderful good movie in there either, because it certainly is. Director Yu manages to create a good atmosphere and a really fun feeling, both human and plastic sets of characters like and shine, as each couple suffers from their own set of domestic problems that the trace of corpses they leave would naturally cause . Technical Bride of Chucky is great for the most part and has the big budget polish about it and about $ 25,000,000 I should hope so. All I want to say is that some of the puppet's effects of Kevin Yagher are a bit stiff and not convincing, nor can I remember any CGI scenes in the Bride of Chucky. Fortunately, the film does not neglect the blood and do with a cool split neck, nails burst into a person's face in presumably a Hellraiser (1987) tribute, people pointed to glass cuts, a person was blotted out by a large truck, a ripped lip piercing & various stabbings & shots. The play is pretty good & Dourif as Chucky is very funny as he spits out one liners. I also like the scenes with Tiffany at the beginning and find her very sexy when she has all that fetish gear, I can't be the only one safe? Personally, I think Bride of Chucky is a great movie, total entertainment from start to finish, great humor and horror in equal measure and in just 85 minutes it never gets boring or boring. A personal favorite of mine, watch it as soon as possible!
