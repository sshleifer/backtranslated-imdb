If you really want to scare people, choose the devil as your subject. After all, a large part of the population believes that he is real. Therefore, you join a whole carnal sword of already existing religious and mythological images. And bound to cause quite a few nightmares in your young audience. <br /> <br /> This episode had the whole look of a Hollywood blockbuster. In fact, I finished watching what I was flying over to another channel that played a recent Bond movie and honestly couldn't share a hair between the differences in SFX. With a minimal casting, limited by its situation on a space station; complete with stunning panoramic views of an impressive universe, it was as claustrophobic and intense as the Alien or Event Horizon. The black hole outside made it feel as if the black hole's weight of dark material pressed the station onto the planet and to anything that was sealed inside. And as the horror intensified with the knowledge that Dr and Rose are stranded, the eerie Ood begins to channel a disembodied voice, and then the characters begin to be knocked off one by one ... <br /> <br /> This has all the best qualities of the cream of this new dr. who strives for the girl in the fireplace and the empty child. Emotionally engaging, scary and humorous all without seemingly cheesy. This is far scarier than any amount of flying Daleks. But it must be asked is this really suitable display for children? This is not a family-friendly episode. Too bad the poor parent who has to put their children in bed after this. I'm not sure I will see what happens next time!
