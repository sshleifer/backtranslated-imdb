I'm in a big minority here. I also have not much looked after the original caddyshack, except for the chase / murray duo scene and choose rodney jokes. okay, break it down: rodney vs jackie - both Jewish and have similar humor. Rodney is a bigger name and more obvious. Jackie has a random and more observational approach to his jokes and is more 'up yours' in this sequel. Jackie's attitude to everything is memorable and somehow inspiring! His quick lines and over-confidence left me and I wanted to be able to express myself in such a way. Rodney was good, but there wasn't enough of him, and he was more 'in your face' and dismissive. jackie, in a rare movie look, makes a perfect underneath for rodney (come on, a pistol shaped hair dryer?!?!) really, look at the little things! <br /> <br /> Stack vs Knight - both play snobby yuppies very well. Ted Knight, despite his wonderful TV / movie career, admittedly shows his age. but he pulls the snobbish demands from the part and we want to see him fall. ted looks a little faint and is rather annoying, playing his anger and frustration for slapstick, while the stack is more randomly cunning and claimed; You really hate him and enjoy watching him constantly fail. stack wins with me. <br /> <br /> murray vs aykroyd-well, both had big vintage SNL-like scenes with the ever-present and comfortable chevy chase (ty web). I liked Murray / Chase One better. Murray plays his big, annoying, chatty character with obvious improv skills and is lovable-yet annoying. and the same can be said for ayroyd. Both become annoying after a while, but it is a tie. I really loved Part 2 over the first one. they are 2 totally different atmospheric films. part 1 is more medicine / bathroom / sex humor with a cast full of big names. Part 2 uses golf as the backdrop for a "stick-it-to-the-rich" type of comedy that makes you better at being the working class. 80s script? Yes. a little removed? Yes, but wasn't the first one? an insult to the sport of golf? yes it is a movie. thin story? yes it is a comedy with real humor - not 'dancing with wolves' !! besides part 2 has a much better soundtrack !! PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO BE A PART TO PART ONE !! It's 98% its own movie and shouldn't even have the name 'CADDYSHACK' in it. That said, I'm a big fan of caddyshack 2, and it's a great exponent of 80's fluff entertainment with quality humor. VIVA JACKIE MASON !!! to all reduce - lights up! It is a great comedy by itself. the randy quaid was wonderful, jonathan silverman was wonderful, heck, everyone was !! All this chats, and now I want to see it! I think I will
