The Merchant of Venice is a great movie. It is very true for the original Shakespeare game. If you saw Jeremy Irons in Casanova and liked his performance, this is a movie for you! If you saw Joseph Fiennes in Shakespeare in Love and you enjoyed his performance, this is a movie for you! If you saw Al Pacino in Donnie Brasco and liked his performance, this is a movie for you! It's a very enjoyable movie, and if you study Shakespeare like me, it's a great movie to watch !! The only problem with this movie is that you can't let the little ones see it because there's a little bit of nudity in it. But apart from that, it's a great movie !!
