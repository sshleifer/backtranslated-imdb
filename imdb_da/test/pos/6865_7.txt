I saw (unfortunately) the duplicate version on Encore. <br /> <br /> Students Paula Henning (Franka Potente, who was also in the cult favorite "Run Lola Run") stars as a serious doctor who enters a prestigious school in Germany. But she soon discovers that some students disappear, and the bodies they work on in anatomy lab are incredibly fresh ... I was stuck looking at the duplicate version on Encore. It hurt a lot (the words that didn't match the lips became annoyingly real fast), but I liked what I saw. The action was good, it was beautifully photographed, it wasn't too cruel, and I was never bored. Even more refreshing was a sympathetic heroine who fights back when the evil ones go after her. The (mild) nudity was in a refreshing twist, man! A former poster mentions Benno Furmann (who is excellent) showed his ass, but I can't remember seeing it. Whether this is a well done, scary and excellent thriller. From everything I've read, the original German language version is the best (I don't doubt it for a second), but the copied version can be seen. I give this a 7.
