This was a very faithful presentation of Lewis's life in the mid-50s. The dialogue on theology and banter with its subsequent colleagues was exceptionally good. Michael White's book, "C.S. Lewis: Creator of Narnia" deals with this timeframe in a very parallel fashion. Joss Ackland's play was great for catching the unemotional Lewis. The film took great pains in being presented in a precise English setting. The development of a strong bond between "Jack" (his favorite name) Lewis and Douglas Gresham, Joy's son from her previous marriage, was pleasant to see. The movie avoided the unpleasant element of "Warnie" Lewis (Jack's older brother) drinking problem, but it would not have moved the story so it is best omitted.
