I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was beautiful in this movie when she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a robber of his luck and tries to make another hoist. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When things aren't training on the trip, they put my mines together to find out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with help from Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob. Make sure that whatever the tire is after, the result is never the same and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The rest of you have to look at yourself. As far as Raquel goes, if you are a fan of here, then you should watch this movie because she never looked better on the beach with a ****** on. I give this movie 10 tissue stars only on Raquel Welch body. It's no wonder why she was the hottest actress back in the 60s. She was the gender symbol that everyone wanted and no one could get. Not only does she look good, she can act even better. If you like Raquel Welch then you will like this movie
