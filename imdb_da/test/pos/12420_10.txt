Just come around to see Monster Man yesterday. It had been a long wait and after many expectations and construction I am happy to say that it came through and met my expectations at all levels. Truly, you really can't expect too much from hearing the rundown plot, but after reading some of the reviews for it, I was ecstatic. I mean, which trash fan won't see a gore flick about a fake inbred hick turning people down with their make-shift monster truck? I went in to expect a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and got so much more. This was a horror comedy that actually worked. The filmmakers got it right when it came to getting you to wake up and make you laugh with laughter at the same time. Kudos to Michael Davis for going out with gore and pushing the envelope with sickass humor. Let me mention a few reasons why I love this movie so much: First is the story. It has been done to death in so many other flicks. A college guy gets wind that his childhood murder gets married. He is the 25-year-old virgin as he is, hops in his Vista Cruiser and decides to breathe to confess his love, hoping she will fall over hills and all the good jive. Hidden in the back seat of his station wagon is good friend Harley. Harley is loudmouth, former friend who laughs and talks like Jack Black in High Fidelity. You can't help but like the guy, but if he was your real-life friend, keep a whiffle ball bat handy (laughing all you want, but have you ever been hit with one?) To keep him in check. So he is a little on the unpleasant side, at least, but you can tell he is a loyal friend, deep down ... Yet they are on their way, and when they stop in a bar they aggravate the locals. Now they are stalked by a leatherface clone in a monster truck. That is it. Yes, along the way they pick up a beautiful hitchhiker, but I'm too lazy and hungry to go into it right now ... just watch the horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The other I love was humor. This one had some of the sickest laughs of any movie since Cabin Fever. How horrible is that? Well, I don't even go into the entire cat area, and as far as the "corpse burrito" thing is concerned, I also leave it for the virgins. The bar full of amputaries was somewhat disturbing, and the guy who looked like John Turturro also tormented me. Harley, though a completely unpleasant frat-boy type, can really fling off one liners. Love the wooden shoes by the way. I need a new couple. <br /> <br /> GORE. This pours it on heavily. While the first hour plays out as a demented road comedy, the last third revolves around blood and gut. If the film hadn't had such a lust all the way through, it would have been a little disturbing, but seeing how it all was playing for laughs, it's not possible that you're bothered by it. If you are still in your place at the time it comes, you will probably see humor in it too, but seriously there were buckets and buckets of the red stuff. There was a big plot trip that I couldn't see, and when the credits rolled, I was completely satisfied. I was exactly what I came for, and I'm really glad I bought it. Much like Cabin Fever, it will get a lot of reproduction. <br /> <br /> The film's appearance was excellent. There was this deliberately cheap look that made it all scream in the late 80's, and I loved the exaggerated colors. It is obvious that Monster Man was made on a relatively low budget, but much like Cabin Fever (sorry I compare the two) it actually works in the favor of the movie. Cabin Fever was an ode to the 70s greats, this was the 80s response to it. So take it for what it is worth. No CGI here. That's what we all need. I'm not quite sure why it didn't get a theatrical release because that's all Jeepers Creepers should have been. Thank goodness for Lions Gate.
