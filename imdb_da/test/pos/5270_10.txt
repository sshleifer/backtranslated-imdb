I consider this movie as one of the most interesting and fun movies of all time. It has so much very intelligent thoughts in it that anyone who thinks the movie is horrible did not get it and no doubt can recognize really deep philosophical themes that are in it (in all 3 Schneider films). Several universities in Germany and throughout Europe have made studies on Schneider's way of seeing things. By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on the jazz musicians in Germany (maybe europe). He is most inspired by the great M.Davis and T.Monk. So, if you don't like him, it's okay, but don't try to convince others that he might be stupid, cheap, boring or not fun. Because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look at H.Schneider's art, then you must "surrender".
