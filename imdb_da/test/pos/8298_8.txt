I'm also serious, I don't think I'm wrong, if you haven't bowed to this type of Z class, you have a huge creature function {why would you see my first thought?} Then it's a rating of about 3 for 4 out of 10 peaks, but for me it is a special kind of nonsense that takes me back to a good time in my childhood. You know the kind, the memories that never leave you. Eagerly, it all goes with youthful marvels like Doug McClure and Peter Cushing tunnel under the mantle to battle with a host of creatures and sub-human species. And guys! Now we are all adults, we can admire most seriously about the wonder of Caroline Munro and her scornful division. No wonder my older brother was eager to take me to the cinema to watch this one !! Yes, the effects are bad, men in suits, strings that poke parrot monsters around and explode rubber squares as things, entertaining us greatly. And yes, Cushing and a surprising pudgy McClure seem to have really been fascinated by the evil Meyhas at the "core" of our movie. But it doesn't matter, much and lumpy and flooded in brilliant color. That The Earth's Core is a return to a special pre-ILM time when children like me buy around the block to see such joyful nonsense. 8.10
