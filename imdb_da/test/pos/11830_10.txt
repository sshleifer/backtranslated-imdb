A wealthy young man, raised as a Son of God, must confront his Chinese heritage while living in a white world. Although the premise on which this movie is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility and secret of the plot, when revealed by the conclusion of the film, doing everything that has been slightly ridiculous before, history still serves some decent entertainment and good actors. <br /> <br /> Richard Barthelmess has the title role as the sweet Oriental whose life is terribly complicated because he looks caucasian. Barthelmess keeps the tone of his performance seriously all the time and gently stare into the middle distance (a way he evolved during quiet days) when his character is outdated abusively. He does not attempt to replicate his classical performance in D. W. Griffith's BROKEN BLOSSOMS (1919) and that is his credit. Beautiful Constance Bennett is the millionaire's daughter who makes Barthelmess miserable. She is beautiful as always, but her behavior does not fight her for the viewer, and her terrible illness in the last coil is kept mercifully off screen. <br /> <br /> The multi-talented Frank Albertson has a small role as Barthelmess's improvised buddy. Serene E. Alyn Warren and blustery Anders Randolf play the leading star very different fathers, while Claude King distinguishes from his short appearance as the English writer who turns to Barthelmess. <br /> <br /> Movie belly recognizes little Dickie Moore, unredited, plays Barthelmess as a young child. <br /> <br /> The original Technicolor of the flashback sequence has faded over time into a reddish tone. The shot, claiming to be Southern France, instead looks suspiciously like Avalon on Santa Catalina Island, off southern California's coast.
