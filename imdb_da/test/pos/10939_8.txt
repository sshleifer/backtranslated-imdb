I see many Vampire movies. I know vampire movies. Hammer movies have always been my favorites. Christopher Lee will always be the best Dracula. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is a fun movie from the beginning to the end. The headline is not great, but I also like Godzilla movies, so I'm used to badly dubbed movies. Anyway, I liked this movie a lot. SFX is great. Although Jackie Chans is part of the movie, has nothing to do with the plot and seems to have been added to sell the movie, he is entertaining in it. The Fang work is excellent. The action is not great, but it could have something to do with the bad dubbing. Maybe the actual language would sound better with the movie if I could understand it. I'm sure the movie Gone With The Wind sounds worse in another language. <br /> <br /> I own this on DVD and would not participate. I sit on my bookshelf next to my Hammer Films DVDs.
