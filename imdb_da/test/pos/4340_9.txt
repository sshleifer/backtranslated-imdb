This movie was amazing. It had everything a true action fan could wish for. Lots of people are shot and / or relaxed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with violence at many intervals instead of meaningless plot that stores only one scene at the end, and villains just asking for it . Bronson seems to be at its lowest level of tolerance in this movie, and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great policeman and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie does not involve a plot so boring or overuse that you see this movie once and never again. Rather, you will see Kersey in action and the story just sets. These are good things.
