I was surprised how big Black Snake Moan turned out to be. Become a fan of Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson. ID Fig id give this a try. Well, when this was over, I was just left by how big this movie really was. I think everything was dead - on big and very precise for that matter. This film shows how the great director and writer Craig Brewer (who made Hustle & Flow another great movie) just might take something even something that seems ludacras and make it this. Well, I like how it's just a good time, just like it's a movie that just makes it there in a good way. Also I love that it doesn't show great steroids in the south and how it has been portrayed in things as the most repulsive place to be, but not this movie makes it very accurate and because of it very recisable. The catheter in this was just phenomenal, especially from Christina Ricci (who deserves an Oscar for this role), the always great Samuel L. Jackson, and even Justin Timberlake did a good job. Overall cheese is all right with this, and while it's not all kind of movies, it is definitely worth watching from anyone who can enjoy a good time. Three Bowls For Black Snake Moan !!!! <br /> <br /> 9.3 out of 10 stars
