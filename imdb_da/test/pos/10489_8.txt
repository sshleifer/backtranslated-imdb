Valerie's "Il Prezzo Del Potere" drive. "The Power of Power" is an excellent and exciting Spaghetti Western that reflects the Kennedy murder. A great leading performance by Giuliano Gemma and an excellent score by Luis Bacalof are just two of the many reasons to watch this movie. In 1881 Texas is divided into those who value the abolition of slavery and just want to live in peace and those who after 16 years will still reinstall the Confederation. Despite warnings, President James Garfield, who wants to establish a new gender equality policy, decides to visit Dallas, where corrupt law enforcement officials are planning their murder. Bill Willer (Giuliano Gemma) and two of his friends, a black man named Jack Donovan (Ray Shaunders), and a curly guy named Nick (Manuel Zarzo) are determined to prevent the president's murder. <br /> <br /> When James Garfield was not murdered by racists who wanted to reinstall the confederation in Texas, but in Washington DC of mentally unstable Charles Guiteau, the story of "Price of Power" is, of course, historic nonsense. However, since the film does not claim historical accuracy but tries to highlight the 1963 Kennedy assassination in Dallas, the fact that history is fictitious is legal. <br /> <br /> Giuliano Gemma delivers an outstanding performance as protagonist Bill Willer, Benito Stefanelli is great as the crooked and corrupt Sheriff Jefferson. Some other good performances are Ray Shaunders as Bill's black friend Jack, Warren Vanders as Arthur McDonald, Presidential Adviser and Fernando Rey as Pinkerton, a rogue rich businessman. The result of Luis Enr√≠quez Bacalov is fantastic, the filmography and sites are good, and (as in Valerii's former "Day Of Anger") many remind of Sergio Leone, for whom Valerii used to work as assistant director of "A Fistful Of Dollars" and " For A Few Dollars More ". <br /> <br /> Everyone said, "Il Prezzo Del Potere" is after "Day Of Anger", another excellent Spaghetti Western showing both the great talent of Giuliano Gemma as actor and Tonino Valerii as director. "The Power of Power" is a must-see for Spaghetti Western fans, and I highly recommend it to everyone else. 8.10
