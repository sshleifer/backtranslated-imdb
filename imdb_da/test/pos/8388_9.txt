Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent cartoon character, gloriously so. Built on the backdrop of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds hit the lengthy training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to jump into action right away. In the process, Tarantino solves one of The Dirty Dozen's big mistake by giving the wicked screens time to remind us how badly the Nazis were. The Nazis with the most screen time end up being the most complete human characters in the movie, ironically making them even worse monsters. <br /> <br /> As you pull the training sequences, Tarantino can also give us a picture of the whole war, show us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also give us glimpses of the world of French and German civilians, both partners and resistance. It goes without saying that any Tarantino movie will have a great dialogue, but when Tarantino decided to get the French characters to speak French and the Germans speak German, in addition to adding a level of authenticity, Tarantino somehow ensured that his dialogue in french was so sharp and fun and clever as its english dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this way, the Nazi "Hunter Hunter" asks SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) in French milk farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet) in the opening order. Land suspicions that LaPadite stores a family of Jews. While Subtly presses LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. After greedy gulping it down, Landa LaPadite complements her daughters and his cows, "choose and choose you're good". It is in French "vache" cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If one reprimanded for this vulgar saying, Landa could quite convincingly not claim to understand French well enough to have meant it that way, but Landa means that way, and he thinks it as a threat. And LaPadite understands his opinion too well. It is a really subtle piece of play and word play that many audiences would never catch, or at least they can understand the subtitles without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The film is rich in such details. All the French and English dialogues are chosen with the same attention to detail, and although I cannot swear to the Germans, I suspect that it shows a similar level of craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> The Inglorious Basterd opens with the phrase, "Once upon a time ... in Nazi France". Personally, it reminds me of the opening of every Asterix book and film, another cartoon character in a war-torn possession occupied by France. As Asterix, Inglorious Basterd's howling fun is in places, even though the film also gets dark serious. In his more serious moments, Inglorious Basterd reminds us that the first war injuries are compassion and the ability to relax Tarantino, like almost any elongated sequence of the film, finds a new way to build gravel tensions at almost tireless levels. <br /> <br /> Tarantino also reminds us that movies are dangerous, even flammable, and that its power deserves respect. <br /> <br /> If you can watch this movie as I did in a packed theater filled with knowledgeable fans who get any joke, then you will see this masterful movie that was supposed to be seen. If you're not that lucky, all you want is a great, great movie that delivers a dark fun punch.
