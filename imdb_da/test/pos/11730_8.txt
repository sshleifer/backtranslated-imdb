How Burt Reynolds describes this film, which happens to be his best ever. He plays Tom Sharky, a deputy detective who is tracked by an international mobster (Vittorio Gassman) and the man he finances to be the next governor of Georgia (Earl Holliman). In the story of William Diehl, the story is more complex, because the guy is running for president. This is a very long film that feels more like three hours instead of two. The movie in downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza hotel just put the mood right into the story. Reynolds does not laugh very much at this comedy film. He is very serious here, especially at the beginning of the movie, because he gets demoted for a dope bust that goes wrong. At times, however, the film plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with Burt, who tries to get close to mobster's woman. Only at the end of the film is the violence shrunk, leading to bang bang climax. Like the great jazz score in DIRTY HARRY by Lalo Schifrin, Sharky's Machine has an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including Chet Baker, Julie London, Flora Purim and Buddy De Franco, The Manhattan Transfer, Doc Severinson, Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams. Al Capps handles the score with magic. This movie has become one of the best crime drama ever. Check it out. <br /> <br /> Result, 8 out of 10 Stars
