This show should be my favorite out of all 80's horror television shows. Like Tales from the Darkside, also from the same creators, this show is a rare gem. If you agree with me, sign this petition I started to get the word to Monsters and get it out on DVD. Here are the petition address: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Some of my favorite episodes should be Glim glim and Rain Dance. I also loved the opening integration with the monster family. It used to creep me out! One of the things I would ask the DVD creators to include would be the organ sound that was heard just before where the commercial break would be. I don't know if any of you remember that part, but it's one of the most important things that brings memories back to me. I mean, come on! World of Warcatcher, the TV series has already been released on DVD, so I say Monsters, and also Tales from the Darkside, and Friday the 13th, the series should also be released! We fans should speak our thoughts! We need this amazing show on DVD so PLEASE spread the word !!!
