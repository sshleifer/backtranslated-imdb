1904. The North African country in Morocco is dependent on independent independence, as the various European powers - France, Germany, Britain, Russia, Spain and now the United States - strengthen influence in the region. The Sultan (Marc Zuber) is a weak doll; his uncle, Bashaw (Vladek Sheybal), who is being manipulated by the French and the Germans, is the real power behind the throne. Enter Berber Chieftan Raisuli (Sean Connery), the leader of the Rif tribe and "the last of the Barbary Pirates" who kidnap an American missionary, Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen) and her two children and take them hostage. Back in the US, President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) threatens to go to war on the problem: "Pedecaris Alive or Raisuli Dead!" - to see the problem as the perfect way to exercise his "Big Stick" diplomacy, but Foreign Minister John Hay (John Huston) is not so confident. But Raisuli has less vicious plans for pedecarises, which, incidentally, are able to handle themselves. <br /> <br /> John Milius's great historical film relied very loosely on a true story (ie, Pedecaris was a middle-aged man), a wonderful bit of escapism. It has some amazing action scenes, a witty, well-written script, a fine cast that benefits from the material and does not surpass its welcome. "Pirates of the Caribbean" or "The Lord of the Rings" movie. It's not really an "epic" movie in the strictest sense, but it is one of the best pure action movies ever made. <br /> <br /> While the historical context is shaken, the story is interesting and as some reviewers point out, it is even more relevant today than it was when it was made. As President Roosevelt says, "America is like a grizzly bear" - tough, strong, but a bit blind and ruthless at times. At the time of the film's setting, America has just been promoted at world stage as superpower, after their resounding victory in the Spanish American War - and Roosevelt expresses this incident as a way of proving America's worth. In fact, it didn't work that way, but allegorically it works well. While writing from a right perspective, Milius's manuscript is precisely to assess America and its place in the world. He admires Roosevelt and his method of "big stick" diplomacy and correctly acknowledges (with Roosevelt's words) that while America can be feared and respected, they are never truly loved by the world, whatever they do. And there are some scenes - like Roosevelt's target shooting of European leaders and the marines' almost comic surprise attack on Bashaw's palace - showing America's ruthless and violent side, while others - the climaxic showdown with the Germans - show their heroism. <br /> <br /> The historical / political context of the film is, of course, only meat on the bones of what is essentially a terrific action / adventure movie. There are some excellently finished scenes, such as Raisuli's rescue of Pedecaris from crossbreed tribesmen, which includes some of the best sword types in any movie. The initial entrance to Raisuli and the aforementioned march and attacks by the American marines is brilliantly executed bravura set pieces. And the final battle that combines elements of "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Wild Bunch", while a great historical fantasy (a three-way battle between Germans, Americans and the reefs) is an excellent staged adrenaline pumping sequence. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast provides some great performance. Everyone seems to have a fun time with the movie and it shows. Sean Connery is surprisingly convincing as a Berber with a Scottish accent, but manages to draw his interesting, generous and chivalrous character that will respect his hostage and detest modern, barren warfare. Candice Bergen, an actress whom I have never been happy with, gives a good performance as the cowardly Eden Pedecaris, who is as hard as her prisoners. Brian Keith is an incredibly convincing TR - you really feel that he must have been like this, an athletic, thriving but practical and intelligent man with an admirable sense of self. The scenes in Roosevelt Boxing and Goal Shooting during the discussion of foreign policy are some of the biggest "bad ass" moments in film history - and who can forget lines like "Why destroy things with legality?" John Huston provides solid support like the tired, cautious tall, which acts as a perfect foil for the much more imposing Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> Among the fine supports are the best Geoffrey Lewis as Samuel Gummere, the cynical ambassador captured in the midst of political intrigue, and Steve Kanaly, as Gung-ho Marine Captain, as cheerful spokesmen (and performs) " Military intervention! " as the dumb and simple solution to the whole complex situation. Other well-known faces such as Vladek Sheybal, Nadim Sawalha, Roy Jenson, Larry Cross, Marc Zuber and Darrell Fetty also do fine work no matter how small their role. Spaghetti-Western fans will recognize Antoine Saint-John ("A Fistful of Dynamite") as the German general and Aldo Sambrell as one of Raisulis tribes. <br /> <br /> "Wind and the Lion" is all around, a wonderfully made adventure movie. It has something for everyone: wonderful gun and sword games, a lot of humor, a hard, celebrating heroine (and her two cute children), a lovely (if effortless) romance and an interesting (if imaginative) political / historical context. It's not a masterpiece, but hey, it didn't try to be. I give "The Wind and the Lion" a stir nine stars and my highest recommendation.
