Christopher Boyce (Oscar Winner: Timothy Hutton) sets out to be a pastor and returns to an uncertain future. When his best friend Daulton Lee (Oscar winner: Sean Penn) is a drug dealer, who always comes in trouble and enjoys taking drugs a little too much. When Christopher gets a job by working in a top secret place called "RTX". Boyce and Lee both have wealthy families who they hoped to make it out of their own. When Boyce decides to take secret documents out of curiosity these documents have to be destroyed. He decides to sell these secret documents at a cheap price to the Soviet Union with the help of his best friend. But both never knew how far they would go for sealing documents for living, and since they were both amateurs. Both have betrayed their land for secret information. <br /> <br /> Directed by the late Oscar winner: John Schlesinger (The Believers, Eye for a Eye, Midnight Cowboy) made an interesting character drama about two young men taking the wrong path in life. Oscar Winners: Hutton and Penn are both exceptional in the movie. The movie is even occasionally fun and quite disturbing at times. David Suchet almost steals the show as the man working for the Soviet Union. This image has a well-known casting in supporting roles. It was quite undervalued when it was first released. Despite some great reviews by some of the best film critics. This picture is actually based on a true story. There are some flaws in the story, like these two leading characters, but in general it is a movie worth seeing. Based on a novel by Robert Lindsey. Play by Oscar-Winner: Steven Zaillian (American Gangster, Hannibal, Schindler's List). (**** / *****).
