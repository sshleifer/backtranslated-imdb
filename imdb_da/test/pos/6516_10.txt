I've seen this movie a long time ago, but I've always loved it. The story is about a young girl, Sally O'Moyne, who at a young age finds out that when she asks for St. Anne, answering her prayers, and her missing lunch pail and a mediocre neighbor tattooing her, asking for someone to give him a black eye for tattoo. A moment later something comes to him and he has a black eye. Sally believes in the power of prayer and decides to use that power for good. She is well-known and loved around the neighborhood, as she has copy books / magazines filled with all her friends' requests for st. Anne. At the same time, a local boy returns from college (I think) and Sally is awestruck knowing how much he is adult. Sally has a big crush on him, but is so shy. Will she use her prayer power for St. Anne for her own selfish desire or just watch as the most popular girls in school try to snare the boys' husband? This is a fun filled movie with a grandfather who is so charming and Irish, brother is hilariously annoying and a sworn Irish neighbor who jumps with grandpop on a daily basis. He has his own story of buying O'Moynes property, which is a small house in the middle of two large apartment complexes (his own), in other words, O'Moynes house is an eye for his lovely buildings. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth watching and is good enough and rarely enough to add to your movie collection. I hope you enjoy!
