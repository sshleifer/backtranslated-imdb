Hayao Miyazaki's magic continues with this absolute crowd pleaser Ponyo on Cliff by the Sea, his latest animated movie that turns on the usual sweetness to soothe your socks. I thought the trailer highlighted his song, which was quietly hypnotic, and I didn't have to wait for an invitation to make sure I got my sneak preview of the movie to be opened here next week. <br /> <br /> For fans of Studio Ghibli movies you will probably know what you are in, as Miyazaki has another winner in his filmography that will win new fans. I am embarrassed to say the least that I have so far only seen My Neighbor Totoro (eyes piles of Ghibli DVDs) and love it to bite, but it is given, it would serve as a last push for me not to continue to miss what would probably be animated movies that i would enjoy. Ponyo (pronounced by Nara Yuria) is a magic goldfish who longs to know what life is beyond the sea, with her constant advances in a bubble to the surface of the water to sneak a look. Nevertheless, these ambitions do not sound good with his humanoid father, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who has some hatred of humanity for pollution, and briefly touches on a plot of environmental protection / revenge at Mother Nature. An accident sees one day Ponyo is washed ashore and picked up by the five-year-old boy Sosuke (Doi Hiroki), who lives on a house on the said rock with his mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko), while father Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige) is mostly out to sea as he is a sailor. And you can expect some moments of recall to the kind of Little Mermaid or Splash made for kids. To say something more would be to destroy fun. <br /> <br /> The artwork here is still simply amazing, even though it is in 2D glory, knowing that every cell has been carefully worked. There are so many things at the same time within the same framework that you will probably be replaying games just to spot them all. This certainly beats any 3D or CG animated production, every day with its beauty that comes from its simplicity and not just from the artwork but also from its story, despite complaining that it took a magazine from HC Andersen classic. While there are ways to make this movie extremely dark, it only suggested some dark themes, but instead chose a movie with more positive emotions that fit both children and adults. <p> <p> About love, that between the family members of Koichi, Lisa and Sosuke, and especially between mother and son. More so, it's about the love between the boy and his new pet fish, which he named Ponyo, and I tell you that Ponyo herself has enough beauty in her to beat Bolt, WallE and Eve like all hands down. Characterization is top-notch here, and it is hard not to fall in love with Ponyo, whatever form is adopted, especially when she is such a playful creature that does not hide her feelings - if she is upset, she either turns away or you can expect a jet stream to spit from her mouth to your face! <br /> <br /> Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a clear insight into my best movies this year without hesitation. And the next time I go to Tokyo, I'm sure that hell will make my way to the Ghibli Museum to bask in the magical world brought to us by Hayao Miyazaki. Recommended movie, so do not miss this on the big screen!
