I have reasons to love the big users of a camera; liquid direction allows speeding up adventure and comedy narration; But such a skill, in the hands of a King Vidor or an Anthony Mann can also be applied to idea level work. This is Paul Wendko's masterpiece. Its history can be negotiated in a single set of sentences. General Hector Cordoba is setting up as the closest emperor in northern Mexico and stealing a great cannon from General Blackjack Pershing. He sends his crack mission unit, shared, anxious but certainly, led by George Peppard, to get the cannon back and bring Cordoba alive back to put an end to rebellion. Charismatic Raf Vallone plays Cordoba; the ladies in the play are Giovanna Ralli and Francine York; with the team even longer consisting of Nico Minardos, Peter Deuel and Don Gordon. Other stalwarts in the class include John Larch and John Russell. Also in an already incredibly dangerous operation is Miss Ralli and a stubborn Mexican Teniente (Gabriela Tinti) whose regiment was betrayed when Cordoba sat down. The father is multiplied when Gordon's brother as a front-end is captured and tortured to death while he is to see ... and he decides to kill Peppard. The attack that captures the cannon when Peppard's orders are not obeyed by a regular hearth type is one of the most electrifying visual and staged results in film history; The intrusion of Cordoba's stronghold, the revelations uncovered there, and the actions that win the mission team a chance of victory - or nearly victory - are presented flawlessly. This is a beautiful color adventure movie with exceptionally strong costumes, plays, lighting, artistic sets and music by Elmer Bernstein. The script by Stephen Kandel is probably his best ever for a feature film. This is probably the most underrated major Western at the moment, but I have always appreciated its heroes as a result - getting hard workers. But as Peppard reminds his group on the way home, "The problem of being a" hero "- is the morning after". To find out why he says it, see "Cannon For Cordoba".
