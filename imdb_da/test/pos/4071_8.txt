If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you know pretty much what to expect because what you see here is what you get. And even if you haven't seen the previews, it won't take you long to pick up what you are in - especially a good time and lots of laughs - from this clever satire of `Reality TV 'shows and` Buddy Cop' movies, ' Showtime, directed by Tom Dey, with Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston (De Niro) is a detective with LAPD, and he is good at what he does but works one night, it suddenly goes south when another policeman, Trey Sellars (Murphy) inadvertently intervenes, a television newsman turns out, and Mitch loses his cooling, resulting in a lawsuit from the television station that has to cost the department some big bucks. Except that they may come around it, thanks to Chase Renzi (Rene Russo), who works for the station and likes what she sees in Mitch - enough to put an idea to her boss for a "Reality" cop show , It would be nothing but Mitch Preston who Chase sees as a real life "Dirty Harry." <br /> <br /> Her boss likes the idea and gives Chase the green light. Now all she has to do is convince Mitch to participate, which should not be too difficult as the station has agreed to drop the case if he wants to perform the show. But Mitch is a policeman, not an actor, and he has nothing to do with it - that is, until he has a heart to heart with his boss, Captain Winship (Frankie Faison), who briefly outlines Mitch's future him. And so is the show. Oh yes, there is another thing; For the show, Mitch will need a partner. And who do you think they will come up with? Let's say that: Trey Sellars is more than one of the usual suspects. <br /> <br /> This is Dey's second film director, his first being "Shanghai Noon" - also a comedy - and he certainly shows a love for the genre. From the opening frames he establishes a pace that keeps the story moving right together, and allows his stars to make the most of their respective talents and personal strengths, including their impeccable timing. Of course, with stars like De Niro and Murphy, Dey had a leg on this project to begin with, but he is the one who keeps it on track, showing that he knows what works and achieves just the right mix of physical comedy and action and apply the subtleties of dialogue to great effect. <br /> <br /> There is no more natural actor in the company than De Niro and he enters Mitch's skin as he was born. And after many years of hard work, cutting drama (where he became a remarkable achievement after another), with such films as "Analyze This," Meet the Parents "and now this has fixed his skill for making comedy, as well. is not a particularly complex character, he is actually something of an "ordinary" guy, but there is the challenge of the actor - to make him credible, to make him seem like the guy who could be your neighbor and just another member of the community And in every way you succeed Niro, he is Mitch, the guy you drive into the grocery store or bank, or say "good morning" on the way to work; who likes to watch the game on TV and has a life , like you and me, who happens to be living by being a policeman, it's the character Mitch has to be to make this movie work because it makes the "ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances" credible. These roles - and work - that is o fte wrongly dismissed outside of hand because it looks so easy; And of course that's what makes De Niro so unusual - he makes it easy, and he does it with installations. <br /> <br /> Like Trey Sellars, Eddie Murphy becomes a winning achievement like Well, and it is a role to suit him as the magic glove. Trey is a policeman, but also an aspiring actor - and a bad one - and gives Murphy the opportunity to play on the exuberant side of his personality (ruled enough by Dey to keep him from shooting over -The-top in Jim Carrey area) which works perfectly for this character and this movie. From his melodramatic take part during an audition, to his throw out of one-liners - delivered by looking directly into the camera (which, for his part, is not there) while recording the 'reality' show - Murphy is a rebellion. And he has a chemistry with De Niro that really clicks (which is not unexpected, as this is another of De Nisi's many talents, his ability to connect and propagate the best in his co-stars, all of whom will prove support - are better at their craft after working with him, including likes like Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and Ed Harris, to name but a few. The most important thing is that this is a part that allows Murphy to excel at what he does best, and he does it completely. <br /> <br /> Russo gets the most out of his role as Chase, also a sign that is not much of an artistic stretch, but which she presents, with a strong and credible performance. And William Shatner (playing himself) definitely steals a few scenes as an instructor of the show. <br /> <br /> The support model includes Drena De Niro (Annie), Pedro Damian (Vargas) and James Roday (Cameroon). Well-crafted and delivered, `Showtime 'is a comedy that is exactly what it should be: Pure entertainment that gives lots of laughs and a comfortable couple of hours that will make you chuckle for some time afterwards. It's the movie's magic. 8.10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
