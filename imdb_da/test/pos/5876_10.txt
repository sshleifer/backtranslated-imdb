Since there have been so many reviews of this fine movie, I will write in a list form and try to solve issues that have not been discussed. <br /> <br /> 1. Dana Andrews was 38 under the film of this movie. His character, according to the play, was in his mid-20s. Andrews, a highly underrated actor, played excellently a character who was much younger. <br /> <br /> 2. Fredric March as all major players must at times be detained by the director to avoid over-the-top acting. He mumbled for the cameras when he was full at night after his arrival and also the next morning when he checked his hanging over in his mirror. <br /> <br /> 3. Dana Andrews was great when he was in "Laura", "The Ox-Bowl Incident", "A Walk In The Sun", "The Purple Heart" and many other movies. Why does the Fredric March Academy Award win and why was Dana Andrews not even nominated for his outstanding performance? <br /> <br /> 4. Harold Russell gave the best performance I've ever seen by a non-actor. <br /> <br /> 5. I realize this was the 1940s, but Dana Andrews didn't seem to have any romantic interest in his exceptionally attractive wife (Virginia Mayo). <br /> <br /> 6. Ray Teal, who played the right wing, later became famous for portraying the sheriff at "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> 7. The south professor wrote that the movie was slowly moving, boring and badly acting. The professor is more than likely uninformed about classic films. The beauty and importance of these ageless classics is that they are slow moving character studies that avoid profanity, excessive violence and free sex. <br /> <br /> *** I was surprised that zero out of 3 people found my review helpful.
