OK .. you need to settle down! This movie is not that bad. I saw it for the first time last night and fell in love with it! I must admit that I have never been a fan of LeeLee Sobieski, but she grew on me in this movie. I think Josh Hartnett looks good but c'mon..Chris Klein is the most beautiful man I think I've ever seen !!! He made that movie better for me. C'mon girls. When he does not wear a shirt and goes to get water, I know your mouth has fallen. Yes, I know at first that he is a smoker, but eventually he understands how he acted and learned to be a good guy. If he didn't come to the end .. then I'd have been angry. I think a few lines didn't have to be said, but overall it was a great movie! I definitely recommend it!
