It is easy to see why many people think that in the mood for love is Wong Kar-Wai's best movie. The toned-down appeal of the film, centering on the studied image of a relationship carried out by an emotional ringtone, is reproduced to Happy Together territory, but without the hyperkinetic patchwork of jarring film stocks and hyper-saturated sequences that have become a trademark of Kar -Wai's movie since Chungking Express. Like Soderbergh's The Limey, this is another kind of curio for Kar-Wai; where dialogue and plot disappear by mood and composition to create a tale of two delicate lives in an apparently limiting emotional stasis. It is a testament to Kar-Wai's genius that he is able to make such a simple story so resonant. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) are moving close to each other in the same apartment complex. He is a journalist who dreams of publishing martial arts novels, and she is the secretary of a shipping company. Their possible pairing is obvious from the beginning, but the pleasure here is the way Kar-Wai carries out such a journey with his great championships. <br /> <br /> The key to the success of the movie is Kar-Wai's use of the inner space that plays with foreground and background plans in ways similar to Polanski's works. During the wooingly sensuous first half of the film, Kar-Wai isolates Leung and Cheung within shots in such a way that the other person in a conversation is never visible. Kar-Wai is concerned about the environment and space here, which creates an urgent emotional dynamic between his characters. It also says that Kar-Wai never chooses to focus on the physical characteristics of Mo-Wans and Li-zns. Their faceless partners are noticeably absent from the movie, as they tend to have their own love relationship with each other. <br /> <br /> This is not to suggest that In the Mood for Love is a limiting experience because Kar-Wai manages to flood his movie with wide splashes of hypnotic camera movement and sound. There is a shot where Cheung's slow, sensual ascent up a metaphorical staircase turns into Leung's descent down the same staircase; their movements compliment each other perfectly, post the shot and create a sense of erotic duality between the two characters. Their souls have joined, but they have not yet physically united. The erotic displacement of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating as two star-crossed lovers reject physical birth because of their humble fidelity. Other scenes in the movie are drawn with short slow motion shots of Cheung erotic moving through her inner environment, set to Mike Galasso's ghostly beautiful score. Cheung's dresses compliment her exterior space beautifully as she slowly moves through her surroundings. Her movements slowly build up to what seems to be an inevitable fusion between Li-szhen and her dream lover, although the seduction process seems to be totally subconscious. <br /> <br /> If I do, it seems that these two characters are more like two birds loosening pheromones, it is probably not as translated by a statement. The tight bond these two characters have with their inner space is almost as intense as their relationship to the outside. The film rarely enters an outer space, and when the camera does so, it is normal to burst through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like restricted animals. Kar-Wai continues to plague ourselves when the lovers come close enough to touch by crushing the couple's closeness to each other by shooting them through mirrors or through holes in garments inside a closet. Mother Nature even seems to respond to their love sounds, and often releases a soft wreath of rain over the characters after their bodies have slipped close to each other. <br /> <br /> Kar-Wai's hauntingly atmospheric shot of a waterfall allowed Leung's Lai Yu-Fai to experience a cathartical release in Happy Together, although Leslie Cheung's Ho Po wing was not there to enjoy it with him. At the end of this film, love was so inextricably bound to the war that a third party's muted love statements signaled Yu-Fai's realization that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace, even if it would not love him back . Mo-Wans journey ceases within the framework of a crumbling temple. His own emotional depletion is nicely parallel to the political climate of his country, and the absence of Li-szhen is only accepted by Kar-Wai allowing Mo-Wan to experience a kind of release. Mo-Wan turns to an old myth, and his secret release to a crack in the temple allows him to live his days hoping that all his loss and heartache somehow served a higher purpose.
