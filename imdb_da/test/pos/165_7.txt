Three children are born during a solar eclipse, and ten years later it has somehow caused them to grow up without conscience. As their simultaneous tenth birthday celebrations approach, they become cunning and calculate cold-blooded killers. The friendly girl local teenager Joyce Russel (Lori Lethin) finds herself confronted with these little terrors when most others fall to their English demeanors. Returning to movies like "The Bad Seed" and "Village of the Damned", this movie's premise for evil children cannot be completely original, but it is still quite disturbing. All three of the child's actors - Elizabeth Hoy, Billy Jacoby and Andy Freeman - are chillingly convincing. Director Ed Hunt and his co-author Barry Pearson maintain the unpleasant yet convincing mood for the movie's duration; they go as far as getting the little girl to access an involuntary peep show with her older sister (future stand-up comedienne and MTV personality Julie Brown whose striptease is a real eye). <br /> <br /> Names actors Susan Strasberg, who an Isle teacher, and Jose Ferrer, with virtually no screenplay as a doctor, add to the case with their presence while KC Martel, one of the original youths " The Amityville Horror "is very sympathetic to Joyce's kid brother. Other well-known faces like Ellen Geer, B-filmmaker Michael Dudikoff, Cyril O'Reilly ("Porky's", "The Damned Dance"), Joe Penny ("Jake and Fatman") and William Boyett Hidden ") can also be seen. /> <br /> Touching such parents' fears as children playing with weapons that they have discovered and locked in old fridges, "Bloody Birthday" is a little more than just a slasher variation with children as antagonists. Obers' music score, this movie stinks in memory more than some of its brothers, without lots of gore falling back (although this arrow through the eye of the eye seems pretty good). <br /> <br /> Unclear, uncomfortable and downbeat, "Bloody Birthday" is worth looking for the curious. <br /> <br /> 7/10
