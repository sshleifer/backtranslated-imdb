I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best periods in the civil war that I have seen telling a story of friendship divided by the war. The costumes are good, the lines of history are good, I love how the story jumps from character to character to keep you guessing what will happen next time in their lives. There is a good balance between good and evil. Some of the signs that are evil in my opinion are too good not to see. Every time something more despicable than the last happens, I curse the TV as if they can hear me. I love how this miniseries makes me feel involved in that drama. However, I would NOT recommend watching the third movie in the DVD series. It is a disappointment to the first two movies and most of the original characters do not return. I don't want to remember how the third movie ended, I prefer to live with the thought of the end of the second movie. It makes me happy.
