Bridgette Bardot, who looks as sexy as ever, plays a spoiled but innocent daughter of a French ambassador. She likes one of her father's top helpers (womanizer MICHEL) to marry her, and it turns out to be the best for both of them. Michel is flirting with his old girlfriends and to teach him a lesson, Bridgette is flirting heavily with a married PRINCE CHARLES. Michel is surprised by his envy. A cat-and-mouse game takes place between Brigdette and Michel ("I have an affair" ... "No, you don't" ...) And finally Michel acknowledges that she can just promise to give up all the other ladies in his life. Bridgette and Michel settle comfortably into their happy ever while Prince Charles comes home to England. It is an easy piece, but it is incredibly charming. While some might mistake it as a product of the time, I found it quite fun. Worth renting.
