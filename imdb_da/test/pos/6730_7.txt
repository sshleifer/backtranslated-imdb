So after years and years I finally track down this movie! I was dying to see how it lived up to my memories. I clearly remembered the shadow of the ghost drain that ran into the mine and waited for two wooden planks crossed in the mining and just stared out with a pale white face. This only shot was probably the most chilling shot in my childhood, I remember chills running down the back. When you see it now, it's obviously not nearly as scary, but quite unconsciously strange to see the same pictures again. If anyone wants a copy, privately alert me. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty standard BCFF stuff. However, it is strange that the message is rather unclear this time - there is no real morality as such (except that "ghosts are here to help us?" Or "not be harmed by ghosts!") There was not even a greed / capitalist angle of profit from mine. But a massive act of irresponsibility from the captain and encouraging the two children to actually follow a ghost's vague consequences not only in a mine but into a new mine hole, which is quite dangerous. The captain then invites the kids to climb a large ladder deep into the mines simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too. It is also a little strange that the ghost chooses the boy to help the trapped adults and not just help the captured adults directly. Oh good.
