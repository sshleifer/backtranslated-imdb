If you think about it, it is almost incredible that a film about the death penalty (one of the world's most controversial issues) can be made that does not offend them. It is a testament to Tim Robbins' extraordinary intelligence and sensitivity, traits that can also be seen in his plays (Shawshank Redemption, Jacob's Ladder). <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie shows a subtle compromise between "for" and "against" camps ... so subtle that it can't be put into words, subtly to the vanishing point, but one gets meaning when looking at the picture that a compromise is possible that in some way it may have been prepared if we only look deeply enough ...
