This film is a study for my English class, but it is depth and meaning has amazed me. As we look closely at all the facts and characters in this film, its and interesting stories of love, hatred, war and prejudice. Well recommended! A girl named wealthy Jewish Patty Bergen meets an escaped prisoner of war, she then hides him in her playhouse in her large gardens, and as they get to know each other, they begin to see the other qualities and they serve each other's love. Patty's father despises her and treats her like dirt. Anton (the prisoner of war) blows almost his cover to protect her, but patty manages to stop him before he is seen by anyone.
