Quite simply, Goldeneye is the single biggest N64 game to date. The learning curve is almost perfect, and you will still play it with your friends months ago, since the multiplayer mode is nothing extraordinary. The system of acquiring cheating for once requires some degree instead of just knowing which buttons to print, and the challenge with Aztec at 00 agent level is amazing. All in all - it's the best game I've ever played on the N64
