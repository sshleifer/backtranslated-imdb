Father Hood is an entertaining tale of an unwilling father who is definitely a HOOD! Patrick Swayze plays Jack Charles, who is always looking for one big "score" to put him on the street. His wife died while he was a prison and his two children were taken care of. When he came out he thought they were better off in the nursing home? besides, he still had to score his happiness. His daughter Kathleen Charles (the game wonderful by Sabrina Lloyd) breaks out of a nursing institution that abuses the children and misappropriates money that is supposed to be spent on the children. She hunts down on her father; tells him how badly the place was and that her brother Eddie Charles (played by Brian Bonsall), "just a little 7 year old child" was moved to the institution she had just broken out and convinced her father to kidnap him The three begin on an adventure across the country, all the time Jack keeps telling himself that he needs to get rid of the kids! Patrick Swayze is really good in this comedy, playing a "hood" (probably a little understatement for this criminal character), which resembles his Johnny Castle character of Dirty Dancing except Jack is appropriately more fun in this comedy and more optimistic than Johnny Castle. Swayze is fun and rally makes comedy pretty good! Halle Berry plays Kathleen Mercer, who is a reporter trying to enter the foster care system, which becomes Sawyer's allies. Diane Ladd plays Rita, the concertist's mother of Jack Charles.
