I watched this game at Showtime some years back in my home, and when the final note was struck, I would jump out of the couch and give the production a standing ovation. As it was, I shot a tear that it was such a bunch of amazing performances and songs. For my birthday, my kids bought me the VHS version as well as the CD of the play with Len Cariou in the Sweeny Todd role. <br /> <br /> I've shared the game with many ... some seem to be the subject of a little sick, but nobody has anything but praise for the songs. <br /> <br /> I've always loved the interplay in songs with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn as well as Hearn and Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin. <br /> <br /> I'll own the DVD.
