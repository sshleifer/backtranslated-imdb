There have been several books that have cited this as the earliest homosexual. I really do not see this as all gay homosexual sensations, but then two men dance in what must be the world's first movie musical has its attraction. <br /> <br /> There have been several previous comments on this movie that reject any gay overtones. As for those who can quickly dismiss this movie as just silly and an attempt made late at night for too many drinks ... Now I've heard that story before. <br /> <br /> This movie is interesting as a wonder and if people want to consider it the first gay movie, be it. Better than the depressing 1919 Other than the Duck.
