Don't listen to most of these people. ill give you a better review of this movie that I and my friend love! Its about Jill Johnson, played by Camilla Belle, who sits in Mendrakis's house and someone breaks in. If you wonder how he got into the house, he probably went through the garage. so don't listen to, "the worst deal" anyway. It has amazing plays. with a great story. I think there are 2 benefits that Jill has. 1. Shes a fast runner and is on the pitch team. 2. She came out alive! laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> It's a cool movie and pretty scary. Check it out you will be happy with this masterpiece. Don't listen to the other people on the site. it is very good. Trust me, I'm good at reviewing movies. I am a future film critic. I really want to buy this movie. And you also want when you see it. It's amazing.
