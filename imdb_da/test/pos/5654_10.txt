A scary masterpiece on the sheer madness and despair of war, Fires on the Plain (Nobi) will not be to everyone's taste: this is a war film in the most meaningful sense of the term, one that does not differ from flagging patriotism or saccharin sentimentality . Nobi cuts deeply, it is ugly, foolish and gloomy, as few things ever committed on celluloid will ever be. This is war behind the cannons, without triumphs or heroes, no moral victories or defeats to be had, just a handful of giant and horrible-looking men striving over a land ravaged by war as prisoners who fled a great disaster. The characters speak morally judgment because they are creatures possessed by a great ve, a path that does not allow issues of moral character. War and survival. Pitting one's will toward the other is in a battlefield arena. The loser is simply removed from existence. <br /> <br /> Tamura, a soldier in the Japanese Imperial Army, is exhausted from his platoon and ordered to report in a nearby hospital because he coughs blood and does not suffer from the rest of the platon. He is asked to never come back and instead commit suicide with a grenade if the hospital rejects him. As it does. The hospital is nothing but a shelf made of wooden planks, and the hospital's surgeon simply tells him that if he is able to walk, he is just fine. It is in the shabby excuse for a hospital that one of the film's most frightening scenes takes place. As the area is carpeted by American aircraft, doctors and those who can walk and maintain themselves can escape from the hospital and into the forest. Times before the hospital breaks, the wounded and curly figures of the sick crawl out of it in every way posture, dressed in their sick white robes, as if the building is a kind of beast spitting viscose and dirt on the ground . <br /> <br /> It's Nobi's greatest success; the sharp and brutal depiction of war suffering in simple but evocative images without melodrama or pseudo-heroism. Soldiers cross a moss, wading knee-deep in mud, moving across the opposite bank and into a field only to discover the enemy tanks hiding in the forest, their light shining like malignant eyes as they scan the darkness. A procession of wounded soldiers, dirty and semi-grained, crosses a road and falls to the ground on the sound of enemy airplanes. Buzzards feasting on a pile of dead bodies. An abandoned village. A mad soldier who believes to be the Buddha sitting under a tree covered in flies and his own excrement and offering his arm to be eaten by Tamura when he is dead. These are the pictures Kon Ichikawa confronts for our eyes, relentless and unclear in their poignancy but honest and raw. <br /> <br /> Nobi doesn't rush to get anywhere. It is accurate to follow Tamura's travels through the war-torn country as he attempts to reach Palompa's regrouping center and observe the madness and obscenity of the war. The film drifts through the sludge of the fate of the war cloud, slowly and brooding, just as the characters follow. The last thirty minutes of Tamura, taking refuge with two deserters feeding on "monkey" are the closest Nobi will observe conventional narratives, and they are no less powerful for that matter. Strikingly photographed in black and white, with great performances from the cast and Ichikawa's secured direction, Nobi is not only among the best war movies to be made, but also among the finest Japanese cinemas.
