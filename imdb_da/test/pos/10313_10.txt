I watched this movie over 5 years ago, and the subject still infuriates me as it should. Her anger and initiative were inspiring. Not that I would take over an army and kill people, but the scene at the well and in the rebellious strong team will never leave me. This is a good movie, but be prepared for the strong topic.
