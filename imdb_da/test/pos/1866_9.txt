I saw world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, this is a great movie. Real-life man and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star like Charles and Emma Darwin in the midst of their struggle through the letter and decision to publish the origin of the species. Their reflections on the ramifications it can have for their family and the future of humanity are conveyed in such a way that one can only suspect an off-screen couple could achieve. <br /> <br /> Jon Amiel (who gave a heart-felt introduction) and John Collee do and great work to bring Randal Keynes' biography to life. They created some very exciting and human moments, great filmography and sets and a generous help of tongue-in-cheek about the ever-divisive theory of evolution. <br /> <br /> The surprise star is Martha West, who plays Annie Darwin, the character of whom much of the story is wrapped. She plays the perishable young girl to a tee. If this performance is something to go with, the star must rise. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great movie, and while it's a period drama, the issues that run it are still very much alive today.
