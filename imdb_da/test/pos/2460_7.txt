This movie easily rivals the emotional strength, the dramatic impact and the overall performance of "12 Angry Men". I rented it on a whim and was amazed that I hadn't heard of it before. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it was Emilio Estevez's direct debut, but the pacing, interplay and evolution of the characters as well as some clever cameras surrounding the character Estevez all play a natural eye. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Martin and Emilio includes the same wonderful chemistry we experienced in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie. Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation of her character in "Playing in the Fields of the Lord". She is annoying and yet one can empathize with her at the same time. <br /> <br /> There are moments when I feel that the plot is delaying a touch, and the moment between Estevez and his ex-boyfriend seems almost written for another movie, Estevez comes out as another character all together. But there are small complaints. <br /> <br /> This movie must be based on a true story or written by someone who lived these experiences. I rate it 8 out of a difficult 10. <br /> <br />
