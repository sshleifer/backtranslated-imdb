Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic by Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method (sketching poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its amazing beauty) and his struggle to accept a harsh reality in relation to his idealistic imagination. <br /> <br /> The movie integrated excerpts of Miyazawas poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students were powerful, especially in a scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom. Miyazawa's selfless compassion for the peasants in his village, his sister, and other unlucky people can serve as a lesson for all of us. In addition, Miyazawa's devotion to science was also nicely portrayed. At a time when Western ideas were still met with skepticism, especially in provincial cities like the one where Miyazawa grew up, he understands his usefulness by helping his villagers and is inspired by his elegance. The way the film presented moments of artistic passion and disappointment in the author was truly intense and interpreted. <br /> <br /> I felt that CGI was embedded in the movie, while the groundbreaking innovation was clashing with the more organic animation. It could be argued that this was intended to represent conflict within the main character, but I found it rather unethical. I also want the film to have discussed Miyazawa's Buddhist influence, but it worked fine without it. <br /> <br /> Although this movie was very well done. I give it a 9/10, with one point being deducted for CGI. Otherwise, the animation, plot and dialogue were all wonderful and fervent. I haven't seen any other movies of Kawamori Shoji, but after seeing this, I'm sure to give them a try.
