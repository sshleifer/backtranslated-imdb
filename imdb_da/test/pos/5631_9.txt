I rented this movie for two reasons. The first was all the good things I read about it. I was definitely impressed and couldn't agree more with all the reviews I read. The other reason is because I know these guys. I don't know Mark and Mike. He hasn't changed much from the years we knew each other. I know him as "reaper" from a local Milwaukee radio station (WMSE). The way he is in this movie is really Mike 100%. He even gave me a table he made. It was a small one, about 15 "tall that said Metallica on it. The odd thing about it was that it only had two legs. Sometimes it is the thought that counts and Mike has always thought of others first.
