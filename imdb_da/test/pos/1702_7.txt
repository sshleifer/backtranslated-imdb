I just finished a double feature night of an American werewolf in London and Paris. Let me start by saying that "London" still stops after all these years, and the transformation sequence is of any standard quite impressive, the movie was fun and frightening, also a bit gore .... Now we can come to "Paris" it's fun, a couple of years, lots of gore not as exciting or creepy as original, but it has some laughs in what has become quite fashion these days in movies, so maybe in that sense it was before it was time, the transformations al a CGI, while good at the technology of its time, is not as impressive as the original. I gave this movie a 7 because I have to admit it was comfortable, I laughed a lot and found Tom Everett Scott to be so silly that I would first like his performance only to end up suffering it ... go figure. Julie Delpy was competent as it was the direction, it's the script that lacked a bit of shine and finesse. I read here that John Landis should lead to bad. He wasn't quite sure it would have been another movie altogether. I have also noticed some discussion about a sequence "What if" well no one has noticed the obvious, it should be in American and here is my title "An American werewolf coming home" or in DC that would be fun, all the political dogs need a good scare. Just watch the original in the new dolby 5.1 audio DVD transfer and watch both of these on an HDTV with upconvert on ... nice !!!!
