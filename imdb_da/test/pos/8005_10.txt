Many of us only find art pleasing when the masterpiece itself touches something deep within us. That is, the finished creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can somehow personally relate to it. It was winter, here in Australia in 1992, when I watched Batman Returns on the theaters and it blew me away. Both "me" are. I was supposed to belong to an ideal, a standard, but at the same time I lived another life. Tim Burton was the first film producer to say it was OK for a comic movie to be dark and to confess that darkness can happen to all of us. After Tim Burton's Batman interpretations, many other dark cartoon heroes and anti-heroes flooded the theaters. Cartoon folklore for decades had told about friendly, sympathetic heroes with dashingly beautiful smiles and magical superpowers flying in the sky and spun powerful paths from their wrists and had red boots and had the power of a locomotive. But what happens when you are only ten years old and you see your parents coldly executed before your eyes? You Snap Somewhere in your psyche breaks your young sore psychological make up from each other. The only way that such pain and evil can be controlled is to create an alternative person. You make a promise. Your other self will be stronger, exploiting all the rage to use the means available to avenge the innocence of your parents to the criminal, criminal, criminal. This is life seen through Bruce Wayne's eyes. Both couples. The world he sees is dark, gloomy and cold. Although he patrols the streets and people hear him cruise, they do not jump to get their autograph. He is their Savior, not the winner of a personality contest. Batman Returns is about losers. Batman, for another Christmas, remains "the only lonely man in the city". Bruce Wayne is never allowed to arrest the evil Max Shreck. The penguin must never trigger his pain to be discarded by his parents of Gotham citizens, and Selina Kyle is forever lost to being mentally fragmented and traumatized. And the hero doesn't get the girl or the cat. This movie kills into the desire of all of us to want so desperately to have a home, as expressed by Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot. The film brings out a need in all of us to be heard, respected and not ignored as desired by Selina Kyle, Oswald and of course Bruce Wayne. But sometimes we are all suppressed in one way or another, we are told to be an ideal, to behave to a certain standard. That is until we finally catch up. Only hope remains at the end of the movie as we see Catwoman rising towards the night sky. But come, what must we all want good will toward all men and women. As for me, I cannot say that I want to reach a point where I believe my problem of duality will be united. But it is OK. We all have a dark side. Batman Returns is not only the best of Batman movies, it is truly a wonderful unusual masterpiece of storytelling.
