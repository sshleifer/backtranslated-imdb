Taylor Hackford wanted to make this movie for 15 years and finally Jamie found Foxx to play the title role. Foxx is amazing in his depiction of Ray Charles. From an interview I watched with Foxx, he met Charles several times, and the two also played the piano together (Foxx had piano lessons as a toddler and actually played the piano in all his scenes). I couldn't see Charles live until his later years, so it was great to get a perspective on how his career evolved. I hope Foxx will be nominated for the best actor Oscar, as he certainly deserves it. The music is also amazing - it really shows the breadth of Charles' music, from country to blues and everything in between. The film also provides an effortless account of Ray Charles's life, from the many women he was related to with his drug abuse and its consequences.
