A surprisingly beautiful movie. Beautifully conceived, beautifully directed, beautifully acted, beautifully acted and beautifully photographed ..... The cinematography is nothing short of amazing. It's a war movie, but is epic in its reach and blends romance, tragedy and comedy into a story that is as appalling as it provokes.
