I enjoyed it, appreciated, will watch this movie again because I'm sure. There are subtleties that I missed. Wonderfully cast, no over acting or Clich√© performance or plot. Uses a tragic event that reflects several relationships, how the people involved in each relationship are connected (or interrupted) and perceptions of life, the position each one takes in the relationship, in life, and how to cope with the confusion, joy, evil and disappointment that things are not what they perceived to be. First, I thought there were "observers" and "they observed", but that is not the case, we are all connected in some way, and our perceived separation is only in small degrees. I recommend the movie to everyone, especially those in education, social work, religious counseling and any other person who breathes.
