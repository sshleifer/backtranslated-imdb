I do not know if it was the intentions of the directors to ensure that the sky was almost always sunny and beautiful in this film. Perhaps this is the romantic image many Americans have of the time this movie is set, as it is in the middle of the war, Macy has returned from the war. (His neighbor asks, "Hey, is it true, you have a Fritz over there?") And tries to get on with his life, but one day he gets a new pair of glasses (hence the name) and sees it clearly as the surrounding Situation turns out to be one of rabid anti-Semitism, and Macy and Dern could be wrapped in it. Funny how neither is Jewish in this movie, but the accusation is made. That too is historically accurate, as the labor market democrats in this time wrapped themselves in the flags of American and God. Macy is continually bothered to come to the "meeting". His presence gives unexpected results. <br /> <br /> The application of this timeframe to today is a contrast study. In 2005, a complete turnaround with average citizens who have taken patriotism and religion as their association, supports the Republican Party and sees organized work as part of the left-wing 'patriotic' America. <br /> <br /> A great picture to see if you're happy to see the friendly, brave and wise Macy (played beautifully by him) gets caught during race and hates in the mid 40's NYC's. <br/> <br /> A hard, emotionally charged movie.
