This is an excellent movie and I would recommend it to anyone. Dr. Drury's performance is top notch, as it always is, and he fits well with the other actors in the film. Can't give away any of the excitement or drama in the movie. Hell to pay is a must see movie !!! The reason was very exciting. I wanted to watch the movie over and over because it has all the elements of a great Western movie. It was very authentic in how they showed the components that deal with this film containing guns, horses and clothes. The soundtrack is fun and adds the taste to the movie. James Drury has the right touch when choosing a movie to be involved in. This is another winner for the Western genre. !!!!!
