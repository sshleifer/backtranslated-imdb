Me and a Coupla Friends form University - Alberto Lopez, Dave Hall, Celina Alcock (we graduated from Uea, Norwich, United Kingdom in 1997), still gathering and watching b-movies once a month. <br /> <br /> We are perfect experts in poor filmmaking and this movie was quickly placed in the top 10 of horrible / brilliant movies. <br /> <br /> So if you've just got beer and grass and need a movie to laugh like a drain on, DROID GUNNER aka PHOENIX 2 is the movie for you! Marc Singer is fully aware that he is in a turkey of a movie here and milking it for everything he can! Matthius Hues is sublime in his wood-acting and muscular moronity (is it a word?) Which he grabs "But I want my 20 thousand!" Pure Shlock Gold! If you liked this, see also: TRANCERS, THE RUNESTONE, DOLLMAN and some of the Charles Band or Fred Olen Ray ..... (but be warned: some of their movies are wholly unprofitable and you must scream them lost hours in your life !!!?!).
