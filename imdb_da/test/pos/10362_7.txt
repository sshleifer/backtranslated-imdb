I liked this movie. Many refer to it as "Sabrina the Teenage Feminist". They do it with a lot of movies that Melissa Joan Hart is in. She was really surprised at this movie because she was great in the part of Mary fighting for justice when her roommate is raped. You could tell that Hart was extremely determined in this movie and it showed. I also liked Lisa Dean Ryan as Marie's roommate. She was very effective in making me apologize for her character after she was raped. Josh Hopkins was good as the bold and selfish rape. Lochlyn Munro played convincingly his character. The action in this movie is better than in most television films, in my opinion. However, the film was quite predictable. I also expected more from the end, it was too sudden. Delivery could have been better. But the performance and the overall plot constitute these problems.
