I've seen these movies counting times now and still can't get sick of it. It's like a frickin 'fabric. I know that many people do not like it, but there is something about it that just pulls me in. Each performance is spectacular, but Aaliyah is the one who steals the show. She played not only Akasha's role she became. Her body movement and beauty were taken very well. It is also great to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an Egyptian queen (No, I do not advocate white people, I am one). True, it is not known what color the ancient Egyptians really were, but it was a good change. Stuart Townsend made me forget that Tom Cruise's portrayal of Lestat and Marguerite was once again striking. All in all, it was a good time in the cinema. For those who haven't seen it, be sure to see it openly and don't take it too seriously. I mean, it's a movie about a vampire being a rock star. Take it like that.
