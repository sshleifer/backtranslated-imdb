How do you describe perfection? In the mood for love! Maggie Cheung and Tony Leong dance virtually on the screen and give star performances that stay with you hours after you leave the theater. Each scene in the film resonates with the powerful combination of excellent filmography and shooting choices, top-notch acting and the sensual soundtrack. Night King Cole song in French clearly sets the tone for the whole movie. Maggie and Tony look wonderful, with Maggie slimming in some really brilliant cheongsams and Tony always looks dapper. I've seen this movie several times already, and every time I see it, I find something new to rave about. Love it!
