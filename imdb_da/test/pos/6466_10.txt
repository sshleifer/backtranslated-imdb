This is one of Cassavete's best performances. The entire cast is excellent, just as Martin Ritt is sublime undervalued. The anger, the fear and the separation of labor in the cities are splendidly told in a way that is neither intrusive nor condescending. In a way it is dated with its era, but in many ways it is wonderfully timeless.
