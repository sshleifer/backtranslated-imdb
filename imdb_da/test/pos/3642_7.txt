The animation quality here is determined under par IMO, regardless of the age of OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the signs do not. <br /> <br /> This may sound tricky, but given that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, will you feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever effectively mimic human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed? I doubt it. There are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, they are basically "bioroids" (or whatever they are) that can be replaced by human characters. It seems to me sloppy. The protagonists seem to have some kind of emotional confusion, though there is no light on this. Little light is throwing on the backstory at all, a big shame. The short length of the film combined with the focus on mecha and the crime means that we do not see any depth of field. The reason is completely down, but we are back without any finished product. A cropped version of this OAV would have made a big TV episode when some sign-signatures had been established. <br /> <br /> The highlights of this short film are mecha design and action / espionage. <Br /> <br /> The errors really start to show once you've had a chance to digest all goings-on, so I couldn't recommend it to own, but it's definitely worth a watch or two! While this review is mostly negative, I really think it's worth spending time to see this, but it's nothing to hurry up and buy. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: A clear waste opportunity.
