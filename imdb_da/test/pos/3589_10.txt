This is undoubtedly the most amazing and amazing documentary I have ever seen! The pictures shown are absolutely breathtaking and amazing. Besides that, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs you and doesn't let you go to the end. You will be so hooked and entranced by what you see that you will forget your home watching TV! This series is available for purchase on DVD, and I highly recommend picking this up! With all the evil and death in this world, this documentary series gives us evidence that life is beautiful and worth saving and preserving.
