This is the best movie I've ever seen, and I love it a lot, it's so sad and loving that I could see this movie over and over again. When I first saw it on the Disney Channel, I was like I'd love to watch this movie again. I would love to watch this movie every day and I recommend it to anyone. This is really a good movie. For anyone who has not seen this movie and thinks about it, they go better and see it because it is really good. I love the part when the boy found out the girl and from then on I was just into this movie. if i could watch two movies every day it would be this and loved it are my two favorite movies, i really love them
