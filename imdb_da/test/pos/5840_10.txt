Tom Fontana's unforgettable "Oz" is down one of the biggest TV shows ever created. Brilliantly written, acted and directed, it is so close to perfection in any art form (movie, television, literature, music) as it gets. Haunting in it's extreme brutality it creates a prison world filled with various characters ranging from compassionate and flat out scary. It is a show that no matter how brutal it is, one cannot see the eyes. The combination of professionally trained theater actors with film and television actors allows for a variety of and all original performances. <br /> <br /> And while the show is universally acclaimed and / or has a loyal fan base, one cannot feel that it was underwritten during the television run due to other HBO dramas such as "The Sopranos", "Sex and the City "and" Six Feet Under ". And while all these shows are fine and border-red masterpieces in their right, many people forget that it was "Oz" who was HBO's first entry into an hour's television drama series. It was a brave, risky first entry and with that HBO hit a grand slam with it. This is as good as it gets.
