Although it may not be as entertaining as some of Herzog's works, Little Dieter is another fine film by one of the world's greatest film artists. Following on from Herzog's usual themes, Little Dieter is a fascinating and uplifting character study of a brave man and his efforts to live a life-changing traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Dieter Dengler wanted to fly from a very young age, and the Vietnam War gave him that opportunity, but instead of using the war in a cockpit, he spent most of the land as a POW. Dieter tells most of his story eloquently and passionately, with occasional help from Herzog. Herzog makes very little voice over this time, but contributes with very subtly powerful soundscaping and visuals - which should not be any surprise to those who are familiar with him. <br /> <br /> Angels are a fascinating and highly sympathetic person. As a human being and as vibrant as they come, I found the story of his life and his inexplicable personality to be inspiring. Thanks to Herzog for (re) introducing him to us. <br /> <br /> The scale of the film is not so widespread, and the drama is not as fierce as many of the early films that made Herzog a force to be reckoned with. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend it to his fans and to those who enjoy documentaries. It is a very interesting and well done movie.
