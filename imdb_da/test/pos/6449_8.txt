When I first saw the ad for this, I was like 'Oh here we go. He's finished with High School Musical, but he can't go further on it, so now he plays at other Disney shows. Personally, I love The Suite Life and I'm a big fan of Ashely Tisdale. But for some reason I'm not so keen on Zac Efron, even though all my friends think he's the best thing since Jesse McCartney. But he really irritates me. Anyway, I saw the show (taking a break from English coursework) and was pleasantly surprised. The performance was good all round, especially from the regular characters at The Suite Life, and Zac Efron was not as bad as I expected. All in all, a pretty good show.
