This is a good movie, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. Without destroying anything, it is only going on in 3 places - a Sicilian farm, the boat and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close, so we never see a wide sweep of anything. I wonder if it was saving money? No street scene anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close-ups. And the music ... what on earth was playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they were out? I could have done without the dairy industry too ...... But before you think of me as a pure misanthrope, let me repeat, it's a very good movie with heartbreaking moments, wonderful photography, great characters and more accuracy than the usual ( US) in the field of immigration experience.
