<br /> <br /> *************************** MILD SPOILERS AHEAD ************ ************** <br /> <br /> We Dive that Dawn is an English made movie with John Mills starring. The second time I looked at the DVD version was on a big TV and I have to say that the movie is better than I thought the first time I saw it on the samll screen. Maybe it was the big screen display that helped? <br /> <br /> I'm still saying that the first few segments of the movie are confused, but when the submarine leaves the port and begins its mission, the movie also goes off! The search for the German battleship called Brandenburg and the adventures that came with it was absorbent, and the details of the film are interesting! <br /> <br /> I increase my rating to 7/10. If you enjoy WW II movies, I think you find this one interesting when the submarine gets going. Some of the men on the bottom also have a good sense of humor!
