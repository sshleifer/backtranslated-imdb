I consider myself a casual fan of Dario Argento. For every really good flick of him (like "Deep Red" and "Tenebre") there seems to be an equally uninspired (his production since "Opera" tends to disappoint). Yet there is no denial that when he is at his best, there are few terrorists who can beat him. I consider "Opera" to be Argento's best work. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the movie where all his trademarks are present. There are no well-developed characters, and the plot makes very little sense when you begin to examine it. Still think of Argento as a European equivalent to Brian DePalma - the style is everything that matters here, so much it becomes fabric. Typically for Argento there are some beautifully filmed murder sequences. Those who are not familiar with man's work can experience it as a sadistic remark (and it may be, given the often time misogyny of them), but it is truly true. Argento stages murder with a complicated look at visual details. He really makes graphic violence an art form. Plus, his direction and the look of his movie is impeccable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, "Opera" is one of his most frightening products. Argento is the only instructor that I feel of booming rock music, works well for horror sequences (when others try to pull it out, it comes across as cheeses). The play varies, with Cristina Marsillach playing a beautiful and reasonably sympathetic but never particularly animated young opera performer. The rest of the actors are man-made and get the job done, but again, with Argento, the play is never the only point. Its the beautiful colors, the frightening violence and the overall feverish / nightmare atmosphere. (9/10)
