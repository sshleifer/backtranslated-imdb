The end of Suburbia (TEOS) is a very useful movie. It is also important and provocative. There doesn't seem to be any space with either the movie or its main source of entertainment, anti-sprawl Meister, James Howard Kunstler. <br /> <br /> While I'm not a big fan of the new urbanism, my criticism of it is because of its little vision. In the case of the new urbanist Peter Calthorpe - another talking head - you finally hear what's obvious in and among the special extra TEOS-selected ... Calthorpe just doesn't understand peak oil. <br /> <br /> I used this as a teaching tool in economy classes to get out of the country's importance as a production factor - a fact that has been slowly reduced by neoclassical economy - and also as a means of educating: top oil , our waste land use, global warming, our endangered food production, public transit our compromised future <br /> <br /> Move across South Park! .... Made by Canadians from Toronto for $ 25,000 and released in May 2004, this video sold over 24,000 copies in October 2005. A large DVD rental provider recently ordered nearly 400 more copies. The Suburbia sales actually climbed 1/2 year after the release, and it has also been available on one of the largest online video services since September 2005. <br /> <br /> A sequel, Escape from Suburbia, is in the works with a possible release before August 2006.
