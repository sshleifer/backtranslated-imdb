The Italian concept of "sprezzatura" was the grace and nonchalance in social manners that led to success in love, as described in the 17th century manual "The Courtier". The movie "Hitch" is worth looking at the performance of the "sprezzzatura" concept in Will Smith's dynamic performance. <br /> <br /> Smith plays the character of Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, a professional dating consultant to those short on luck and trust. The best scenes are when Hitch trains the painfully shy and maladroit Albert in his quest to win the heart of a New York socialite and in Hitch's own attraction to Sara and a surprise to her when visiting Ellis Island. In these scenes, Smith is supported by good work by Kevin James and Eva Mendes. But this movie is driven by Smith's charm and blessed personality. <br /> <br /> From the start, Smith rises above the average cartoon that makes "Hitch" a highly watchable and entertaining movie. I don't think there is another actor working today who is able to deliver the charisma and the perfect timing with the comic moments like Will Smith in this movie. And his secret is in "sprezzatura"!
