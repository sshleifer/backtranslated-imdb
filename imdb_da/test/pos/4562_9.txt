This is one of the most satisfying of the TV adaptation book. The actor, who makes us believe that a Borg might be sexy, makes us believe that a spy and traitor can have some redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> The TV plot line does not exactly follow Cornwell's story, but is both exciting and rewarding as a story of a darngarn. If you have a yen for romance in uniform, there is a lot of sexual energy that sparks between our husband Sharpe and the lies hussy. Made me wish she was closer to it in the books. But no matter what the hero is wronged, completely redeemed, all in rage, luck in flight and totally in battle to keep you clued to your DVD game.
