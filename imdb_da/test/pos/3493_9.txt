The Ali G show was really fantastic - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noted that he just pretended. In fact, Sasha Cohen is very intelligent guy who pretends to be stupid so he could get really honest answers from people ... And that's very funny. So I didn't expect movies to be good because it was all done - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of any show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Sure it was stupid, but who cares that you can't actually slow down safely with a car battery that someone said? It was not supposed to be a realistic documentary ... And it is not like the show, it is completely different, but that does not mean that it is bad. When I was finished watching, I was totally impressed, but now that it took a while, I realized that it wasn't so special anyway, but it still deserves a nine - at least for what it should be.
