First I have to say that this movie is way less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code. Sure you have the religion vs. science problem, but it's not trying to make a big statement about it. It is basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well. a scene especially (involving fire) I found very well done. <br /> <br /> Second, change from book to movie. Although I followed the development of the movie, I complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others, I must admit that I was wrong. It was refreshing that the film did not follow the book exactly as it was in Da Vinci. However, if you are a purist of the book, some of them may disturb you. But BIG TWIST is still there, so don't worry about it. Finally, I'm glad they removed some stupid subplots and didn't even try to suggest the possibility of Langdon and Vittoria coming together. <br /> <br /> The performances are really good, but nothing out of the ordinary. It's okay for a movie like this. <br /> <br /> I would give it a 9/10, mainly because it delivers what it promises, entertainment, pure entertainment
