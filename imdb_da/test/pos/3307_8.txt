You can't take this movie seriously ..... the plot is predictable and tired, it often appears over the top, the dialogue is ridiculous; but it all adds a lot of fun! Three "girl girls" in the late 1950s find their way to the BIG city and all the evil and temptations their mothers have warned them about: married men, alcohol, premarital sex, abortion, etc. <br /> <br /> So, there is Amanda Farrell (Joan Crawford) who succeeded professionally but whose personal life has been sacrificed to an office with her name on the door. <br /> <br /> This movie may have been credible 50 years ago, but now it's just big campy fun! Rent / buy it and enjoy.
