This is more of the same thing that made this cartoon popular ... but who complains? It is always fun to see the bad coyote try different contradictions to get Road Runner and then get powdered by each of these inventions. The underground cave hunt was different from the normal fare and was clever. It gave us an aerial view of the hunt in a labyrinth-like structure. I didn't say it was fun; just different from the normal supernatural antics. This along with some other Road Runner shorts is available at the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2, and their transfers are spectacular. The colors are magnificent.
