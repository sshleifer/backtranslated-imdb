This movie was excellent from start to finish. I was ripped off by the action, the black humor and the incredible unfortunate our heroes encountered at every turn. Thomas Jane is a great actor and I hope to see him in many more movies to come. Reading through the comments of others, I must admit that I have never even thought of Tarrantino while I look "Thursday", but now I think about it, I think there are some similarities. I guess I don't spend much time trying to relate everything to everything else. The rape scene between Porizkova and Thomas Jane is one of the record books - the sexiest scene ever.
