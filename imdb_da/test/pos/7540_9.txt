Great fun both as a movie and as an excuse to sit back and play 'Oh, it's whassi's name' game. Every star in the English movie's golden age seems to be in this one and it was a joy to see them. And the biggest of them all, Richard Wattis, was as huge as ever. <br /> <br /> There is actually a plot that rolls together very nicely, there are also some amazing jokes and comic moments, but the key to this movie triumph is the characters in it. Alastair Sim is magnificent and somehow convinces you that a six-foot big bone Scottish could be the head of a girl's boarding school. George Cole, Beryl Reid and Irene Handl all have their moments, but with Alastair and Richard, the star of the show is Joyce Grenfell. She is an absolute one and brings a smile when she is on the screen ... her roll-walk and plum accent done to perfection. <br /> <br /> And for those who play, it's whassi's name game, you can even see Arthur Mullard, Barbara Windsor and Ronald Searle if you look carefully.
