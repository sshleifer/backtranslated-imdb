Had no idea what I would experience on this old 1940 movie. I still enjoy watching Laraine Day (Katie Lattimer) playing the role of a younger sister of Jean Muir (Helen Lattimer) and also their mother, Billie Burke , (Ms. Julia Lattimer). Thought I should be bored with the story of two sisters and a mother who is overly protective of her daughters until they meet with Robert Cummings (Ridley Crane) who has the reputation of being a millionaire playboy who has lots of gals and is a heavy drinker who is partying all the time. One night, Helen Lattimer goes on a date with Ridley and he continues to be bombed out of his mind and simply can't drive his car. It is at this point in the movie when this becomes a drama and changes the complete direction of this movie, which certainly keeps your attention right to the end of the movie.
