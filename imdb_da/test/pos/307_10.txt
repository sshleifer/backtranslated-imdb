Spoilers. This review has been edited for word limit. <br /> <br /> `Horror. Fear. 'Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001) <br /> <br /> The phrase that is as famous as "Here you look at you, child" or "Are you talking to me?" or 'May the power be with you' or 'I come back' means a little more than some one-liners. When it is spoken, it speaks in the air with a meaning and meaning that does not go unnoticed. What can drive some seer nuts is that they may never find answers to horror unless they see the movie again and try to pay close observation to each frame. What exactly does this line of dialogue mean? The horror that is being talked about is the reality of war. The reality of the moral people is so easily disturbed that they turn on their native instincts and kill fellow human beings without any sign of guilt. When Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) is standing in front of the dying colleague Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the movie, "The horror.the horror." is the realization of Willard's corruption. He has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his mission. This is not a typical Hollywood ending. In most cases, a character gets something, whether emotional, physical, mental or all three. But Willard wins and loses both. He learns that he has lost his morality. And it's a shocking end. <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse Now" is Francis Ford Coppola's tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking. This movie is completely different from `The Godfather. 'It is hallucinogenic, visually dazzling and an ode to the guilty side of human nature. Initially, it seems realistic, and then it becomes strange and so symbolic, and ultimately original in its unique perspective on the spiritual side of warfare. It's not as much a movie about the Vietnam War as it is a film about the war in us. <br /> <br /> It seems to be another war movie. Captain Willard (Sheen) is awarded by an army lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to murder a dismissed American colonel named Kurtz (Brando) who hides somewhere in Vietnam with a crowd of troops that more or less work as his slaves. <br /> <br /> Willard performs his "extreme prejudice" mission on a boat with four soldiers, including the boat captain, chief (Albert Hall), Chief (Frederic Forest) and a very young "Larry" Fishburne (who later became Morpheus in "The Matrix"). "Apocalypse Now" is in many ways a modern update of Homer's Odyssey. When our protagonist, Willard, completes his journey, he meets a number of original and strange characters, including Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has a strange fetish for surfing, and a rocky photographer (Dennis Hopper) whose lively gestures and manners are comparable to those of the much smaller Jeremy Davies in "The Million Dollar Hotel", one of those worst movie I've ever seen. Davies failed to make any connection with an audience; Hopper does. He is like the poetic vibe between Willard and Kurtz; He is like an interpreter who goes back and forth and speaks in foreign languages. In this case, he translates Kurtz to Willard, although I'm not sure Kurtz needs a translation of Willard. Many movies are fortunate enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. "Apocalypse Now" has many. Kilgore descending on a Vietnam village playing Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" remains one of the most remembered scenes in the entire film history. There is sharpness to it, a brutality to it, an ironic tone to it, and also a sense of playfulness. When Kilgore breaks down on the beach and says, "I love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like victory," we all break a smile. I won't lie to you: "Apocalypse Now" is a strange movie. It is not exactly the easiest to analyze. The end may frustrate some viewers if they do not understand Marlon Brando's significant speeches. But what it all comes to, what really matters is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche. The fear is the realization of war and its effects, not the war itself. Kurtz says, "You have the right to kill me. But you have no right to judge me." Brando's character, Kurtz, is left to the public to judge. For many naive viewers, he may seem like a crazy wage whose power comes to mind. But that's not what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to get across. By fighting in Vietnam, Kurtz realized how great he had it and how bad some others had. By going through ruined villages, he finally realizes that we are the naive who live our lives in a fool's paradise. We are totally naive towards our surroundings and possible accidents until they hit. By seeing how unfortunate some Vietnamese are, Kurtz realizes just as easily that he could be hit by something. He could just as easily end up as the people around him. And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have left their morals and left them at the door. Many believe that horror is one thing. There are two. For Kurtz, the horror of how naive he was and the reality of the influence of war on men. And after Willard's murder Kurtz, and hear Kurtz's dying words, he realizes it too. He realizes the effects of the war. To see so many soldiers without feeling right or wrong, he realizes the horror of what war can do for a man. And what it has done for him. Fear. <br /> <br /> 5/5 Stars - <br /> <br />
