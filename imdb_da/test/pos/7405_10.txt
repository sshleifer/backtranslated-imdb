I had never heard of Silverwing before, so I saw it at Toon Disney and immediately loved it! I also think that it is not just for children and that people of all ages will enjoy it. It has a great plot, great effect and cool characters. I will always love the show and I heard it coming soon on DVD all over the world and I will get it! I haven't read any of the books, but I intend to. The show deserves a 10 out of 10, and I hope the books are just as good. Well, that's all I have to say. But I still have 2 lines, I have to fill up, so ... who do you think everyone is the coolest character? Mine is Shade and my other favorite is Marina.
