Lots of action, cheesy love story, unexpected actors and generally fun. The special effect is acceptable / decent, some of the matches are quite cozy with some interesting acrobatic movements. The overall story moves along and is cheesy enough to keep you in doubt when the inevitable will happen, even if there is a bit of a twist (just a small one). The general naivety of the movie sometimes makes it fun. Sweet enough chickens also what more could you want. PS. If you want to review a movie like this, try reviewing it for the category the movie would fall (not necessarily where it should fall). that is, do not bomb good cheese films!
