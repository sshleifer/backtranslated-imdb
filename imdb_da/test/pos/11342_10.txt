Kar Wai Wong is incredibly impressive romance that is perfect for me. Seen in the 1960s Hong Kong. As we are shown, it is set in a turbulent time. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung play Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan. A man and a woman who meet each other in an apartment in Hong Kong where they both move in. Chow Mo-wan works for a newspaper company. Su Li-zhen Chan is secretary. Two very different people. Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan set up a special bond after they both found out their spouses, all the time extra-marital trysts are committed. Together. Chow Mo-Wans and Su Li-zhan Chans figures are nothing short of amazing. Both Leung and Cheung manage to beat such a fantastic chemistry with each other, it is better than any Hollywood romance set out today. Combined. The film is about the two leaders' focus and their feelings according to their partner's adultery. Kar Wai Wong manages to create such a strong character development between these two characters, you really begin to feel for them. Leung and Cheung are both amazingly amazing, better than any Hollywood pairing shown on the screen today. Combined. There is little else to describe Fa yeung nin wa than beautiful, energetic romance that also contains a moody, atmospheric piece with beautiful filmography. So many elements in this movie help create it to be flawless. In addition to Kar Wai Wong and the play, cinematography from both Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee is on its way. Beautifully undervalued. The shootings of Kar Wai Wong help make your heart create your own world. A world that creates these signs. Original, melancholy and nostalgic. This movie is incredibly unforgettable. Costumes created by Kar Wai Wong regular William Chang are absolutely beautiful. Cheung, wearing an elegant, ankle-deep, beautifully patterned dress in each scene. She is a stage steal. Her costumes say a lot about her character and a feeling is mounted in all her dress colors that are used vividly and smartly. Very original. Chang, also the production designer, creates a brilliant attitude to the movie's mood. Especially by the fantastic music used in scenes and masterful movie editing, again by Chang. William Chang seems to be incredibly versatile and is an unfortunate one for this movie. Overall, this film is one of the best of this millennium. Incredibly convincing and filled with nostalgia. The shots are fascinating and joking. Kar Wai Wong turns out to be a champion at the top of his game. The play; music; cinematography; editing; production; costume and direction all help to create a small, small, perfect movie. A masterpiece in Romanesque film production. Visually spectacular. Overall, a masterpiece for film making. A movie that reminds me of the old classic Hollywood was the one that never was. Never forget oh yung nin wa. I know I don't want to.
