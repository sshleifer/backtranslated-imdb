Before I watched this movie, I didn't really expect much of it, even though my friend had otherwise. Because of this request from my friend I decided that I really wanted to watch this movie. The moment I sat down to watch the movie, I was completely gone. From the credits I fell into my seat; I just couldn't contain myself. The film is about Hitler in all the comedy's glory. Hynkel is the absolute double for the Jewish barber who comes back from the fighting in the war. Because of the heroic heroism, he manages to save one of the Germans and make it a member of the enemy on board, which helps in the struggle the Jews had. But things went wrong, and Stolz was arrested, but only then to flee to the border of the Jewish surbur, the 'Ghetto. Because of this escape, the German army began to search, which meant that Barber and Stolz were arrested, but again they were escaped, only to be confused with the crawl and consequently take his poistion. ***** THE LANGUAGE THAT THE CAPLINE DOES IN THE END, IS FANTASTIC, IT DOES COMPLY MORAL, AS COOPERATION ONLY DREAMS. IN THE SPEECH, THE ENTIRE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MOVIE ON WHICH THE SERIOUNESS AND SINCERENITY, WHAT IT SUPPORTS, IS LIMITED THAT THERE IS WHAT I EXPRESSLY IS ABOUT WHERE WE DELIVER OUR LIFE, LOOKING AT THE LESS THAT IS USED TO ANYONE TO THE LARGEST, most prominent thing as war.
