-It's pretty much the entire soundtrack for this movie. I just saw this baby at the Munich Film Festival and it rocked the house. Director Doug Pray is never seen in this documentary, nor do I believe he is heard, but he has made a very intimate look at the mixer's life and history. He has segmented his film into about eight chapters, and then his disgusting group of enthusiastic interviews is spiced up according to what they are talking about. I was never great to "scrape", but the film does a wonderful job of keeping elementary for those who know a little, and throwing in jokes for those who are experts themselves in this area. Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys is in this movie, but it was only after the movie that I could mention several heavy heaters in the industry (DJ Shadow, Q-Bert, etc.). The extreme fascination of turntables from these talented and neat DJs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them. The film also sheds some joyful light on these guys (and a woman) to be classified as musicians. Do not let his movie idle, and if there is a slow scene, it will soon resume by virtually never ending music. If nothing else, this movie will increase your slang vocabulary. I have to come back to "dig" so I will end this review. Look, it will be interesting. Good thing man. Good things.
