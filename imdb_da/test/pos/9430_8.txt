Dr. Franz Tobel, a Swiss scientist, is smuggled out of his homeland by Sherlock Holmes for the Nazi agents spying on him not to get his invention of a new bombing sensation. Arriving in London, he resides with Holmes and Watson, but goes out with his girlfriend Charlotte Eberli, giving Holmes a clue about the location of his bomb vision, which he has divided into four, but Holmes' eternal nemesis, Professor Moriarity, is also seeking the bomb's vision to sell to the Nazis and abduct dr. Tobel and Charlotte's clue, a code series dancers that both Holmes and Moriarity both cannot decipher completely. Holmes eventually discovers the clue to the code and gets the position of the fourth piece of the bomb sight, but moriarity has the other three and a showdown is inevitable. Very good entrance into the Holmes series with lots of mystery and guesswork to go about. Atwill's depiction of Moriarity is more sadistic than the cunning kind described in the Doyle stories (or George Zucco's performance in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), but Atwill's acting as an actor renders his morality the rightful guy. The script and the direction make both of these entries more of a cat and mouse game between the two characters, and that is one of the reasons why this record succeeds as well. Good work on the cinema too. Rating 8.
