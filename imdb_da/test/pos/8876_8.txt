Just thinking about the movie, I laugh at myself. Anne Ramsey plays an unforgettable part as 'Momma', probably the most unpleasant but hilarious matriarch ever caught on film. Danny Devito and Billy Crystal make a fabulous duo that brings true warmth to the movie. Although not very complicated, the sweet story keeps your attention and keeps you laughing all the way. It's a fun comedy to ease up and even entertain the kids. I give it my full recommendation.
