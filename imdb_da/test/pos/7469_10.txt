Very closely written, acted and filmed. Violent, but not too much. Anyone who edited this knew exactly what he wanted to portray. There is not a wasted scene in this movie. "The usual suspects" were outstanding ensemble acting; This is a collection of excellent individual performances. I rarely buy movies, but this is worth owning.
