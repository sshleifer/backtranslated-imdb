We have moved far beyond this preliminary decay into a prohibited area-drug abuse - for the 1950s. As such, the film may appear to be dated. The man with the golden arm served his function is peeling back a layer of the underside of society, an eye opener to a southern country boy in 1955, when I first saw this movie in the theater. After some serious thinking about being too young, I was allowed to go. It was powerful and influenced then and still maintains some sharp, painful moments of the soul stripped naked. As a movie depicting loneliness as the core of being, it succeeds. <br /> <br /> Filled with anxiety, Frank Sinatra in his best role creates a vulnerability that makes him sympathetic to the viewer. He conveys his helplessness and inefficiency in a beautifully maintained performance. As a common sense in the final city jungle, Kim Novak as Molly is quite good. She is compassionate and still stands firm. The interaction between Sinatra and Novak is really good. Darren McGavin plays a slimy character and does very well. Eleanor Parker is extremely irritating and painful insecure in her role as the pathetic Zosch, the precocious wife of Sinatra. Arnold Stang is another unlikely survivor of the street. Considered pitiful and despicable, his character gives Sparrow tart comic moments. <br /> <br /> The music is almost the star of this movie-brooding, frantic, moody Elmer Bernstein's score perfectly accentuates the tensions of Frankie Machine's spiritual weakness and physical need for heroin. Molly's theme is bittersweet and aurally captures what the film depicts visually. I don't know of any other soundtrack that effectively complements the excitement and defeat of a man as effectively as it does.
