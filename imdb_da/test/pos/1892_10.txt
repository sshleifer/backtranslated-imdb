I don't know what some people thought when they said this movie was bad. It was good. Classic Bruce Campbell, yes it was low budget and the special effect showed this, but that's not what you see a Bruce movie because you see it to Bruce. Also Ted Rami was excellent. I found this movie hilarious and entertaining, I still jump up when I remember Bruce on the pink moped. Now I will admit that this movie is not for everyone if you don't like B-movies, you probably won't like this if you want big budgetary effects and the actors are controlling. But if you like the slack and off the wall sci-fi plots this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Hail King King!
