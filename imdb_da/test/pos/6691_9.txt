Because of a very misleading advertising campaign, I watched this movie in theaters at a relatively young age of 10. The trailers on television portrayed the film as a comedy, and I bugged my parents until they took me. After watching the movie I was blown away. I had no idea what to think. Quite different from anything I had seen before, and left far too many questions for such a young mind. Needless to say, I loved it. This morning was the first time I had been watching for probably 2-3 years, and I still think it is one of the biggest movies made in the last decade. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are both top-notch, like a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet, and the psychiatrist who develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery. The support aids are also almost perfect, every inhabitant of mental institution is incredibly convincing in their own way. The open end was handled very well and provided plenty of evidence to support what you thought happened in the end. How this movie did not receive at least one nomination in that year's Oscars is beyond me. If you haven't seen this movie, then drive to Wal-Mart RIGHT NOW. The DVD is usually in the buyer, pick it up! <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
