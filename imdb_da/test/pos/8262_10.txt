As you can see, I loved the book so much, I use the title for my internet alias and have been for over 15 years. (Okay, so it had to be spelled phonetically to fit the name's BBS character limit at that time, but what could I do?) If anyone finds this movie, I would absolutely love to watch it! Janet McTeer is amazing in everything else I've seen of her. I think she would have made a great Prue. And it even includes early Clive Owen - from before Chances (a large series itself). What's not to love? I hope the powers are clever and make it available on DVD soon! With some of the true mud they pout out, it is time well executed productions do it also on the market.
