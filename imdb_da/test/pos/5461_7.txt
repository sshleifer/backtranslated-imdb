LATE SHIFT was interesting for HBO films that took a detailed look at the power struggle that occurred between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him. This match is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who do not know the story and are aware of where Letterman is now, it may be interesting to learn that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as the host of THE TONIGHT SHOW more than Everything in The world, but Letterman found that his dreams were tracked as frequent guest hosts Leno had one of Hollywood's most powerful agents, Helen Kushnick, in his corner and worked tirelessly to get her client the job. It is not often we are going to look behind the scenes. Hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment value, but for fans of these two supernatants in supernatant, this movie gave a fascinating look at a very turbulent period in the night television. According to this film, Letterman was practically promised the job of Carson himself while NBC had promised the job to Leno, and that was where Helen Kushnick came in. The film presents Leno as a kind of milquetoast that allowed his career to be manipulated by Kushnick and celebrated ignorance of some of Helena's strong will manipulations by some of NBC's greatest power players, and it presents Letterman as this wise and wise businessman who despite Carson's support being paved by NBC and Kushnick. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck reliably recreate Letterman and Leno, respectively, but that is the sharp performance of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Helen Kushnick who keeps this movie bubbling. Bates commands the screen in one of her best, if not so well-known performances as the toxic Hollywood agent who eats television study director for breakfast. There is also a wonderful tour of Impressionist Rich Little as Johnny Carson, but it is primarily a fascinating story and the Bates Powerhouse performance that makes this a worthwhile check.
