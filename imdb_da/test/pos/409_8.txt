Red Skelton (in his first lead role) plays Wally Benton, who plays 'The Fox' on a radio program. He writes the mysteries of the murder, and as the 'Fox solves them. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder of anyone. He kidnapped Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another boyfriend (Virginia Gray). He tells Benton to write the perfect murder ... or his girlfriends get it ... <br /> <br /> Very fun and fun movie. Fast movement (it's only 77 minutes), a good script and perfect casting really puts this across. Skelton is very good in his first role - very funny, fast, beautiful and intelligent. Veidt is excellent as the evil Jones. Rutherford and Gray are very fun as Skelton's friends. All three of them play perfectly apart - their oral sparring is the highlight of this image. Also fun to see Eve Arden in a small role. <br /> <br /> Well worth your time.
