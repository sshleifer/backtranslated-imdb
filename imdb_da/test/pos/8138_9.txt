This short film intends to focus on a problem sociologically known as cultivated shock. the film presents the condition of average Romanian in democratic Romania, which finds out that life and the problems do not differ from the communist period, and if you want something, bribe to get it. <br /> <br /> So, our protagonist is fired for a long time, he's about 50 and needs a similar job, but the only job available is one inferior. He is forced to take it because of the lack of money. My opinion is that you should live in Romania so this movie can be as real and tragic as it seems.
