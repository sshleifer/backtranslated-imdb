Of many accounts, Stu Ungar was not a very nice guy. He spat on dealers, stiffened people he owes money to, and was verbally abusive. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers can choose to sugarcoat the man, making him a kind of sports hero who would win despite adversity. But High Roller does not. And it is a hard row for raising. Instead, we should look very close to seeing a man who never matured, passing the frightened little boy from the streets of New York, despite all his successes. And the only real approval he ever gets is from death itself. Very brave (because people don't get it) and very touching (when you do). <br /> <br /> What is also courageous is the use of a scoring sensation. "Ah, how distracted," people will say. Really? But there is virtually no violence. And Stuey LOVED gangster movies. Perhaps the feeling reflects the husband Stu and not the director Marty? And if it's really a low budget movie and look good, bravo! Finally, the linear flashback structure is. Wow, it will be hammered. Still, it doesn't only work exceptionally well, even for those who don't see the connection to "seventh seal". (Evidence: In SS player Knight plays with chess with death: In HR says Stuey "We can play a hand with cards, because you know" ... Death says "Never very good on cards .." Damn big last line.) <br /> <br /> No difficult effects or camera movements. No shaking camera. Nothing trendy at all. Just solid, tight story. <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie is too basic and somehow flawless. But then again it was also the guy. And that just makes it right. <br /> <br /> 9/10
