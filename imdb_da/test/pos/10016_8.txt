I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it here. Sure it's a bit slow in parts, but what would you expect from Rollin? Also there is plenty of nudity, nothing wrong with it, especially as it contains lots of beautiful, Brigitte Lahaie. There are also some spectacularly erotic female dead, a bit more dodgey, perhaps, but most effective. There is also a sci-fi-like story with a brief explanation at the end, but I wouldn't interfere too much with it. No, here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to what extent one is still 'alive' without memory. My DVD sleeve mentions David Cronenberg, and although this may not be as good as his best movie, there is some resemblance here, especially with the great use of seemingly threatening architecture and the efficient and eerie use of interior space. As I have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller, it is a captivating, nightmare film that makes most of its places, including a great railroad position at the end.
