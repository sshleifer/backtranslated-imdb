University teacher Larry Donner (Billy Cristal) is a blocked writer since his former wife Margareth (Kate Mulgrew) destroyed him and stole his novel, which became a best seller. He doesn't hide his hatred for Margareth and disturbs his girlfriend Beth Ryan (Kim Greist), an anthropologist teacher at the same college. While giving classes of Creative Writing, he is stalked by the student Owen (Danny DeVito) who wants to know his opinion on his crime story. Larry says he didn't like it, explaining that the murderer in each mystery should remove the motif and establish an alibi, otherwise he would be caught. In addition, Larry Owen suggests watching Hitchcock's movies to understand the structure of an exciting story. Owen, who wants to kill his horrible mother (Anne Ramsey), looks at "Strangers on a Train" and misunderstands Larry's advice and believes his teacher wants to change murder to remove the motive. Owen travels to Hawaii and in a ship Margareth goes overboard disappearing into the sea and is considered dead. But Larry does not have an alibi and becomes the primary suspect while blasting Owen pushing him to kill his mother as part of their supposed deal. "Throwing Momma off the train" is one of the funniest comedies from the 80s and a great tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. The direct reference is "Strangers on a Train", but there are jokes with "Vertigo" (with the spinning camera), "Family Plot" (with the car without breaks) and other movies. The lines are excellent and there is an interesting point when Larry tells that every great romance or mystery has a train. Anne Ramsey is amazing in the role of an unpleasant and fierce dominant mother, and the viewer will surely feel sad and understand Owen's madness. Kim Greist is very beautiful and Kate Mulgrew is the perfect bitch. Billy Cristal performs an obsessed character with many stupid and unreasonable attitudes, but is necessary for the plot. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jogue a Mam√£e do Trem" ("Throw Momma from the Train")
