I saw this very emotionally painful depiction and it was fascinating. The conflict between Williams' public and private faces and the pressure he was under was illuminated in such a way that even those who knew something about him would be surprised. The piece seemed excellent, but Michael Sheen was excellent. I only understood that it was him when I saw the previous comment. He looks quite physically different in this role, from any other role I have seen him in or like himself. Williams' autobiography differs markedly from his diaries, as represented in this film. The movie is sometimes disappointing to see because of the emotional anxiety that appears. However, it is a valuable experience and a movie that can be highly recommended.
