This movie is amazing. From the performances of Huppert, Girardot and Magimel, to Haneke's manuscript and direction, there is no single error line. The movie can put some people away with the tough sexual issue and at the slower pace, but it's really a masterful piece of movie theater ... so don't let it be challenging ways to stay away! <br /> <br /> Powerful and deserving of any prize it won in Cannes!
