The first reviewer is right - In this movie, we see ourselves snuggling up to the majority, being comfortable, trying to stay out of trouble, just trying to live our lives, and we can see how easily these very human traits are so fundamental to the functioning of society can lead us to become complicated in an evil. <br /> <br /> The story is set during World War II, with the radio, newspapers and movies reminding us of Hitler's attack on Jews to emphasize the irony of the same form of violent anti-Semitism taking place in America. It sometimes seemed a little heavy to me. It feels more like a game than a movie, but it is so thoughtful that such quibbles mean little. Perhaps less trivial is the fact that the whole plot is linked to a small fact that struck me as quite unlikely. Larry has lived an immeasurable life until the Middle Ages; But all that is needed is his beginning to wear a pair of glasses for everyone - ALL - at first glance to take him to a Jew. I deliberately suspended dissatisfaction because the plot kept me ahead, but the obscenity made me the subject of the whole movie. (And honestly I didn't understand why his wife was also taken to a Jew. Larry seemed to believe it because she was called "Hart." And later, when he married me, I don't know why his neighbors assumed she was Jewish. ) In the first part of the film I wondered if there should be elements of imagination. Larry's discomfort seemed exaggerated, almost to the grotesque point. Why not call the police to see rape, even if the attacker was a neighbor? And I thought the lighting seemed to suggest something a little unreal - the redness of the houses seemed too red, Gertrude's entrance seemed deliberately overlooked, generally the colors were almost crystal-like in their intensity. <br /> <br /> In the credits I see it was filmed on Campbell Avenue and Wallace Avenue in Toronto so I'm planning to go down there (near Bloor & Dufferin) today to check out the colors. Really :) It was good to be reminded that the priests at that time often led the evil of racism. (Remember how the Pope refused to speak to Hitler as he was only seeking protection from the Church? It was the same pope, on the other hand, who, when Rome was being liberated by US troops, asked the first soldiers to enter the city Don't be black Check your story.) I can't remember ever listening to this movie before. It's a shame. It is certainly of great interest to every thinking person, to anyone interested in American history or racism; It's one of the clearest illustrations I've ever seen by Bertrand Russell's poem: "Don't go with a crowd to hurt."
