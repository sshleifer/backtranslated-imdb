This movie has been in my mind for years as one of the best movie mysteries I've ever seen for television. The action is amazing. I've seen it twice and are still confused on some parts. I want a copy so I can play certain parts over and over again. I'm interested in buying a copy of this movie, but can't find it anywhere. I wonder if anyone has any suggestions on how to find it? I have tried e-bay, Amazon.com, internet searches and are completely frustrated. I haven't seen it at Turner Classic Movies, even at American Movie Classics, and I've even put out airplanes in our community and ask if anyone has a copy.
