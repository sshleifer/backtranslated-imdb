What can I say?? This movie has it all ... Romance, break-ups, rich kids, punks and preps. This is my all-time favorite movie that I can recite line by line .... I remember when it first came out, I was 14 and couldn't come in .... so finally got to watch it on cable .. I was hooked! Wanted to move to California and be a Valley Girl .. (Hey, I can also remember the song of Moon Zappa, do you?) In vain tried for years to get the never-produced soundtrack ... now you can find it on rhino ....
