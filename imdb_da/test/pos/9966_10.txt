Seriously, where is Al Pacino's Oscar nomination for this? Is it that we take him for granted at this point in his career? Pacino here is extraordinary. He gives a complex, heartbreaking performance like Shylock, the Jewish money lender. The movie as a whole was quite large, with beautiful shots in Venice to watch and a pitch perfect score to listen to. Other actors all do a good job, but the right reason to see this is Pacino. I've seen all of the nominated Oscar performances from 2004 and I have to say that Pacino was snubbed. blame it on the anti-Semitic affiliation with the game, the lack of campaign at the studio, the late release date without major impetus or most likely all of the above. In my thoughts this year's best performances are for Jamie Foxx in Ray, Don Cheadle in Hotel Rwanda and Al Pacino in The Merchant of Venice ..
