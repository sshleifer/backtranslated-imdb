I thought this movie was great, and I laughed so much that I had to watch it twice to catch the bits I missed while I bent over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this movie for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this movie fun, yes, my IQ is about: 135 ... I challenge that person to question me and then eat his own words! This movie is brilliant, and if the critic above was not such a boring idiot, he could smile for once in his life and take things as easily as they are meant !!! <br /> <br /> The musical tracks were so imaginative! EVERYONE when watching movies at that time, you will see men in pantyhose and realize how different it is for today's clothes and how much fun we would find today's male population if they were wearing tights today! The idea of ​​dedicating a song to beat men dancing in pantyhose was so fresh, how can anyone not laugh !!! (Plus also watching hip hop rappers doing ballet is always hysterical. As a dancer, I also made ballet and hip hop and danced with men who had to do both. It still cracks me every time !!!) < br /> <br /> I love this movie, if anyone hasn't seen it yet, don't listen to the critic above ... see it and then decide for yourself !!!
