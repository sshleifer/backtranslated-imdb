I thought this movie was great. I was a little skeptical when I really had no idea what it was about, but it was a beautiful story. I cried a lot and I laughed too loudly. I think it is very important to create movies about the Holocaust and how it affects people (it happened only 60 years ago!) I have been in Germany and Eastern Europe and I have studied the Holocaust so that this movie meant much for me. I think this movie did a great job of capturing this story (I don't want to go into details, I don't want to spoil it). But I certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a movie that I know this may sound clich√©, but will change your mindset about things.
