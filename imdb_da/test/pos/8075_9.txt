LA ANTENA (Esteban Sapir - Argentina 2005). <br /> <br /> A truly unique silent movie theater in this adventure as a story from Esteban Sapir, beautifully shot in black and white and virtually without dialogue "La Antena" is a feast for the eye and a must for lovers of the German expressionist cinema, with most nods to the works Fritz Lang and Friedrich Murnau. <br /> <br /> 'The City without a Voice' 'La Ciudad Voz' is governed by Mr. TV. He has taken the citizens' voices and has total control over all spoken words and images, forcing everyone to eat their own brand of television food. Sir. Television is not just a monopoly, he is the personification of evil and totalitarianism, although swastika appears as a symbol a number of times. He secretly works on a mesmerizing unit to control the minds of all citizens through his television broadcasts. To that end, he removes the only one left with The Voice, a beautiful singer, but a television repairman testifies to the kidnapping and flies to an old TV antenna in the mountains to stop Mr. TV's evil plans. <br /> <br /> The production design is fantastic with beautiful sets and imagery. Although shot primarily with the base language of silent cinema, Esteban Sapir also adds a number of own fresh techniques as a combination of typographic and animation techniques. Everyone speaks to each other through speech bubbles (usually close to their mouths), the higher they speak, the greater the signs. The texts themselves can be pushed away or broken. In the opening sequence, we see a book titled "La Antena" that opens and a paper town rises from the pages. There are hardly any references to Argentina. It is constantly snowing, giving the film a very un-Argeninian feel, while the surreal setting suggests a large city on the northern hemisphere, with only some of the songs revealing the Argentine background of the film. The pace is fast and so much is happening on the screen, it's hard to keep an eye on the movie's surreal story. Not only breathtakingly beautiful to look at, we also get a few messages about media monopolies, corruption and totalitarianism, but they are breezily packed. One of the most original movies I've seen this year. A joy. <br /> <br /> The film was shown as an opening film at IFF Rotterdam 2007. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
