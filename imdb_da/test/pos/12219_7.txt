What can I say? I got up this morning and switched on sci-fi and saw half of the first season and figured it all out. Strange, unusual and brilliant. It gives all the potential, and to think in the beginning I said it looks stupid. This should be the second best thing since the X-Files, but as always, nothing will ever take down that show in my opinion. I tell you, it's scary and so exciting and so soft. Towards the end, you have Miles as a beloved puppy with a strange pet that is a new species. You have two people on the run from the authorities. And a killer tsunami is about to strike! Wow! And I mention Miles pets are a potential killer (well the rest of his kind is). The surface is a brilliant show with spins and twists that deliver it all.
