Assy McGee is a show that you really have to be a certain age to appreciate. Otherwise it is likely that you will miss the references to the 80's copfilm and simply find it a continuous gag about a walking rectum. Think it's brainless, infantile poop humor? Go look at the Stallone movie 'Cobra' and you will see what I mean. In fact, this show has very subtle humor that says a lot, both for a show that aired adult swimming and for a show about a walking ass. <br /> <br /> All the standard genre clich√©s are in place, made movies like Dirt Harry and Cobra so big and mature for parody. Sanchez is Assy's partner, who - as per. The genre - stands tall and always apologizes for his partner's homosexual behavior. The police chief is, of course, a breathable hard case that lives to scream "I want your badge on my desk first thing tomorrow morning!" The over-the-top, and sometimes utterly obscene way in which the 1980's Renegade Cop movie is parodyed, fits well with the subject. For example, one of the criminals, while breaking up with a bus robber, stops asking Assy: "Hey, where are you going, asshole?" To which the title character beats from the one line: "I go ... to shoot you." <br /> <br /> Recommended for anyone who loves 80s action movies and has actually seen plenty of them to understand humor.
