This movie is on my top 20 comedy list. This is a truly unique movie. To the reviewer who said "I really need something." - You're right. You're missing something. If you don't have that kind of sense of humor, this movie requires, it's a thing. But don't give it a bad review because you think it's "looney", but it's not supposed to be. Loony is a suitable description of both what it intends to be and what it succeeds. I laughed very often and much more intensely at this movie than I do on most other funny movies. Michael Almereyda brought out the best in his cast in this, his first major movie, which he was nominated for an independent spirit prize for best first function. Crispin Glover, as usual, is absolutely brilliant in a completely inexplicable way, and some of his very funniest lines were ever said in this movie. Glover is clearly the best cartoonist working right now. Harry Dean Stanton puts an excellent comic performance. William Burroughs is amazing in a small role. Dylan McDermott was ideal cast, and Lois Chiles is absolutely outstanding. All of the above are quite fun in their own perfect way, but this is one of Crispins finest performances - up there with its ripples and Willard performances. If you're a Crispin Glover fan, but somehow overlooked this movie, stop what you're doing and watch it immediately. <br /> <br /> But remember to relax first and maybe have a beer or something. This is a great movie, but it is very unusual and I recommend being in or inducing an appropriate stupid state of mind before you see it.
