I thoroughly enjoyed it for television movies. I was channel surfing and came across the start of the movie. Boy am I glad I stopped. This movie has a really hot cast as well as a semi-credible plot. There is drama, comedy, action and best of all, the human nature aspect of this movie is what makes it good. I hope it comes out on Video because I want to buy a copy. Rating ... 9 out of 10 stars
