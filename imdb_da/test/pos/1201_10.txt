I'm not a big musical fan, but this is one of the few I really love. Unlike many other musicals, such as "The Sound of Music", none of the songs is about free stuff. Each song is social commentary, sharpness about war, sexuality, recalcitrance, spirituality and freedom. Particularly amazing songs are "Easy to Be Hard", "Aquarius Age", "Hair", "Flesh Failures / 3-5-0-0", "Walking In Space" and "Hare Krishna." Completely revolutionary and wonderful. I can't wait a day to see it live!
