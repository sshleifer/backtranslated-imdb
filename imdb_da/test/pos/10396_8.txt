This is a special movie if you know the context. Antonioni, in his eighties, had been paralyzed by a stroke. Mute and half paralyzed, his friends - who are by the way the best movie world - have arranged for him to "correct" a last important movie. The idea is that he can tell a story about being just looking at it. So we have a movie: About a director who tells stories by simple observation. And the question of the (four) stories is about how the visual imagination defines love. <br /> <br /> The film emerges by giving us the tools to bring it into our own fantasy. The result is pure movie world: every person (except the director) is lovely in aspect or movement. Some of these women are ultra-quiet, and they exist in a dreamy misty world of sensual encounter. There is no shade, no suggestion that something exists, but what we see; no desire is at work other than what we create. <br /> <br /> I know of no other movie that so effectively manipulates our own visual longing to make us create the world we see. He understands something about not touching. No one understands Van Morrison visually as he does. Morrison's Celtic space music is based on the very same concept: the sensual touch involving, but not physical, touch. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's red-wife wife seems to be appropriate as a store keeper and she also leads a lack of production of movies on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Ted's Evaluation - 3 out of 4: Worth seeing.
