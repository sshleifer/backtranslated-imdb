I watched this movie last night at a "pre-code" film festival, and I must tell you that when Gary Cooper turned his head to his initial close-up, the entire audience jumped. He was just so beautiful. <br /> <br /> Cooper looks aside, this movie shows Rouben Mamoulian's directorial artistry to perfection. Wonderful stage fades, creative camera angles, symbolic allusions - Mamoulian continues to explore the director's media and come up with innovation. <br /> <br /> This was Sylvia Sidney's first role in Hollywood after her success on the New York scene, and she's as lovely as a Gary Cooper's leading lady should be. It is great to see her in a role with a harder edge than many she got - so often she seems to be afraid that she will be hit by someone. <br /> <br /> There are many well-known faces in this movie, including the wonderful Wynne Gibson. Most striking is Guy Kibbee, best known for playing poor rich men as a laughing and mendacious hitman. <br /> <br /> There are hardly enough of these pre-code movies available on VHS or DVD, so if you can't find a pre-code festival near you, try Turner Classic Movies campaign for a broadcast! As for the reviewer who believes that Gary Cooper was too stupid to have dialogue more complex than "Yep" or "Nope," he might consider Coop's performance in films such as "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" or "Meet John Die". Even though heaven knows someone who looked, it should not be smart either.
