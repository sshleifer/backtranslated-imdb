Typical Spanish production - slowly moving, but with great sensitivity and sexuality oozes from the lead actress Paz Vega. (See her in "Spanglish"). Big set, lots of color - you will see Cordoba, Seville, Spanish mountains and countryside. The plot tends to meander here and there, but if you follow closely (I managed even though the film is in Spanish), you get the core of it. <br /> <br /> It's about how very very sensual young gypsy woman, Carmen, uses her feminine wiles to seduce men to make her bidding. Carmen is taken to prison after attacking a co-cigar at the cigar factory where she works. She persuades Jose, the soldier responsible for taking her in prison to let her escape. Jose offers her charm because she speaks Basque (he is Navarrese and speaks the same language). Jose is punished by 1 month in prison and demoted to foot soldier. He later meets Carmen at a party, and they end up being lovers. But Carmen refuses to commit to him and continues her lively and flirtatious lifestyle. In a jealous rage, Jose kills a soldier who has been to Carmen. They then have to leave town. Life on the move makes Jose a bandit. Carmen is meanwhile the same, a wildly promiscuous woman. Eventually Jose loses her mind and ends up killing Carmen. The story is told by Jose in the prison and is awaiting execution. The person he tells the story is Prospero Merrime, a French writer and anthropologist whose fancy watch (that plays Beethoven's Fur Elise) was stolen by either Carmen or Jose. Worth looking at the sets and for the lovely Paz Vega.
