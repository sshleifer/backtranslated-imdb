If you were ever a fan of MTV's "state", then these three guys will be familiar with you, but even if you only stumble over them over the internet as I did, you'll soon appreciate their unique brand comedy. <br /> <br /> Born out of their stand up comedy trio, "Stella", Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter and David Wain produced these amazing vignettes of surreal comedy for viewing on their shows and now being available only for To download from two websites, they appear in pristine glory on a DVD. <br /> <br /> Think comedy sketch shows sense censorship and you will be half way there. No stone of decency remains unchanged. But for those who can like their comedy rude, self-reliant and bordering to puerile, (and I mean this in the most flattering way) this is the DVD for you! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth the money for the comment from the two Michaels and David alone, you can't help but like them, d e explains their actions, shrink in their own confusion with eg toys and by beating each other on their backs and blurring abuses. <br /> <br /> Fantastic. <br /> <br /> It must say something to Stella's appeal that Julie Bowen and Paul Rudd are willing to take in the action so fearlessly. And you should follow their fine example, throwing prescriptions to the wind and preparing to laugh yourself sick.
