What do you get when you have a persistent, spicy French police inspector named Maurice Martineau called to solve a murder? Well, simply a very entertaining, fun movie. The re-mastered black-and-white movie "Quai des Orfevres" delivers the goods in spite of romance, jealousy and marriage, which apparently just come in the way of the truth about "who did it?" <br /> <br /> Empty by inch, technique of technology spiced by experience and intuition, the patience of this master inspector enters the truth - but of course, using a bag full of dirty police officers tricks. <br /> <br /> Martineau is the centerpiece of this movie. The use of director Henri-Georges Clouzot's raucous background music to intensify the drama of grand film noir style is a wonderful wrapper around the visual experience. Martineau eventually solves the mystery and arrests the culprit. Hi, he is good !! But unfortunately Martineau can also keep a dark secret in his past. Who is the boy who may not be his son? <br /> <br /> Some things can never be solved - even though the final credits.
