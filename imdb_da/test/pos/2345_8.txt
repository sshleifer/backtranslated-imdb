One Life Stand is a well-established piece of film making that has not got the credit it deserves. Its 1.7-inch IMDB rating does not do justice and is perhaps due to the very few screenings it has had instead of the quality of the film itself. Shot on digital in black and white, the film is well geared to production values ​​that believed its brilliant budget. The performances are excellent, especially Gary Lewis, who gets better with each role. My only criticism is that it is a little on the long side and could have done with a touch of more humor to compensate for the darker moments. Overall, however, it is a good job.
