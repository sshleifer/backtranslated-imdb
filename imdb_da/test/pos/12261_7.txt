From producer / writer / Golden Globe nominee director James L. Brooks it is a really good satirical comedy film that shows behind the scene in a news reporter / anchor / journalist or producer's life. Be like. Basic Jane Craig (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Holly Hunter) falls for new reporter Tom Grunick (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated William Hurt), but correspondent Aaron Altman (Oscar nominated Albert Brooks) also has strong feelings for her. The network is preparing for major changes, and sparks will fly with all members of the studio. Also starring Jack Nicholson who anchor Bill Rorich, Moonraker Lois Chiles like Jennifer Mack, Mrs. Doubtfire's Robert Prosky like Ernie Merriman, School of Rocks Joan Cusack like Blair Litton, Peter Hackes as Paul Moore, Christian Clemenson as Bobby, Robert Katims as Martin Moor, Ed Wheeler as George Wein and Stephen Mendillo as Gerald Grunick. The comedy is subtle but strong, the romance has its moments, and it is certainly a credible movie. It was nominated Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Movie Editing, Best Writing, Play Written Directly to the Screen and Best Picture, and it was nominated Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy / Musical and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture. It was number 64 in 100 years, 100 laughs. Very good!
