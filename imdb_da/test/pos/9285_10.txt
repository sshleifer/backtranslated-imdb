This program is definitely my favorite non-sitcom television comedy. Australia produces very small good programs - most of the TV I see (and I live in Australia) is from the US and England. The funniest part of this show is just as controversial it is. Like when they passed numerous security barriers at the APEC Summit, pretending to be Canadian diplomats. <br /> <br /> The show consists of pre-filmed stunts, general satirical discussion of current world events, and sometimes on stage sketches. These all come together to make a fantastic, extremely fun TV show. The segments like "Ad Road Test" and "Message from Osama bin Laden" are fun. For anyone interested in watching hilarious satirical TV comedy - it's definitely the show you should see. <br /> <br /> All the guys are amazing and do an excellent job of entertaining you for half an hour. <br /> <br /> I would rate it 10/10.
