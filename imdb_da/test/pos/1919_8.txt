This is an excellent documentary about a story I hadn't heard of before. The first solo, non-stop sailing race around the world took place in 1968-69 and involved a handful of racers. It is a truly fascinating story about man vs nature and man vs himself. The story focuses on Donald Crowhurst, the tragic figure in this story. The film combines elegant interviews with recordings shot by the sailors themselves aboard their boats. The story is very exciting and sad as we learn the details of Donald Crowhurst's story. This is one of the best documentaries from the last few years. It has true human feelings in it as the men face this almost impossible task of navigating the world out of their own expense.
