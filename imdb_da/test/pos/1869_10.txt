I was a big fan of this series. Yesterday I saw it again on DVD. I was worried about laughter coming or not? But in a few episodes I laughed hysterically and some episodes were good. The real wise Rakesh Bedi (Raja} & Satish Shah are brilliant, while Swaroop Sampat is pretty bad, but I think she gets the job done. Maybe a better actress could have been used instead of her. good, pure comedy is. <br /> <br /> If this series were to be aired this year, I would have given it 9/10 and to believe that this series is almost 25 years old and its comedy is still good I give it 10/10. I would highly recommend this series to watch DVD.
