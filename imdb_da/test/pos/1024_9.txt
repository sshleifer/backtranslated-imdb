Aftermath England, the beginning of the "atomic age". Nevertheless, the concerns of a young schoolgirl who longs to experience her first "kiss" cannot be traced by something that does not mean the BOMB. This was a lovely, if not educational, look at young love from a youth's male and his world of the 1940s world. Without political correctness and preaching messages, this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind (and <br /> <br /> hormones) of a young teen can create. Wonderful subplots <br /> <br /> maintain character interest ala "Gregory's Girl" and lots of well-blocked shots help keep the pictures in this era. This is a very good story for anyone, young or old, who has ever been in love or ever wanted to be. Does he ever get his wish? See it and see.
