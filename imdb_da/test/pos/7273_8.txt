** HOW TO PLAYERS ** <br /> <br /> Recap: Macleane (Miller) testifies to a Plunkett (Carlyle) robbery that goes wrong. Plunkett's partner is shot (and killed), but not before, after he has extinguished a large ruby. Plunkett and Macleane then meet at the cemetery when both try to get the ruby. Unfortunately, they are caught as burial birds and sent to prison, but not before Plunkett has extinguished the ruby. Ruby is their key to freedom, and when they are free, they form a partnership in robbery. Macleane is to be like a gentleman and find out who is worth stealing, and they just rob him (and rob them in style). But Macleane falls in love with Santa / daughter (?) Of their first victim, Lady Rebecca Gibson (Tyler). And a Mr Chance is out to catch them, and his methods are not so nice ... Comments: A good act tasted of comedy and adventure. Carlyle and Miller make a good team, with a lot of friction and friendship. And then there is the relationship between Macleane and Rebecca Gibson. The scene with the ball is very good, especially the (anachronistic) use of the music. In addition to these interesting characters, Cumming plays the best of them all, Lord Rochester. Both the character and the play are stellar and among the best in the film. In all, the film works very well, a good balance between history and special effects, action and comedy. Very entertaining. <br /> <br /> 8/10
