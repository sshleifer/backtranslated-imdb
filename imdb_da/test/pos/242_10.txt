I really like this movie because of all the stars and the dance and the story that comes with it. Rita Hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were beautiful. Though a musical, I thought, Rita Hayworth made a good performance of dramatic performance in this movie too. As far as her dance is concerned, I think she was excellent. Even Betty Grable really supported Rita's dance in this movie when she commented that Rita danced around her own dance and let's see it, Betty Grable was an excellent dancer. The cinematography and the vivid colors are also seen. Rita wants to be a girlfriend for a magazine, but she is also in love with her mentor, played by Gene Kelly. Will she leave Kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass the love and Broadway star or will she stay around to find the unique gem that will change her life forever? You have to watch the movie to find out!
