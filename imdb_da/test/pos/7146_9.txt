This movie was recommended to me by the same person who blessed me with a copy of The Chronicles of Narnia. Shadowlands is one of the most amazing screenshots ever written. It is well done, acted and corrected. The kinematics are a little dark for my taste, but I'm sure it was supposed to be that way. The play is like poetry in parts of the film, through the film I found myself taking a break to reflect on the comments that were just made on the screen. This is a wonderful piece of cinema and I can only hope that more people will run across it and add reviews. Fair warning though, this was a 6 tissue movie for me. Very touching. Very cordial performance.
