It's also the best book I've ever read. Karl Urban and Steve Zahn are good together. It had drama, adventure and sweetness and sadness. I laughed. I cried. It's hard not to laugh when Gus speaks. I wish Gus would have beaten Clara as he did Inez. Clara only leads Gus in all the years without intentions of getting married to him. She just liked to play with him. It was sad that he spent her whole life for her. It would have been nice if Woodrow was married to Maggie, but she would still be dead on him. Woodrow was a man who could not express his feelings and keep them bottled. It was obvious that he loved Maggie after the raid on Austin when rangers came back and he ran to keep her. Val Kilmer is great for playing odd characters. I loved his portrayal of Captian Inish Skull. I loved the entire Lonesome Dove saga. Comanche Moon is the best of the pile.
