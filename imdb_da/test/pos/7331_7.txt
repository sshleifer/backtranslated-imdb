Flipper is a lovely heartwarming movie for the whole family. Of course, it's not a good movie, Free Willy looks much better in every aspect of film making. Perhaps it will sometimes be a bit naive, and the script and script are not the best part of the movie, but it is an entertaining movie with very good filmography (including underwater images) and some important moral messages. Elijah Wood once again proves to be an incredibly talented and underrated actor. He can make bad movies that can be seen, okay movies - good, good - great and good movie becomes completely classic. The Paul Hogan performance was also very good and he is perfectly suited to his role. As I have already said above, entire cinematography was very good. But underwater shoots are definitely the best parts. So Flipper is a perfect way to watch nice, sweet and entertaining movies. If you like me, you get sick and tired of the modern Hollywood waste, filled with sex, violence, vulgarity, and beauty you most likely want this movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7.7 out of 10.
