I think it's one of the best Tamil movies I've seen for a while. I love the fact that it's not a guy and a girl who falls in love, and they made the movie brilliant. The cast did a good job and I especially congratulate the girl. She was brilliant and really brought the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother. Best of all is the songs, beautiful music and moving lyrics. There are some good songs in this feature ya'll! especially 'Kannathil Mutthamittal' and 'Velai Pookal'. Great songs, both. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good scream and some great plays (and amazing songs!). Bowl Simran.
