Man-and-wife doctor teams Carole and Niles Nelson do modestly in their careers, but Niles has a gaming problem. His luck succeeds as he (unconsciously) saves the life of a gangster from Joe Gurney's mob and gets a big bonus from the gangster himself. Niles continues to receive payments to patch other injured gang members in love for their change (and snazzy new opportunity). Unfortunately, his shady offerings come to light in a police attack, which also hangs a shadow over his wife's career. <br /> <br /> At this point, the plot has come into focus as Carole Nelson will save his career before her license is suspended. This involves bringing the bond to justice more or less singularly. <br /> <br /> This is not a hard-edged gangster image, but a plot that could have been comfortable on a show like MATLOCK or MURDER SHE WROTE. There is excitement, but the mood is kept clear by Bogart's heavy-in-cheek performance by a stupid gangster who imagines himself as "Crime Napoleon". His other gang members also work more like stooges than hoodlums. And there is some talk dialogue between Bogart and Francis, especially when she deals with his injuries at his hiding place. Of course, as in all gangster flicks, there is a great shootout ending, but with a humorous twist. This is a good short film showing Bogart on his rise to the star.
