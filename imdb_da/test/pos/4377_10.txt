It can be a stretch that says this as a die-hard Carlin fan, but the material, written and done, in It's Bad for Ya is yet another of the best late-era material. At 70, Carlin returns from the level of despair (and some of the stumbling blocks in the action) from Life is worth losing to a specially structured, but loose and playful special - or as much as the "old f ***" can get - and is uninterrupted, fun. And fun as reminiscent of what some of us were wearing when we looked at Back in Town or 'Diseased' the first time. The material, although at times resembling a bit of what has been done previously (ie the whole piece of children in school and camp like the Children's segment in Diseased), is always fresh and with such truth to everything it scares the mind while looking at it funny bone. <br /> <br /> Going away from the death sentence (how long should you wait to scrape a name from the book? six weeks unless if on the computer planner) facets of communication, looking down from the sky, stains of God (of course), children and just cumbersome movements involving hats in religion, and if people really have "rights" make up the bulk of the special, centered on the premise that what is bad for you, simple and simple, is BS. In all, complete BS, which as we also learn (or if you have really learned it, you as the child waiting in the street corner for a week after it is not randomly random by the parents) keep the country together. Carlin is not necessarily angry, although beauty seems to radiate in most laps, even just to observe how terrible children's teeth enter. It's skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything won't be "fine". What it comes to is this: Carlin is that dirty, witty, cautious stand-up comedy what Yoda is to Jedi everywhere, which is a small spark of hope through crystal clear wisdom in a world where it is pretty wrong to get anything. At least we get classic GC - outrageous lines and bits from the human 13th (or the 14th) comedy special, including as regards an eyebrow elevation observation on people playing Mozart music during birth!
