Although I am not the golf fan, I participated in a sneak preview of this movie and absolutely loved it. The historical settings, the obvious class celebrities, and the good and the evil on both sides of the dividing line kept my attention throughout. The actors and their characterizations were all fascinating. And I was on the edge of my seat under the golf segments, which were not only dramatic and exciting, but easy to follow. At the end of this movie, "Seabiscuit" came to mind, though "The Greatest Game Ever Played" is far less complex than a movie. In both cases, the fact that the events really happened was elaborated.
