Maybe I read into this too much, but I wonder how much a hand Hongsheng had in the development of the film. I mean, when a story is told to throw the protagonist like himself, I would think he would be a heavy hand in writing, documentation, etc., and that would make it a bit tense. <br /> <br /> But. His family and friends have also had a hand in getting the actual details of Hongsheng's life. I think the best view would have been told by Hongsheng's family and friends perspectives. They saw their transformation and were not so confused about drugs that they remember everything. <br /> <br /> As for Hongsheng being full of himself, the consistency of Jesus Christ means that he acts as a martyr who sacrificed his life (of course he is still alive as he was cast as himself ) for his family's happiness. Huh? The viewer sees him at his lowest point while still maintaining a superiority complex. He is lying on the grass coming down from (under?) A tall of himself and with his father he is considering life and has visions of dragons in the window, he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle while stretching his arms later. <br /> <br /> It is fabulous that he is away from drugs now, but he is no hero. He went from a peak in his career to acting at his most vulnerable point while on drugs to get back somewhere in the middle. <br /> <br /> This same device is used in Ted Demmes' "Blow", where audiences begin with the protagonist who appears as a flawless hero. <br /> <br /> But "Quitting" ("Zuotian") is a recommended movie, mostly for its joking soundtrack, great plays and landscapes. But the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we suppose to be Jia Hongsheng's house is actually a stage setting for a game. It makes the viewer feel that Hongsheng's life was just a game that was told in many difficult parts.
