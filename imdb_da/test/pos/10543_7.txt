Perhaps the best movie ever made by director Kevin Tenney (well, his Witchboard is not on top of my all-time horror list), this is a strange, fascinating mix between Pin and Child's Play, both better than this, but not so better. Of course, the plot is designed and perhaps foreseeable, but the actors are good, Rosalind Allen is very pleasant to the eye (and it's Candance McKenzie - God bless her to the shower!), The actress is very good at interpreting the disturbed daughter and Pinocchio puppet is scary enough to give you a few tensions down your back. For a B movie not at all bad.
