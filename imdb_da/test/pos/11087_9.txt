this movement was exciting and absorbing; The story, however, was a bit choppy and difficult to follow at times. Although the two main actors did a good job, so only Senn Penn worked with each fiber of his being and stealing each frame, made this a very memorable movie. Later movies have revealed him to be a not only one-role actor: he also showed comic flair in Sweet and Lowdown. Surprisingly talented and not the light I used to believe he was.
