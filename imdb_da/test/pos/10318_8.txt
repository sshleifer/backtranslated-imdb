A Three Stooges card, this one with Shemp. Of all those who involve Shemp I've seen, this is my favorite performance of him in a Stooges card. The basic plot is that Shemp must marry at six o'clock in the evening if he is to inherit half a million dollars a great uncle left him in his will. So Shemp sets out to make a break, but finds it a harder way than expected, that is, until they learn about his inheritance. Best bits here involve Shemp shaving, Shemp and Moe in a phone box and Larry on the piano as an accompaniment to Shemp's voice-training session. Also, the sequence in which Shemp fails as cousin Basil and its result turns out to be fun.
