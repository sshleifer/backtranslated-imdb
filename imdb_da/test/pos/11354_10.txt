In the 60s in Hong Kong, a man and woman move on the same day to neighboring apartments with their respective spouses. Soon they suspect their eternally absent spouses of having an affair with each other. A strange bond emerges between man and woman as they cope with their sadness by turning each other to play each other's spouse before a more complex bond emerges ... <br /> <br /> No summary can do it justice, for Hong Kong author Wong Kar-Wai's "In the Mood for Love" is nothing short of a miracle. A story of grief that manages to touch and sometimes fun. A romance that never feels forced or false. There is no doubt that the instructor's method has much to do with it. <br /> <br /> Directed from an unintentional manuscript (although the concept largely flows from a Japanese novel) in favor of improvisation, the film is immediately separated by the freshness of its performances. All the film is about it, and the rest is pure improvement. The core of the film is two characters that will ease into your heart and stay there long after the end of the credits: Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are simply amazing, and no language barriers undermine a single fragment of immediacy and truth they show. The extra material is also top-notch: the movies are magnificent to see (partially lined by "Hero" s Christopher Doyle) and the music is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> This is something everyone should see if only because it is by far the most heartfelt, mature and authentic "love story" out there. Unmissable.
