An inspired choice of director of this latest Brit-Flick, Rose Troche, who burst on stage with the budget-free tale of NY Dykes, _Go Fish_ brings a cautious jazz perception to this tale of a Londoner choosing the slightly inappropriate environment of a male binding society to declare their desire for a sister's seeking male truths. The highlight for me is a scene where society tries to return to being primitive hunter-gatherers, but ends up ordering a take-away. The movie as a whole is wonderfully acted, and Troche, who would never be accepted by some of the lesbians she portrayed in her previous movie, enjoys the bigger budget by indulging in some wonderfully lingering panoramic images that contrast with the _Go Fish's grainy hyperkinesis. A really fun movie
