This is a movie to be seen and treated as a work of art. This is an ignorant love of the Schrader brothers about the life of Yukio Mishima, who is full of real artistic elements. The film jumps from color to black and white, previously present, fictional works by Mishima to him. Everything without being confusing at least. The only thing that causes me is that the whole movie, with the exception of the narrator's spoken parts, is in Japanese. Still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but has not found the winner. Criterion, if you read this, this is a movie to be published under your imprint with as many extras as possible. This movie truley deserves more. 10.10
