Another of the endless amounts of cookie-cutter 'Kickboxers Fight for Death for the Amusement of Rich Scumbags' film that so many of the 90s ... Y'know, those created by taking the word 'Death' 'Blood' and 'Steel' and the words 'Ring', 'Fight', 'Match' and 'Cage' and put them in a random generator! To say that Death Match is a pretty good entry into the over-used genre thanks to its exciting battle scenes and the surprisingly good play of its kickboxer cast. The story relates to two friends - ex-Kickboxing World Champion John Larson (played by pug-faced Middleweight Kickboxing Champ Ian Jacklin, probably formerly best known for his terrible performance as the biggest villain in the Ring of Fire 2) and Nick Wallace (Nick Hill, a looks like guy who is probably best known for the street fighter's role Sergio in Bloodsport 2) who works the LA docks who read boxes on ships. One discovery of a boxful of weapons and a short fight later, are our two heroic jobless and propping up a L.A. bar. Sensible John Larson decides to head north and seek job headstrong nick wallace has heard of a guy paying good money for fighters to fight in private kickboxing matches. "Why should things change?" says John, "If you need me, I'll be there." Predictably, it is not long before Nick has missed out, and his good friend fights in the lethal 'death' attempt to find a lead for his missing mate. <br /> <br /> Sure enough, there are probably no prices for originality here, but as I said before, this film strength lies in its action, its caste of real life fighters and the pretty good performances that it can twist them. Ian Jacklin especially surprised me. Previously, I had just seen him as the bad guy in the Ring of Fire 2 and in bit parts in tripe like The Steel Ring, and I have always been very amused at how bad an actor he is (good fighting himself!). But in Death Match he is pretty good! Given a decent manuscript and a haircut, he turns out to be the charismatic leading man! And his friendship with Nick is very well portrayed. Jacklin and Hill have a good chemistry and you really believe that these two characters care about each other. Enough for one of them to lose a job, travel halfway across the country and risk death to save the other - I wish I had a friend like that! <br /> <br /> It was also nice to see Matthias Hues as a villain henchman with a little depth than we are used to seeing from his many 'rogue hands' roles. But don't be fooled into thinking he's the star just because he's on the videotape (with it seems that his head is stuck on Michael Bernardo's body from Shootfighter's cover) - he's good while he's on the screen, but He is not much. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, the movie is rather slow when it does not struggle with lots of unnecessary scenes (what about gangster Jimmie Fiorello's pointless story of his grandfather ??) and the end fight is disappointingly short, but on it all i enjoyed it! Lots of fighting, most of them good. Isn't that all we really need martial arts? And of course the eye-like, here in the lovely form of the very beautiful Renee Ammann. All in all, a pretty entertaining kickboxing movie.
