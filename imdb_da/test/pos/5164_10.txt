Swedish filmmaker Roy Andersson's latest film You, the Living is not easy to review. One of the reasons is that in his own words he has broken the Anglo-Saxon tradition of narrative narration, essentially the template of most western film productions. Another reason may be that, although Roy Andersson is somewhat heavy on symbolism, his, unlike those who say Andrei Tarkovsky, is of a more elusive nature. It took him 3 years to complete this 86-minute movie, and it wasn't because he was forced to have long breaks between shootings due to financial problems or problems with the actors. The movie consists of 57 vignettes shot mainly by a still camera, and that was the careful design of each of these scenes, which required a lot of time. The picture of this film, which is closely linked to the director's former film Songs from The Second Floor, is of paramount importance to history. Therefore, this story is told to a great extent by the surroundings and the environment in which Andersson's universe resides and interacts. Before each scene was finally shot, there would have been no less than 10 different test shoots with different actors, colors, dialogue, etc. The result is a dreamlike version of the surrounding world that most of us would recognize and if the setting is like one dream why not dream a little? As in Bunuel's Bourgeoisis Discrete Charm, when someone says "Last night I had a dream," you'll see it. But then again, what is perceived as reality here is not very different from the dreams. Despite the fact that the film lacks a plot in the traditional sense of the word, and there are no main characters, thus, the various characters that appear and appear in different scenes still face each other, and their stories are inevitably intertwined. What most of these signs have in common is their apparent loneliness despite being surrounded by other people. The trailer's trash chain smoking and binge drinking woman who dreams of having a motorcycle so she can get away from "all this crap", her corpulent and mostly silent girlfriend and his frail and seemingly gentle but vanishing mother, members of a brass band, whose skill-enhancing efforts at home do not receive a positive reception from either their families or their neighbors, the depressed Middle Eastern hairdresser and his arrogant customer heading to "a very important business meeting", an elderly man with a nightmare on bombers in the sky, a young man girl who dreams of marrying the young rock star that she is so crazy in love with. It is about dreams and nightmares against reality, but it seems as much as a statement in support of Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein claims that "all human communication is misunderstanding". People are talking to each other, but it is as if they are talking past each other. They try to reach out to the others, but close the others out when they try to reach them. <br /> <br /> You, Living is a poetic movie that is physically seen in Stockholm, yet universally applicable. The society it portrays is Sweden, its artistic language and the people shown are generally unmistakably Nordic. But the subject it deals with, namely the misery of humanity in a selfish world, extends far beyond this hemisphere. Despite the theme's seriousness, the film sees itself much more cheerful and loaded with humor than you might have expected. But in the director's words, "living" is so complicated for each of us that the only thing that saves us is our sense of humor. "Therefore, this movie is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy, depending on your sensitivities, and not a depressing black reality tournament of human nature, it is unusual in its language and structure, but if you can think outside the box and enjoy it, you will surely find this movie entertaining and meaningful at the same time.
