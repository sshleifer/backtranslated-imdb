Jean-Pierre Melvil's Le Cercle Rouge follows two criminals' lives: Vogel (Gian Maria Volontè), a murderer who lets the police slip while being transferred from one city to another by train; and Corey (Allain Delon), a thief just released from prison. Fate decides to join these two men to pull out a spectacular hoist. In the background there is Matei (André Bourvil), detective Vogel escapes from, irreconcilable in his persecution and sometimes ruthless in his methods. Next to the film, the viewer meets other smaller but fascinating characters, the best of which is Jansen (Yves Montand), a spoiled ex-cop and an excellent marker. <br /> <br /> Melville has such a unique style you don't need to see many of his films catch. Le Samourai, Un Flic and Le Cercle Rouge are clearly made of the same cloth: the symmetrical angles; the long shots; silence; coats and hats and cigars; the quotes at the beginning; the fantastic hoists, fatalism; the harmless and sincere criminal life. Everything that is good in Melville is here in top form. And his shortcomings did not disturb me so much this time: the illogical, confusing behavior of his characters and confusing storytelling, which made my enjoyment of his other films almost invisible here. When Le Cercle Rouge preceded Un Flic, it did not mean that he improved with time; Maybe I just get used to it and get a mindset where it doesn't bother me anymore. <br /> <br /> Melville made unique crime movies. As old as they may be, they show more ingenuity, realism and grace than the modern techno-thrillers, where cool thieves use computer systems and James Bond esquire gadgets to pull off impossible crimes. Melville's criminals are not tough: they are lonely, socially awkward and probably aware that they are not good at much more than planning heists. They are unwanted in society and live tonight, always one step ahead of the police in a game they know they lose at last. There is nothing romantic about them. <br /> <br /> Amazingly, for a movie of this type, the pads are not complete idiots. Matei is smart, capricious, patient and even compassionate. He's not an unbearable villain or cliché, he's just an old man doing his job and doing it right. He knows when to use force and when to use brains. Many movies could learn from him. <br /> <br /> It is this earthly, uromantic style that makes Melville's movies so happy to see and put on a special pedestal as one of the movie's major crimes.
