Look ... I've come to expect this level to act from William Macy ... the guy just keeps putting tremendous beliefs ... but the meat LOAF? Right then, his Loafness decided to leave Jim Steinman behind and throw his particular lower weight around Stanislavsky's wonderful world? Well ... what can I say? I am duly impressed. To paraphrase an old proverb: "It's not the flesh, it's the emotions" ... and the Loafen moves up on his late-night plays. Good work at costumes and hair divisions ... David Paymer is typecast but right on the money. Solid camera works throughout the girl. The baseline is reminiscent of "Gentleman's Agreement" (post-WWII anti-Semitism). Worth to be your time ... especially for the growing legions of Bill Macy acolytes. <br /> <br />
