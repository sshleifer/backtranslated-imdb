Okay, so I love Aidan Quinn's acting even with a bad script. This is not the case in the task. As other viewers have said, it was a movie I stumbled upon cable and got it into it, I didn't want it to end. Take a Cuban American Navy Blue Ofc. (Quinn), an upright, upright soldier and family. Add a crazed agent (Donald Sutherland) looking for the world's most notorious terrorist and add a Ben Kingsley and you have "The Assignment". Sutherland is a witness to the most notorious terrorist Carlos actions in a cafe on a wonderful day where he is so deeply shaken by this evil that his only reason to live is to get this man as long as he breathes. <br /> <br /> Take a soldier on a passport in Israel, a dead call to this man and beat and held by Kingsley until they realize they have a plan. By assuming Carlos by being him or being responsible for never helping get rid of the world of the world, he creates a very heavy duty and guilty journey. By not helping his country, he is bound as a man and his military duty to choose wisely. So the training begins. Let's say Carlos training is right up there with the Academy of Arts and the Holocaust. When I say this intense and wonderful throw, scripted and executed movie rates are best, I don't understating it. All three actors could save almost any script. Together, it is a movie that is seen from frame 1 to credits. I'm not into terrorism or movie about it, but I was hooked! Bravo again to Aidan Quinn, who for one time plays a heavy that could hold onto any actor, including Gary Oldman. It's a compliment. Rent it and get lots of popcorn. Oh do I mention the sex ?? It seems better than "Last Tango!" And its educational.
