The largest crowd ever to see a breakaway event in the United States took place in Wrestlemania 6. Over 93,000 people appeared to break the Rolling Stone's indoor record, and this event did not disappoint at all. Perhaps the biggest match ever took place when Immortal Hulk defended his world title against Ultimate Warrior. There are over 12 games in total so you get plenty of action
