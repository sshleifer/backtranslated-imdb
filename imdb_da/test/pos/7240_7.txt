What is often overlooked in Agatha Christie's stories is her progressive, anti-conservative stance on a number of issues - from the role of women to the effects of the tradition of people's belief in the supernatural. In "Nemesis" you can see many of these subtitles - but you can also find a good old-fashioned exciting mystery that keeps you in the dark for most of the length. Likewise, "Nemesis" promises other serial entries ("They do it with mirrors", "4:50 from Paddington", etc.) Is the fact that in the crucial moments before and after the revelation of the killer you can actually feel the excitement. And finally, Jane Booker is welcome to protect my body at any time. (***)
