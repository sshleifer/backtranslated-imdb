"Witchery" is a decent little Euro-Trash horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is quite a wonderful fun in this and unfortunately he is one of the better actors. Linda Blair is actually horrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife ... she's hilarious! The plot of this movie is also ridiculous. It has some holes that you can't help but notice, but it remains entertaining throughout. <br /> <br /> Gore in "Witchery" is freaking outstanding. I loved the part where the old bag is "sucked" into the trash and ends up in the chimney to roast! And the part where the lady "is being exploited by" by the devil was pretty damn disruptive. I would say this is a must for gorehounds. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an overproduced, well-functioning flick, look elsewhere. But if you like old-fashioned Italian sleaze and above the top gore, "Witchery" belongs to your shelf. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised at the low rating here! What did you expect, "The Exorcist?" 7 out of 10 children.
