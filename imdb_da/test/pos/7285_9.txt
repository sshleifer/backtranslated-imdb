I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was. Whether you're a gore fan or a suspense fan; You will love this. I didn't like scary movies, considered them stupid. But at least it happens that I make exceptions. I find something really extraordinary in this movie. Rarely have I ever seen a movie that has scared the crap out of me, but I tell you the truth that this movie made me shake my neck. Unlike most horror films, this is about the development of the characters. I highly recommend this movie, and I'm happy that Asyl finally comes with good horror movies these days. <br /> <br /> I recommend! Enjoy!
