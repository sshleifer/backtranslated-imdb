This Don Siegel / Clint Eastwood strange and hypnotic drama was left out of the way in 1971 and what a shame. A fascinating character study with some amazing women to squint to handle. Geraldine Page was one of our highest actresses and she is completely cast. Young Jo Ann Harris is a flirty minx, and Elizabeth Hartman (who died too young) is unimaginably repressed. <br /> <br /> A 7 out of 10. Best performance = C. Eastwood. Published the same year as DIRTY HARRY, it did nothing, besides getting some good reviews. Search this out unless you are only in "Explosion" movies. Very subtle and scary, this piece will stick to you.
