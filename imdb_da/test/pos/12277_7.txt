You must love the spaghetti western universe. The view of a west, where good guys are shot, flashes without warning, the cartoons crouching nature in extreme close-ups, and anti-hero goes away from the girl at last. Many call Corbucci's film 'depressing'. I find it a little risky as far as descriptions go. I think gloomy and unforgiving are more likely to be mostly because "depressing" suggests a level of sentimentality, almost every Eurowestern director is ignored to paint broadly. <br /> <br /> GLI SPECIALISTI must be seen throughout its widescreen glory before it can take its place in the Sergio Corbucci cannon. It's a beautiful movie. And it makes sense that Corbucci wanted to blow some steam with COMPANEROS after the incessant two strokes of the GREAT SILENCE and this (though he would later return to his usual tricks with the foulmouthed SONNY AND JED). There is still some amount of caricature that detracts from the overall horror of the movie. Imo it hurts more than anything good to have an unnecessary recording of three children dressed as hippies shoving around the city in search of gold and trouble. And it hurts to get Mario Adorf to play the Mexican one-piece bandit El Diablo as over the top as he always plays his characters. The smaller grips aside are more than enough here to wet the gift of spaghetti aficionado. Shootouts galore reduce the population of a whole city to crawl the nude in the dirt, the typical iconic badness of the laconic antihero (played by Johnny Halliday), the moral bankruptcy of almost all characters in the movie. Corbucci can never receive recognition from the more famous Sergio or the US patriarchs of the genre, but you and I know it's a gross injustice to a very talented director. His dynamic shot selection, in-depth with objects standing close to the camera and back in the background, his flair for rapid pacing and feverish energy by moving a story that was not always everything, the way he photographs open space, all In his work I do I was sure that if Corbucci was American and had appeared 15 years later with Mann and Hawks, Cahiers du Cinema critics would have promised him as an author who was serious critical consideration.
