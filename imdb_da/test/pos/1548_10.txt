Ken Loach showed the world the downward flip side of Swinging London with "Poor Cow", about London Woman Joy (Carol White) in connection with a thief and having a son with him, to see only the man ending up in that slam. While his friend (Terence Stamp) manages to help her out some, he turns out to be a little better in what a loser he is. It soon becomes clear to the joy that she will have to make a serious decision about where she goes in her life. One thing that I have decided - I don't know if this is correct - was a use of irony in the movie. Her name is Joy, but she experiences no joy in her life. Although not intended, it is still a movie that I recommend to everyone. With songs by Donovan (one of which - "Colors" - appeared in another Terence Stamp movie: "The Limey" (which also came out in 1999 when I was as old as my parents were, then "Poor Cow " come out )).
