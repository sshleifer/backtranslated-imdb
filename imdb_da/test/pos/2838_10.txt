After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, the nurse Betty is a fresh breath. The movie is like no other I've ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can lead more than disturbing images of men and women and how they approach sex (his two previous films were the brilliance of the Company of Men and the almost brilliant Your friends and neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives her best career as Betty, a waitress, who, when experiencing the brutal death of her ass wife (LaBute's chief stub Aaron Eckhart), is lost in a fantasy world. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play the hit men who killed his husband and are now on her trial. The trick to the movie is that Freeman and Zellweger are really parallel characters. While Zellweger falls in love with the picture of the beautiful and polite Dr. Dave Ravell on a soap opera, idealizes Freeman Betty. Nurse Betty is a brilliant film, full of life, humor, love and graphic violence. My grade: 10/10.
