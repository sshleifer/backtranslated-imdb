It's a horror story okay. But maybe not as you know it. The right monsters in this flick are humans. While monsters are humans and prey. As strange as it may sound, I see this as "Monsters Inc" for horror movie fans. Of course, the effects of an STD horror movie, the monsters are there as in any monster-based movie, the Gore is also there, even a slasher in the form of Dr Decker (played by David Cronenberg; I see flash of Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane in Batman Begins here - or is it the other way around?). And it is Decker & c who are the bad ones. The monsters will primarily think of their own business and stave off intrusive people more or less misunderstood that will be part of society. At the end of the movie you actually grow like the pretty little monsters (and the dog) - not maybe what you expected from the first few scenes ...
