God God, there are movies out there that do not follow the same old Hollywood crap formula. I think the digital revolution and the DVD revolution actually allow more interesting work to get out of there, even if you have to dig harder to find it. I love it when a movie takes its time to pull you deeper and deeper into its inner emotional ranks. It was really like taking a trip through America's soul and that soul is disturbed and confused. What really blew my mind was the way they used Martin Luther Kings talking about Vietnam and references to his murder in a way that hit me hard. I found myself choked up every time I heard his voice. I've heard him speak before, of course, but the way they used the speakers made me feel I understood his message in a way I had never thought of. What can you say about a movie that has heavy statistics on war, oppression, and a plea of ​​compassion at the end of which a credit would normally be crawled? In fact, there are no credits at all in the movie. You must access them by selecting them in the functions. Somehow it made me think a lot. All in all, I can't say enough about this DVD. Brilliant.
