After seeing the 'oh so praised' Fargo and thinking it was no more than average, I walked if it would be a good idea to hire another Coen 'masterpiece'. This time I was much less disappointed than I was with Fargo, and I have to say that most of the credit for it goes to the good jokes and the good play by George Clooney. Well done Mr. Clooney, make several of these and less 'Perfect Stormish' movies. You can shop and you showed it here. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
