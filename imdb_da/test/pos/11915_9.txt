I recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic phase I go through. I was born in 1980, and so movies from the mid-80s to mid-90s are a very important place in my growing up. <br /> <br /> This particular movie was one of my favorites, so I was thrilled when it became available in the UK. It's not got worse over time, it's still a fun movie with lots of excitement in its own way. Sure, it pales in the shadow of bigger, bigger budget films, but don't stop enjoying this. <br /> <br /> Worth renting or even a purchase for the discount prices you will find it.
