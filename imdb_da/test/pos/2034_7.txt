I have been looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago and I was not disappointed. I will not bother to sum up the story since everyone else has, but I would say that it was just entertaining throughout. The performance was great, as was the music, and the protagonists were sympathetic. My only complaints are: (1) The story was clearly lacking; the film wrapped very steeply - in fact, the writing was quite salmon in the second half as if the authors were not sure what to do with the plot. Since the plot was not as important as the music and action, it doesn't really affect the movie's entertainment value, so it's not as big a complaint as it seems. <br /> <br /> (2) This is really nitpicky, but the music that the characters in the movie listened to was sometimes dated after 1985 when the movie was set. INXS 'Devil Inside was from 1987 and AC / DC's Are You Ready was from 1990, including errors. This disturbs me a little as they of course went in lengths to do quite a while, they could have checked the copyright date of these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier. Again, not a big thing. <br /> <br /> Oh, I was thinking of something else that was weird. Steel Dragon Band members had to be English, but for some reason Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy played guitarist Zakk Wylde band members and each had a couple of speaking lines in AMERICAN accents. It was also lazy, but it was still cool to see the actual musicians playing musicians, so I will forgive it too. <br /> <br /> I could probably nitpick all day, but I wouldn't give the impression that this was not a super entertaining movie. I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out, and I'll definitely buy the Soundtrack CD for the six Steel Dragon songs (some of which were sung by the singer from the Steelheart band, if you remember them!). The highlight of the movie may have been a good play, as Mark Wahlberg lipstick for a rock song on stage and suddenly there are "Good Vibrations" by Marky Mark and Funky Bunch. The surprised look of Mark's face is invaluable. Classic rock and roll flick! Result: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment
