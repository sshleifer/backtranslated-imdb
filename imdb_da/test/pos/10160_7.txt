Probably a story about Jimmy Stewart's young child and Doris Day. The child is kidnapped to keep his parents quiet. They know something about a plot to murder the ambassador for an unnamed land during a performance at Albert Hall in London. <br /> <br /> The movie is rich in Hitchcockian events. A friendly but opaque Frenchman seems to grill the innocent Stewart - a doctor from Indiana - a bit too intense to be just idiot curious. Later, the French man shows himself in Arabic disguise, a knife in the back and whispers some information about the murder plot of Stewart. Stewart tells his wife - Doris Day looks very cute - but refuses to cooperate with the police and risks her son's life. <br /> <br /> Instead, the couple tries to track the murders, buy them and get their son back, take them from Morocco, where Hitchcock has given us his usual tourist perspective in terms of customs, places and food for London. There is a hilarious wild goose hunting with a set-to between Stewart and the staff of a taxidermy shop. The staff are more concerned with guarding their half-filled specimens than anything else, and they blend protective and hold the bodies of a leopard and swordfish. During the scuffle, Stewart manages to rescue his throat from being cut by the swordfish bill, but is bitten by a full tiger's hand. The action is reinforced by Bernard Hermann's bumtic score. The scene ends with Stewart rushing out the door. Hitchcock ends it with a shot of a lion's head that forgets at the slammed door. There is also a running gag, well finished, if some visitors are waiting for the couple's hotel room in London and are waiting for things to be explained. <br /> <br /> There are two serious issues that are easily affected. One is the relationship between Stewart and Day, which is not as rosy as it should be, considered a bourgeois ideal. She has been a stage musical star for some years and is internationally known. And she has given it everything to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be doc. It is understandable in eg. A nurse or flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star with a promising career in herself. It is not delved in, but edginess is noticeable as it was not in the original version. It reminds me of a bit of an exchange between Joe Dimaggio and his then Marilyn Monroe, who had just returned from entertaining the troops in Korea. "Oh, Joe," she ran, "have you ever seen ten thousand people stand up and rejoice?" "Seventy thousand," mumbled Joe, former hero of the New York Yankees. <br /> <br /> The second problem is a fidelity. Who has greater social value? Your own young son? Or an unknown ambassador. Are we or our loved ones at risk of national stability? Day is facing this dilemma in its strongest form by the climax of Albert Hall. Her solution chooses to believe in political stability, although her motives are problematic. Is she fighting to save the ambassador's life, or is she just doing it to release the overwhelming anxiety? (Cf: Alec Guiness falls on the detonator at the end of the "Bridge on the River Kwai.") The photography is extremely good and the settings can be threatening, even on a quiet street in a residential area of ​​London. It's mid-day, and Stewart is alone and determined, but also scared. There are footprints echoing on Gulliver Street from somebody somewhere. Will he be followed? Is his life in danger? And where in hell are all living on this street? Hitchcock pays close attention to location details that we can handle the brick behind him. <br /> <br /> The director had a rare disagreement with Francois Truffaut while he was interviewed for Truffaut's otherwise laudatory book. Truffaut claimed that the previous version of "The Man Who Went Too Much" lacked the depth of the later version. Hitchcock replied, "It seems to me that you want me to make movies for the art house's audience," but finally agreed that the 1930s version was a talented amateur's work, and this version was a professional work. No argument there. <br /> <br /> This is Hitchcock pretty much near his zenith.
