The best of American Pie "bakery". I found humor and plot to be much more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also about the appropriateness of the content, I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie films. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out, I read a number of negative reviews and did not end up seeing it while it was still in the theater ... I am now sorry about this decision. The film far exceeds my expectations in terms of plot, dialogue / scripting and overall quality. I give it two thumbs up!
