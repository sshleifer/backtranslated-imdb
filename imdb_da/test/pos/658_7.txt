** SPOILERS ** Beautifully photographed slice of the life front WWII's love story of Norman Rockwell paintings at the beginning and end of the film about how a "war hero" is not just someone who kills for his country, but also one who believes for himself and is not destroyed by the war propaganda, which constantly enters his head. Leaching of the Marine Corps Marion Hedg Hedgepeth, Jan Michael-Vincent, kicks out of the boot camp after five weeks and forced to put on a Baby Blue Marine uniform that shows he just didn't have the corps. Humilitated and scorned where he ended when he went home to St. Louis and scared what his family, as his father was in the Marine Corps in WWI, would think of him because he couldn't "cut mustard" like an American navy. <br /> <br /> Hedg stops in a bar and finds sitting next to him is a marine member of the fearless and deadly Marine Raiders Richard Gere, who an admiring hedge buys a beer. Talking to Richard Hedge is shocked to find that he is not only sent back to the Pacific Theater after all the battles he fought in and fought medals, but he got it all gray hair and in the midst of thirty looks Richard. be 21 next month! That was what was in the Marine Corps and WWII made for him! Buy Hedge a variety of drinks Richard takes the drunk Baby Blue outside and knocks him out with his Baby Blues and leaves his impressive US Marine uniform with some money in it for Hedge to ware. <br /> <br /> As soon as Hedge puts on Richard's uniform that fits in perfectly with him, he is confronted with this great, drunk American paratrooper who calls himself Cement-Head, who wants a tight fight with Marine Raider. Hedge does everything he can to avoid trouble, is forced by Cement-Head to tie him down after he himself has cracked two beer bottles over his cement head to get himself warmed to the big battle between Marine, Hedge and Paratrooper Cement Head. Hedge incredible floors the big cement head buffoon knocks him cold with a blow! "I suppose the trick doesn't hit him on top of the head". An anesthetized hedge tells his Cement Heads, colleague G.I .. Hitch hikes to this small town Bidwell Hedge this American military internment camp for Japanese Americans who are there because theirs considered a threat to US security. It is later in the movie, Hedge shows everyone what a real hero he is, not as the people of the city think he is, risking his life to save one of the hated "japs" as effortless together with two of his friends escaped from the interment camp, where in hell did they think they were going anyway? Hedge risked his life by saving the fear of death, Japanese-American from drowning in the dangerous rapids outside the city. Hedge in his actions taught Bidwell's people that not all "japs", even those who are American citizens, are bad and treacherous banzai screaming suicide bombers, as they were believed by newspaper magazines and movies at the time to believe they were. <br /> <br /> Hedge looks up to a conversation with the very sweet and beautiful waitress at the local dining room Rose Hudkins, Glynnis O'Connor, who just loves him as Hedge himself first thinks it is his uniform, not he who impressed her. Later when Hedge admits Rose that he is not what she and her parents believe a US Marine Raider that he is Rose, had so good knowledge of the sweet and caring leached sea, so good that it didn't matter her on everything he was supposed to be, a marine a paratrooper or a post office worker, that was what was inside his heart that really counted. <br /> <br /> The film has a series of touching and beautiful scenes in the between Hedge and Rose, showing how films were made many years ago without all the sex and beauty we see and hear in movies in day that involved two people in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The way the film, precisely, not the false baloney, shows the true feelings of average Americans, since 1943, whether the war in general and Japanese in particular could not have been done in more authentic and precise as well as good taste. "Baby Blur Marine" is best not to be politically correct when you do not show the hero's or leading actors and actresses in the movie that have the same feelings and ideas left over during World War II as most people now have as one Three dollar bills for the people who watch the movie who lived in the historical and momentous times when the film was to take place.
