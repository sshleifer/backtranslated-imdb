At one time, the `Buddy Cop 'movie controlled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes fell on our nation's theaters. Not anymore. Most recently, gusheret has dried to barely a lukewarm. The drought has eased recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a truly fun and consistent entertaining example of the genre. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston is a dedicated policeman. He is not a Dirty Harry type in any way. He is just incredibly focused professional who is completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of performing his duties, such as A T.V. kameraman. Mitch employs the cameraman in a socially irresponsible manner and then falls into Chase Renzi's couplings, a producer who seeks a killer hook for her `reality T.V. 'cop show. She believes that Mitch will give her the "edgy" boost, it must be a hit, but feel he might be unlucky to carry the whole show alone. Enter Trey Sellars, a patrol-cum actor who has seen too many Police Story re-runs. Of course, Mitch and Trey blend in like oil and water and very happy chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> We know that Mitch and Trey are bound to become best friends before the end of the movie. That's how buddy movies are supposed to work. In fact, it should be said that Showtime rarely differs from the time-known cliches as written by Lethal Weapon and Tango & Cash. There is a high tech McGuffin to get the ball rolling (in this case, an automatic rifle that burns rounds big enough to stop tanks.) There is a smooth foreign baddy with an accent of indefinite origin. There are chases, shootouts and explosions. We all know that this goes in, and we have a fairly fair idea of ​​how it all will turn out. You know what? There is nothing wrong with that. Yes, we know that the well-worn bases are being touched, but the fun here is the trip, not the destination. Showtime is not charged with being original. Instead, its energies penetrate into its characters and humorous situations. As a result, Showtime makes a competent job with the action sequences, but really shines in its comedy. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is dry fun as Mitch. In the past, I thought De Niro was a cold and unexpressive actor who was terribly mumbled when asked to do comedy. For the last time he has grown on me. He seems to inject more humanity into his roles. Eddie Murphy is fun as Trey. The best way to describe his performance is that Trey is what Murphy would be if Murphy wasn't so talented and hadn't hit the big time. Rene Russo has a droll time playing motor-mouthed show biz shark Chase Renzi. She stalks through the film and chases high Nielson ratings with awe-inspiring determination. In her zeal, she spans Mitch's life to make it more camera friendly. She even calls on T. J. Hooker himself, William Shatner, to show Mitch how it is a more "authentic" policeman. Shatner is fun and plays exactly as we expect him to be loud, ignorant and a little uncomfortable. I must admit that I was really looking forward to Showtime and I was not disappointed. Ten years ago, this movie had been a guaranteed hit. Today, at best, it does moderate business. It's a shame because Showtime is a lot of fun.
