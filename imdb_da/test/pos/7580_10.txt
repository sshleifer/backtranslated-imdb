I'm not a film producer, but I know it's hard to tell a story and draw people into it in just seven short minutes. I think a good movie is one you won't end up with. Eric did a good job of developing microbe charater and making him seem like "human". Loved the music and the voice used for the microbe. I'm looking forward to seeing what Eric has in store for us in future movies. This is a movie I didn't want to see at the end. Good work.
