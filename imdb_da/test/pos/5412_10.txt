Wow. When I went to this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, I had no idea what I was up to. This movie takes you on an emotional roller coaster in the best sense of the term. Sigourney Weaver was better than I've seen from her this year; Emile Hirsch was great and Jeff Daniels broke my heart. I can see how this will not be every person's cup of tea, as it is sometimes about some pretty hard things that can happen to a family. Don't make me wrong - it's also really fun - at my screening, the audience broke into applause after grinking over and over again. I just think if you are open to exploring your own life, Imaginary Heroes will sincerely touch you. I can't wait until it comes out in theaters.
