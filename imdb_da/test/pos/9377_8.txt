As a rule, there are few things more prevalent than Hollywood's attempts to be brave. Mixing caution with heavy duty, "message movies" folded high on the back to dare to cope with big problems. CROSSFIRE is not completely free of this taint; It contains a sermon on the nature of meaningless hatred that is embarrassingly obvious, assuming a level of naivety in its audience that is depressing to consider. As late as 1947, it was a big deal for a movie to announce that anti-Semitism existed and that it was bad. (Of course, it was impossible for Hollywood to address the real issue in the book on which the film was based, since his victim was gay.) Nevertheless, CROSSFIRE is nevertheless a convincing study of what we would now call a hate crime . Post-war malaysia was one of the main components of film noir, and CROSSFIRE addresses it directly. The film is set in Washington, D.C. among soldiers still in uniform but inactive, spend their days playing poker and bar-crawling. Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), an intelligent and kind Jew, explains that the end of the war has created a void: all the energy that went into hating and fighting the enemy is now unfocused and bottled. Samuel meets three soldiers in a bar: The sensitive Mitchell, who is close to a nervous breakdown, the weak will of Floyd Bowers and Montgomery, a tall, indulgent puddle who nastily belittles a young soldier from Tennessee as a silly hillbilly. The three soldiers turn up in Samuels' apartment, where the drunk Monty becomes more and more insulting and calls his host "Jewish boy". Samuels are killed, and Mitchell disappears, making himself the primary suspect of the murder. <br /> <br /> Cleansing up the crime is Detective Finlay (Robert Young), dare and by-book and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows Mitchell, is unable to murder. Among the pieces of the puzzle is Ginny (Gloria Grahame), a nightclub hostess who met Mitchell and gave him his apartment key, and Floyd (Steve Brodie), who witnessed the crime, was frightened in a filthy room. Although there is no genuine "whodunit" tension, the story is still poignant, and the trap laid down for the killer is extremely clever. <br /> <br /> The strong noir atmosphere saves the film from feeling didactic or sanctimonious. The cinematography is a striking shadow play with inky dark and harsh lights, rooms often lit by a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke. The world's fatigue is as transparent as noir lighting. "Nothing interests me," Finlay says quietly; "For nothing" is Ginny's bowl in the nightclub. Gloria Grahame, the paragon of noir femininity, almost steals the movie with its two scenes. Platinum blonde, blown and caustic, she is the quintessential B-girl, poisoned by the "smelly gin mill" where she works ("for laughs," she says bitterly), her sweet face curls when Mitchell tells her she reminds of his wife. Every now and then a wistful kindness throws through his defensive shell, as when she dances with Mitchell on a deserted farm, he offers to make him spaghetti in his apartment. When he goes there, he encounters a wild, curvy facialist (Paul Kelly) who seems to be fungi of Ginny and whose conversation is a close layer of lies and false confessions. Gloria beats Mitchell's girl's wife off the screen in a scene where she is asked to give Mitchell an alibi. Slim and fragile in her bathrobe, with her smiling lash, she lets us see how often Ginny has been offended and dismissed as a tramp. <br /> <br /> Robert Young is an indefinite actor, and he stands no chance of Mitchum's charisma, but he does a good job of keeping his smoking character, sat by delivering the movie's serious message, this side of pomp . Meanwhile, Mitchum gets a cool dialogue, but not nearly enough to do; Still, even when he does nothing but lounges in a corner, one cannot take his eyes off him. The third Robert, Ryan, creates a fully shadowed and frighteningly convincing portrait of an ignorant, unstable bigot; we see his false genius, his bullying, his anger with someone with benefits, his "am I right or am I right?" complacency; how easy he beats labels on people and what satisfaction he gets from despising them. <br /> <br /> CROSSFIRE's message seems cautious and dated now, but not as much as the same year's GENTLEMAN AGREEMENT. Finlay's talk of bigotry cops out by reaching back a hundred years for an instance of white victim, reminding us that Irish Catholics were once persecuted; Next, it could be people from Tennessee, he says, or men wearing striped neckties. Or maybe black or Japanese or homosexuals, or communists? Scripture seems to be afraid to mention any real simultaneous problems. It sweeps its message by saintly making the Jewish sacrifice as if his innocence was not sufficient; and it deals with the liberation of the military and has a superior officer who states that the army is ashamed of men like Montgomery and emphasizes that Samuel served honorably in the war. Still, it took a little courage to portray, immediately after World War II, an American that might have been happier in the Nazi army, and the film's basic premise is still valid. If Monty lived today, he would have expired on September 12, 2001 and strike up a Sikh.
