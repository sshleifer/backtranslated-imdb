This review includes what can be a spoiler if you never read the book or so the cover of the video box. So if you want to approach the movie without knowing anything about it, except that I like it a lot, stop here ... <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are not the first rate, but the action between the leaders is and they give the romance between them more life than Shute does in his novel (though I generally prefer the novel). My very weak objections to the film, as opposed to the book, is that the film dumps some of the relationships with secondary characters and between the main characters of a scene towards the end of the movie, to give some not at all realistic dramatic tension and as a general plot unit . All this is handled much better in the book, with the result that I find the end of the book a bit more touching than the end of the movie.
