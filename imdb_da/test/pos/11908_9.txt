This movie is just really amazing. I do not know why. I always have a weakness for Damian Chapa. It's not Scarface, but I really enjoy myself. This is a movie I can see more than ten times. He really tries to make a good movie, but he just can't do it. I'm sorry for him, so maybe it's a bit of a sympathy voice. I can't help it, but I just can't give it less than 9 stars. Everyone should have seen this once in his life. Seeing how to make a cheap film work. I live in Holland and bought this movie for only one euro! It's $ 1.50. I would also have bought it for ten euros. Great Great Great. In a small Dutch cinema, this film gets 101 votes. Here is only a 260. It's not so much more. Saw people all over the world. Buy this movie!
