This BBC version of an Agatha Christie book shows the pitfalls of following a book too closely. Christie's books tend to move in a gentle, sometimes even sedating, pace, and "Evans" is one that certainly does. It also has a solid school of red herring to confuse the plot. This version is extremely faithful to the book, resulting in a very slow, involved story. As a Christie fan, I gave it 7 stars, but it takes 3 hours to get through a relatively action-free story. I appreciate some of the tightening of plots that the BBC made for its later Christie productions much more. In the end, this movie is a leisurely pleasure, highlighted by breathy waif Francesca Annis, bringing significant charisma to her role and playing very well by James Warwick.
