A few days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents was assaulted and tortured to death a middle-aged lady who came home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl who had seen everything reported what happened. Therefore, it started a debate on the overly intense flow of immigrants from Romania, who generalize them as criminals, all without distinction. <Br /> <br /> I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of ​​wealth does Italy give these poor people? How do they view us as the country everywhere? Last night I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer. When you only have one donkey and some goats, these propaganda postcards display the United States as a land of milk and large vegetables, such an impression. <br /> <br /> NUOVOMONDO is really a must-see movie. It balances an ethereal symbolism (milk islands, gaze, hard and rocky mountains, name and character Lucy / Luce) and a cruel realism (the mass of hopeful people on the ship, the procedures on Ellis Island). There is a mixed cast that goes from the English Charlotte Gainsbourg to the realistic Vincenzo Amato until a bitter and crushing Aurora Quattrocchi as the mother. But was it really that hard to get into the new world?
