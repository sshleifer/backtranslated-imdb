Another great achievement by Kiefer Sutherland. I love his movie because he always plays his part very well. For a low budget movie it was done very well and kept me on the edge all the time. I love this type of movie and I was glad I caught it. I will probably buy the DVD or tape. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
