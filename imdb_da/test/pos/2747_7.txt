Many of the previous comments are right on the money, but some, yes, not so much. <br /> <br /> This is hardly a 'B' movie ... it is well-produced, the live flying sequences are truly amazing, and the model sequences are first rate. It's not "cheapie". <br /> <br /> Ricard Barthelmess is pretty good at this and it makes a great collection for "Only Angels Have Wings". <br /> <br /> To see John Wayne, J. Carrol Naish spot first, they end up together. <br /> <br /> Tom Browne is young enough (and somewhat boring), but when they saddle with the most pathetic pencil in Hollywood history, it makes his character even less credible. Sally Eilers is much more. <br /> <br /> As for later influences this is Wellman in the early Airliner-in-Distress zone ... the opening sequence of this movie, with the Airline Operations guy arriving at "Grand Central Airport" would have looked very nice into "The High and the Mighty" ... imagine Regis Toomey ... and a 1955 Buick.
