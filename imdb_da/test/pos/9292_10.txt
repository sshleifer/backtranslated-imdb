This is exactly what Australian television and Australian politics need, people with a sense of humor !!! Good on ABC to support these guys. The show is based on a few Aussie blokes who know how to take mickey out of politicians or other people in the limelight. The boys use Sydney as their primary base to make a splash in the public. Watch out for Crazy Wharehouse Guy or the Ten Questions. The boys who perform these actions are the same guys who presented CNNN. If you enjoy CNNNN and Glasshouse then you will love this show. I'm still interested in knowing which stunts are real and acting purely because there are some dubious actions from the boys ...
