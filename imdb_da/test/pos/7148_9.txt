This is a wonderful movie ... it is fun, dark, poignant, thoughtful, innocent, and generally entertaining all around. I don't know I've seen similar before ... "The Rapture" or maybe one of Todd Solondz's black-and-night "comedies" or even the recent movie "Teeth" comes to mind ... but It's all bitter, ugly little gems. "Franklins", despite the darkness around the edges, manages to have a thoroughly sincere and pure heart. The story resembles John Waters '"Down Down Dirty Shame", only this film differs from what actually has a story, and something to say too, besides Waters' juvenile "Sex is not dirty (snicker, nudge)" message. A conservative, suppressed family is undergoing a drastic change due to a car accident and is suddenly not as conservative anymore ... in fact, they are actually actually happy, probably the only ones in their city (or perhaps the whole world) who are. Talking about why this is the case would be to destroy the movie; Simply put everyone together to see it, though of course only people are already sold on what the film's optimal, hopeful philosophy will ever. <br /> <br /> The action is amazing - just this realistic side to keep the case from being too heavy ... Teresa Willis gives a particularly memorable and courageous performance as an exciting mother emerging as a butterfly when released. Both she and Robertson Dean deserve kudos for their unflinchingly sincere achievements (not to mention frequent and extensive nudity and sex scenes); They turn to what could have been a tasty joke involving a "deviant sex practice" in a touching, credible, and welcoming moment. Aviva as a daughter is a standout and a person to see, perfect capturing of a girl in her age, attitude, anxiety and speech patterns. Vince Pavia as "himbo" brother with a secret is handsome and functional, though his story and how everyone responds to it is more rewarding than his actual acting. Mari Blackwell as the opposite best friend to mother Franklin is wonderfully cold, confused and even merciful in a role that could have gone above. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie looks great, all bright colors and wide-open spaces ... it looks like it might have been shot Hi-def ... If yes, the line has become very thin , it looks a lot like movies. There is a lot to speak and much of the philosophical, which becomes a bit predictive (moreso, I can imagine a viewer disagreeing with the film's policy), but this movie says many things that need to say ... only people would not be afraid to listen and think The arguments that take place are clever and well thought out, primarily refusing to demonize the religious or non-religious parties. The end is on the ambiguous side which I found a bit of a disappointment in some way ... I think it would have worked better, had the author (since Jay Floyd since he produced, wrote and directed) gave one more useful degradation, a kind of solution, but then again there is probably not one when it comes to pitting people with different beliefs against each other. Still, it was a moving, memorable final image that left me cold - a success. Meanwhile, I am very happy that Mr. Floyd made this movie and look forward to sharing it with as many people as possible. Check it out.
