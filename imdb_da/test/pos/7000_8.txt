Let me waste a moment of your time explaining how I approached this movie. 1. I dismissed trailers out of hand because the movie seemed to be an unredited remake of foreigners, which I consider to be one of the weakest movies in the Alien series. Stupidly continues to dismiss the movie after I had heard positive things about it from people whose opinions I trust, I missed the theatrical race altogether. I was then hooked on Farscape in his 3rd or 4th season at that time and found Pitch Black on cable one night around bedtime - so I said "oh why not, at least it has Claudia Black in it." Soon I recognized Keith David and began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could all act (why this should surprise me, I don't know). I was jailed. I have now been fascinated for four years. I just watched the movie for the third or fourth time, and I still love it. <br /> <br /> This is not an art film, not an independent one, and it is not entirely original, but where it does not break a lot of news, it is entirely successful in providing interesting, realistic characters, hard-driving action on the medium of a compelling but simple plot and non-stop entertainment; an absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully developed special effects. Does it sound good to be true? Don't take my word for it ... see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> The film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel that introduced the character of Richard Riddick. Diesel would continue to steal in the little Riddick-ulous Chronicles thereof (which I also enjoyed, but recognize its rather big flaws) and is now a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big and so interesting to see that it's easy to ignore that he's not just a talented actor, but also a smart one. Check out the DVD version of Pitch Black, with the audio commentary on, just blowing away. <br /> <br /> The film is about the herd of an inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash landing where their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic (Mitchell), but she is trapped between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically changed to see in the dark (Diesel) . Is that all? Of course not - the planet is inhabited and the inhabitants are hungry. As unoriginal and unlikely, as some of this may be, Pitch Black is beautifully filmed, well-told and very nicely done. Don't expect to learn anything and don't expect to think much, but expect to have fun with this modern sci-fi action classic.
