I enjoyed the movie and the story immensely! I have seen the original (1939 I believe) and enjoyed them both. To really appreciate the story, one must be familiar with English culture and customs. Prof. (Peter O'Toole) was dedicated to his school and "boys" in that school. It was an English "public" school that we in the United States refer to as a private school (E.G. Andover). He is a very ascetic person and on the surface seems to be stiff, dotted, motionless and weak to the point of being widespread. He is strict in his education standards because he cares for "his lads", that is, he does not want them to get a cheap or weak education. He meets (through introduction) a "dance hall girl" (Petula Clark) and is completely beaten. In England at that time, the reference to "dance hall" had the connotation of extreme sexual promiscuity and was certainly "lower class". We find that Prof. in fact, a very hard and courageous person is loyal to people and institutions he loves and / or respects. Clark becomes more than a lover and wife ... she "revives" her personality and allows him to grow as a man and a person, much to the benefit of his beloved school and his own happiness. The first movie was set before WW II, one goes through WW II, also it is 1969 (we have had the "British invasion" ... Beams, etc. Clark had hits and was very popular when ... still for me ), the music is great, color and photography excellent. I think O'Toole played the character perfectly! There are dedicated people like "Chips" ... all around us, but many do not receive recognition. Very entertaining movies and history!
