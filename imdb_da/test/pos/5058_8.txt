When I was going to see Rendition, I was expecting an exciting movie on a controversial topic with big-name actors. I didn't expect a movie that was so exciting, exciting, poetic and sad that picked me up from the beginning and didn't let me go even after I left the theater. An advice for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, don't let your policy get in the way of enjoying (or not enjoying) this movie. Take it for what it is. I saw this with my conservative Jewish family (I am the black sheep, the pseudo-liberal college student), and I thought they would print it out as "liberal propaganda". Instead, they said it was a great movie with great performances (they like to fancy themselves movie critics). It's boring that a movie like this must be marketed by its Oscar-affiliated actors while leaving the constantly underrated Sarsgaard as well as new talent as the truly outstanding Metwally. The whole cast gave good performances where some stood out much more than others; My only problem with that was that there was a lot going on that didn't allow much screen time for each of the characters. In fact, I felt that "sub-plot" with Fatima and Khalid was just as prominent on the screen as Anwar's part of the story. The people all have the potential to fall into stereotypes, but actors do a good enough job to give them depth with the small screen time they have. Streep is really amazing, like a heartless senator, and as much as I don't want to see the actor in such a horrible role, it's impossible not to believe in her. Gyllenhaal, who is likely to be one of the Oscar sisters of this film, seems a little uncertain in his role at times. H tries to portray his inner conflict, but usually just goes as if he has either forgotten his lines, or he does not know how to feel. Sarsgaard gave an excellent performance; his unforgettable confrontation with Streep is easily one of the best parts of the movie. Metwally, again, was great, and I hope to see him in more ordinary movies. It's a shame that Gyllenhaal is probably nominated in front of him. Yigal Naor, as shown on IMDb, has been, are some movies already, but he is a beginner in my eyes. He gave all good results together with Mohammed Khouas and Zineb Oukach. <br /> <br /> The story of Fatima and Khalid was not given any credit in advertising, but it brings a sad humanity to the story. The story was interesting when I really tried to connect the two stories until it was clearly told us at the end. I've read some comments here that say the love story was useless, but I disagree. I think it certainly shows another side to the controversial issue as well as humanity in general. Khalid was the real terrorist, but he did it to avenge his brother, and although he is responsible for the attack, you see a human side to him through the history of Fatima. Not that I think we should feel bad for the actual terrorists, but I think the theme "we all human" is absolutely relevant. Whatever your feelings on terrorism, politics, etc. Give it out of theater. The bottom line is that this is an interesting story with a message we all need to hear.
