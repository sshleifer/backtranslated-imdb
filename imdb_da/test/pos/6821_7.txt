Joseph Conrad's timeless novel, Heart of Darkness, was depicted in the 1994 film. I've read Conrad's novel, and I have to say, even though I prefer the novel itself, the movie was a great depiction. Set and costume design brought Conrad's novel to life on the screen when we followed Marlow's journey. The play also brought the characters to life through fashion, voices and personalities. If you have read the short story, I recommend that you also watch this movie. If you have not read the novel, however, the film may be harder to follow. Conrad's Heart of Darkness is too full of action, emotions and information to be made into a movie that is just over an hour and a half. Therefore, if you have not read the novel, the plot in the film may seem too nice to follow. Overall I gave this movie a seven out of ten. The foundation's floor plan was performed on the screen with beautiful sets, costumes and plays. However, nothing can replace Joseph Conrad's original work.
