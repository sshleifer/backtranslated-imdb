Tim Robbins makes a wonderful movie. His wife (susan sarandon) gives a wonderful performance like her sister Helen Perjean, who will help Murder Poncelet (Sean Penn) who is convicted of murder and who will also die from an injection ... 120 minutes of split and touching scenes is what you get. Great acting and it's a movie that gives something to think about! <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon deserves Oscar's 1995 Best Actress. It's probably one of her greatest movies ever. <br /> <br /> I didn't see 'The Cradle Rock' but I have to see more movies from Robbins. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9/10 or *** 1/2 out of 4. Go see .....
