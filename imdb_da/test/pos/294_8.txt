It carries the tone that tells the book in Vietnam's jungle and into the wild eye of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mysterious morbidity around Colonel Kurtz. (I'm not saying Marlon Brando, because after watching the documentary, "The Hearts of Darkness", I'm skeptical of how much credit Brando is due to that quality). The tone I am talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing: "Everyone gets what he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one. They sent it up with room service." It is indulgent without being narrow and alienating. A good example is Hopper's forbearance in aphoristic madness, generously installing lines written by T.S. Eliot and Rudyard Kipling into his rocky monologues: "I think the man is a genius? Sometimes he will walk right by you without saying a word, and sometimes he will get you by the collar and say" did you know the 'if' is the middle word of 'life'? if you can hold your head while you around you lose theirs? and then I mean he is a wise man, he is a great man; I should have been a few ragged claws pushing over the boards in quiet sea "(The first is Kipling, the other is Eliot.
