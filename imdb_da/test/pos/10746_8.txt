Dragon Ma (Jackie Chan) is back, removing the seas in the dreaded Pirate Lo. Back on land, he has been assigned to the police force to clear up corruption and crime in a local suburb. Along the way, he is trapped in the fate of several Chinese patriarchs trying to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause. The Chinese maneuvering is after these revolutionaries, and anyone in the way is in trouble even if they are in the police force. I had great expectations for this movie after I saw Project A. But unfortunately I was a little disappointed. There is just too little action compared to the first movie. There is only one good fight scene until the big end. This battle scene is in "gangsters' place" and that's good, many people fly everywhere and hard kicks and blows are throwing. Jackie Chan and his stunt team do not disappoint here at all. The end is very entertaining, Jackie Chan shows us why he is the best stuntman in the world. Really exciting stuff! The only bad thing about the end is that the fighting is too short and forgettable. Conclusion: Many fun moments, good plays and crazy stunts. But not enough is fighting for a top rating.
