This solid black-and-white slapstick comedy with a dark (but hopelessly designed) plot is a true crowd pleaser that makes you shine with laughter (as well as rolling your eyes with disbelief). It is the old psychopath of a train history, but it has no meaning, since the movie's thriller part almost seems to be just a counterweight to the antiquity of the great comedian Robert Gustafsson. His rude, almost incurable, optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and harmlessness in a way that almost competes with Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> However, the case of the film that appealed to me the most is that wedge between the unlikely and the hilarious ones they accurately portrayed the joys of everyday life and the hassles of rail travel. They add a very welcome feeling of realism and recognition. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, this thriller comedy has borrowed most of its "excitement" from Hitchcock and should, in my opinion, only be monitored for its comedy value (which is high actually). Besides Gustafsson, Lars Amble's solid performance as a lovely cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission alone. <br /> <br /> Warmly recommend.
