** and 1/2 stars out of **** Lifeforce is one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen, so ridiculous, but at that time it is strangely convincing and never the least boring. Whether due to the unstoppable nudity, the sheer amount of violence and action, it all comes together to make an entertaining 2 hour movie theater. <br /> <br /> Spacer Churchill has been sent to investigate Halley's Comet as they discover something hiding inside the giant cliff's coma. A small team, led by Colonel Carlsen (Steve Railsback), has been sent to search the area. What they discover includes hundreds of frozen bats creatures and three naked and seemingly unconscious humanoid creatures within strange crystalline containers, two men and one woman (Mathilda May). They decide to take all three back with them, resulting in a disaster. <br /> <br /> When London does not receive a response from the crew, another crew is sent to find out what is happening. When docking with Churchill, they find the remnants of the crew that all stand out from recognition. The humanoids are still in perfect condition and they take them back to London. <br /> <br /> After various tests, scientists still don't know what those creatures really are. As late as one night, a security guard in the connection has to enter the room where the woman is being held. He touches her shoulder and she wakes up, stands up and smiles at him in a seductive and wicked way. She approaches him and starts kissing him when it becomes clear that she is actually taking her life force and sucking him off all her energy (the effect is a bit cheesy). She escapes from the compound and begins to leave a track. Another man, Colonel Caine (Peter Firth), is brought in to track her down. Then the men discover that there is a pattern of the life force process. The guard of the security guard wakes up in 2 hours and takes the life force of a doctor. It works every 2 hours, this process is repeated by a victim. With the help of Churchill's only survivor, Carlsen, they try to track the girl before it's too late. The life force is pretty good late night entertainment. It has all the elements one could look for in such a movie, lots of nudity, blood / gore and lots of special effects. This is certainly better than a similar plot of film, Art, thanks largely to a more rapid finale. The performances range from decent to terrible. Faring the worst is easily Steve Railsback, who endures to no end. Much better is Peter Firth, who comes through and convincingly, and the beautiful Mathilda May (she is as beautiful as French actresses Sophie Marceau and Emmanuelle Seigner). May go through pretty much the whole role without wearing clothes, and there were reports that it was hard on her while filming, so the fact that she is able to go through all the scenes without fidgeting and looking uncomfortable is impressive. There are times when she can be quite unsafe, simply seductive. Most of the film manages to work because of her. <br /> <br />
