"Broadcast News" is directed by James L. Brooks (Content terms as good as it gets) and has a great cast, including William Hurt, Albert Brooks and Holly Hunter. Everyone gives a good performance, but they are too unlikely to really care about them. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the movie are really brilliant, such as The prologue and the short scenes with Jack Nicholson. The main reason why it doesn't quite work is that it's a movie that trusts the characters are more fun than entertaining things that happen to them. You can consider it no more than a drama, but it is often too stupid to be successful there as well. But the script makes it worth watching. Certainly not for everyone. <br /> <br /> 7.0 out of 10
