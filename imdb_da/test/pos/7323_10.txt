The Columbia Pictures Short Subject unit has never had any delusions of producing any 'Art' movie. They wanted to give filmmakers just a little more for their money when they booked a Columbia picture in their theaters. This would double for The 3 Stooges movies. MEN IN BLACK (1934) came as close as their Comedy Shorts because they received an Oscar nomination for Best Short Subject, Comedy. Even if it didn't win, it might well. It was good enough, and even those who do not count among Stooge files still seem to be won over by the clarion shout of "... calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard ! " This was the second entry in the long series of Comedy Shorts made by Stooges for Producer Jules White, head of Columbia's Short Subjects Department. Only WOMAN HATERS described in his credits as a "Musical Novelty" preceded it on Harry Cohen's scam sweatshop. <br /> <br /> The movie starts at the office of Dr. Graves, the hospital manager. He receives new trainees, and when he approaches the group, he says that three of them have passed from Medical Conditionally since they had been there for so long. But the good doctor says he won't reveal their identities as long as they promise their all "... for customs and humanity!" Stooges runs out to pledge "... for Duty and Humanity!" And run out of office and break the window glass in the door. The game was on. <br /> <br /> Stooges left and did not stop for the rest of the 2 wheels. Every type of gag was in evidence. From broad Sennett-like synagogues, to proverbs, to dialect humor, to absurd theater and to a surrealistic running gag involving a public address system that apparently takes its own life and has the true sinner, a radio tube gets shot at one ". ....... he got me! " (It all plays pretty well, honestly!) The sets used were very authentic and were undoubtedly borrowed from Columbia features made around the same time. There are plenty of wheelchairs, surgical cats, stethascopes, surcical scalpels, etc. As proof of maintaining the illusion of a hospital. A true strength of men in black is the high number of normally nameless players that we all recognize by face. Along with them, the movie boasts of a large number of veteran comedy actors who always turn out in fine performances that often steal the scene. People with names such as Billy Gilbert, Hank Mann and Bud Jamison shine in equally small parts. And finally, we have Maestro, conductor director Raymond McCarey, the grandson of Leo McCarey, who showed his ability to get this little movie 'in the can'. He skillfully preserved everything as a traffic console at times, what about all actors, extras and behind the scenes the crew moves and out of each other's way. And it doesn't count Giant 3 Man Tandem Bicycle, The Sway Backed Horse and Miniature Race Cars, not to mention 'Giant, Green Canaries!'
