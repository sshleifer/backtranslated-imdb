Captured this recently after noting the James Earl Jones name of the title. It was better than expected. Of course, it's pretty old made in the early / mid 70's, but it's actually a decent drama. It runs a fast 90 minutes or so and shows good performances by James Earl Jones and Diahann Caroll. The reason is common in general but told through a single black woman on welfare who has 6 children and is trying to deal with all the problems that persist. This gives an interesting view ..... also in the fact that the script was not too sentimental or over-dramatic - it's almost like looking at a piece of past. All 70 styles are in abundance. The finish is a little boiling though .... probably would have done better without theatrics.
