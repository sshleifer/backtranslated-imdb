I loved this movie! It has a good heart and large bones. I stumbled upon it by chance, and I did not have a memory, not even an incline, of this movie from promotions or reviews or mouth to mouth. I remember many years ago reading a journalist who commented on the value of watching movies without having them contaminated by preliminary judgments or the promille's false divorce. And this seems to be the most common source of critics' negative reaction to the movie: it failed to meet expectations of being a comedy or a piece of life or character-driven. I had no expectations for the movie, and then it was comical - but I only laughed once or twice - without being comedy; It was about a person, but so eccentric that it was not a piece of life; It was about a character, but the character was so intelligent optimistic and proud of her instinct for life that it was not the anxiety-driven sentimental melodrama that was so typical of American 'serious' film - that I wrote that I realized that author / director Lisa Krueger managed to poke fun on this schlock American sentimentality in the man! And very wise too! And Kreuger was able to keep the cloyingly sentimental end off the screen as the weighing, not lost man came back with his tail shrunk between his legs. Bravo, Mrs Krueger, bravo! (Now I want to watch this movie again as it gets better and better as I reflect on it.) <br /> <br /> Graham's performance as Joline is brilliant. I loved how subtly but completely she was able to portray and convey intelligent awareness of her committed engagement to honor her words and actions - she knew she kept her word with a band or friends or man that she sat down to ridicule and / or disappointment in a world that could not honor the commitment she could make. But even with that strength, she was fully connected with mankind and embraced with a fully committed heart their fragility and failure. The character of Joline was incredibly well-acted and I left the film surprised that I hadn't reminded of honors nominations for it. Okay, not so surprised when American prizes are on women in "serious" roles, full of anxiety and the right amount of nudity that this movie didn't have. What it has was much better, which was the heart of this woman's discovery of herself with the help of new friends and a self-defeating shaman. I admit to being a bit of a soft touch for eccentric characters who manage their peculiarities while remaining honest and true to themselves, as they move through the minefield of what includes "proper" social behavior and "acceptable" interpersonal discourse. So if people are to adhere to the normality of your world, then this movie will not suit you. And it was one of the common threads in the critics. <br /> <br /> And I am always a sucker for a good word game when it raises questions about human behavior and ethical / philosophical values. Until this film, I had not made the emotional connection between being committed (for a cause or honesty or something) and being engaged (for an insane asylum). At what time does one's commitment to a personal sense of truth and action in life become a one-time ticket to madness? It sounds like a simple question, or one that is easily dismissed as rhetorical. Mean it? And yet some of the critics - I think maybe two - commented on this aspect of the film either directly or indirectly. <br /> <br /> A nice movie. 8.10. <br /> <br />
