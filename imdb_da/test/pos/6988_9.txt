If you're a science fiction fan and you've only seen this movie once, please go and pamper yourself with another view. I just did that, and I was surprised at how well I thought the movie was, unlike when I first saw it three years ago. The first time I was impressed with the astronomical outlook we are dealing with in this movie, but basically I didn't think so much about the movie as a whole. It was an alien rip-off, and I thought the description of monsters was a case of really bad science. That they were allergic to light was something I found particularly ridiculous. Based on my first impression, I recently reviewed this movie a 5. <br /> <br /> But now that the sequel, the Chronicles of Riddick, is on its way and the movie poster for one looks great, I thought I would better brush up on Pitch Black again, so I borrowed the video from a friend. I'm so glad I did. There is so much of what I thought I remembered from the first impression that turned out to be wildly inaccurate. I thought most characters died very early in the movie. It wasn't like that. I thought Claudia Black's character was the first to die. It wasn't like that. I thought Riddick was the only survivor. It wasn't like that. <br /> <br /> I see now that the movie works * extremely * well. There is no excessive and tiring focus on monsters. It is much more of a human drama. The protagonists are appealing and capable of some compelling actions. And there are so many small details that make the Pitch Black universe coherent and credible, such as. Lack of oxygen in the atmosphere on the planet they collide with, and the fact that the monsters have eaten everything on the planet and so they are facing each other. <br /> <br /> And I have to mention the astronomical outlook again. I mean, we begin to see the spacecraft passing through a comet tail, with bits of spaced zapping through the hull. Then we come to a planet with three suns. Just as the shipwrecked people think it is getting dark, a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon, and everything is engulfed in a blue glow. As the darkness approaches, we see the enormous neighboring gas giant rise above the sky, and in the last scene of the film we see the ship sliding close to one of these very poor ones. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, wonder and detail, and I don't think I've seen any other SF movies that really made such a point of including these things. I hope we see much more of it in the sequel. <br /> <br /> Pitch Black now gets me a rating of 9 out of 10. A cult classic? You can believe that!
