I used to enjoy "Happy Ever After" but was totally hypnotized by "Terry & June". With Aunt Lucy, there was heaviness in the relationship between Terry and June, a middle-aged middle-class English couple, and I thoroughly enjoyed it and lost myself quite happily in each episode. The 1980s were the era of alternative comedy, but they were also the decade of choice - and Terry and June certainly fit more traditional tastes. And mine - and I was also a big fan of "The Young Ones"! Every week, Terry came into a stupid situation, and June was drawn into herself and ended up paying him. How dated the shows look now - it was a different world, but it is fun to see trends in the 1980s, such as The CB radio story from 1982 (CB radio was legalized in England in November 1981) who saw Terry in jail in his car on the back of a truck! I've been watching the shows again recently on DVD and I still think they're great! Not loved by the enlightened elite - they chattering classes, but a big hit with the masses! Wonderful!
