I was surprised at how emotionally invested I was in this movie. Peter Boyle is a tour de force as the working class social conservative bigot, Joe. I actually sympathized with some of his complaints. Of course, he does not mention the underlying historical socio-economic causes of many of his prejudices. The film also provides interesting insights into the rapid change that American society underwent at this time. Recreational drugs, casual sex and the challenge of custody became fashionable and replaced the more contemporary traditions of respect for God, country and seniority. Susan Sarandon fans will be happy. Joe is her movie debut. She also gives viewers a visual treat near the beginning of the movie. Recommended, 8/10.
