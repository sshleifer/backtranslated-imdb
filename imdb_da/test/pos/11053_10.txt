Garbo's first spoken word in this 1930s movie-electrified audience and became part of Hollywood legend. Garbo had become a star in his first American film, The Torrent, in 1926. And the audience was waiting for this movie to see if Garbo could make the transition to talkies. She did. And while Pola Negri, Vilma Banky and Renee Adoree fell by the way of their accents, Garbo sailed for another decade. Despite this film's staginess, Garbo is really excellent, especially in the opening scene with the equally large Marie Dressler as Marthy. The two big stars act dirty looks and sharp words as they stretch each other up while they have a few drinks and set the tone for the rest of the movie. Garbo was 25; Dressler was 60. Charles Bickford is OK as Matt, and George F. Marion is good as Old Chris. Marion originated from this role on Broadway in 1922 and also played it in 1923 silent version with Blanche Sweet. This Eugene O'Neill game is a true classic but strangely never filmed again. Anna Christie is one of Garbo's greatest performances. And despite the film's staginess and the wickedness of history, she is truly a marvel. Watch this for Garbo and Dressler!
