WOW I love this movie. This is definitely added to my list of Ghetto Movies. Juice - Starring Tupac 'I Don't Give F ***' Menace II Society - O-Dawg 'I want to smoke someone, I just don't give F ****' New Jersey Drive - Hi they steal cars in broad daylight they give Of course not f *** <br /> <br /> New Jersey Drive is the best hood movie ever. It's at the top of the list, threat II community is second, and juice is third, Clockers is really stupid. <br /> <br /> The New Jersey Drive soundtrack is Pwnage for Mac Mall & Young Lay - All about my fat is being heard through the movie. <br /> <br /> Underground - Burn rubber, another good song, and it is also Ill & Al Scratch - don't be shut down on a player <br /> If you're a fan of GTA-SA, you will freaking love this movie and the amazing soundtrack. The soundtrack is largely raped to steal cars ^ _ ^ SWEETTTT Movie!
