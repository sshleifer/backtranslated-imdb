Although it's not the first movie I've bought for myself, it's almost certainly the one I've seen the most. The animation is well drawn by the experts of Tokyo Movie Shinsa, and the animators have often used clever techniques such as having the sun cause "lens flare" if the camera gets soaked (and with the "camera operator's hand" cleans the lens!), Etc. While the film is being avoided The "animator's gadget feast" gave the poor but generous use of such techniques the movie a much more "realistic" feel than the typical cartoon. <br /> <br /> The story has many interweaved plots that don't seem to have much to do with each other until everything comes together eventually, in a way even though the authors admit self-evident, are constructed. Each of the major plot lines has its own musical theme, ranging from "Pop Going Woven" [Hamton & Plucky] to the love theme of "Romeo and Juliet" [Fifi & Johnny]. The transitions between plotlines are slightly varied, but consistent. <br /> <br /> Really a wonderful movie; There is not much original music, although the new lyrics to "Spinning Song" are clever and comfortable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
