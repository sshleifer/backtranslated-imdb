There are many well-known Hitchcock elements (from earlier and later films), and this time they blend into a jolly, but hardly exciting piece of entertainment. You can tell that Dorothy Parker had a hand in the manuscript, the most memorable scenes are the dialogues of hero Cummings with the blind man and his meeting with a pretty bizarre group of circus people. The famous climax of the Statue of Liberty seems a little heavy-handed - judged by today's standards, but also in relation to other Hitch monument finals (eg, blackmail, north of the northwest).
