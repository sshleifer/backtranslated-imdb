I remember when I first saw this movie. I was a child walk for a friend of my mothers, and one of the kids suggested we look at it. Thought it was the genuinely ridiculous 'Prince of Thieves' they slammed into the VCR, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom. What I got came as a shock, a pleasant one, I will admit, but still a shock. <br /> <br /> Now you know all the Robin Hood legend, right? I have to explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal who nodded money here and there and gave it to people who needed it, secondly, pursuing the beautiful Maid Marion and confused Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John. That's the basics! Now, with the review. <br /> <br /> This movie was released in 1993, and is a start of the entire Robin Hood legend and a p --- take of the Prince of Thieves in particular. <Br /> <br /> Resolved after the legend, Robin of Loxley is first discovered in an Arab prison during the third century crusades, and along with a 'Moor' as they were called these days, he performs a cunning escape with a cellmate, Asneeze. <br /> <br /> After escaping, Asneeze visits Robin to find his son Atchoo, a foreign student in England, and look for him. This Robin promises to do! Robin swims back to England. <br /> <br /> He returns to his home, Loxley Castle, to find it on the wheel at the back of the Bailiffs, and goes through his sad revelation that his father, dog, cat, and himself the goldfish are all dead. Desperate for a familiar face, he finds the family's loyal blind servant Blinkin, who sits on the toilet with a jazz mag in braille. The greeting continues throughout the film. <br /> <br /> As with all Robin Hood stories, Robin is supposed to counter the evil plans of Prince John and the sheriff of Rottingham, who spell chaos and charge exorbitant treasures at King Richard's kingdom he is away. Those who are familiar with the films Mel Brooks have previously directed will have a little idea of ​​what to expect. After all, it is the man who is responsible for Dracula-dead and loves it and young Frankenstein. All the jokes ranging from visual gags to wonderful witty comments are in exactly the right places throughout the movie, with never more than a minute between laughs. <br /> <br /> Cary Elwes (probably the only English man to play Robin Hood in a movie) that many of you will know from Princess Bride, brings his naughty grinning flashing eyes to this movie and does a wonderful job . From foreign heroic lineup, to a viciously sexy gaze, he is really incredibly fun. And the man looks better in tights than I do! <br /> <br /> Richard Lewis is fun as the whiny, arrogant Prince John with the ever-changing mole. He gets sissy-boy behavior down to a tee, and his whinging American vocals are great. Throughout the film, a mole changes his face constantly: it begins on his left cheek, then over to his right cheek, then his chin, then his forehead, before returning to the original place. This is a subtle joke based on Alan Rickman's pier when he played the Sheriff of the Prince of Thieves. Roger Rees as the winding sheriff of Rottingham is wonderfully slim and nasty and has some great lines throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There are some faces here you want to be familiar with from other Brooks movies. For example, Robert Ridgely, who played the hangman in this movie, also played the hangman of Blazing Saddles, another movie directed by Brooks. He can also add subtle references to his previous film; With more in this movie, die-hard Brooks fans will easily spot. Those who looked at Part One of World History recognize the music of the song 'Men in Tights'. Also, when Patrick Stewart arrives and sniffs Marion, Mel himself (plays Rabbi Tuckman) reports the line "it's good to be a king", one of his lines in world history. <br /> <br /> The whole cast It is wonderfully comical, even those with few lines give a great depth of warmth and humor to them. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so wonderfully warm and fun in my own opinion is all the improvised scenes. Although there was a script of varieties, some scenes were completely impromptu by the actors themselves, as the scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) asks Rottingham in his bed, and he falls through the ceiling and lands right where she wanted him, which became entirely devised and thought out by the two actors. <br /> <br /> There are few special effects and those there are small but fun moments of computerized camera. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is memorable, with some very fun songs, and a few cheesy love songs. You will sing 'Men in tights' or at least lower it to yourself in weeks. The rating is Pg, as I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the movie except in the use of double entender and an expression of sh! T, and violence is minimal. In fact, I will go as far as say non-existent, except for a couple of comedy battle scenes. <br /> <br /> A fun movie that both adults and children will enjoy!
