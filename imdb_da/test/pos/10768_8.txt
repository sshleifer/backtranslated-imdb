In the second of his historical martial arts films, Chiba draws his real life orientation Mas Oyama. The movie itself recreates Oyama's incredible feat of killing a raging bull with its bare hands (Oyama did this over 50 times in reality). Dynamic combat choreography with authentic Kyokushinkai techniques. Ironically, this is one of the rare Sonny Chiba movies where he DOES NOT rip out or rip off body parts of opponents. One must watch for Sonny Chiba fans certainly one of his top 5 movies
