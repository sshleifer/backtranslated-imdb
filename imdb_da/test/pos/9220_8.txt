Um, hey .. Rainbow Brite .. the name alone is hard to take seriously, as if she could be a cousin of Strawberry Shortcake .. but when you are a child, it is absolutely serious thing. <br /> <br /> So there is this vain, snotty, spoiled girl, and she wants Rainbow Brite's belt, including all the light of the light, and Rainbow Brite and her friend Cris are bound and determined to stop her. As I recall, Murky and Lurky had a minor role in this production. Maybe they would have too much money? <br /> <br /> Yet, the evil girl has a strong jewel and she channels it to take Rainbow's belt .. imagine? But somehow, Rainbow gets his belt back and re-activates it with "stocking" and kicks the bad girls' scales with the help of Cris and his prism bracelet, and they also save the whole universe in the process. <br /> <br /> So good victory over evil, goodness triumphs over rudeness, and Rainbow Brite and Color Kids are once again confident of spreading color and joy for all of humanity.
