This film is one of the classics of cinema history. It was not made to satisfy modern audiences, so some people today may think it is creaking or silent. I found it absorbing all the way through. Cherkassov has exactly the right presence to play Alexander Nevskyi as he did when he played Ivan Groznyi (Ivan the Terrible) several years later. The music was beautiful. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was the bad soundtrack that was pretty confused. Although I only know a little Russian, it would have been nice to be able to choose more words than having to rely almost 100% on the subtitles. I saw this on an old video tape from the library. Perhaps there is now a DVD version where the sound has been improved. I would like to know if the actors used archaic Russian or even old church Slavic when they spoke. The subtitles were strangely worded and it is hard for me to tell whether this should reflect an older way of speaking or whether the subtitles were a little poorly done.
