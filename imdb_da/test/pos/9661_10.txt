My teacher made this movie. It is a new beginning. See it and you won't notice it's a Romanian movie. The old boring style has gone. Now it's something else. A post-revolutionary film. It uses the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists. They are unique. You do not even know that you are simply being transferred outside the screen and you will feel every frame. Don't miss it, pay attention to the plot, but don't ignore the details. They make the difference between this movie and the other Romanian films. You hear some music at some point. It is representative of some of us, but it does not represent us. Please keep your head straight and leave your body free.
