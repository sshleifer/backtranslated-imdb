This outlandish Troma movie is actually a great movie. It is known as their epic and best and highest rated production. Their version of Shakespeare's game is extremely fun with the usual dose of Troma nudity and gore. Troma has made some very good gore movies, one of my favorites being "Street Trash" and of course the Toxic Avenger movies. I have a Troma movie, "Terror Firmer" which has a reputation as their most beautiful and nastiest movie. I so much enjoyed "Tromeo and Juliet" that I finally have to see "Terror Firmer". This is a 2-disc Collector version with four comments and many many features. "Tromeo and Juliet" is an absolute hoot and highly recommended.
