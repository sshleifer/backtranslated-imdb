I rate this quite high just because of Sam Elliott. I could have done without the female nudity, but I would sit through almost any nonsense to see Sam strut his stuff. He gets to spot wonderfully cynical witticisms, many of which I agree with, and it's a joy to see him in a role where he actually comes to emote instead of just standing around scowling and looking virile as it may be . My girlfriend stated that this movie is in a couple of ways that resembles a movie where Ed Harris had a Spanish partner (in the sense of the police the term!), Who was a little superior to prove himself. You can draw your own conclusions about that score, but if you like Sam you will like this. One can say that I am biased, but who is not in any way? I wanted to buy this on DVD in a heartbeat!
