I thought it was a really good movie, especially because it was jut filler for me. I was sorry I got it from the library and I really enjoyed it! I've seen it twice in the two days, and the more I see it, the more I like it. I thought the plot was really corny, but in the end it could really be said that it would be true. I liked the main characters and I thought they were well thrown and you could see true friendship. I thought they all did an excellent job. The finish was good. And you really hate the bad guys and you really like the good guys. That's how a movie should be like.
