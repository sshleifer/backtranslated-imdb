"Who will love my kids" Saddest movies I've ever seen. Definitely 10/10. Published on television in 1983. Film has been released on VHS. DVD publishing is a must, rather than later. Mother who dies of cancer must find the home of all her children before she dies because her thoughts are that her husband and father of the children are unable to care for them when she is dead. She manages to get home to the children except one, a young boy who is not wanted because he suffers from epilepsy. Very sad when you didn't want to. In front of a really good toe rope, get your hands on this movie. I am a man even I cried when I watched this movie. Not to be missed.
