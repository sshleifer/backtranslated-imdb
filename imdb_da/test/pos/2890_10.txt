Rush in Rio is simply a fantastic DVD. This concert is one of the highest moments in Rush's history and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate enough to actually be in this concert, and not just that, I was in the very first row that grabbed the gate that separates the audience from the stage !! It's the first and only time I've seen a Rush concert live and it was a dream come true for me. I have no words to accurately describe this experience, but I can tell you that it is one of the highlights of my life. <br /> <br /> Some people complain about the sound of this DVD, saying it is not very clear and polished, but the sound you listen to is genuine, true to how it was in the concert. It's raw and powerful and so authentic that every time I see it, I go back and live the beautiful moment. Many artists record live shows and then they do a lot of tweaking, so the final product is far from what the actual concert really was. Sure you can achieve a very sophisticated and polished sound this way, but you don't get the right thing. This is not the case with Rush in Rio, this is the right deal !! I admit that I enjoy the fancy-sounding concert DVDs, I love music and the sound is a very important aspect, but listening to a concert that is so honest is refreshing. You listen to Rush, as well as sound in live performance, no tricks, no tweaks. This is a really live concert DVD. I highly recommend Rush in Rio, the set list is amazing, and the performances from Geddy, Alex and Neil are thinking. Not to mention the crowd, you can see how much they love Rush and sing together for every tune, even YYZ, which is an instrumental !! I actually seem to sing twice; In Tom Sawyer, I sing "always hope but still dissatisfaction" and in Earthshine I sing "reflect only". It's just a few seconds, but I simply couldn't believe my eyes when I saw myself in a rush DVD !! Fantastic!! I hope you enjoy this grand concert from the greatest band on Earth.
