* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the movie entertaining. It was weird and I enjoy it. I laughed a lot so the bottom is that I recommend the movie. But I have problems with what LaBute would say. plot is very simple. Betty (Renee Zellweger), a hard-life wife looking at her husband being murdered, and having forgotten everything she had seen, she follows her "true love" to a soap-and-jerk character, dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minute movie. And here comes the big question. What is the film about? The reference to "The Wizard of Oz" is obvious. Betty and Dorothy are both from Kansas, while at the end of this movie Dorothy comes to the conclusion that "there is no place like home", Betty does not come to a conclusion and at the end of the movie we remain strange what She has learned from her experience and the answer is simply nothing. It doesn't seem to affect her at all. <br /> <br /> But is the film about the differences between reality and fantasy? could be, but the scenes dealing with this topic are short and serve no more than a joke and not as a serious plot line that can take the film to other places. (and by the way "The Truman Show" dealt with this topic in a much better way). <br /> <br /> The movie could be about obsession. Betty is obsessed with soap series and Charlie (Morgan Freeman) is obsessed with Betty.LaBute shows two sides of obsession and he seems to forget that obsession, in any form is dangerous and must be condemned. He seems to be sympathetic to Betty's occupation because he sees it as a harmless one. <br /> <br /> For too long the movie we have scenes that could have been a subject for a whole movie in itself, but are left to us to think without affecting the characters. The end is simply a makeup that has nothing to do with what we saw before. It's a shame because the film could have been sharper if he'd concentrated in one or two subjects. As it is, it's all about much, but actually says nothing. <br /> <br /> What we are left with is the feeling that we have seen a little movie, funny and weird that could have been much more.
