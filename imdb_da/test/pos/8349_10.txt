Since I saw the trailer in "The Little Mermaid II: Return To The Sea" DVD, I had the feeling that this movie is going to be great, because I'm a great Disney fan. And guess what? I am right! This movie is a very worthy sequel to the original classic "Lady and the Tramp". <br /> <br /> It tells the story of Scamp, Lady and Tramp's mischievious son Scamp, who will be wild and free instead of living a housedog life. Although the movie may not be as good as the first, it has a great morale that you could not find anywhere else before you see it. <br /> <br /> I admit that the movie is not for everyone, but those of you who hate it, all I can say is that you don't have a spirit for this and I suggest you shouldn't see it again. But hey! It is truly an amazing story filled with brilliant animation, music and star-protected talents with Scott Wolf (Party of Five) and Alyssa Milan (Charmed). So if you haven't seen the movie, why stand there? Go and take the copy !!!
