I went into this movie and expecting a slasher, and while Mute Witness influences the style of film making, it's much more than just your average slash flick. There are a number of thrillers who focus on a particular disability - Blind Terror (Blind Terror, Wait for Dark, Cat o'Nine Tails to name a handful), but the consequences of having a blurred link in a thriller like this is well portrayed and actually integrated into the plot, because the fact that the protagonist cannot speak is often the reason why she finds herself in dangerous situations that it would be easy for others to get out of. Our bad witness is Billy Hughes, a make-up artist working on a horror movie production at a studio in Moscow. She finds herself locked in after hours one night, and after trying to call her sister for help, she stumbles over what initially seems to be making an illegal sex girl, but soon turns out to be a snuff movie! She tries to convince the authorities what she has seen, but finds that no one thinks her story ... Recently Hostel made the headlines to show snus film in a foreign country, but this movie did it first and actually does a better job . It may not be as unpleasant as Eli Roth's opus, but gore is more effective, and since Director Anthony Waller (who continued to lead one of my favorite modern thrillers with 'The Guilty') implements a good sense of humor in The case, Mute Witness is both sufficiently gory and fun to see. The director certainly has a talent for making exciting exciting rides, as this one never stands still. The ground is set in motion quickly, and Waller constantly introduces plotting, which gives a great helping hand to the film's overall entertainment value. The act is not bad for a B-movie, with young performing artists Marina Zudina, Fay Ripley and Evan Richards providing good performances. The atmosphere is greedy and the Russian places are suitably unfriendly, helping the film to maintain a tremendous atmosphere. Overall, Mute Witness is a much better movie than you might expect. The grounds flow well and the atmosphere and excitement are spot on.
