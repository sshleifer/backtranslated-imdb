So I guess Bud and Lou just like to row with classic stories (though they had some interesting results). In this case, the baby-sitting is a bad boy, and Lou is trying to read him "Jack and the Beanstalk," but falls asleep and dreams of being the butcher, Jack and Bud, and they climb the prayer glove to save the prince and the princess from the giant (Buddy Baer). I think my favorite scene was when Lou tried to make the giant an omelet, and ... I'll let you see what's going on. Since this was an Abbott and Costello movie, they had a couple of unnecessary songs, but apart from that, it was quite fun. For other interpretations of the classic story, "Bewitched" and "Gilligan's Island" both had episodes that portrayed it.
