Anyone who enjoys Lynchian's weird Twin Peaks, or a fan of HP Lovecraft who knows that the most frightening things are the familiar stuff, will really enjoy this movie. Don't see it as a horror movie in the "traditional" western sense, but more like a Grimm's adventure. It's gory and definitely for 16+, but when you start to see it, you'll also find yourself drawn into the whirlpool. Absolutely one of the movies that is connected to you for a few days after seeing (I'll never look at my snails the same way again!)
