"The Gay Desperado" is wonderful all the way through. The banter between Leo Carrillo and Harold Huber is as much fun as anything you would hear in a movie today. Best line? "That would be my third choice!" "Diego" is obviously the archetype of Kevin Smith's "Silent Bob". Lucien N. Andito's black-and-white filmography (especially with bandito's shadows) was striking. All I can say about Ida Lupino is, "God God for DVD!" You can go straight to the scene where she tries on sombreros and serapes and watch her standing in front of the mirror again and again. <br /> <br /> Let me forget that the Nino Martini guy sings really clean too.
