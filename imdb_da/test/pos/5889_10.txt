The best years of our lives are often compared to what is a wonderful life. They should never be. Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment on a war that took millions of lives. It's hard to know what value each life can have. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? What statistics do we have to live with?) Our feelings about war have also changed for 60 years. We have gradually moved from believing that the war is just if the enemy is right to believe that no war is just right, especially those that have been struggled recently. I've been a lifelong pacifist. I oppose all war. A long time ago I had tested that position. It happened while I was at the USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship required a crew that is 3 or 4 times the community in which I live. It's a powerful experience moving around on her deck. She had seen a lot of actions. Someone gave me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply bought. <br /> <br /> I can't see the best years of our lives without thinking about things like Lexington. <br /> <br /> Each of the three veterans paid their taxes. And they also paid mine. <br /> <br /> None of them became lighter than anyone else. Navy, Air Force and Army paid straight, though in different ways. Each had problems directly related to the war. And each had to work terribly hard to overcome these difficulties. It took more courage to meet their civilian environment than it did to deal with the war, for each had to do it alone. Anyone could understand and sympathize with someone else's problem: in the end no one could help. <br /> <br /> The moving part of the movie (this could be the beginning of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male leaders found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry the girl. Don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. It's hard for Harold to believe anyone could love him when he had been the football hero and athletic star before the war. But to his credit, Harold listens. <br /> <br /> The other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Edit your relationship with your wife? standard trade show for 30's / 40s movie. Derry did not debate the point: he felt he was not fit for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the movie comes out when we find that the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real feelings from real people. I believe our era has deep problems with feelings and feelings and honor. I sometimes think we think these values ​​do not exist. Perhaps that is why people watching this movie have problems. <br /> <br /> Al is not idle, he does not want completely. Every time his boss speaks to him, Al is bound in knots. And rightly so. There are some things that cannot be judged by industry standards: they must be judged by large general intangible assets, and only anyone tested by life's difficulty will understand what those intangible are. All this leads to a scene near the end, where all the aircraft that fought so violently were cut off, stacked, stored, discarded and soon reused: their function, worth and pride are as transparent as Derry himself. He can overcome the translucency that he does, and make him feel comfortable with the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> I gave the best years in our lives a 10 and there are few movies I feel that way about. This is not a popcorn movie. It deserves our attention. We are very privileged to fall into something as private as the lives of these wonderful people. We should be careful not to abuse the privilege.
