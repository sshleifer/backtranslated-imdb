Great film! One of the best movie noir movies ever made. Evil boys, bad girls, a jewel hoist, a twisted morality, a kidnapping, everything is here. Jean Servais has a face that would make Bogart proud and the rest of the cast is full of character actors who seem to know they are on something good. Get some popcorn and have a good time.
