There are many movies now on DVD, but the producers had forgotten some titles of importance to many movie gamers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites from the broad-screen era, had great budget pics profits. Many people from my generation learn a lot about Egypt's history, medieval Spain and even the Incas (the first time I heard from them was a very inexpensive adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Incas Treasure), the same happened to me with Egypt or Rome has seen many "bad" epochs in the era. many production values, excellent color utilization (De Luxe color was more Brigit and sharp as the regular Technicolor), perhaps the casting was wrong, but the film did in any case to give us an idea of ​​life in ancient Egypt and was in a way the engine to go out and buy the novel, my Mika Waltari, one of the best, if not the best, historical novel ever published. Also ousting was the amazing score of Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann. I saw this movie many times when I was a boy, it was not the big box office hit that Fox studios wanted afther The Robe to hit huge, in CinemaScope and Stereo was a wonderful eye-catching sp4ectacle. I have Lasser Disc version.m the only way to see Ito its wdisescreen format. Soon I will hope to show up.
