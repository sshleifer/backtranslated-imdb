Thursday is clearly derived from the "new wave" of crime films released since Quentin Tarantino took the genre by storm with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in the early 1990s, but it has enough ideas about it to ensure that it remains an interesting little movie. Thursday spends a few signs mostly within a single place. It works because each character is quirky enough in itself to be memorable, and when you put together what you got is a very entertaining little thriller. There is little substance found in the plot, but it does not matter because no one enters this kind of movie that expects a life-conscious experience. The reason follows Casey; a former drug dealer who has gone straight and now lives as a successful suburbia architect with his wife. The couple wants to adopt a child, but things get awful when Casey receives a visit from his old crime partner, Nick, who led a heroine case and a lot of money stolen from the police. Thursday will prove to be a very interesting day for our former criminals ... The first scene puts the movie up pretty nicely and ensures that we know what to expect. We see a coffee order go wrong, which turns into a murder scene, which the culprit immediately covers when a police officer comes in for refreshments. The scene is soaked with dark humor and witty dialogues, and it is carried on in the rest of the film. Thursday is a very fun movie, and scenes like those who see the adoption visitor come up at an awkward time to make sure the movie is hard to dislike. It is true that the film does not bring anything new to the table, cinematic or plot, but the fact that it is happy to turn in its tip ensures that there is more time for the absurd situation to build around the key characters. The play is decent enough, with the whole molding fun with this plot. Thomas Jane keeps the film together in the lead role, while entertaining depictions by James LeGros, Paulina Porizkova, Michael Jeter, Glenn Plummer and Mickey Rourke put him back well. This movie is unlikely to impress the experienced movie fan, but if you just want a fun little movie with a few comfortable phrases and performances; Thursday is probably enough.
