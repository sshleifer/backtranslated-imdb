Good admission of ships and aircraft in World War I complements this excellent war drama in the Adriatic. Walter Huston is excellent as the commander who knows his place and his place does not have room for personal feelings. The ship's security and mission must always come first. Robert Montgomery is a lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role of a leader in fighting. He makes poor decisions that threaten the submarine and the crew, but eventually becomes a "real man" after he has become a military force and dismissed from the navy. Robert Young plays a lieutenant junior grade and Jimmy Durante as a cook. Parallel to the war drama is an equally important war-time war triangle between Montgomery and Madge Evans, who plays Houston's daughter and wife for a tragic wound flying. Recommended.
