"What Alice Found" is the biggest movie nobody ever heard of! I underestimated it when I heard about it, and although it would be all sex, no plot and just really stupid, but in reality it was really good. They say every indie film sucks, but one and "Napoleon Dynamite" did not suck. I asked my friend who had seen it before I did, and she said that Alice has all those three-way and you see all this nudity, but no, there is no three way I remember and a little nudity. The movie had a point and it taught me that I never trust hitchhikers. I liked that in the end they got Alice a little dolphin eventually on their way to Flordia. I totally suggest watching this movie.
