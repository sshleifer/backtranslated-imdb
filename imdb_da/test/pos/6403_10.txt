This series, while idealized and fictionalized, has the quirkiness, sultriness, and kindness that comes from living on an island. <br /> <br /> For a couple of years I lived in one of the outskirts of Hawaii and found some fun, fun and fun people in some remote (non-touristic) areas. <br /> <br /> Whenever I see the series in this series, I am happy to compare my memories of experiences in out-of-road parts of Hawaii with memories portrayed and fictionalized in Key West. <br /> <br /> This series is not reality TV. I hate reality TV. <br /> <br /> It is from the era when people still wrote creative TV shows. Give me a "young writer" who takes their inspiration from "angels in the spray, the guides in the palms and the elves in the seashell" any day.
