I loved this movie. It manages to make the characters sympathetic (most of them) about the problems they have with their relationship. <br /> <br /> Gloria Swanson, like Leila, is in a dusty marriage with a man who almost doesn't notice her presence (though he notices her absence). The movie shows very well why she is tired of the married life and why she is receptive to a sweet-talking king without making her selfish or demanding. Leila's reaction shot at the dinner table on her anniversary while her workaholic man (late for dinner) eats salted shells with gusto and pushes the bridal and groom dolls out of his plate is perfect. <Br /> <br /> The show is stolen - and stolen effortlessly - by Elliott Dexter as Jim, Leila's negligent man. After losing Leila to another man, Jim literally cleans his action, shaves his mustache and works to lose the medieval spread and dressing nicely. There are several pictures of Jim at home, lonely and thinking of Leila, including a strong scene when he finds one of her old dresses in the closet. The movie gives the audience the benefits of watching Jim's transformation with Leila. It is not only the exterior that is more attractive; we learn much more about the kind of person Jim really is and we see how completely different he is from Leil's second man, Schuyler (Lew Cody). Dexter shines as before and after Jim, determined to win Leila back if he can, after discovering Schuyler's true character. The movie's most touching moment comes when Jim and Leila discover they are under the mistletoe, and Jim talks about what he has lost. Definitely worth a look.
