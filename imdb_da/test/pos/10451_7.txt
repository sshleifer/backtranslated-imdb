Yes it's a Fast Times wannabe, but it's still decent entertainment. Some of the comedy parts are really fun. The scene, when the three guys visit the Spanish lady, is fun, with a little flamenco music in the background. The reaction when her sailor husband comes home is a rebellion. The boys' use in crab handling is also fun when they try to "drown them" and when they visit the pharmacy. <br /> <br /> The abortion scene is also a Fast Times ripoff, but it does a good job of catching the terror of the situation. You really feel what Karen is going through and for Gary in her crazy struggle to pay for abortion and meet her recovery. The end is painful to see, but refreshingly realistic. First-time viewers will not be prepared for it and it will be a shock. There is a decent eye-candy to guys with young girls and the milf Spanish lady, but heterosexual guys might like to skip the penis measurement competition. <br /> <br /> Underrated soundtrack too. Check out early, early U2 (!), The Cars in their prime and an appropriate tearjerker song by James Ingram until the surprise ends. Some people will hate it and it is somewhat dated, but those who as a teenager or grew up in the early 80's should like it.
