One of my favorite movies. I like horses, I like happy ending and I like Walter Matthau. I miss him and am happy to have a good movie like this to remind me why he was so wonderful. See it with your children (or your horse). The story of an old hard-start horse trainer with children and down on his luck. If you've ever had or appreciated horse racing, you'll appreciate the rugs of wealth history. It may be a little under the "Seabiscuit", but not much. The story is the same, except for the quarter horse version. Well-acted, correct running conditions and equipment and fine racing scenes. Don't take my word for it, get it and make your own mind.
