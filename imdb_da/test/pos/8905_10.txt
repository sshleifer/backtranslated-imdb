Participating in this movie was an excuse to escape the work I had to do for my classes, but it turned out to be one of my best experiences here in France. The movie does a quick job of building multidimensional characters and has an extremely smooth story. The characters really had the voices you would expect to read the graphic novels, and the artistic talent exceeded my expectations. The music was captivating, and the comedy was playful and light-hearted, almost a flinstoneish inclusion of modern elements in playful manners. The film was attentive, sweet and action-packed at the same time. A wonderful story spun expertly. I want to show it to my French students.
