The SF assumption is not unique (although it was pretty much since then), but the focus is quite different from other artificial reality movies. Particularly in the first part, it is an elaborate crime scene that uses the SF premise to tell an unusual crime story where the coercive detective tries to solve a mystery with the impediment of vanishing signs and unhelpful witnesses who should not lie to being inappropriate. Instead of an unreliable narrator, we have an unreliable world. <br /> <br /> In Part 2 we follow the main character's struggle for hygiene and it becomes more of a psychological examination of a sign in an extreme situation. He knows that his existence is nothing but electrical impulses, how does he act with this knowledge? He knows there is a world that is more real than his, but he is trapped in an artificial world, a world where no one can understand him. The problem of thinking about knowing something important about the world that no one else knows or believes in is a very real thing that many of us can identify with. For me, the film transports this hopelessness very well with its dull, artificial atmosphere, which also supports the film's factual artistry. <br /> <br /> Other than 'The Matrix' or 'The Thirteenth Floor' is a little concerned with the induction of a sense of awe for its artificial reality plot, instead it focuses heavily on the psychological aspects. The philosophy is only so interesting that certain philosophical concepts are crucial to how they shape and change the character's perception of the world. It may be longer than it should be (which is not a problem if you are as imprisoned as I was) and part 2 is running low on steam.
