It was September 2003 that I heard that the BBC should revive Doctor WHO and make it "bigger and better", but I had heard these rumors in the press before and thought it was all they were - rumors. But it was then mentioned that Russell T Davies was supposed to produce and write the show and then a Saturday afternoon in March 2004 the Channel 4 news interviewed the actor who played in the title role - Christopher Eccleston. Yes, that Christopher Eccleston, an actor I have always been impressed with since he saw his film debut in LET HIM HAVE IT, and if he was interviewed on television, it must have been true. As the months passed more and more information was leaked, Billie Piper was thrown, Daleks had to return, and The Mill, the Hollywood effects company that made FX for GLADIATOR, was contracted to make the special effect of the show. For several weeks before the first broadcast trailers galore are called the return of the new series, massive billboards in London informed the public about the show's return. Tabloid magazines had massive image spreading of foreigners that appeared, and Christopher Eccleston appeared on programs as diverse as BLUE PETER, MASTERMIND (who had a special doctor's WHO night edition), this morning and Friday night with John Ross. In fact, this new series of DOCTOR WHO should have been the most frequent program in British television history, it was better to be bloody well <br /> <br /> So was it bloody good? It has undoubtedly been a great success with almost all episodes that make the top ten shows in the TV listings. To give you a clue to its assessment success, only one episode (The Ark In Space episode to - February 1975) from the old series made it to the top five television charts. The opening series episode made number three with two episodes either beating or matching the previous record and it is in an era where there is much more competition for television stations and selections. Let's laugh and cheer on the fact that DOCTOR stuffed HIT ME BABY A MORE TIME, FAILURE AND MALLED ANT AND DEC'S SATURDAY NIGHT TAKEAWAY. Of course, much of the success is down to the breathable images and cast by a well-known prestigious actor in the role. For the most part, everything you see on the screen here is like everything you want to see in a Spielberg / Hollywood movie. There is a Dalek invasion force that counts tens of thousands of exotic aliens, a 19th century Cardiff that resembles a 19th Century Cardiff and night movie that is actually night movie and not done by holding a dark filter over the screen. I promise you will hear much more from the directors who worked on this series, Joe Ahearne will be a particular day in the Hollywood A list. There are some flaws in the new series DOCTOR WHO and everyone has to be put to death by Russell T Davies. It may be disputed whether the soap opera and postmodernist elements are successful or not (in my opinion they are not), but it is not undisputed that the weakest scripts are written by the RTD. As I mentioned in my review of CASANOVA, he cheats the audience and he does the same here: when faced with armed soldiers pointing to their weapons at him. The doctor's belly "attack plan delta", which makes no sense to anyone in the audience, but allows him to escape from a tight spot, a nude captain Jack suddenly pulls a laser he has hidden and RTD scripts are full of this type of cheating and deus ex machina type endings. In fact, the last episode is spoiled by the ridiculous concept of "Bad Wolf" which seems to have brought RTD out of a tight place more than The Doctor. And by the end, do I try to remember if any of them were actually down to the doctor? More often than not, it is a supportive character or the doctor's companion who saves the day. The display is called DOCTOR WHO NOT ROSE TYLER, so can we see the title staff save the day, just as you did in the classic series? A final point about the doctor's portrayal is the way he is written as a grin. Eccleston is best known for his serious and gloomy roles, and he is quite breathtaking on scenes when he shows sorrow that the tear runs down in the face of the End of the World, but more often than not he is written as a "Tom Baker on Speed " Grade . It's obvious why Eccleston hasn't done much comedy in his career - he's not that good at it. <br /> <br /> Do I start to sound like I hate this show? Sorry, it was not the intention, but it is just that, while some expectations have been met or exceeded, some others have not, and they are almost all down to Russell T Davies, who fortunately contribute less to scripts in the next series by Doctor, who. Let's see more traditional stories of a human outpost threatened by monsters as we saw in the 1960s and 70s. Imagine a story like The Sea Devils with a massive budget directed by Joe Ahearne! Oh and a last request - Can we see these "NEXT TIME" trailers scraped? They reveal all the best pieces in next week's episode
