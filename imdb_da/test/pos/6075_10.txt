Even after all these years, this remains a "perfect movie" for me. I still remember sitting for a long time in the theater after it was over, stunned by the experience, overcome by emotions. I own the DVD (of course!) Look at least once a year. It's unparalleled, and I can't add much to the fact that it's already written about its expertise and beauty. So glad others love it as much as I do! One note: The author of the book on which it is based - Michael Ondatje - was enchanted with the movie and is quoted as saying that he would have thought of some of the wonderful scenes written exclusively for the film. The way Kip "invites" Hana to his side with a trace of small candles, and the way he arranges for Hana to see the frescoes in the ruined medieval church.
