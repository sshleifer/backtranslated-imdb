Although "the dead with their boots on" are not quite historically accurate, it is a very entertaining Western. Not only is Flynn the perfect Custer, character actors are amazing. Besides the action part of the film Flynn and DeHavilland's love scenes are very touching and credible. (Flynn and DeHavilland were very fond of each other in real life). Flynn was always so bothered to not be taken seriously if he only knew there were very few players who could play the characters he played and play them well!
