Great film. No free gimmicks like in most Hollywood movies. Everything supported the excitement of the plot. The b & w gave it a basic, no frills feel too. In short, it was visceral in its simplicity of film and cast. <br /> <br /> The following serves as an interesting contrast to Memento. Signs of both used manipulation and subterfuge to a large extent. That way, both reminded me a little about "In the company of men", also highly advisable. One difference between Nolan's two films is that Memento was a little easier for me to follow, as the b & w scenes progress in a constant chronological direction, and they also do in colors. I don't think it was right to follow where scenes seemed to be random. If you have the choice of video and DVD, I highly recommend DVD as it allows you to watch the movie once in chronological order, not only in the distorted (though brilliant) order presented by Nolan. It also makes it easier for another view to control the order together for yourself if you want. <br /> <br /> As another viewer noted, one of the best things about both this movie and Memento is that none of the cast was famous. They were characters, not big name actors who brought personas developed in other movies. Considering some similarities in the plots, I wonder if Memento is a kind of remake of the following, but intended to reach a wider audience, as Edward Burns did, She's one in the form of - and basically the one same cast as - The Brothers McMullan.
