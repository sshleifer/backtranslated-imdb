I hardly know where to start writing about this gem, except to say that it represents the young Buster Keaton at the top of his power and must surely be ranked with half a dozen best short comedies ever. made. THE GUEST is twenty minutes of smooth paced, professionally photographed, beautifully executed gags; two wheels with non-stop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending - which was not always with Buster's comedies. (See COPS for a case where fatalism eventually became better for him, or a week for the victory of defeat.) If I were to describe this movie in one word, I would call it "effortless" but if I was allowed two I would call it "seemingly effortless", for it is certainly going to be very hard work into the creation of any cartoon opus that unfolds with such a strange ease. Yet they didn't call him The Great Stone Face for nothing: Buster Never let the public see him sweat. A sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is set "along Millionaires' Row," that is, on a bread line in a grim city, where Buster waits patiently on the back of the line and as a result is not being fed. But it should be emphasized that he does not momentarily play for the pathos; Buster has our sympathy, but he never asks for it. For a long time, through a series of accidents, coincidences and absurd misconceptions, Buster is believed to be a fledged killer named Dead Shot Dan and is persecuted by every police officer around miles, yet while he is clearly appalled by this event, there is never a hint of self-pity or even surprise; we get the feeling that he always knew that this was what life would have for him and that he did not have time to be sad anyway, he has to find new ways to escape these cops and escape from the last trap. <br /> <br /> Just as Buster refrains from living for sympathy, he doesn't seem to be burdened by laughs, which is particularly impressive because the GED is one of the most frightening short comedies that exist. This is the movie that contains the iconic shot of Buster that runs a train's co-catcher right up to the camera's lens, which is not a gag exactly but sure is ridiculous in its own strange way. Meanwhile, there are gags involving weapons, dogs, the police, an incredibly hard mustache and a leather statue of a horse melting under Busters weight (a surrealistic view of reality), but some of the biggest boffos are saved to the finals when Buster is trying to elude his primary nemesis, Big Joe Roberts, a rotund cop who also happens to be the father of leading lady Virginia Fox. The jail in Big Joe's dining room, Buster's jump-frogs over him and sails through a transom, turns a phone box into a lift and pretends to disappear and ultimately uses the elevator himself to get rid of his pursuer and win the girl in time for a last fade-out gag. <br /> <br /> Saying more would be a disservice to first-time viewers. I just wish I could see this movie in a theater full of people who had never seen it before, and floated on the laughter. Live musical accompaniment would also be great; And by the way, the musical score that Kino delivers to their home video / DVD version of THE GAT is top notch, serving as an icing on an already tasty cake.
