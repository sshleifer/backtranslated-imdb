This is a true and faithful adaptation of 'The Hollow'. It can be argued that the actual mystery here is not a Christie's best, but what makes 'The Hollow' special is the characterization, and I found the actors here, more or less without exception, were perfect in their parts. In such a consistent good throw it is difficult to choose stand out performances, but I have to say that Sarah Miles is just as perfect as Lucy Angkatell. What is extraordinary is that she not only conveys Lucy's dottiness, tactlessness and her more lovable qualities, but she also manages to draw the underlying truth that Lucy is not that great! Megan Dodds is also very good as Henrietta and Claire Price affect much like Gerda. John Christow is really quite an unlikeable sign, but Jonathan Cake still manages to make us see what his women see in him. As I said, the script follows the story fairly faithfully. The only disturbing thing I found was that Midge and Edward's relationship really comes out of nowhere, and I think some of it should have ended up on the rocky floor! However, their secondary history and primary story are very well done. It all also looks beautiful and really takes a perfect English fall. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie in every respect and worth seeing.
