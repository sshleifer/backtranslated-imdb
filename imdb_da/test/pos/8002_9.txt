I really wanted to give this movie a 10. I have long believed it was my favorite of the four modern live-action Batman movies to date (and maybe it will still be - I haven't seen the Schumacher movies yet) . I also start to worry whether I am somehow unconsciously contradictory. You see, I've always seen the Schumacher movies. As far as I can remember, they were either 9s or 10s for me. But the conventional wisdom is that the two Tim Burton directed films are far better. I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman this time - I ended up giving it a 7 - and apologizing, as I might, I just couldn't feel that Batman Returns just has too many small directions, plot and script issues spread over to justify a 10. <br /> <br /> But Burton _most_ trumps the problems with sheer style, and although there are many small flaws, Batman Returns is still a good movie, especially if you are a Burton fan as Batman Returns has as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as it does with anything else in the Batman universe. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Cobblepots to have a baby. We see their dissatisfaction - people are leaving the birthplace with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. Later they have the baby in a small cage. Finally, they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the Gotham City River. The baby ends up being Batman villain The Penguin (Danny DeVito). Meanwhile, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is the movie's "evil capitalist" comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He plans to dump Gotham City in various ways and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary, the crooked Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of the imprisoned grounds, Grissom tries to get rid of her, but she is being rescued by cats, becoming Catwoman. <br /> <br /> While all this goes on, The Penguin, who has long been the only rumor to exist and who is considered dangerous, begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy, despite having less than benevolent, backward motives. Before you see Burton's Batman movie again this time, I couldn't remember how little movies are about Batman (Michael Keaton). It's almost as if Burton didn't feel the character was interesting enough to focus on. The focus here is much more on villains, especially The Penguin. Batman does not appear very often, especially at the start of the movie, and surprisingly often we see him see The Penguin. Although some viewers necessarily count the above as a mistake, I cannot say that I do, though I would like to know more about Batman and follow his story more. The villains' stories are also interesting, and as a "story of origin" for two big Batman villains, Batman Returns is already more complicated than plot. However, there are some sign issues that I consider to be a mistake. The penguin has a cadre of circus artists who make his bid, but even though they are often on the screen, we never learn anything about them. Burton has a core of characters as exciting as those in Tod Brownings Freaks (1932), available with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he just doesn't have room to use them. <br /> <br /> For that, he barely has room to explore Catwoman. The movie plays as if Catwoman might have been so developed and highlighted in so many scenes as The Penguin, but the movie cut would have been 4 hours long. Then most of the Catwoman scenes had to be carved. Of course, all this leaves almost no room for Batman. Burton has Batman very dark in the public eye in this movie, and unusually, he never has trouble solving this. As far as we know, at the end, Gothamites still believe that Batman is a killer. It's an interesting development, but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this movie and the next. <br /> <br /> Regarding the script, although there are minor issues, including some non-sequiters and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic) made of characters, it is clear that Burton and authors Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not even trying to tell a traditional story. Much of the dialogue is point-oriented, but it is often quite subtle and / or complex (of course it is sometimes very obvious or transparent). It helps to see Batman Returns as a more "poetic" movie that I thought was intended. This also translates into more general plot and director decisions - lots of odd character acts, including from minor characters, are performed in general mood or style service, and that style works very well. <br /> <br /> "Dark" is the easiest way to summarize Batman Returns in a word and whether it is positive or negative depends on your disposition. Anyone who knows me knows that I love darkness. So for me, Burton's style surpasses the basics of the plot and script. In many ways, Batman Returns is like an insane, campy horror movie with beautifully annoying production design. Like Batman, Burton still makes many references to other movies, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (there is still a small Star Wars reference), he invokes films like Nosferatu (1922) Max Schreck "was the name on the actress who played the Dracula-like character there), Motel Hell (1980), the aforementioned Freaks, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal dark edge) zombie film - made the most explicit in the final scene of the penguin. br /> With regard to visual and general atmosphere - and that includes the general "feel" of the story, the characters, and so on - this couldn't be a stronger 10.
