Most movies from Hollywood seem to follow one of a few preformed and highly predictable plot. This movie is not a perfect example of what I see in the IFC. <br /> <br /> There's a guy, Michael, and his girlfriend left him with a word. He wants to know what happened. Is she okay Can he say goodbye? Maybe get some closure. He has not been able to contact Grace, and in an attempt to find her, he has made a movie asking for your help. <br /> <br /> Michael figurines we might need a reason to help him so he tells us his story by reliving his relationship with the help of a friend (Nadia) to play the role of Grace (the girlfriend left) <br /> <br /> The sight is 20/20, and that is no different for Michael. By telling his story and getting feedback from his friends, he realizes his mistakes and how much he appreciates what he has lost. Unfortunately, it's a lesson we've all had to learn (or need to learn) and are easy to identify with. That's what makes you hear more about Michael's story and wants to know if he finds Grace.
