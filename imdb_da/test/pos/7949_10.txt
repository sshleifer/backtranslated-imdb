I was fortunate enough to watch this movie in the recent international film festival here. I could actually see another South Korean movie (The Power of Kangwon Province), but Christmas in August got my attention more. The story is simple enough, the usual boy-meeting girl (or should we say girl-meeting-boy?). What made it special for me was how it was done. We can say that the film was quiet and endearing. We do not have flashy and constructed romance here, only two common beings made wonderful of their friendship and unspoken love for each other. I also loved how the film used images as an expression of past and present relationships. I wanted this to be shown here as a regular movie. I'm sure it would call out to a larger audience.
