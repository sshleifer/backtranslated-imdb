A very strange, psychedelic, esoteric (and I said oddly? :) experience. But at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. The glowing gap between the stupid, crafted, Hollywood look at teen pop idols, which was the Monkees TV show and the adult, musical growing and evolving, yet a little stupid Monkees from the 70's and over. <br /> The main line of the movie is Mike Nesmiths, "If they think we're plastic now, wait until they see how we do it." That the monks were tired of all the negative comments about their image and their work is a matter of record. They said it over and over in interviews. They had to recreate themselves and what better way to de-bunk and hilariously lampoon the actual machine that created them. And at the same time, they commented on our entire community (news, movies, art, everything) and said, "Hey, why choose us - not all of these things are made at some point." These are the Orwellian "proles" (the monks represented the persecuted "everyman" even in their silliest in the television series) pulling down "big brother" pants and kicking him in his very deserving shame. <br /> <br /> Loved the ideas, loved the music, loved the effects, loved the movie! But then, as Peter Tork says in the movie: "But then why should I speak, since I don't know anything?" :)
