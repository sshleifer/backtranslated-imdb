My friends and I spent most of a Saturday afternoon watching a selection of "bad" movies. Among the flicks we looked at was the strongest competitor (for quality bad movie fare) lightly Jack-O. It's ridiculous that movies like "Gigli", "Glitter" and "You Got Served" are listed in IMDB's bottom 100. While they are definitely bad movies, they do not belong in the bottom 100. They rob "Jack -O" and "Keeper of Time" etc. Of the bad movie the greatness they deserve so right. <br /> <br /> So what makes Jack-O so great (in bad movie terms)? For starters, Steve Latshaw, the director, decided to throw his son, Ryan Latshaw, in the role of Sean Kelly. Unfortunately for Steve, Ryan Latshaw was dangerously close to being out of block of a tree. The child has seriously no ability to emote at all. The end result: accidental comic gold. The child could listen to a joke or just moments away from getting the head smashed and his expression is one of stony "numbness". The other aspect of the movie that we found fantastic was the sheer number of "double dreaming" sequences. What is a double dream? Well, that's when a character wakes up from a nightmare, and then something just as nightmare happens, and then the character wakes up again. Basically, they wake up after dreaming of waking up from a nightmare. Smart device, no? I think Sean Kelly's character saw no less than 3 double-dreaming sequences. <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what more? Oh yeah! This movie has a true cast of thousands. It is really amazing to see how many speaking roles are introduced during the movie. Best of all, almost none of the characters have anything to do with history. They are either killed by Jack-O, or they serve no purpose. Jack-O himself was pretty sweet. Like most other B-movie monsters, Jack-O has the amazing ability to teleport over long distances. He is always hanging, somewhere in the background when you are dealing with a great character. What is confusing, however, is that when he actually chases a person he is moving in a shopping / stumbling pace, and yet he can keep up with the people who sprint. That's all for now. Concluding remarks: If you are looking for an accidental hilarious movie, you cannot go wrong by renting this animal. <br /> <br /> Bad Movie Score: 7/10 Good Movie Score: 3.5 / 10
