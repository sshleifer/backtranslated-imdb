"... beat is too strong ... we are deaf mutants now - like them", Rex Voorhas Ormine <br /> <br /> I'm surprised this movie has been uniformly based. Let me be the first to actually discuss the "Beat" virtues and why should you watch this movie now. <br /> <br /> Don't make a mistake, this movie is cheesy and "bad" in the conventional sense: the story is hasty, poetry is stupid, and the play is inconsistent. <br /> <br /> But it's the movie's CHARMS - all these ingredients make up the recipe for one of the most UNDERAPPRECIATED CHEEZY FILMS from the 80s. <br /> <br /> If the reference to "deaf mutants" didn't tickle your interest, then maybe it would: What kind of name is "Rex Voorhas Ormine" anyway? It's such an unusual name (for the North American audience) that I told myself, "even the names of the characters in this friggin movie are bad." <br /> <br /> Well, "The Beat" is so fabulous cheezy that the "meaning" and "symbolism" behind "Rex Voorhas Ormine" are not revealed too subtly by Bart Waxman (the rude adviser you love to hate ). I don't want to spoil the revelation behind Rex's name, but please don't get too excited, okay? <br /> <br /> Overall, the play is inconsistent (John Savage - who plays the "concerned teacher" Mr. Ellsworth is pretty good, just as the member plays Bart Waxman, but the rest of the throw is not convincing). That said, the actor does NOT interfere with the movie. Why? There is a SINCERITY in each of the actors' notions that make the characters they play unique. So even though the performances can be sucked, you're still left with the impression that the actors are really trying to do their best. As a result, the actors' sincerity succeeds where their actions fail (which is quite often). The greeting to "poetry" in this movie is bad, bad, bad. But it's a good, good and good thing when it comes to entertainment. Do you actually enjoy "better quality" or "more respectable" poetry - especially in a movie like this? People it would be to live (think of the dragon they made us read in high school - sanitized to avoid "destroying the youth", politically conservative and without any critical analysis, etc.) Even if you don't like poetry or " arty "movies (with all the" intellectual "attitudes that involve), you can most certainly (and should) appreciate the LUDICROUS POETRY in a WANNABE ART FILM !!!! How could you not enjoy the following? <br /> <br /> "Do you remember your dinosaur's roar? A woman's scotty craps on the floor badly scotty bad, oh the woman is so sad, she washes her hands and then waits at the door today, yes - today!" It is an example of some of the remarkable poetry flowing across the Beat. But what about the story, you ask? <br /> <br /> Now, the story is confusing. But then again, this is the beauty of this movie. Apart from some clichés, stereotypes and predictable plot points, there are probably really unique elements to the plot / story to keep things interesting. Who is Rex? Where did he come from? What is he talking about? Døvmutanter? Illiterate Angels? Billy and Kate really understand what Rex says? Should the audience understand Rex and his poetry pose? (I've watched the movie several times, and I still haven't found everything out.) Will bad poetry and high school literacy really show YOU VIOLENCE? <br /> <br /> I guarantee you have never seen anything like "The Beat" - a perfect combination of brilliant bad poetry, mediocre-yet-sincere action, and a "mythopoietic conquest of gang violence" story that Have to be destroyed by any movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Bonus for classic NYC hardcore fans: Cro-Mags makes a rare movie look like "Iron Skulls," and it's a good idea to see them perform multiple songs. I wish they included more concert films, but maybe it would be an "extra" included on the "collector's edition" DVD I fantasize about. <br /> <br />
