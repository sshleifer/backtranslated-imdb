I agree with "johnlewis" who said that much has happened between the lines of this film. While I think the pacing of this movie can be improved, I think the complexity of the relationship between the characters is fascinating. <br /> <br /> Examples: <br /> <br /> Pierre must marry his cousin, even though his love for her seems very cousin-y? <br /> <br /> Pierre, Lucie and Thibault seem to have a triangular relationship, and the actual points to the triangle aren't quite sure ... Lucie's brother is a bit eunuch or is he? <br /> <br /> And Isabelle, who is she really ?? <br /> <br /> All in all, I think it was worth my time. An interesting movie and one that makes me read Melville.
