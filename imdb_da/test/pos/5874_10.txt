What can be said about any Wilder movie, except that they are the most human and real stories of humans, and what drives them, traps them, haunts them. Billy created images as paintings that stand forever reflecting the human condition. He paints the good and the bad in all of us. He also paints love. I can't imagine anyone having a list of best movies without a Wilder movie on it. They will last because they are true. I first saw this movie on television in the 60's when I was a kid, and I had to leave the room because I felt tears rolled up in me and became embarrassed. Now I am an old man and I still feel tears welling but not leaving the room. I knew these people and loved them and grew up around them. Billy kept them in this movie and not in a "greatest generation" way, but in a most realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit.
