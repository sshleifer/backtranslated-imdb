Okay, so there are always people out there who seem to make it a point not to like movies because they are good but instead choose to like movies based on how depressing or boring they can be or whether they come from a foreign country . All that sits is One Crazy Summer the perfect example of what a great American teen comedy should be. The jokes are a good mix of slapstick (a la Bobcat Goldthwait), surreal (Bobcat under Steve Holland's inspired direction) and dry (John Cusack, one of the most morosely dry and fun actors in American cinema), and there is no character in this movie that does not deliver at least one fun line (ok, except Demi Moore). Yes, it is immature, yes it is screw ball, yes, Bobcat dress up as Godzilla and waste a scale model of a seafood restaurant. It's also fun as hell. See it.
