The Vietnam War era is certainly far ahead of my time, but it has always interested me, and I have seen many movies about it. All the others I had seen had handled strictly with the front line of the battle. When I read a description of "The War Home," I found the concept exciting. No Vietnam War movie I had ever heard of talked about what happens to a soldier when the fighting is over. <br /> <br /> One night while flipping through channels, the movie played on The Sundance Channel. I put the remote control down and hit me back to see it. I did not move from my seat during the two hours; It's one of those movies that keeps you very interested because there is no way to predict what will happen next time. <br /> <br /> This movie made me a big fan of Emilio Estevez. I had had him much like Billy the Kid in the "Young Guns" movies, but I never saw anything he did afterwards. Emilio proved to be very talented in writing and directing as well as acting. <br /> <br /> The filming of the film has been performed extremely well. I am hard pressed to think of a point where it draws. <br /> <br /> What amazes me is that it didn't get an Oscar or any real recognition when it came out. It is a dramatic story of parents trying to cope with the fact that their son is not the one he used to be and probably will never be as they remembered again. Definitely worth a look.
