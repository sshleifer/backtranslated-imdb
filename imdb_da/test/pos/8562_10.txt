I watched this movie with my family over a long Thanksgiving holiday weekend. I'm grateful that someone insisted that we look at it, even though I didn't pay much attention to the end of the movie when a head cut seems promised, but unfortunately it doesn't. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I watched this movie some years later and loved its liveliness, absurdity, glittering, and just fun. I think the movie has a female tone. Women are not exploited in it, though I'm sure someone might think the movie is pure exploitation. I think the movie plays with the tropics during the period. <br /> <br /> I keep thinking that someone should recreate it. And meat out some of the implications of the original.
