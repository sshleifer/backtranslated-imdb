I don't understand why this movie has such a low rating. It deserves more! Sure, it's totally ridiculous, but that's what it should be. Don't Expect Movie Override from a Beauty Contest Competition Movie Stranded on a Caribbean Island! What you should expect is a great spear on virtually all relevant sci-fi, fantasy and block-buster movies in movie history, and even references to other spoofers. Everything quite exaggerated and sometimes completely unnecessary, but that is exactly what makes this movie stand out. If you like parodies and enjoy saying Leslie Nielsen or Mike Myers, you'll love this. I sure did!
