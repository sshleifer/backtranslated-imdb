Scandinavians are pretty good at making me laugh at the death of rare life, huh. The movie production here was incredibly meticulous, every piece of framing, every death post staring, every element of the color palette, every snatch of muzak or whooosh of these street men was there to hammer home this world's quiet emptiness. In fact, I think I might have found the general sense of emptiness indulgent if its absurdity had not become really fun and relatable. Like when Andreas tells his boss that he misses children and looks up and the guy smiles and halfway out of the door, it's a kind of sad but genuine reflection of working with people, spending 7/8 hours a day with them, watching more Those than the people you love, but ultimately knowing deep down, do not give you anything about your problems and the same. <br /> <br /> This could have been a movie that Coens had made if they were born in Oslo and not Minnesota. I think their humor is more aggressive and more wrapped up in the cinema's past, but they have the same technological excitement, and their movie has the same underlying sense that life is rather inconsistent. I stop before I talk myself into taking a bus into the wintery desert.
