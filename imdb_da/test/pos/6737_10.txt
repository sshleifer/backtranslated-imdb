I love this movie. The molds were all fantastic in the depiction of their various characters. Judith Ivey performed so well a weak, dreadful, addict who was passive aggressive in her complaining and independent character, that it was a relief to see the metamorphosis of the character. Blythe Danner was as appealing in her role as a somewhat judgmental Jewish mother, devoted wife and loving sister. Jonathon Silmerman, Bob Dishy, ​​Stacey Glick and Lisa Walz performed their roles equally well. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies relating to going through challenging times without losing your sense of humor and hope, you will love this movie.
