Flowers! If it's one thing you take away from this movie, it will be the flowers. They are so prominent and used as plot units, and you become an expert in identifying with daisies and black tulips when the movie ends. Daisy is in Amsterdam, Daisy tells the frustrating Love Triangle story between 1 girl and the 2 men in her life. One is a professional hitman who dispatches, the other is an Interpol agent. With a pan-Asian cast (Korean, Hong Kong) and crew (director Andrew Lau from Hong Kong, author from Korea and a Thai post-production team) I could imagine headaches in coordination. <br /> <br /> Park Yi (Jung Woo sung) is a hit man who found a soft spot for the painter Hye-young (played by the beautiful Jeon Ji-hyun). It is love at first sight in the dais of daisies, where her clumsy got her attention. But to be shy and always aware of the dangers of his professional career, he can only admire her from afar, make small (or perhaps large) things in an anonymous way, but the one who takes the cake sends her potty everyday without error at 4:15. He becomes her host's distant angel, protects her and keeps her safe from harm. <br /> <br /> Hye-young is in love with this mysterious stranger. She is constantly waiting for him to show up, but I really wonder how hard it could get the almost punctual daisy delivery. Nevertheless, she has been terribly moved and affected by this only action. But as the stars wanted it, interpol detective Jeong Woo (Lee Sung-jae) chances for Hye youth in a square under one of his undercover missions, and he is also captivated by her. Because of his profession, he is equally questionable whether he should make the first move. <br /> <br /> This is where the audience would find it frustrating. Of course, the lady would fall for the wrong guy (again it is the "good" guy), Park Yi gets confused by Jeong Woo's pursuit, yet he still refuses to step out and identify himself, and Jeong Woo is the opportunist to grab free anonymous identity unconsciously. It's almost like you will give everyone a blow to wake them up completely. <br /> <br /> It's just as exciting that it is this excitement that keeps you fascinated. And it's funny fun to see the two male leaders who find it hard to fall in love without endangering their careers or their loved ones. But do not fret action fans, there are enough cat-and-mouse revelations and invisible companionship in the form of Infernal Affairs, as well as plentiful shootings, though I felt the ending could have been scripted tighter. <br /> <br /> Which cuttings are the clever editing. Tells the story on a non-linear timeline (no worries, it's not that bad, you can still follow the story) from all the leaders' views, stay in excitement and culminate in a three-part split screen showing all their feelings in a single converging event that I thought was extremely well done. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie about landscapes of lush meadows and bustling city squares with lots of classical music to soothe the soul. As with romance films, all the leaders are eye lights - the girls want a field day with the two handsome male leaders, while the boys have to do with a somewhat pudgy-faced (argh! OK lah, in some angles) Jeon Ji-hyun. <br /> <br /> If you are in a romance movie with equal balance in the action / thriller, Daisy will be your choice. If you prefer a more conventional laugh then the other Korean film debuting here at the same time you are my sunshine would be your alternative. And yes, I totally dig the end of the scene as I thought only the Koreans do it best? Kinda reminded me of JSA one.
