It is almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious three-color review: RED without letting people get into some of the ideas Krysztoff Kieszlowski has explored in the two previous entries to this fascinating trilogy. The more I see them and think of them and imagine myself in their world, the more I get their theme: that we are more connected with each other than we would imagine, and all it takes is a small hand of destiny to set some events going on. In BLUE, Juliette Binoche played a grieving widow whose plan to live her life without connections to the past had her meet someone unexpected. In WHITE, an act of cruelty creates an unlikely friendship between two men who, unlike odds, will conspire to bring the perpetrator to court and full circle. And now, in RED, all fate elements and apparently coincidence apply to the meeting of a young Genevese model and a retired judge who has a habit of engaging in the lives of others. <br /> <br /> This young girl is appropriately named: Valentine (a shining Irene Jacob) who has this radiance on her and even smiles openly while working on the runway. Not that she is without luggage: she has a girlfriend, invisible, who also needs to know what she is doing at all times, she has a brother who cares about her, and she rejects the progress of a photographer working on her picture for a big billboard. She hits a dog while driving and nurses her back to health, but when she takes her to the owner, a retired judge (Jean Louis Trintingnant), he will not have her. "I don't want anything," he says coldly, and BLUE elements suddenly show themselves as this arrogant man who also lives in anonymity and apparently free-flowing freedom, monitors unsuspecting people. This male version of Juliette Binoche's character at first shock Valentine - she says she can only feel sorry for him when she goes away in horror, but a chance event has its back in his place and here he begins to reveal who He is, and his great loss. At the same time, Kieszlowski plays a parallel story: a young man's story, Auguste (Jean Pierre Lorit), who continues to be a judge and lives across the street from Valentine - but they still disappear. Chances are the word. Just as Valentine wins the jackpot in grocery history, she visits elements of chance pepper her life and Augustes. He has a boyfriend who also delivers people with phone calls on the weather. One of them is the old judge. He knows more about her than Auguste does, and he never met her. As God or Prospero, he slowly creates a storm that will break the walls of this present state of conformity and bring a new meaning to the phrase "We meet again." It is this parallelism between the old and young judge that makes RED so beautiful and transcendent, because time is really much more fluid than we would like to consider. There are people we meet in life that if we were only born in similar time frames, so many things would be different. <br /> <br /> That's the case with Valentine and the old judge. I think there is certainly a strong brotherhood of souls that bind them together in a close bond: she is the woman he did not meet - by chance or not - and is whether he knows it or not , trying to make changes so why he is at great risk of revealing his monitoring and becoming the social exclusion. But it doesn't end there. One of the many connections between the three films is the character of an old woman who goes to a large trash can. Where Julie did not see her (and would not have helped her at least), and Karol fresh from her public humiliation spun on her thinking: "Someone is worse than I am" Valentine is the one helping her. Weakness in distress can happen anywhere, and Kieszlowski uses it right here in a minor nature. Now, RED is so much more than a story. Valentine, the old judge Auguste, even draw the dog: these are not signs limited by narration. An American version would destroy the idea and advertise possible meetings and even produce a dumbed-down ending. RED is so devoid of a linear, defined plot that something can happen to any of these people, and the possibilities that this story could have confused in so many directions had a decisive element not found at the exact time and place. <Br /> <br /> Adding to the concept of characters that reflect each other despite time frames or placement is the theme of sexual fraud. This is also an important and distinctive element in all three films: in BLUE, Julie's husband had a mistress, and she also betrays Olivier when it becomes clear that she is emotionally dead. WHITE, Dominique has listened to her moan over the phone (which becomes an important unit in RED) when she has sex with a man while Brigite Bardot's CONTEMPT looks at the table. In RED, the old judge's story of love and betrayal is reintroduced. And all this time, Valentines billboard image over them as a precedent of what to come at the same time, that Rita, the dog Valentine's car hit, carrying seven tits, life renewed to the six major players of this complex trilogy, of course care and love. Why do I say six? You have to watch the movie and wonder.
