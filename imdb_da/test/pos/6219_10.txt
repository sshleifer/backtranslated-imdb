This enchanting film is based on a novel by Arto Paasilinna. Bestseller is one of the best books I've read. Here's the story: <br /> <br /> A day journalist and photographer Kaarlo Vatanen decides to leave his past and begins a new life that wanders over the Finnish forests and landscapes. With him he has a companion, a young hare hit by a car. The vatten must take care of the hair because it is the leg wound, so they start a journey together and take care of each other. <br /> <br /> During their adventure, they are almost shot by hunters, caught by the police meeting many people and finally coming to Lapland, where they live peacefully until a group of foreign tourists disturb their privacy. The hare becomes ill and they must return to Helsinki to see the vet. <br /> <br /> The Vatican has found an ideal way to live, but modern society is trying to tie it back to its duties and taxes. In Helsinki, the Vatan took to drink, just got engaged and imprisoned, but finally he fled and hauled.
