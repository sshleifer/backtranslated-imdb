A group of evil businessmen have to knock down a building to build a large complex, but they can't remove the tenants. The tenants and businessmen with their hired fines collide until the movie ends with one of the funniest matches ever! The guy with ginger hair that goes 'eeeeehhhh' every time he throws a blow and the other guy who stands with a knife in his mouth instead of fighting, only to be knocked off the camera, makes this important show if you can likes to laugh movies rather than with them.
