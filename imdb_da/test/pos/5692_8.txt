"Black Water" is one of the most exciting films I've seen in a long time. The story moves fast as it follows three tourists (all the great actors) into a swamp on a tour with a slaughter guide on a small boat. Soon after having anchored in a remote area of ​​the swamp, they have been turned over by something big in the water. Hastily, the three manage to make it a tall tree nearby when they realize that a crocodile has attacked them. Over the next two days, they will desperately try to escape the crocodile's evil-minded eye, and he doesn't seem to be go away. The movie just pulls a little, but what can you expect from the setting and the limited budget? It's so much better than "Primeval" and other recent crocodiles / underwater predators. The excitement is heavy and all three leads provide great performance. Really chilling, this movie struck a deep chord of claustrophobic fear in me. Apparently based on true events.
