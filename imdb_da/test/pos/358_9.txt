One of Chaplin's longest films so far, Burlesque on Carmen is a smart and surprisingly complex parody of what was then "Prosper Merimee's" famous story of "Carmen". I was a little confused about the difference between the IMDb listing of the 1915 Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on maturity, I assume it was the 1915 version that I saw since 1916 is a good 20 minutes longer and from what I have read, there are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it is clear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplin's most complex and ambitious efforts to date, starting with a long-standing story, told through intertitles, about the tragic love story of Carmen. <br /> <br /> Carmen is sent by a band of gypsies ("A band that put GYP in gypsy.") to seduce a Spanish officer so they can pull out their smuggling business. It's a wise, Chaplinesque band of criminals whose leader, Lillas Pastia, has "spent 50 years learning to steal, thinking he could be offered a job in politics." <br /> <br /> On a side note, I have seen some almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of Chaplin's past work, but probably not as obvious as in this one. At the start of the movie, there is a scene where the mules and women set up, and as a group of gypsies travel, and an inter-title explains that "the mules are those with long ears." If you couldn't tell, I guess. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays the part of Don Jose, the unfortunate officer to be seduced by Carmen. He is described as "a brave soldier and lover of women." Not exactly a stretch for Chaplin, who dispelled any doubt about his ability to play a compelling comic soldier a few years later in the brilliant shoulder arm. And of course he didn't have to be a lover of women. What is different here, of course, is his polished military uniform and straight-backed disciplinary way, blasted, of course, with some of his traditional slap-stick movements. He strikes me as a little guy in a governmental position struggling to maintain respect for his subordinates by exercising a gruff, stole exterior. <br /> <br /> Soon Carmen comes in ("Loved by all men under the age of 96 ??) and she immediately starts flirting with Charlie. I should mention that for a large majority of the movie it is surprising Believe in the original story full of jealousy and tragedy, Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover who can evoke a jealous passion that I have never seen from him, at least there is a scene where he is really a little scary. <br /> <br /> Chaplin has some good sight gags in the movie, like a fun table dance and some classic sword fighting in the end, and his boyish charm and role as a soldier is certainly a winning combination even though there is another peculiar stunt involving a group of men pushing a large door back and forth, which was not very effective at first but just continued and over and over, probably about five times longer than it was worth, even though it was interesting that when it finally fell over It was clearly revealed as a movie prop. I always appreciate such glimpses at the old movie sets. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is the strongest part. It has striking resemblance to Romeo and Juliet, but just as you think Chaplin is going to do a great thematic experiment by deviating far from its traditional style, there's a fun twist that's like vintage Chaplin as something I've ever seen. Nice work!
