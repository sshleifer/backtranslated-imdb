I really only saw this movie because it had Rupert Grint in it (which I knew as Ron from the Harry Potter movies). I had never really appreciated Rupert as an actor until this movie. I loved the whole movie. Rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious, quirky movie. I think the movie could have been fine without the meat, but it worked out somehow. I can't wait to see more of Rupert's films in the future. Julie Walters also did a fantastic job. In the Harry Potter films, she has a very small role so I didn't even know what to expect from her either. But she was wonderful as Lady Evie. The part where she turns off the key was absolutely fun. Overall a great movie.
