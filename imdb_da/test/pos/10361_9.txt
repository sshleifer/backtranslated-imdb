This film shows absolutely something and portrays what is happening in most institutions today, and shows how a gurl can only do things through his newspaper, has the editor's full faith in her and does not publish anything important because it would hurt her friend ... and when it was the right time she took the necessary action. <br /> <br /> The movie overall got a rating of 9 from me because it got everything I think it keeps you entertained, and by the way, they have acted really well for a TV movie, it's really high quality, That deserves a lot of credit.
