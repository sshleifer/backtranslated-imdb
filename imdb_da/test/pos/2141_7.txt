I've been a fan of Heaven's Gate since its first release. I have seen it at least fifty times and have long thought of it as a masterpiece. So it was with excitement and a sense of expectation that I went to see the restored director's cut. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I was disappointed to see it again and have since reviewed my film review. The sky's gate touches on the greatness of parts, but generally the thematic and narrative consistency and the passionate urgency are characteristic of a truly great film. First, two technical issues: the sound quality is diffuse throughout the film, sometimes about inconsiderate. Some of this may be intentional - a way to imitate chaos and confusion of history as it unfolds. But at key points one cannot record what the characters say. <br /> <br /> The kinematics are also diffuse. The images lack sharpness and specificity of details. The result is a specific graininess and lack of image sharpness that succeeds in blurring the foreground and background. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the narrative is absolutely the key throughout, as if Cimino can't quite imagine what effect he is after. He wanted an epic, surely. But a pastoral or dramatic epic? The film sits uncomfortably and convincingly between styles and perhaps even genres. At times it reminded me of Terrence Malick's 'Days of Heaven' or even 'Elvira Madigan' in her light pace and elegant stage painting. At other times, it threatens to become a robust 'western' more like 'The Wild Bunch'. In fact, the latter offers an educational reference point for an assessment of 'Heaven's Gate' as it shares the same period and employs a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for a darker yet heroic America. <br /> <br /> This structural and thematic uncertainty is not helped by the poor quality script that often sounds forced and curled to the ear. The result is an unauthorized sense of period speech. <br /> <br /> The Gate of Heaven is approaching in its fixed pieces. The roller-skating sequence is particularly stunningly beautiful, one of the most evocative scenes ever set for film. Another set piece that works very well with regard to unifying theme, mood and attitude, happens when Kristofferson and Huppert ride in the new rich lake, and she washes herself while lurking in the shade. The dull pacing, evocative music and monumental nature combine in this scene a convincing depiction of the love story that may be just in the heart of the movie - and which could have been its saving grace if persecuted more persuasively. <br /> <br /> Some critics have complained about the length of the movie. This in itself does not bother me. A good movie can't be long enough. The restored minutes are essential for restoring the motivation and characterization of the carved version, and they are full of pictorial interest. Perhaps the Gates of Heaven's top glory is in the painfully evocative soundtrack. The repeated roller motif and its various scores throughout (full band, guitar, solo, etc.) give a frightening quality to the foreground activity and create a thematic consistency that is lacking in the actual story. <br /> <br /> Despite the obvious error, especially the absence of a compelling story, there is a sense of grandeur about the film. You leave the cinema with a rueful sense of missing grandeur and a desire for Cimino to resume the movie - with the wisdom of time and overlook, to say right what is so much wrong.
