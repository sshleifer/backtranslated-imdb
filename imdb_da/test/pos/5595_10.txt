Broken Silence or "Race Against Fear" 1998): Contributing Ariana Richards, William Bumiller, Susan Blakely, Tracy Ellis Ross, Teryl Rothery, Scott Vickaryous, Marissa Rudiak, Ken Camroux, David Neale, Bruce Dawson ... Director Joseph Scanlan, Sara Charmo, Jean Gennis, Phyllis Murphy. <br /> <br /> This is another Lifetime channel movie made exclusively for television released in 1998, directed by the television series director Joseph L. Scanlan. Inspired by true events, it is much like the majority of Lifetime movies, a women's warning story that raises the awareness of the predator that lurks within the family (a mother, father, wife, husband) and mentor (teacher, in this case, coach). The young and little-known actor Ariana Richards (she played the little girl in Jurassic Park) provides a very convincing performance as high school track athlete Mickey Carlyle, who is raped by his coach Kurt Ansom (William Bumiller) and must suffer in silence like None Believe in his story, except of course his own mother (Susan Blakely). Together, mother and daughter fight to put Kurt Ansom behind bars. The film draws quite a bit, is ultimately predictable, sometimes too melodramatic for the sake of the drama, but is really strong in the end. Ariana Richards' performance is of the daily soap type, but she is the strongest in the whole cast. Her facial expressions, body language and overall actions are realistic as to how, as an aspiring athlete, she idolizes her trainer, in turn violated by him and now has to live with shame, trauma and beyond, fighting him in court. William Bumiller plays part with an eerie kind of duality, even though he is far from subtle. He has mistreated other star performers before, who have been silent and made it to the top and appear innocently innocent. William Bumiller, a lesser known player like the others, has never played a role like this, but he does a credible and strong performance in general. It is especially disturbing to see him in this role because he is a sexy leading actor in everything else he does, including some lesser known films and the soap opera "Guiding Light". The only real problem I had with this movie is the way the movie is structured. When the film opens, we see Coach Ansom raping Mickey, and we immediately tell us that this guy is not good. But it gives weak character development and history. If the first scene had instead been the sequence of opening credits, where we see Mickey running / jogging in the city over a lake, we would have better character development because we do not know that Coach Ansom, but apparently interested in the success of his star athlete is really an uncomfortable job and we would have seen Mickey idolizing someone she thought she knew and then received a rude awakening when she realized she was wrong about him. Director Joseph Scanlan is no stranger to drama for television (Knott's Landing, Star Trek, Quantum Leap, External Borders, Lois And Clark, Earth Final Conflict and Movies like La Femme Nikitta. In 1996, Scanlan had directed another life-like resemblance to This Standing " Stand Against Fear "(1996). He manages to convey the gravity of the event. We are really disturbed by the coach who sneaks around the showers where he rapes his own student. These scenes are graphic and should be seen by the mature audience, but its message is clear: sexual predators and rapes are not always alien and can take on various forms, and their primordial basis may even include a high school, this film supports the cause of fighting violence against women and calls on women who have been silent victims of witnessing and fighting so that rape will not hurt others.In spite of other negative reviews, this film does a good job of expressing its message and should be given to mothers, d three hi gh school students (including both male and female). Just as violent as rape is to be quiet when it happens, even worse.
