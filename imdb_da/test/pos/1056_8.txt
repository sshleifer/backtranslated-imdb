Although it is a Christmas present, "Christmas in Connecticut" could have been done at any time of the year, as it is the story of a soldier spending what should be an idyllic Martha Stewart type time. He thinks so. In fact, that lady, depicted by Barbara Stanwyck, has a popular magazine about life on a farm with her husband and baby. She has no farm, no man and no baby, nor the many recipes she publishes her. They belong to the restaurant owner nearby. When her no-nonsense editor, the Sydney Greenstreet, insists she entertains the soldier Dennis Morgan, she approaches her boyfriend to use her farm and she transports herself and the restaurateur there. There is even a baby ... yes actually there is more than one. Chaos follows and charade becomes increasingly difficult to play out, especially when Stanwyck falls in love with Morgan. <br /> <br /> It's such a wonderful movie, and though you're seriously depressed, "Christmas in Connecticut" can lift you straight out of it. Barbara Stanwyck is wonderful when the career woman became homemaker. Even though he wasn't as flashy as Crawford or Davis, she could still do whatever it took - she could be cheap, elegant, warm, nasty, cold and / or sexy, and she made it look easy. In addition, she is always attractive and excellent. Dennis Morgan is a beautiful and charming solider; As an added bonus, he gets to use his Irish tenor. Fiance Reginald Gardner is all business and you can tell he is not right for Stanwyck. S.Z. Sakall like the fake uncle / real cook is fun, especially when he asks Stanwyck to tilt a pancake before an audience. <br /> <br /> I can imagine the influence this lovely movie had at the end of World War II. It must have been a real lighthouse for the better times to come.
