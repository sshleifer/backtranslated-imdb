Heya Denver fans! The animation is a cartoon classic and one of my favorite too (and yes it was also broadcast in Europe. Including my little Central European country, Slovenia! :) :) Oh how I miss the 80s cartoons !! Honestly, they were far better than today's children's exhibitions. More imaginative, creative, full of fun with good morals, more substance, great history and excellent character voices. Computer animated shows today lack all these features. So, all of you who agree and will bring back all the shows, so that today's kids will see the entertainment that these cartoons brought to us, sign in to the page posted and sign a petition for a resume of 80 ' the best comics! <br /> <br /> http://www.thepetitionsite.com/ 1 / we-want-a-80s-child-cartoon-kids-show-channel <br /> <br /> Carpe Denver! =) <br /> <br /> Lay
