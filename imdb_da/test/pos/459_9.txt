"Journey" is a romantic version of the Cold War. It's about an English woman (Deborah Kerr) trying to smuggle her former love, a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robards, Jr.), out of Hungary during Hungary's Revolt in 1956. She is aboard a bus with thirteen other international people trying to get out of Hungary through the Austrian border. <br /> <br /> Of course, the bus is stopped by the Russians for a security check. The Russian officers-in-charge (Yul Brynner) is attracted to the English woman (Deborah Kerr) and delays the trip. Of course, the Russian officer knows the truth that the Hungarian scientist is a British citizen, but he decides not to arrest the scientist because he is waiting for the English woman to come to him. Of course this sounds absurd, but it's a funny movie to watch. Despite the romantic dialogue flow between Mr Brynner and Mrs. Kerr, who seems inappropriate in the situation they are in, the film becomes exciting and interesting. The good play overrides some of the stupid dialogue. Maybe some people involved in the Hungarian rebellion would not appreciate this movie; They would consider it a piece of fluff. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite Yul Brynner role. He speaks with his own masculine voice and is very attractive, especially when he becomes vulnerable. This is Deborah Kerr's second time working with Yul Brynner when they made "The King and I" in 1956. They make a very attractive couple. Too bad they never worked again. This was the second sexy role Mrs Kerr took since "From Here to Eternity". Despite the fact that Mrs Kerr had heavy winter clothes throughout the film, she was very beautiful and sensual. <br /> <br /> The fine supporting cast was led by Jason Robards, Jr., in his first film role. Some of the international casts were recognizable, such as Robert Morley from England. But the rest of the actors, which I have never seen before, were just big in the movie. In the background, it was fun to see Senta Berger as one of the girls speak a few lines of Hungarian. A few years later in 1966, she was in a movie, "Cast a Giant Shadow", with Yul Brynner as her leading lady. She still works today.
