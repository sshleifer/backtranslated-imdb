First of all, I'd like to start by saying that seeing a British drama that finally looks and feels credible is a refreshing start. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart plays the role of (Ian Hood), the public science advisor, with his constant and unconscious views on authority and thoughts about the future of "real world" science and how he feels it is either being used or abused by others. <br /> <br /> Not only is the molding thoroughly maintained throughout the series, but it makes its characters appear more credible than most other British dramas. <br /> <br /> Ashley Jensen also delivers a top-notch performance like Dr. Hood's appointed bodyguard (Rachael Young), she brings a refreshing thank you to the ignorant, disinterested everyday views of science, and her constant struggle with Hood makes for some very fun and memorable moments between them. <br /> <br /> The way the series keeps all the scientific elements more realistic I find positive and more engaging than the psychobab we are used to in other fiction or science fiction TV shows. <br /> <br /> However, there are remarkable disappointments in the series every time an episode ends, I find disappointed that they did not appear to cover every aspect of the plot and sometimes leave open-ended stories that are not closed. <br /> <br /> Although I remember that this is still the first series, I hope we see a return to form in the near future, where these final stories can finally be given a significant conclusion as they rightly deserves. <br /> <br /> For those who enjoy slower paced science-related plot lines, this is the ideal show to see as it always manages to remain credible and more important to that point.
