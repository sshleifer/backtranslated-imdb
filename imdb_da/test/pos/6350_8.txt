This story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle way, something that separates it from most movies with this plot. Mr. Lam (Jacky Cheung) has a relationship with Choy (Karena Lam, who was also so good at "Koma") in what initially seems to be an inexplicable situation. He is married for 20 years to Ching (the great Anita Mui, in her last role before being taken away from us), and it seems to be a loving relationship. When Ching offers to take care of her and Mr Lam's former teacher, Choy and Mr. Lamb opportunity to be together. What makes the movie so good is Director Ann Huis pacing. It takes a while to uncover Lamsmet's secrets and it makes sense. The film is very dramatic and touching. You do not feel rejection of the teacher / student situation, something that raises this film over many with the same plot. It goes slow, but please. Also staying in Ms Mui wonderful, youthful but beautiful performances. She was and is a really special and in this movie you fall in love with her one last time. It is worth witnessing and just being with her.
