Bud Abbott and Lou Costello always had a good following among children, but in their career, I think you could say they only made a movie that could be designated for children. Jack and Beanstalk were the one movie. <br /> <br /> It was part of a two-part deal from Warner Brothers, the second movie was Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd. These were the only two films that the boys made in color. <br /> <br /> The two of them, most often out of work, take a job for a very perishable and uncomfortable young David Stollery as a babysitter. Although it starts with Costello who wants to read the child, Jack and Beanstalk as a bedtime story, the young boy wins it up to Costello. Lou falls asleep, and in his dreams he actually fantasizes Jack the Giant Killer. Buddy Baer, ​​who threatened the boys of Africa Screams, plays the giant, and he has a huge Dorothy Ford as his housekeeper. Dorothy was a big girl, 6'2 "and you can imagine she was having trouble throwing, except when her height was used as a joke. One of the only players ever looked down on her was John Wayne in Three Godfathers at 6 pm. Henry Fonda and James Stewart in the On Our Merry Way also stood just above her, but again her height was part of a gag. <br /> <br /> Shaye Cogan and James Alexander were the princess and the prince of the imagination, and they sang beautifully but could not do anything worthwhile. This was the last film by William Farnum, which is career dated from the early silent screen days and to the end of the last century on stage. He played Princess Shayes' father king. <br /> <br /> Some not terribly memorable songs came from Jack and Beanstalk, the song title song. I remember well as a child who has 78 record of Bud and Lou singing the song and reciting the story. I was in my early single-digit years, but became a lifelong fan of their through it and their television series. Jack and the prayer mat are still a good children's image for the very young, although I would warn parents to warn their little urchins not to imitate young master Stollery.
