The other reviewers are way WAAAAY out of why the Farscape show is (temporarily) put to rest. It has nothing to do with the quality of shows 'slacking'. In fact, the exact OPPOSITE is true. They kept getting better and better! :) I've seen every episode, and when you simply see them making you really get in awe, how much cooler it gets when they move on and on, and the wormhole and Aeryn subplots are really very interesting and gave it more vibe, no less. Before it was kind of chaotic, slow and rather futile. They used as the first two seasons that run from this enemy type, but in the other two they actually tried to do something :) Also I have never seen such a fun mix of sexy gals and attitudes in Sci-Fi. The blue girl - Zahn - was cool, but not 'sexy'. They literally got to the point where the galls ran around in leather corsets and high heel blasting aliens - now tell me what could be cooler than that? :)) <br /> <br /> The right reason why Farscape went a bit off is because it cost too much - and that's a good thing for the fans, because the show that was seen is really like a 60 hour epic movie with all the movies in the blasted stuff (okay, they use similar sets a lot, but CG is great and gals are sexxxy). Blah blah - the real reason is because TV shows are about profits. It's a business, and the Sci Fi channel or the one who didn't get that much return on this expensive Farscape show as they could with junk, shows like 'Stargate'. Lexx was actually cool until they got rid of the hot German girl and replaced her with this bizarre greasy oddity. <br /> <br /> Anyway yes, remember this: Farscape kept getting better and better until it really was like a real movie every week. So the network decided "hi people will see some old piece of drag we push in the air as long as it is the only sci fi thing in that hour, so why do we all spend this money on Farscape, let's push the cheesy low-budget" Stargate " down the people's throat and call it a 'hit series' because it's like everything we play every darnnat LOL :)) That's the way it goes. I must also tell you that Claudia Black is a really cool actress. After she got her facelift (they got the baggy eyes tightened) so she really kicked out - one of the dynamic types like Judy Davis, and sometimes magnificent, like a roller coaster ride. I wanted to pair Claudia Black with Lucy Lawless in style and fabric - both very funny to see - not just Chrichton :) And yes you can say that pregnancy was cheesy, but how many sci-fi shows have a credible and deep romantic subplot that actually goes somewhere and progresses It was legitimately cool as a novel story - the actors on the show It's great, it's really a shame that the show is in limbo for now, but I hope it comes back in several episodes soon and movies too, because I want to deffinately buy them! :-D
