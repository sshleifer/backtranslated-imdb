This movie is the most impressive Turkish movie I've ever seen. Probably "Okul" is the first Turkish horror movie. I must say I was thrilled while watching the movie for some reason. The first reason is that the story is impressive, I believe that at the end of the movie you realized every detail of the movie, it makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no Turkish man made such a movie before. This shows that Turkish film improves itself after time. Although the first attempt to make a horror movie, it was really successful. I advise you all not to miss this movie ...
