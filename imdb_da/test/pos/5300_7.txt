Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood. At a time when movie animation has been dominated by Disney / Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki still relies on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories. The story is about the friendship between a magical seagull / goldfish and the human child she meets during a curious outing to see the human world. The human child, Sosuke (Doi Hiroki), lives in a small house on a cliff overlooking a small harbor town in southern Japan (based on Seto Island), where he lives with his young mother, Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko). Sosuke names the strange goldfish "Ponyo" and takes it to the day care / care center that Lisa is working on. Ponyo is definitely not your typical goldfish and soon begins to adapt and assume human aspects (she develops human speech and an appetite for ham) by trying some blood from a cut at Sosuke's finger. <br /> <br /> But like Sosuke and Ponyo starting to develop a bond, Ponyo is taken back by his father, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), a former human being who has rejected the surface world and is now trying to gather and develop magical elixirs taken from the sea that help him repair and rejuvenate the world's oceans. <br /> <br /> Ponyo's desire to become human has become so strong, but Fujimoto can no longer hold her, and she takes on a more human look and breaks free from her water world and goes back to see Sosuke. <br /> <br /> During her breakout, Ponyo unintentionally broadcasts Fujimoto's cache of magical elixirs that release all sorts of magical sea creatures that cause a violent storm in the lakes around Sosuke's town. Desperate to solve Ponyo's rebellion, he soon urges his help to his beautiful wife, Ponyo's mother - the water element, Mother / Lady of the Sea (Amami Yuki). <br /> <br /> As with its previous films, Miyazaki's "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" touches various themes of ecology and environmental science, this time focusing on the health and vitality of the world's oceans. The opening order is sometimes dazzling when Ponyo encounters a grape vessel that scrapes the sea floor and uncovers mountains of waste and waste. One can understand the anger and frustration of the character of Fujimoto, who has spent his lifetime, and tries to repair the damage civilization does to his oceans, yet it finds a frightening and almost effortless effort. Certainly cannot be said of the remarkable animation in this movie. It is sometimes bizarre and outrageous, but at the same time charming and curious. It was clear that Miyazaki would capture the sense and style of a child's imagination. The art style has the appearance of crayon / pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and imaginative. It's almost like a child's coloring book comes to life. Children's actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do good work as Ponyo and Sosuke. They bring sweet charm to their roles. Nara Yuria sounds especially sweet as Ponyo, that it is not wise to doi sosuke fall for the magic girl. Former campaign girl / model and actress Yamaguchi Tomoko (Shichinin No Otaku, Swallowtail) are also very good in their role as Sosuke's modern mother, Lisa. I was a little confused at the start of her character when I originally thought she was Sosuke's older sister. It also did not help Sosuke refer to her as "Lisa" rather than mother, but I think it is perhaps a sign of the times and an indicator of the modern Japanese family (in the anime series Crayon Shinchan, Shinnosuke also refers to his mother by first name also). The 80's comedian Tokoro Joji sounds quite different from the serious Fujimoto, but wisely does not make his character sound cartoony vicious or stupid. While we don't know his character anymore, former pro baseball player and actress Nagashima Kazushige (who portrays Sosuke's father Koichi) also delivers a good voice. The opening theme "Umi No Okasan" by Japanese soprano Masako Hayashi is simply beautiful and stirring. In contrast, Fujimaki Fujioka and Nozomi Ohashi "Geke No Ue No Ponyo" theme is light and entertaining and evokes images of a traditional Japanese nursery rhymes. In a glorious order, the soundtrack occupies an almost Wagnerian operative sound with music that sounds like "Die Walk√ºre". <br /> <br /> However, the film is not perfect and suffers from moments where the central story of Ponyo and Sosuke takes a back seat to some of Miyazaki's stunningly stunning images. I had also wished we had more time to explore Fujimoto's back story as well as the relationship between Sosuke and his father. Like "Kiki's Delivery Service / Majo No Takkyubin", "Howl's Moving Castle" "Princess Momonoke / Momonoke Hime" and "My Neighbor Totoro / Tonari No Totoro", "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" is another Miyazaki classic that is a great party for the eyes. As a modern adventure, the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that will surely be appreciated in the years to come.
