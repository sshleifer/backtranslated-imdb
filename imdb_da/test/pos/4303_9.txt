What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode, beside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Still, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bike discovered by his fiance, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman in the house, the housekeeper, who relies on her talents and chiles Columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with her cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Anyone accusing the other of murdering their uncle for money. Now you just have to see and see the outcome, but I can assure you that it is always worth looking at this for the cast and the crew.
