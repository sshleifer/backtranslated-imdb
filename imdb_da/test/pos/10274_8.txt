So here's some background on how I came to watch this movie. As you probably know, this is the original French movie that was restored (quelle surprise) by Hollywood as Wicker Park. Well, I avoided the movie like the plague when it was first released, simply because: a) I knew it absolutely had nothing to do with Wicker Park, and who lives in Chicago, I didn't see why they called it - it was filmed in fricking Canada for a start! - b) I find it hard to bother with meaningless remakes, clean, because Hollywood thinks we are too foolish to read a few subtitles (I fear the restoration of Infernal Affairs by the way) and c) I can't stand Josh Hartnett said nuff there. <br /> <br /> But I came across WP on TV the other day, probably about half an hour in, and I have to say first of all that it had no meaning until about half an hour from the end when it began to come together. In the end, I was really surprised to find myself really in it, and then the ending seemed just as good - a perfect combination of history, passion and end with possibly one of the greatest musical choices I've ever seen (heard ??) . Since then I have heard a lot about L'Appartement vs. The Wicker Park argument and looking at WP, I still say that it has bugger everything to do with Chicago, but there seemed to be something about what I liked, so when it was back on, I saw it again - unfortunately still lacking the first lump (I haven't seen it yet!), and I still thought it was pretty good. Heck, even Josh Hartnett seemed good! But I was curious about L'Appartement and wanted to see what everything about it was. So I waited and waited to catch l'Appartement somewhere. Netflix let me down, so I ended up getting a copy from a site in Ireland. And I've just seen it. <br /> <br /> It's really a little weird, but a good wonder. A classic French movie. Great acting, Romane Bohringer is an absolute gem - sorry but she is acting Monica Bellucci from the screen in all scenes. Vincent Cassel was a strange choice for the lead, but eventually he works. And I've seen Jean-Philippe Ecoffey in a lot of movies and I just love him - the scene where Alice dumps him in the restaurant, and he just looks like someone has told him his puppy is over, was scary! But I can honestly say that I have seen WP and pretty much expect to have been a scene for stage copy (which about 75% of the rest of the film had been - perhaps in a different order, but bring the stage with the coffee in the glasses ?? Word by word !!), you can imagine my surprise when I saw the end of L'Appartement !! I can literally say that I was blown away - hmm, a little like poor old Lucien really was through the cafe window! So be prepared if you have seen Wicker Park and you want to take a look at the original as I did, do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie because you are either disappointed or excited about a piece of French film history - An excellent example of how to watch a movie, think you'll see a pithy happy ending and get whiplash from the overall spin in the opposite direction right at the end. Certainly catch this movie. Oh, and while you know, maybe not too close at the same time, but down the road, take a look at Wicker Park, it will also surprise you.
