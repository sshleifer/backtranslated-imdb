I found this movie to be one of the great heartwarming gems. The story is tightly woven and the character development fantastic! Still, I'm a big fan of non-American movies, and that's right up there with: "Happenstance", "The Closet" itself "King of Hearts." Vlastimil Brodsky as Fanda is amazing. It's a love story in the true sense of loving life, and it's about getting the viewer to understand / enjoy Fanda's outlook on life (which almost costs him <br /> more than he is willing to give) is wonderful. His co-star Stelle Zazvorkova is unforgettable as his boring wife. I highly recommend this movie to the whole family - my kids loved it.
