I watched this movie "miniseries" on television back in 1989, and it was a great movie. I would love to track a copy of it just to see it again and again. It has been 15 years since I looked at it, and it still sticks in my mind. <br /> <br /> From the start it starts you. The characters and plot line keep you in order. The finish was fantastic. The feeling and rage that the son showed when he found out the truth about his father is unforgettable. The excitement of how it will turn out and how he will confront his father is really intense. <br /> <br /> If you can get a copy of this movie, you will thoroughly enjoy watching it. <br /> <br /> Then send me an email and tell me where I can get a copy.
