This is a great, sweeping movie that you will remember for a long time. It's about history, America, Teddy Roosevelt, Morocco, a kidnapped American and her children, and Berber's leader with the Prophet's blood in his veins. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on a true story - as Jesse James was a banker. An American was kidnapped in Morocco, and the Navy partially went to Tripoli to save him. So much for that. You know Hollywood. Sean Connery is the Berber chief and Muslim leader. Candice Bergan is the guy kidnapped with her two children; his son is rex Harrison's grandson, simon, no less. John Huston is Secretary of State with a large John-Huston-style straight line on a state dinner, beware. Brian Kieth is Teddy Roosevelt, all-American, all-male, a character, who is an interesting comment as modern as today. <br /> <br /> The sweets and beauty of the deserts and Morocco are beautifully displayed in the cinematography of this movie that will remain with you, a haunting and compelling memory. The result is as sweeping and exotic as the pictures. <br /> <br /> This is a story of two cultures, both with great ideas and historical past, fighting for the future without any idea of ​​each other. In any case, the battle comes down to perhaps against ingenuity. <br /> <br /> In the end, there is the little boy - remember the little boy? What do you think HE is thinking?
