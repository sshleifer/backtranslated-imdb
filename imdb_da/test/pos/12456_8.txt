While it doesn't get closer to Tarzan by Edgar Rice Burroughs than, says Johnny Wiesmuller's flicks, it did it have its own peculiar and entertaining slant on the story. It is a well done Tarzan movie. Nice scenery, good photography, usable continuity and a Tarzan shout that echoes the one described by Burroughs. The players have it all well. The only bad points I found were, I think, related. It moves slowly in places. The slow motion? Make this picture too long. It could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter, which I think would have helped with the natural flow of the plot and character development. But the rest of the movie seems good enough to carry it over these two hard spots and still leave the viewer happy with the girl. Short version of all the above ... It's a very good Tarzan movie.
