Honore De Balzac's true bizarre short story, on which it was loosely based, gets a disturbing but breathtaking film, treating here as a kind of forbidden love blooms over a time between man and animal in the early nineteenth century. The thin and very blonde English actor Ben Daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the Napoleonic wars lost while escorting an exile (?) French painter over the rugged, dangerous landscapes of the Gobi Desert. After literally walking around circles, the two men stop trying to reach civilization again, so each one (toward better judgment you) decides to go their separate paths with the promise that both return to the same exact place when and if a water source is actually found. This is, of course, how Daniel's character is going to meet the creature (a wild and unsaturated female leopard) and eventually form an apparently unbreakable bond or right love with both of them saving their lives and almost destroying it at the end of the film. The exquisite cinematography, minimalist dialogue, some demented history, possibly suggesting possible bestiality in about three scenes, is what ultimately leads professional critics to pan the film as pretentious and long-lasting waste. Although it is a movie that is not entirely for yourself, I seem to be a subtle but certainly a left-of-center mix of imagination with a surreal and lavish atmosphere, highlighted by the fact that in more than half of girl actress Ben Daniels is forced to perform opposite a wild animal (four leopards were actually used as opposed to only one), which common sense and little knowledge of theaters dictate that it must have been a crazy and very difficult job to he managed to look quite brilliant if you ask me! All in all, I think "Passion in the Desert" takes a while to warm up, but if you are a patient willing to give it some time, it really throws you the uniquely original spell on you in spite of everything; And, unlike most platonic history relationships between humans and animals, it does not have to require a talking pig, a monkey or an amber dog to keep your interest throughout. (***** out of *****)
