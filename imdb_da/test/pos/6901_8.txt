When people talk about how "they don't do them as they used to", they only point to this amazingly entertaining and picturesque look, comedy fear by writer-director Glenn McQuaid. <br /> <br /> It's a story of graverobbers (played by Dominic Monaghan and Larry Fessenden) that end up digging more than just silent, motionless bodies. After the first shock of this, they quickly realize that they can actually make the situation their advantage. And that's just what they're trying to do. It looks as if things may not have worked out as planned as bad young Arthur (Monaghan) actually relates his story to a priest (Ron Perlman) before being taken to the gallows. <br /> <br /> Looking at the details of his filmography, McQuaid seems to have taken the core of his first short film and extended it to this feature effort, which is nothing bad. The fessend returns and does well, Monaghan is one of those guys who can actually make you like him as he goes about the scary business of stealing from the dead and with other genre favorites like Perlman and Angus Scrimm On stage this movie is also fun for genres. <br /> <br /> It is also a unique and beneficial design and appearance, sometimes moving from EC Comic-style panels to live action (a la Creepshow) and always somehow feeling quite authentic in it is the Hammer Horror feel. Maybe everything is just covered by so much dry ice, but it is next to the point. Whatever was done to capture everything on film, it works. It works well. <br /> <br /> It may not have any real scares, but this movie has a great vein of black humor and certainly bleeds every minute of it's runtime in macabre material that should please all those who have patience for horror that is a little more stunned and feels like it could have been done back in Hammer's days. See this if you like: Meat and Enemies, Doctor and Devils, Creepshow.
