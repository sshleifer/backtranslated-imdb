Just reading the reviews of this wonderful BBC mini-series reminded me of how much I enjoyed it when it was sent many years ago. At that time, I remember waiting with anticipation for the next pass and fell in love with John Bowe and Janet McTeer, two talented actors, whom we can't see enough on television or cinema these days. <br /> <br /> I have tried unsuccessfully to get more of the BBC's amazing past dramas, including the 1973 version of Jane Eyre and the 1972 version of Anne of Green Gables, all wonderful timeless classic stories which unfortunately the BBC does not seem to intend to release on video or DVD. If anyone else learns, I would like to hear from them. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, we need to satisfy ourselves with our memories of how wonderful they were.
