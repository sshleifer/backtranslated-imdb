I was really and wonderfully surprised by "O 'Brother, where are you?" The video store was out of all the movies I was planning to rent, so I came across this. I came home, and when I looked, I was excited and found myself laughing loudly. Coen has made a great movie again. But I think the first time you watch this movie, you will learn the characters. The second time, now that you know them, you laugh so well it can hurt you. I would highly recommend anyone to see this because if you are not, you really miss a movie gem of all time. 10.10
