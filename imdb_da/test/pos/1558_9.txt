Great film! Wow - this is really a treat. I can't believe I discovered such a gem of a movie. <br /> <br /> A beautiful young girl traveling south to Florida meets a friendly older couple with an RV after she has an apartment in a rest stop. But she learns that things are not as they seem, and the couple becomes a little scary after she spends time on the road with them. <br /> <br /> Everyone in it was just as perfect for their parts, so you are just about believing you see this happening in real life before you. Newcomer Emily Grace did a fantastic job as the really sweet, yet somewhat shy Alice. Emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing and you can see how she got into the situation that is evolving in the movie. I'm sure we'll see Emily in more movies in the future. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what others have said, the lighting and photography here were just perfect. The editing was also done well - just the right way to put pictures of the highway to give you the feeling that you are traveling with a throw on their road trip. <br /> <br /> I didn't see it on the big screen, but I can only encourage everyone to go out and see it. More movies like this are * exactly * what we need. <br /> <br /> SF
