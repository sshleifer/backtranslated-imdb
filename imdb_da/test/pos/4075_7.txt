I can't understand why so many people didn't like this movie. Robert De Niro was at the top of his game and delivered his lines with such a plomb, one has to believe that this is his everyday behavior. Encouraged, the movie seemed to take on many buddy-movie conventions while trying to make fun of the concept, it goes without saying that this movie was really fun. From the police dog, to Eddie Murphy does not irritate the heel out of me, this movie is a real goalkeeper. Rene Russo also equalized the rest of the cast perfectly and established his role so that it did not interfere with the budding relationship between De Niro and Murphy.
