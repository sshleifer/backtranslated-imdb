I'm so happy that Zac was in 'Zacks and Cody's Suite Life' because it's my favorite program and he's my favorite actress. It's a really fun episode and a fun show !! I love everything about the show and the characters. All performing artists are good. Keep playing Zac and I'm so excited that almost all of my favorite actors (including High School Musical characters) are in this show. Zac Efron is so hot and I have an autographed picture of him! It's not a photocopy, and it came all the way from America to Australia, and it almost didn't come in time for Christmas. Also, I got a High School Musical Mug with my name printed on it.
