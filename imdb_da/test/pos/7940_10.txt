A wonderful piece of art. You can see every picture of the movie and see the beauty of it. First I would like to say that "when I saw German soldier's helmet, I understood that it was from here that the" Star War "had been inspired. The scene they were killing, the baby is scary, and when I saw it, I didn't like it. But when the movie was finished, I thought of that scene and I changed my mind and thought that in World War II it was exactly what the Germans did. <br /> <br /> The ice war scene is some of the best war scenes I've seen (if not the best). Their way combines this movie music and so stunning stunning visual images are truly outstanding. Then Prokofiev scored one of the most famous soundtracks in history, and I thought it was one of the best. <br /> <br /> What more can you say then a work of art.Eisenstein has created a fantastic masterpiece, a propaganda film and a beautiful work of art. I am very pleased that I have just received the Eisenstein criteria collection.
