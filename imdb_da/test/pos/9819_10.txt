This is one of the few movies that was recommended to me as absolutely brilliant, it really is. If you give this movie a low tone than you really missed the point. You can describe Fosca as a manipulator, but what if it's really serious that she gets sick when the love she's sure isn't answered. But what would you do when you are sure that the other loves you and is "only" rejected by the fact that you are ugly. You wouldn't fight for it. In any case, I think it's better to fight for what dies in bitterness. And it reminds me how, as a man, I react completely to Fosca's physical cruelty and not look into the person she is or maybe is. This movie confronts me with very solemn questions of respect, trust, feeling manipulated and so on. How do I do now if someone manipulates me or just tries everything to get in touch? What I think is the most outstanding feature of this movie is that Ettore Scola made it absolutely credible that Giorgio fell in love with Fosca.
