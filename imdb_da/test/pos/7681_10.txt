Surely the Gershwin family realizes that this is one of America's greatest operas. You have thousands of fans of this opera waiting for it to be released on DVD. Please do not be so stubborn, give us a break. Think of the joy and wonder that you can bring to a hungry public of quality music by releasing this amazing GEM. Do not wait until the film is out of service. Cast is first rate, the music is just great, we need beautiful music in today's world. It must never be filmed again with such a large throw again. With today's home theater systems, wonderful sound systems and the need for good music, I encourage the Gershwin family to rethink and release this amazing movie. Thank you very much
