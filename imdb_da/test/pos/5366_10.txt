A wonderful thought-provoking and engaging film that leaves an imprint far beyond the original boost. Based on a true story, one of the many "little" stories prior to World War II, understanding the thoughts of the majority of common human cultures, influenced by others perceived as past enemies and perhaps future enemies, with the darkness of warrior on the horizon. Seen at the Stony Brook Film Festival, the film was enthusiastically received. Well written and professionally thrown. The characters were most credible and subscribed to experience their trials and tribulations.
