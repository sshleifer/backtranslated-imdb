OKAY. So it can be done! We have the perfect vampire movie here. Gothic, beautiful With all the ingredients. A realistic vampire. A wonderful story. Note! I am from Transylvania and I assure you this movie respects the vampire loren! That's exactly the stories I heard in my childhood. For a transylvanian, it's totally ... credible. You should see it if you are interested in real vampires as they were depicted in medieval chronicles, and how have they not been in recent Hollywood movies (as far as I can guess, the Hollywood problem is that they mix vampires with the incubus - which is pretty hilarious to me The vampires are never beautiful or attractive; they can only inspire horror and rejection. highly recommend this to any gothic person out there! See also the followers, they are all 4 very good! And then don't miss the DArk shadows! Something similar is Nosferatu in Venice with Klaus Kinski. I recommend it.
