This extraordinary pseudo-documentary, created in 1971, captures perfect Americans' zealot today ... making it even more frightening and relevant. "Subversiver" (college students, hippies, black activists, academics) are rounded off by the government and given long prison terms for how many thoughts crimes and social protests are. As an alternative to life in prison, these convicted "criminals" are offered three days in "Punishment Park". Their goal inside the park is to make their way to the American flag, where freedom awaits them. Not surprisingly, the Punishment Park setting is a dirty lie. This amazing movie by Peter Watkins is even called "Battle Royale" and "Series 7", although the angle of attack is more obviously political. Shot in '71, it looks and feels as fresh as anything done today. The performances are exemplary and the direction is razer sharp. The story cuts back and forth between different groups trying to survive the harsh conditions of the park and the McCarthy-like trials that condemned them. Today, this film still retains its power. In '71 there was nothing but nothing really good. This is a masterpiece that succeeds at a dozen levels. It has the balls that most people today have lost.
