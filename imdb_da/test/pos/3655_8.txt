On one level, Hari is about a movie using a well-known genre - the roadmap - to tell a well-known story: curious western leader explores the mysterious east. But in his heart, the film is about two people, a young French beauty (Isa) offered to experience life to the full and a motorized rickshaw driver (Hari Om) with Bollywood ambitions, from far different cultures, their slowly growing attraction to each Second, and the beautiful mad chaos that is India today. The gap between them can never be burned, but the director succeeds in bringing the two as close to an affair as possible without harming the plausibility of history. India and its people are important ingredients in the story, and with the exception of the protagonists, the roles are played beautifully and convincingly by the locals recruited during the production of the film while on the road between the Indian cities and villages forming the film setting. A big negative for this viewer: a Keystone Cup chasing near the movie's conclusion, as Hari flies mobsters bent on collecting a gambling debt. But the final scenes where Isa and Hari farewell farewell are exciting and unforgettable.
