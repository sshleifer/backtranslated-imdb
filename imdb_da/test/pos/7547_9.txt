The first of five St Trinian films (although the latter is usually discounted) was based on artist Ronald Searle's schoolgirl characters and has the wonderful Alastair Sim in a row as Millicent Fritton, director and his own brother. Much of humor is dated, yet curious and appalling in today's PC world - the girls drink, gamble, smoke and sell later to rich Arabs, but always remain responsible, defeating bureaucracies, police, judges, and other characters like the maraud over England. Perhaps because the films have been so regularly watched on television, St Trinians still inspire fancy dress parties and club nights. The films have recurring characters that include PC Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell) and Flash Harry (George Cole). The forerunner of the entire series is a charming movie called 'The Happiest Days of Your Life' (1950).
