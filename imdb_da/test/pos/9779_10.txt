Here we have a miniseries that goes into its mistakes and does not make us hug because of them ... it is excellent storytelling that melts in black comedy, mateship (in a positive way), the pathetic waste of war without the pure unadulterated manipulation of a con-job like Life is Beautiful ... it's an entertainment, not the meaning of life ... and shows the talents of both young and old ... give it a ride and tell us what you think ...
