I love Aaron Carter, but even I expected pop star to be predictable, but I was so wrong! Aaron Carter was really fun in it and a great actor! Also the actor who played Jane was a brilliant actress! Every one I didn't see, loved it! <br /> <br /> The music in it was also really good! <br /> <br /> My favorite lines from the movie are "You Can't Send Me to a Public School Mother! I'm a CELEBRIDE !!" and "Take Your Time, It's Coming To You!" Although the ends are kind of cheesy, all the good chick flicks do! This movie is great and a really good chick flick that I can see over and over again!
