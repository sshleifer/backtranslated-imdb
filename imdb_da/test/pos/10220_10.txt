The movie 'Nightbreed' is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Overall, I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but there's something about this movie that is more atmospheric and different from any other horror movie I've ever seen. Many horror films I've seen have benefited from being horror-based, I know the stories are unreal, as they are fictitious, so I can't take them all seriously. Nightbeed, on the other hand, is a unique horror genre, as it has a sense of realism that I have seen in very few other horror films. <br /> <br /> This movie story of how a man is murdered and ends up living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with undead monsters is the kind of story a person would get from a dreamy nightmare as it is a very unique and original history. Most horror movies I've seen are all pretty fake, but because Nightbreed was so incredibly sophisticated and brilliantly aimed at outstanding plays, especially by Craig Sheffer (Aaron Boone) amazing special effects, good lighting and great dialogue, I found this movie to have a sense of depth and maturity without stupid false horror parody, at all that many other horror films have. Nightbreed, as well as being horror, have elements of thriller, romance and action all raped in one. If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend you see it as I judge it a 10/10.
