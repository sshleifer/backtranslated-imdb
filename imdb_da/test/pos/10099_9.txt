Each high rose word fell far before the height of this film. This film is the real example of how a psychological horror movie should be. The plot seems to be a bit confusing at first view, but it will definitely explain a little about what's going on and you really want to see it for the second time. But after another show you will start joining the pieces together and then you will know how fantastic a movie can be. <br /> <br /> A word of advice to slasher flick fans stays away from this movie. This is not your stupid ass teenage slasher movie where you just turn off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b ** bs and lots of blood. <br /> <br /> If you want to increase the psychological horror factor in this movie and watch it all alone with a large home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, without any of your bad friends crushing jokes a really tense situation. And don't forget to turn off the light. <br /> <br /> My points on different aspects: - <br /> <br /> Direction = 9/10 Acting = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Sound Effect = 9/10 <br /> <br /> Total = 9/10
