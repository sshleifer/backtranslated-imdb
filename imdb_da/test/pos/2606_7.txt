The movie starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This significantly reduces the pace. Billie "Buckwheat" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early stages. When left on a riverboat, his fears and surrender are palpable, and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man who asks for help and is rejected rejected, the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Seeing a child's birthday party through a stake sign is another moving moment. As another reviewer mentioned, I was also worried about the big dog choking on chicken bones! When Spanky and Buckwheat are in Marshall Valiant's home, Spanky tends to interact mainly with the adults, and the baby's chemistry is essentially lost. <br /> <br /> The old South / Huck Finn type setting doesn't do much for the plot except that the kids can be out of the door a great deal. Ralph Morgan is the most engaging adult, but then the other roles don't have much substance for them. Louise Beavers manages some fun moments with a Yankee soldier towards the end. <br /> <br /> The bad guys aren't really bad enough and the lovers aren't intense enough. Still, I think it is worth seeing if you are a Our Gang enthusiast if there is no other reason why the whole piece is odd curiosity. I give it seven stars because, although it wasn't a big movie, it kept me engaged all the time and curious about what would happen next time.
