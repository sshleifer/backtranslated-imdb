I really like the show !! As part of Greek life, I can say that some things are exaggerated, but in general it is still quite fun. <br /> <br /> Rusty is a sympathetic lead character, his roommate is HILARIOUS, and the whole cast is entertaining in their own rights. I like that it focuses on individual situations as well as interpersonal relationships with the organizations. <br /> <br /> This show covers everything and they do it without curse or anything so bad (how else could it be at ABC Family?). <br /> <br /> My favorites are Cappie (of course), Rusty's roommate and virtually all of Kappa Tau. This show is a great launch pad for them and I am excited to see which doors this opens. <br /> <br /> Renew this show next summer, ABC Family. As I said, love loves LOVE it !!
