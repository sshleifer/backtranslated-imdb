I came across this movie on DVD purely by chance through a Blockbuster rental. Voyage to the Planets is an excellent BBC 2-hour documentary / drama about a future "grand tour" of the solar system. In this film, this film tells the story of astronauts on a journey to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto. <br /> <br /> The special effects are great for a TV show. I found the actors credible as astronauts. The situations presented are mostly plausible and you learn a lot about the planets science and spaceflight! Only two minor complaints: I found some of the situations and the dialogue at times. Furthermore, I am uncertain that a single crew and ship would be sent on a single mission to see all of these destinations at once. More than likely, visits to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc. will be / be separate missions. <br /> <br /> They were not trying to cheat this show with production values. The scenes in Venus and Mars were actually filmed in the northern deserts of Chile - the driest area on earth and a dead end to the Martian landscape. Weightless sequences were filmed in a diving Russian transport jet. Manufacturers could have fudged any of these through studies and CGI, but chose the right thing instead. <br /> <br /> I would particularly like to mention the amazing music that was composed for this movie. Don Davy's exciting theme is the first to catch you when the movie starts, as Pegasus' magnificent shot passes the screen and David Suchet intones "it's the fate of man to explore the stars". <br /> <br /> Watching this on a small TV screen is a regret I have. What a thrill to see this in a movie theater, or better yet an IMAX presentation!
