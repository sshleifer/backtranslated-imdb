Did the same year as the first Lumiere movies, this is a much more dramatic card than the brothers tried until next year's "Niagara". The surviving pressure is very rough, but it is only the case with Turneresque visual violence, as large water tanks dasher against a blunt mill and seems to be thrown over the camera, the viewer. <br /> <br /> If you see a number of these early shorts in chronological order and trying to get in the mind of time, there is a further shock that unlike Lumier's single frame setups, this one film an editing that, to my knowledge, was just as sharp as the razor blade in 'Un Chien Andoulu'. <br /> <br /> Unlike the monovision of Lumieres movies, Paul opens the possibility of more perspectives and frees the viewer from the power of nature, avoiding his understanding in a way Lumieres never could. The second shot has a similar gush as in Niagara, but is less intimidating because we have been sidetracked by the editing. In a movie like 'L'Arroseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', nature does not care and is strong, unwieldy by the camera. Basic movie grammar puts an end to its supremacy.
