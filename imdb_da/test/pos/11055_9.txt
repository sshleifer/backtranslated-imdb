I would say this movie is disturbing. The brutality is depicted in a very ill way, it is like a psychosis for 40 minutes. At the same time, it is a cruel introspection in human behavior. The scenes are ugly, starting with the horse's slaughterhouse and ending with the brutal sex scene in the kitchen. Every feeling is exploited to the extreme, the butcher's frustration, love for his daughter almost incestuous, rage, when he finds out that she has been abused, every feeling is so natural and so wrong. This film delivers the truth about human nature in a very honest and brutal way. The film's message is that one's life can change in a second as a consequence of one's behavior and that the most primitive emotions are the most powerful and can determine one's action. I had loved the unique way of filming, the simplicity and the brutality accompanied by the silence where only inner thoughts pierce.
