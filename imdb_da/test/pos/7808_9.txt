Andaz Apna Apna is by far my second largest comedy all the time, first as Namak Halal (although technically a drama). The story is not groundbreaking, but the complications added to it make it amazing. Aamir Khan is a comic book. Just see his expression in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He is incredibly good at comedy, I never knew. Salman Khan was also good as the little dimmer of the two characters. The sounds he makes are almost as fun as Aamir's faces. Raveena and charisma serve their purpose but are nothing amazing. The right choice of party is Paresh Rawal as usual. The plot is quite simple, Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are useless sons of poor fathers. They do not believe in hard work and will just get rich in the easy way. So both of their brains come across an idea to awaken a rich man's (Paresh Rawal) daughter (Raveena Tandon) who comes to India to seek a man. So Amar and Prem meet on the trip and stop hands to run the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl. When they succeed, they must now get rid of each other. Somehow they both come into Raveena's house, Amar as a damaged guy and Prem as his doctor. From here they try to shed each other. But it is complicated when Raveena's friend (Karisma Kapoor) falls to Prem and pursues him. And the rich man's evil twin brother (Rawal too) tries to get rid of heir and her father so he will inherit the money and send in his two most trusted but bumbling fools to do the dirty work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you will not miss. See it! It will be worth it. I own the DVD myself, it's so good. And if you like this movie, I would also recommend Gol Maal if you haven't already seen it. Other good comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new).
