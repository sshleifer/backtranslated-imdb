Duo Abbott and Costello live on in this version of a history-time classic. In "Jack and the Beanstalk" there is everything to see, music, magic and comedy rolled into one. Costello play plays Jack after he listens to the story being told by a young boy once. We know Jack was a poor boy who sells his cow "Dolly" to 5 magical prayers. Now he plants the 5 beans and they were actually magical. He climbs to heaven, sees a big castle there, and he wanted to sing a song, unknown he would encounter the giant (Buddy Baer). Not only him he would dance with the woman, who was also a giant. She would clobber Jack with her elbows during the dance. It was fun! You have the playing harp who knows how to put the giant as ease. The guest who puts golden eggs. And my favorite, the way Jack gets rid of the giant. He gets the ax and began to cut down on the prayer mat. Another fun is where the ax got stuck during the carving, and the last party happens when people dance around the pressure where the giant fell. Very fun and fun for the whole family. Highly recommended! 5 stars!
