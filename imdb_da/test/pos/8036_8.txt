I will not comment on the story as such. I agree with most people's comments that this is a good all-round action movie with a well-written story and good actor. This movie deserves 100% filmography for its opening order. The opening shot is amazing and I have not yet found out how they did it. The movie is worth watching to shoot alone! A shame, therefore, that the DVD that is currently out is just the movie and there is no information about the film's production. Let's hope someone comes up with the special edition. <br /> <br /> And even better, the opening sequence also becomes the end, so you can guess! Good cases. A must for a collector of classic movie moments.
