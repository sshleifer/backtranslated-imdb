Well, I suppose I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie was not. It plodded together in a rather slow conscious pace for the first 40 minutes, but there was nothing in it that I was very interested in - there is an exciting and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the protagonist's walks, which I did not know much about and could not relate to at that time. He walks around alone for the most part, he doesn't meet anyone; I imagine the director was trying to portray the loneliness of loneliness in this post-apocalyptic world or something, which is all good, but I still want him to have trimmed it from 40 minutes to 15 because it can be incredibly boring. <br /> <br /> But after the 40 minutes things start to get very interesting. I don't think I really want to say more than that because I don't want to ruin anything. So, if you've seen the first 15-30 minutes of this movie and are thinking of turning it off (as I was), just stick to it - it gets much better. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting things I found about this movie was the fact that it had no dialogue whatsoever, which really made me think about what happened to how characters felt and what their motivation was why things were how they were in this post-apocalyptic world, all of which give history a lot of room for audience interpretation. And it's amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors don't tell you exactly what is going on.
