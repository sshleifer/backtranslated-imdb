Let's see, Australian television is mostly horrible, but it's a real diamond in the rough, not enough people see. The chaser crew, who make the satirical newspaper and CNNN, are trying something new by mixing live comedy, pre-recorded sketches and political satire in a show filmed in front of a live audience, sorta like Rove, but fun. They love to cause controversy, and this causes some of the most fun moments, especially Chris tells his wife to "f-off" live on breakfast pv and Julian delivers a news check signed by Saddam Heusein to the head of the AWB. It must be one of the funniest Aussie shows since the Micallef program.
