Angels are a bit of an American occupation, but are often rather boring. They are God's messenger, and also the archangels are great warriors (Lucifer is the hardest and best looking until he was kicked out of heaven). <br /> <br /> So what happens if you don't believe in something, let alone angels and you're sent to investigate an angel's story, just to meet one with wings and less than English attitude. Maybe it's what America needs, being a Puritan, is different from being good. Michael is a rude, uncomfortable, female heavenly messenger who will fulfill your desires and care for the world you will be touched on. <br /> <br /> Funny, but not so much, touching, but not overly sentimental, intelligent without being clever ... it's just a good simple, little comedy. Watch a lazy Sunday afternoon.
