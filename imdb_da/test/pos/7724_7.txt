There have been about 60 different film and television games, in addition to the classic opera of this tale of a six-grain girl and her unhappy soldier lovers. This story has been done so many times in different ways. Vicente Aranda leads Joaquin Earth's manuscript adaptation of Prosper Merimee's classic novel and play. <br /> <br /> This is the ART ONLY of the Bizet's opera Carmen <br /> <br /> Pas Vega is an exciting Carmen, full of passion and the ability to drive simple men to do horrible tragic things. Leonardo Sbaraglio is the unfortunate soldier who is solitary in Carmen's poisonous web and led to doing bad things. <br /> <br /> Jay Benedict is the author of Prosper, who tells this story. <br /> <br /> There is not much action, but there are some very hot sex scenes. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's almost an NC-17 movie. <br /> <br /> Since I saw this story so often in so many I was not overly impressed. <br /> <br /> It is a very well made movie and will be of interest to those who may not know it, <br /> <br /> My not too enthusiastic review may also be that I miss the amazing opera score from the Bizet. <br /> <br /> See this as you might like it more than I did. <br /> <br /> Ratings *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
