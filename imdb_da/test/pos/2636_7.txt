At the time of this letter (January 25, 2006), I'm sorry to hear about the passage within the last couple of hours by Chris Penn. Other than Footloose, The Wild Life is the movie I remember most about Chris. I still remember the movie, with little upset Chris' wrestling character and teammates sitting in their favorite restaurant with a large plate of French fries in front of them, drowned in a whole bottle of ketchup. In any case, my comment on the title track was sung by Bananarama. After these many years, I still remember rumors (Canadian spelling - lol) that Bananarama was summoning at the very last minute to compose the track for the movie and that they wrote the song on the plane tied to the recording studio to record the song, and right after they having recorded the song, they went to shoot the low cost video for their title track. I heard that the whole process (from start to finish) took 4 hours to do! If this is true then they are really worth the most successful female band at all times. In any case, it's just a rumor I had heard back in the day and still remember a generation later. Perhaps anyone reading this can comment and clarify. Thanks.
