I felt compelled to give some feedback on this movie, which I rented from Blockbuster. This movie has it all - comedy, drama, crime, excitement and "realism". <br /> <br /> This movie also had a lot of action with just the right amount of humor! I will definitely see it again! There were some fun parts as well as action packed drama. I enjoy movies that keep you wondering what to do next. The writer / director, Travis Milloy, should make more films !!! In my overall opinion, this movie was amazing! I'm looking forward to his next one! Travis Milloy has genuine talent as a writer and director.
