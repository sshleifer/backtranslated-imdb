I admit that for the first time I was able to capture Sci-Fi's "Sci-Fi Prime", but despite being a big Sliders fan coming into the experience, Farscape is now easy my favorite of the four shows. <br /> <br /> Unlike most modern Sci-Fi shows (including the two new Star Trek series), this show regrets being fun without coming over for the MST3K.
