Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative films that have been released recently. It was fun, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, and the rest of the cast made their incredibly strange characters real. The story took such twists and turns that made it incredibly comfortable to see. If you are sick of the recent film, then see the nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or rent it at least when it comes out!
