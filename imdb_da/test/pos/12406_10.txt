The effect of this image was best proven on the intended target audience, namely teenagers. My 14-year-old son became so enchanted in this movie that I judge it significantly higher than his imitator "Mad City". It derives debate in our household about issues such as peer pressure and loyalty vs. doing the right thing. For that alone, I consider this movie a 10! Parents should look with their teens and discuss it afterwards. <br /> <br /> I liked the smart dialogue and consistent action. I thought James Remar was sufficient in his role, but the teenage cast really brought this picture. Other IMDB users have praised Corey Feldman's performance, which is truly inspired. All in all, I give this picture my highest recommendation. Join this!
