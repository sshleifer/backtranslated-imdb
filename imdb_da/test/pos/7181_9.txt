The second (not animated) film about the only people who still refuse to surrender to the Roman Empire is even more fun than the first movie "Asterix & Obelix contre Ceasar". <br /> <br /> Where the first movie got all laughs because all cartoon characters were so perfectly brought to life without losing their cartoon identity, this sequel (which is a separate story like all the comics) is even better. Sure, all the ingredients you find in the first movie and in the comics are present again: Obelix still dies to taste the "magic potion" that gives its other tribal members such enormous powers, the emperor and the rest of Roman Empire is still enemy number 1, but some new refreshing elements have also come to the stage. <br /> <br /> Not only is it very idyllic (biggest player of course in Egypt), but instead of repeating movie number one, some extras have been added by making all sorts of references to other movies (Bruce Lee etc.). It is not entirely new, but the unexpected combination of the famous story from the comic (with almost the same title as the movie) and references to things that have nothing to do with Asterix & Obelix really works. <Br /> <br /> That way, the film builds on a tradition of comics Goscinny and Uderzo who did not hesitate to bring Laurel and Hardy on stage and even assign a whole story to Kirk Douglas. <br /> <br /> If all this doesn't convince you to watch this movie, I'm sure Monica Bellucci will play Cleopatra's will.
