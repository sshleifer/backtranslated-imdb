I rented the movie and liked it so much that I bought it. Elijah Wood (Mikey) and Joseph Mazello (Bobby) are excellent as the two boys. Their new stepfather physically abuses Bobby. The abuse is implied, mostly, not seen, and roused a lot of passion in me to help abused children. There is a magical quality for the movie as the boys' imagination helps them find a way to deal with abuse. You must try to understand the story from a child's point of view. I'm still thinking about the end. I've seen the movie 3 or 4 times, and every time I think of possible new meanings. I'm not sure exactly what Richard Donner meant to me, but it's a great movie! Joseph Mazello and Elijah Wood will make you hug your children.
