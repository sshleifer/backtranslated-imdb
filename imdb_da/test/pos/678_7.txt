The movie with its single set, minimal cast and straightforward photography (apart from a few short special effects) reminds me of one of the old 60 minute playhouse dramas that are so popular in the early years of the TV. Nevertheless, the tension is heavily over poor warriors, Ida Lupino, as she tries to handle her semi-psychotic craftsman Robert Ryan before one of his mood swings kills her. And who better to play the troubled part than the big actor Ryan. He was not very versatile - seeing him essay comedy is almost painful. But no one was better at wounded idealism (on dangerous soil) or the psychological pain in this movie. Few actors could express so much with their eyes as this lean and towering figure. Lupino's problem is that she is unlocked in her house with a man who is kind and gentle for a moment and rages the next. The excitement comes from her various ploys to keep him happy while trying to escape. It's a nail bite all the way. This is not one of Lupino's many fine "soulful" parts that she was so good at. Instead, it is a role that many smaller actresses could have handled well enough. My favorite scene is with Ryan and bratty teenager Margaret Whiting. Ryan already has difficulty with his masculinity and what others say about him. So when Whiting enters and finds the attractive-looking Ryan scrubbing floor, she begins to coy and flirt with her burgeoning sexuality. Troubleshooting, Ryan Brings Her Off - Finesse is not his strong suit. Disgusted, whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work "work of women". It does. Until then, he has been polite and professional with Lupino, who tries to get on a normal road. But whiting has hit its raw nerve. Now there is the heck to pay, since whiting jumps out of the door and leaves Lupino to pay the price. It's a fast-paced scene, professionally done. <br /> <br /> It's still one of the dozen or so movies produced by Lupino and her husband at a time when the audience moved away from those little black and white in favor of spectacle goggles. Too bad. What a very talented figure she was both behind the camera and in front. She deserves at least one honorary Oscar from a film industry that she has contributed so much to.
