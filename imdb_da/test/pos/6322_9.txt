A variation of the same plot line was used in a Simon & Simon episode (Thin Air) originally sent in December 1982. <br /> <br /> The victim's battle was changed, the surviving spouse is one of Rick's "old flames". It is also interesting to note that Gerald McRaney played a role in this Rockford file episode. <br /> <br /> Both episodes were based on a story by Howard Browne - as shown in the list of 'writing credits'. <br /> <br /> Anthony James plays one of his classic television bad roles. <br /> <br /> Continuing the concept of the Rockford files to Magnum PI to Simon & Simon is quite interesting.
