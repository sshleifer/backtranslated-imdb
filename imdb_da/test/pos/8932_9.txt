I've seen this movie on a Sunday night, and I have to say there's no better way to end the weekend. I am completely satisfied with the humor and the warm charm this film offers. It simply leaves me in a beautiful mood. Watching this movie means having a good time and keeping a warm feeling. <br /> <br /> The film offers sharp black British humor and feels very fresh to me. You really enjoy the story and the characters. Brenda Blethyn is so great. I don't know exactly why. She is too old to be a loving interest to me and too young to be my mother. But I feel really comfortable when she comes up in the movie. Some can say that the story was thin and predictable. But who cares? There must simply be a happy end, dancing in the sunshine! Are the characters stereotypes or cuts? I don't know, I don't care! I just loved them and enjoyed them. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that I don't usually like romantic comedies. But this one is excellent: a black comedy with a heart of gold !!
