I watched the movie while I was in a class a few years back in high school. I thought it was a thought-provoking movie that made you look at the power of puzzles. I think the type of people who don't like this movie would be those who don't like solving things or those who get frustrated when they can't solve puzzles. It's a good movie based on a true story that happened in my hometown of Toronto, Ontario. so if you want a real overview of the things happening in the alleys there, watch this movie. And for those who only watch movies to point out plot holes and signs errors, realize that in real life, the same thing happens. But that's all I want to say about it. The streets are good, some are tough, some are not. But the film also leaves you more, more puzzles, more explanation, clearly more. One more thing I want to add is that the ideas in this movie, the underground puzzle world, exist, but there is much more to it. To find it, you can't look for it. Never looking for it would be any way to find it. Add your badge and it will find you.
