This is a surprisingly large budget Horror / Comedy, it is fun and beautifully made, with good performances and a really cool twist ending! All the characters are pretty cool, and the story while the original is very good, plus Eric Jungmann (Adam) and Justin Urich (Harley) had fantastic chemistry together. One of the funniest moments in the movie for me is when Adam is trapped in the bathroom, and Harley wakes up to find the monster truck sitting there and decides to take a truck in the truck, and Aimee Brooks is simply sexy! , plus this is one of the best low-budget horror movies I've seen for a long time. It's very gory, but in a comical way, and I thought it was very well written too, plus Michael Bailey Smith is great as Monster Man and had some evil makeup! It looks like movies like Joy Ride, Duel, Jeepers Creepers, etc. Etc. And it has some exciting moments here and there, plus the Gore effects are really well done for the most part. This is a surprisingly large low budget Horror / Comedy, it is fun and beautifully made, with good performances and a really cool twist ending, I recommend this !! The direction is very good!. Michael Davis is doing really well! work here with a good camera work, good angles, good use of colors, and with a good attitude, plus he kept the movie fun and at a very fast pace. There are many things! . We get extremely bloody nosebleeds, gory impaling's, bloody stabbings, the guy is cut in half a monster truck, human remains in a boiled casserole, guts everywhere, boy's intestines fall out, pencil in the eyes, bloody slit throat, lots of people who walk around without limbs, gory dead squirrels, heads are squished, separated limbs, bloody and lacking corpses, a decent amount of bloodshed, a very crazy scene at the end and more !. <br /> <br /> Action is very good for a low budget movie. Eric Jungmann is fantastic here as Adam, he was a geek, but a very sympathetic, he had fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich, had some cool lines, and I just loved his character, he also seemed to enjoy himself, and he was especially good at the end !. Justin Urich is excellent as a best friend of a best friend, but I just couldn't help loving him as he was very funny and often stole many scenes, I really dug him! Aimee Brooks is beautiful and did well with what she had to do, she had good chemistry with Jungmann, and as Jungmann was especially good at last, I loved her mysterious character. Michael Bailey Smith is wonderful as The Monster Man he was very creepy looking, had some awesome makeup, and is now one of my favorite slashers! The rest of the throw makes it fine. <br /> <br /> Generally, I highly recommend this! *** 1/2 out of 5
