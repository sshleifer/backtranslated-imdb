"The Moon Is Blue" director Otto Preminger tackled even more taboo issues in his controversial 1955 release "The Man with the Golden Arm". While mocking the Motion Picture Association of America with his use of the word "virgin" and "mistress" in his gentle 1953 comedy "The Moon is Blue", Preminger went far beyond what a movie had tried with "The Man with the Golden" Arm "since Dick Powell made his law and order epic" To the end of the earth "(1946) to counter international traffic in drugs. Based on Nelson Algrin's novel, which won the 1950 National Book Award, this cruel, uncompromising 119-minute black-and-white melodrama is about heroin addiction. Originally, when Preminger's movie came out, the Motion Picture Association of America would not issue its approval mark because filmmakers depicted drug dependence. This groundbreaking film qualified as the first big movie to handle drugs from the dope enemy's perspective and actually showed the accessories that junkies used to shoot up heroin. The production code stipulated that filmmakers should refrain from showing signs using illicit drugs. Nevertheless, United Artists released this unique Frank Sinatra image, and it cost over $ 4 million. <br /> <br /> The critical and commercial success of "The Man with the Golden Arm" retired the production code. As a result, the MPAA changed the code so that filmmakers could dive into other taboos such as drug abuse, kidnapping, abortion and prostitution. The film received three Oscar nominations. Oscar nominations went to Sinatra for Best Acting, Joseph C. Wright and Darrell Silvera for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White and Elmer Bernstein for Best Music, scoring a dramatic or comedy picture. In fact, Elmer Bernstein made a name for himself with his jazzy score. The producers had thought of casting Marlon Brando in the title role, but Sinatra beat Brando to the punch. Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang, Darren McGavin and Robert Strauss co-starred with Ole Blue Eyes. McGavin was particularly memorable as a sleazy heroin dealer, while Eleanor Parker played the protagonist's wife with a dark, deep secret of herself that comes as a complete shock. <br /> <br /> "The Man with the Golden Arm" refers to the protagonist Frankie Machine's ability to manipulate a card game. Frankie treats cards to Zero Schwiefka (Robert Strauss from "Stalag 17"), but he has been out of Chicago for the past six months in a federal drug hospital recovering from heroin addiction. Not only has Frankie turned the habit, but he has also learned to play drums and plans to start a music career. Optimistically, as Frank is about his future, he finds himself facing his past once he returns to his old stomping grounds. Schwiefka wants him to handle him again, and Nifty Louie Fomorowski (Darren McGavin from "Counter-Attack") is trying to get him to resume heroin use. Meanwhile, Frankie comes home to his invalid, wheelchair-bound wife, Zosh (Eleanor Parker from "Escape from Fort Bravo") who manipulates him with guilt. Frankie was drunk when he had a car accident, and Zosh got into a wheelchair. Frankie shows with great hopes and a drum set, but Zosh sees no future for him as a musician and encourages going back to work for Schwiefka. Frankie is planning to visit a music promotion and one of his own friends, Sparrow (Arnold Stang from "My Sister Eileen"), store shop from a department store to Frankie. After Frankie refuses to work for Schwiefka because he wants to see musical agent Harry Lane (Will Wright of "The Wild One"), Schwiefka changes both Frank and Sparrow into the police. Meanwhile, Schwiefka Brach's department store gets to drop shop fees. The suit was worth $ 37.00. Frankie agrees to resume the deal to Schweifka and the housekeeper gives him out. Not long after, despite his decision to remove heroin use, Frankie breaks and pays Louie $ 2.00 for a solution. <br /> <br /> Finally, Frankie meets Harry Lane and Lane warns him that he's getting Frankie to shoot up that he has nothing to do with him. What poor Frankie does not know is that Zosh has restored his ability to walk, but she uses her guilt in the accident to hold on to him. Zosh is also jealous of her downstairs neighbor, Molly Novotny (Kim Novak of "Picnic"), Frankie's former boyfriend who hustles drinks at a nearby strip bar called Safari Club. When Zosh complains of headaches, which Frankie gives her practice on her drum kit, Frankie moves them down into Molly's apartment. Schwiefka and Louie are planning a great poker game with Sam Markette (George E. Stone of "Guys and Dolls") and Williams (George Mathews of "Gunfight at the OK Corral"), two big-time players who have heard of Frank and his legendary 'golden arm'. Schwiefka and Louie persuade a reluctant Frankie to act for $ 250. After an early winning strike, Frankie begins to lose, and he can't turn his mishap. In fact, Frankie uses about two days of trading. Exhausted, his nerves shot and desperate for a solution he fell apart the other day, and Markette and Williams made him cheat. Louie refuses to give Frankie a fix so Frankie knocks him out and searches his apartment for heroin. Preminger draws no blows in "The Man with the Golden Arm", and the film is rather disillusioned. None of the characters here are externally sympathetic. In essence, they are either hustlers or hustled. Sinatra gives another dynamite performance like McGavin and Parker. To be sure that "The Man with the Golden Arm" has lost much of its influence in the intervening 50 or more years, but it still stands as a landmark film.
