Rented this out from my room because it was the only new UK movie available this week. Never heard of the filmmaker before or his other movie (thanks IMDB). Ca. once made a good young British comedy that didn't steal Hugh Grant or forty something. The story is a moral narrative, but never preaching, at all pleasing to a young and fresh look. Luke Goss komo was surprisingly very good, but then he surprised me with his excellent performance in 'Blade'. Loved the color gradation, especially in the nightclub's sequences. Great music and a really original voice at work here. Nine out of ten and worth the rental fee.
