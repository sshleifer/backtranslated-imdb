As someone who was in a pan-hellenic sorority, I wasn't sure what to expect when I voted in this show. Having seen so many over dramatizations in "made for television movies" and the craziness of reality shows, I was curious to see if Greek could show the true college and Greek life experience. <br /> <br /> I was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer satisfaction in identifying the recognized characters in this genre, but it could also add depth to the characters. Greek life is not just about parties and petty conflicts. Although these things happen in Greek life, they also happen in any other social or professional circle throughout their lives. Characterizing it as an exclusive experience for those in a Greek organization would be false. Most of the lines of history and situations that take place in Greek can and take place everywhere, in every circle of friends, on sports teams in real life. But I've seen both episodes and my little sister, which I'm still very close to, and I've used both episodes to laugh and be reminded of how they really caught the spirit of our school years and experiences. <Br /> <br /> I liked how the second episode showed how the characters are struggling with the other aspects of their lives; school, relationships, goals, etc. Cappie tells Rusty that the school comes first and goes to your brothers for help, it was very true for life. You can't stay in an organization if you have bad grades. The way Rusty got his job for his professor was far fetched, but it was entertaining. Even the dynamic between Casey and Rusty; It happens that you grow up and whatever your relationship with your siblings was, it changes so you have to adjust. Bottom line: Greek is a good show, good entertainment value and enough "real life" in there to be credible and definitely worth the time.
