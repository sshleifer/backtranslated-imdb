"One Dark Night" is a staple in the 1980's low budget horror genre. Filled with retro puns, clothes and scenery, "ODN" transports the viewer to a simpler time as horror movies were just that ... Horror! Nothing so intense that you can't understand what's going on, the film tells a dark fate of what happens when you mess with the dead. Well acted on it is stable by screaming crowns, and a fine management job by Tom McLoughlin who discovers in time and makes you believe what he presents. There is no "who has done it?" and certainly no big twist at the end. It is straightforward and in your face horror from the beginning to the end, with a lot of 80's humor thrown in for extra spices. I give it "8" simply because some of the special effects are short at the end of the movie, but at least there is no CGI ... Perfect movie for new fans for the 1980's horror genre or someone who wants to live again a fun evening with classic horror bliss.
