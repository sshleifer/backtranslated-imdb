I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of history and character development. Fulci was a master at creating horrible atmosphere using ingenious camera work, live filmography and yes - wonderfully explicit doing. However, this film is no exception, compared to his later film (The Beyond, Zombie 2, The City of the Living Dead, The House by the Cemetery, etc.) The characters here are extremely well developed, and the weight is away from the supernatural and is more tense of a classic that thinned among Italy's lush hills. The landscape is currently reminiscent of the valued folklore and then immediately opposite of mud and blood sucked terrain hailing from devastating ruins. Gore in this movie isn't quite as widespread and seems detained compared to Fulci's later movie, but splatter and giallo fans will probably be satiated by a few close-ups of hurting wounds and the last 5 minutes of the movie. <Br /> <br /> All in all, a fantastic and mature movie from one of our fantastic Italian horror instructors.
