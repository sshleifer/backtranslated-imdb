In the middle of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues to make the documentary and discover a story he had not expected. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best word of the word where a sympathetic but ignorant tells the unnecessarily privileged audience. The story thus has a double tissue, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary. <br /> <br /> Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only to doggedly pursue his story, although it risks his entire performance of his parents' relationship, but also to never give in to sensationalism or melodrama. Although Hollywood's stuff lurks in detail, Doug Block treats the story he wanted everyday. For those of us who have always wondered about our parents' lives before we came on stage (or after we arrived, but while we were too self-centered to notice that they had a life independent of ourselves), 51 Birch Street a fair warning: There are wonderful things in the country, but beware if you choose to enter there. <br /> <br /> But the caution is that the audience is slowly moving around in the details of their parents' past. It's not a warning to those who offered a glimpse of Block's parents. The film is a marvel to make her mother come alive as a living and passionate yet introvert who makes her own conscious decisions during the 50s. The filmmaker's special success is getting the viewers to see the young woman behind the older parent and grandparent. We all know that our parents were once young and energetic, but in 51 Birch Street is the mother. The father, who has been distant, while the filmmaker and his sister grew up eventually remain distant in the film, but it is due more to his own escape character than to his depiction. This biography turned autobiography is dramatic, intense and unforgettable, so you can send viewers scurrying for a closer look at their own family album, but more reluctant to look at the back of those photographs.
