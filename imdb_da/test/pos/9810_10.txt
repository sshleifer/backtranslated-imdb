SPOILER NOTHING MEN SPOILER <br /> <br /> I need to add my name to the list of people who feel that the other viewers just don't get it. But no one has even mentioned the "s" word as far as I have seen. <br /> <br /> While I agree that the child died, I think we can be more specific: He committed suicide. He runs down the slope of an old wagon, shoots out of the rock and ... "flies away". Perhaps the whole purpose of death is allegory, or perhaps he commits suicide in a wagon that lay out. In both cases he flies away (not so hard a metaphor). Maybe I just got one thing for Tom Hanks, but I was ok with the story. In addition, he raises $ for the WW2 memorial and you must love him for it. Oh yes, I loved the movie and found it incredibly mobile.
