In 1961, this series was shown on local television here in Southern California. I and many others have been touching BBC for tape or DVD since then. Now it is suddenly here on Amazon. I ordered in January and now here on March 30 it arrived. It was a long wait (48 years). Was it worth it? So far I've just seen Richard II (I've only had the DVD since 2 o'clock) and I can really say YEA !!! totally worth the wait. The action, direction and production are excellent and even better than I remember. The production is in B&W, but in a way it fits. The video is clear and very good, the sound is flawless. Further evidence of how timeless Shakespeare really is. <br /> <br /> I gave this 10 stars even though I've only seen one of the 8 players. I am sure that once I have seen them all, I will change my rating to at least 12. <br /> <br /> It is currently in stock at Amazon (US Region 1) at a reasonable price. <br /> <I'd rather stop now so I can come back to see. Next is Henry the IV, one of which is my very first Shakespeare player.
