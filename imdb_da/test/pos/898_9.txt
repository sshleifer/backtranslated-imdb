I have so much hope for the successor to Gen-X. Fortunately, my hope has become true. You have a whole lot of action, comedy ... silly comedy and surprises. I think the novice Edison is really a hit in the movie, but I really find Sam's Alien 'stupidly annoying with English. Although the film had some errors in robotics and the stupid dialogue, the action always keeps it strong. The action setup is much stronger than the 1st. <br /> <br /> This movie gets more of an American feel, as 60% of the movie is in English from the Cantonese. This movie won't disappoint you. I recommended this to young people, without worrying about purely action-packed fun. <br /> <br />
