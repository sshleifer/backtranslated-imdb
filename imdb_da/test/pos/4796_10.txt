I love Buñuel's surreal film's absurdity and biting humor (as "the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie" and "the exterminating angel" to name two). Other former works (such as "The Forgotten Ones", if young offenders from a marginal area in Mexico) are more serious and provide a strong social message. But I think it is "Nazarin", as the most successful shot to the heart of the viewer. While it is true that it is merciful with irony, it nevertheless reveals an aspect of Buñuel, which seems to be fascinated by the beauty and solemnity of the spiritual search. Here, while the director (quite typically) throws countless jabs in the Catholic Church, he also surprisingly seems to show an admiration for true Christian thought and its practice of selfless love. "What 拷 斤 拷 Luis Buñuel brilliantly boasts a Jesus-like figure Jeg 斤 拷? I always thought of him as a completely cynical artist without any trace of faith in human virtue ... that is until I looked at" Nazarin ". is that he satirically exposes the difficulty of following the example of Christ in a society infected with evil, ignorance, and sin, but he also presents the hero, father of Nazareth, who alters the light of light in the midst of a dark sea. The movie I looked up to him and not down on him! <br /> <br /> Some would argue that Father Nazario's doubts about his beliefs point to the loss of his sacred values ​​(Alas if he cannot do well in this world, who can?) But I would say that this "error", his frustration, just makes his character more heroic, because it shows how man is and how challenging his struggle must be. the pastor could not eventually get out of the "dark night" and regain Perhaps we have only been presented with a difficult part of his spiritual journey. The elegant, open end (where he desperately accepts fruit from a female stranger) allows us to imagine the ultimate outcome of the story. equipped with brilliant white and social consciousness; but after seeing "Nazarin" I also feel some warmth, a depth and maturity that is not so clear in his other work. <br /> <br /> For the sake of contrast, I strongly recommend looking after his short film "Simon of the Desert" (also made in Mexico several years later). It deals with a similar subject - the abandonment of the ego as opposed to the temptation - it only does it in a hysterically fun and completely irreversible style.
