This is a story of a long and awkward love. The daily life of a woman of 50 and some people around her is depicted. Her daily life is so common and routine that I doubted who was the real main character in the beginning. Then by the audience that the woman and a man who was her high school friend had a very small connection. The woman did the same job - a milk woman and a supermarket casher - so long. There are so many slopes that the supply of milk bottles is a very hard work. The man had married another woman who is now dying of cancer. He works at the town hall and devotees usually cares for her at home. They never look straight or talk to each other, but they never forget each other. <br /> <br /> The original Japanese title means "at some point the days you read books". But of course when the man said, "Now I want to do what I always wanted to do," it was hugging her and loving her. She writes to a radio disc jockey that "If God gives us time to talk, we need at least a full day". Dreaming of the day she has sublimated the desire for hard work and book reader. I personally know a woman who has loved a man for years, even after he married another woman and died for an accident. Therefore, the history setting is not so special. Instead, this film illustrates well-known romances in many ordinary men and women. Through this movie you will remember your romance that has been lost long ago. This is a film with lasting effect.
