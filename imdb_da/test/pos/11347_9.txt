WARNING: SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> This is written for movie walks that may have gone away from "Mood for Love" confused and confused about paths chosen by the protagonists in life. From reading other comments and reviews, many viewers and critics seem to have missed some very important details that may have prevented them from enjoying this delightful drill of a movie. <br /> <br /> We are so accustomed to seeing blatant SEX in narratives that we forget there was a time when movie players would suggest the "dirty deed" by merely showing the dull couples running out into one sled or a horse-drawn carriage, only to return to the next scene with a bulging gut or a fat child stuck in the hip ... "Meet your child". <br /> <br /> The director chose the same nostalgic approach by telling the story of Mr Chow and Mrs. Chan. Last Warning ... SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> Mr Chow fools Mrs Chan to show her real feelings as they practice their departure forever. Next scene: Mrs. Chan leans her head on Mr Chow's taxi and says, "I don't want to go home tonight". Translation: "Let's do it" <br /> <br /> Why didn't the couple just do the modern thing to dump their cheating spouses, change divorce, raise their love child, and live happily ever after? The answer is that this whole story takes place in Hong Kong during the 60s. A bastard would live in a gloomy life if he were a child of a crime, whereas a "legitimate" child could live a tragic but noble / honest life if his mother chose to raise him from his cheating "father" - the invisible Mr. Chan. In short, Chow and Mrs Chan sacrifice their relationship to their child's future. That is why, Mr Chow, learning that Mrs Chan lives alone with a little boy gives a knowing smile and ends his dreams of making Mrs Chan his wife Chow. He also realizes why Mrs Chan went all the way to Singapore to be with him, just to rethink at the last momment and leave .. and never chose to see him again. (But not until he took something named memorable) Chow Chow lives with this wonderful secret with no one to tell. No one except a crumbling temple wall and of course we viewer ... but only if we listen carefully.
