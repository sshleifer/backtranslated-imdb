I find that many people have never seen this movie, and those who have usually dismissed it as garbage ... it's pretty bad really. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie, admittedly, I was almost one of those people ... thank God, I'm patient, otherwise I would never have found such a classic. As greasy as this movie is, it is also a must for anyone who is either a fan of the 80's movie or just happens to have a sense of humor. I know there are many people out there who will tell you that this movie is a kind of better off Dead ... so what if it is? They were both great movies! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that Savage Steve Holland is a genius! 10.10
