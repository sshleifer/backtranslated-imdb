I love this show. It's totally unique. I was under the impression that it would have several seasons. In anticipation of Series 2, I recently bought Series 1 to see it again to be updated when Part 2 started. Now that I saw it, I was thrilled and wanted more so I came to the place to see the table for the continuation. I am really disappointed to see there are no plans for another series as I am looking forward to seeing more of this story with great pleasure. I think they really lost the ball on this one. There were lots of stories left to build on and many unanswered questions. I am now a very unhappy sight, and I hope they will rethink their decision and retrieve the story where it left off.
