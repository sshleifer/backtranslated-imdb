All over the world is the unmistakable imprint of the American C.I.A. can be found in many a muddled mess they have left behind. Initially, their goals were simple: spying, removing enemy agents, stealing classified information, and destabilizing unfavorable governments. Years have passed, and even though their mission remains the same, their secret black operations now include domestic pioneering, discreditation by US citizens and infiltrating US organizations criticizing the US government. However, this film is centered on C.I.A.'s World Man Hunt for the infamous 'Carlos, the Jackel'. The film is called "The Assignment" and tells the story Lt. Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez, (Aidan Quinn) an American name leader who has a striking resemblance to the mastermind of so many terrorist bombs. Recruited by Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) from C.I.A. and Amos (Ben Kingsley), a special agent of the Israeli mashed, is secretly trained by Ramirez to see, pose, infiltrate the unfavorable organization and then discredit the real Jackel working for the Russians. This film is explosively exciting and filled with wild hunting, killing and intermittent chaos. Quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic playing both sides of the war. Easy one of his best efforts. ****
