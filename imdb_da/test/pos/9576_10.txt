This is the only Christopher Guest movie that competes with Spinal Tap and Princess Bride for pure entertainment value, but somehow it never comes close to recognition. The plot surrounds the participants - dogs - and their owners as they wake up in the competitive world ... OK, it's about a dog show. The owners are really characters that one should be so attached to their dogs. It's really all there is to it, but it makes it fun enough. You would never be able to convince me that a mock-u dog show mentor would be fun before you caught the fun scene where Levy and O'hara visit Larry Miller's house on TV ... but that's really all what is required to convert any doubt. Spinal Tap was non-stop hilarity, joke after joke, while the Best in Show had a few lulls (and so I mean say 3 minutes in MEST, where something spooky fun doesn't happen), but the big laugh is even bigger. <br /> <br /> Casting in this one is great and even though it is typically out of place, uh movies in general Parker Posey does a fine job. In fact, her tirade is aimed at Ed Begley Jr. and a pet grocery store owner over a lost dog toy is probably the funniest running gag of the movie. What is great about this movie for me is how the authors somehow managed to weave a plot, simply as it was around these big jokes, so it actually felt like it was heading. I guess there's a freedom to have such a minimal plot. Everyone's role is pretty well designed here and the characters are rarely over-the-top. Realism of how pathetic they seem to outsiders is what makes it more fun than Mighty Wind or the uneven Guffman. I actually meet wierdos like this now and then. If you like the guest's stuff at all, you should definitely own it.
