COMING on the heels of the 1970's "Blackploitation" Era, CONRACK (20th Century Fox, 1974) offered the public a low-key, sincere and everyday people as a drama. Offering a very different fair to the audience (which was far more general than the "Gansta" flicks); Being an earthly dose of realism offered a lonely counterbalance to these shoot-ups. <br /> <br /> REPLACEMENT OF STUDENTS, there were bad ass detectives, super flights and megs / macks / pimps (choose your terminology), was a lonely, humble and gentle teacher. The academic we are talking about is the main character, Pat Conroy; who is the only lonely teacher who is hired to take responsibility for some kind of old time a schoolhouse on an island off the South Carolina coast. <br /> <br /> "CONRACK" (Jon Voight) The name that the young people duplicate him finds terribly behind the school. In addition to the physical characteristics of this "Little Red School House", every systematic and gradually educated education system was completely absent. <br /> <br /> By the way, we mention the additional complications of any successful educational venture were manifested in two indisputable facts. It was that Pat Conroy was both an outsider and he was white; With almost the entire population of this off-shore cay was black and very poor. <br /> <br /> PERPETING these unacceptable and regrettable conditions were the agents of the local teaching council; to be the school's boss, Mrs Scott (madge sinclair) and superintendent, mr. skeffington (Mr. hume cronyn). Between the two, we are made to understand that the teacher who is the low man on the totem pole is powerless in most respects to influence any kind of meaningful and long-lasting improvement. BUT don 'tell you a' Young Turk 'like Pat Conroy that he can't. (Can't do anything it is). "Conrack" spends a year of unorthodox classroom performances and makes real progress; but unfortunately the strong leader will not give in and recognize the authority of his superiors. While he is by law and unfamiliar to him, you serve super pleasure; he violates Mr. Skeffington's specific order and prohibition of taking his class children to the South Carolina mainland on Halloween for some Trick-or-Treating; even goes to the crooked action to stop with them in Skeffington's residence. NEXT we see a Western Union Telegram messenger happily singing as he crosses from the Carolina mainland to the island; where he delivers the telegram to Conroy, carrying the news of his dismissal from his post at that school and district. <br /> <br /> BEFORE one can be fired lying, Pat files fit against Mr. Skeffington, President Mrs Scott and the Board of Education protest at his dismissal as illegal. In an impartial review of both the "offense" and the law, the judge asks Skeffington if there is less punishment that can replace Conroy's separate from the school system; which he receives a negative answer to. Appropriate the judge judges the jersey with his gable pounding down and says, "It's very simple!" The story is brought to a bitter-sweet conclusion, as the "Conrack" students look to the mainland launch, while a phonograph entry gives us BEETHOVEN'S 5 SYMPHONY; who had played an important role in the Conroy training agenda as well as our history. <br /> <br /> In HUMBLE's opinion, this author's story (which we believe is at least semi-autobiographical, even giving the protagonist's name) was much more than a narrative of a localized event. To both me, Pal Schultz and Meself; This is a kind of portrayal of a microcosm that represents the overall regrettable situation that permeates government schools across the nation. (Just one opinion) <br /> <br /> FOR THIS MOVIE, only one of many films depicted the shops of ordinary folk music; leading their lives to "quiet desperation" in the country's vast hinterland, which lies outside DC Beltway and the city centers of business and communication located on either the Atlantic or Pacific coasts. EVERYWHERE small way, this is a fine movie that will soon be joined in the movie vault of the 20th Century Fox by such great works as NORMA RAE and BREAKING AWAY. (both from TCF in 1979). <br /> <br /> SEE it if you are not yet. Recommended by both Schulz and his friend. * <br /> <br /> NOTE: * Why, of course I am! <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
