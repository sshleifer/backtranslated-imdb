Exciting, action-packed and interesting film tells the story of a group of men stationed on a naval base in Italy and their adventures aboard a marine submarine during WWI. Tommy and Brick (played by Robert Montgomery and Robert Young) are two friends and make a couple of very beautiful officers, I must say. A new captain arrives on board, already known by a couple as "Dead Pan" Tolerators (Walter Huston), and he is a real stickler to follow the rule book and an "honor code". Soon Tommy and Brick emptied after an attractive blonde on an officer's dance, Tommy insulted the captain - and of course, the blonde is actually the captain's daughter. But Tommy wins anyway, as he and daughter slip away from the dance to a street carnival outside, and soon tie under an air strike - unfortunately for him, she reveals that she is married. Later, Tommy comes into some real trouble when he doesn't comply with orders in an attempt to save his friend. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite entertaining with an absorbing plot line that kept my interest and top-notch performances by everyone. A climactic death scene with Sterling Holloway is really entertaining - the most memorable scene in this movie I thought. Eugene Palette and Jimmy Durante add a bit of humor here and play a few goofballs - Durante's character is actually studying to be a mail order dentist and has ongoing country-run-ins with a British man making fun of his nose. Okay - if you're looking for a movie showing a man boxing a kangaroo, it would be one.
