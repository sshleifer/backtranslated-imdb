I can't say I embrace this as a romantic comedy when I found some fun about it. I found it appealing, entertaining, cordial and terminally sweet, and while there were some witty moments, I found them more bittersweet than direct comedic. <br /> <br /> I liked this one. Barrymore has grown as much as an actress, and it's always great to catch her on the big screen, but it also translates well into the small screen. In fact, with subsequent viewing, I like this one and more. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the romantic comedy, then you may be a bit cut off by the lack of comedic effect with this, but if you are into it for romance, it is definitely here. It ranks a 7.8 / 10 from ... <br /> <br />.
