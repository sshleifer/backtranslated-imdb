I watched this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver. The screen was three rows in front of me and about 12 "x 10". So I really didn't want to see it. But I like Malcolm in the middle, so I thought I'd see just a few minutes. Next thing I know I was sucked in, good at it, and was happy how good it was and how fast it seemed to make time pass. I agree that the play is very good for this level of entertainment. Being one of the older baby boomers, I was also happy to see Lee Majors with a role in the movie, as with a few other actors who were famous (Jamiel?) "Yesterday" but are out of daylight today heck fun on himself. <br /> <br /> It's your basic "child is wrong, the child gets straight (and then some) and everyone enjoys themselves going". No heavy thinking, no great analysis needed. Just a good fun way to pass the time. <br /> <br /> 3.5 out of 5.
