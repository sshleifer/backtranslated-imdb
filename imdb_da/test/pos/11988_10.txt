The only possible flaw in this movie is the title !! Please stop comparing it with the first one! In my previous review, I only separated it from the first. If you haven't seen the movie and are curious, forget about the first thing and invent another name for this. There is nothing alike and has a mood all its own. This is a great exponent of screwed mid-80s comedy. I seriously doubt that big names in this cast made the movie because they were broke or even wanted to reuse the first one. Anyone who would ever give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. I know the only reason this is in the IMDB bottom 100 is because of its title. I usually hate movies like these (that is, Adam Sandler, Farrell, Farrelly Bros ....), but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically. Maybe I am, maybe it's like a bad relationship, I can't get out of or just a ridiculously guilty pleasure. Either way, this is the most underrated movie from the 80s behind 'The Stunt Man.' <br /> <br /> Robert Stack-We love you !!! (1919-2003)
