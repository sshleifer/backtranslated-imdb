Owen loves her mother ... only he would love her better six feet in this dark, laughable comedy, both stars and directed by Danny DeVito, with admirable help from Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the title role. <br /> <br /> "Throwing Momma From The Train" is a great comedy, even though it's not a good movie. It is too low in parts, and the end feels less organic than adhered to. But it's mostly a gut-splitting trip, with Crystal and DeVito using big-screen chemistry while working on their own separate cartoon, taking the core of being a struggling writer (DeVito is eager, but unaware, Crystal is blocked and bitter ). <Christian's Professor Donner believes his former wife stole his book (the so-called "Hot Fire") and cannot write more than the opening line in his next book, which does not come easy. He teaches a creative writing class of budding mediocrity, including a medieval woman who writes Tom Clancy-type fiction, but doesn't know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through; and an upholstery seller who wants to write the story of his life. Mr. Pinsky is probably the funniest character for acting per. Minute on the screen, an ascot-bearing weirdo who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus: "100 girls I want pork". <br /> <br /> There is the DeVitos Owen Lift, which calls itself Professor Donner's "star pupil", even though the teacher does not read his class work. Owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie, a human child in his late 30s, who lives with his indulgent mother, Anne Ramsey, who calls him "lardass" and other loving emotions. In another movie we will be asked to be upset by Owen, but "Throw Momma From the Train" piles the cruelty of life on this sad case of laughing and expects us to move on. That's a big reason why this movie is likely to lose a lot of people. <br /> <br /> For those of us who enjoy this kind of humor, even identifying with him and taking the rest of what we see here as a Lark, it is not so much a stretch to go along with the bigger gambit, this comedy takes, and asks us to look at rides while Owen listens to Professor Donner's help in a plan to kill his mother. In fact, he first goes to Hawaii to kill Donner's hated ex, and tells the professor it's his turn to kill Mrs Lift, "swapping murders" as seen in Hitchcock's "Strangers On A Train." a director, DeVito not only complements his actor's performances with stage setting that focuses on dialogue; he makes some bold visual statements, throws in bits of entertaining unreality to keep the audience on his toes (and away from taking too seriously.) < br /> <br /> Also helps the case is author Stu Silver, who keeps the grins come up with his quote. "You have rats the size of Oldsmobiles here." "She's not a woman ... She's a Terminator." "A little murder and I'm Jack the Ripper." It's all Crystal's words, but some of the funniest lines that only work in context, but absolutely kill, are DeVito and Ramsey's. Apparently, Silver never wrote another play after this, according to IMDb, and it's a shame because he had a real talent for it. <br /> <br /> The best scene in this movie, when Crystal meets Ramsey, was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical "upcoming attraction" presentation, the only time I've seen a movie being promoted that way. Owen introduces the professor to his mother as 'Cousin Patty', and when Momma says he doesn't have a cousin Patty, panic loses Owen it. "You lied to me," he shouts and slaps the professor's forehead with a forehead. Of course, the professor will not really groan something witty from the floor, but "Throw Momma From The Train works efficiently at such moments when playing his Looney Tunes vibe for everyone's worth. DeVito is of course not gone from movies, but it is mystery, why he has not really followed up on the film's directorial promise, perhaps because, as' Cast Momma From Train's lack of mainstream success shows, his kind of vision is not to everyone's taste. It is too bad for us to see This time and again and likes it.
