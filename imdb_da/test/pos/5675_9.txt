If you've ever seen Open Water, it's the same kind of gritty, edgy, indie-style movie. I liked the action, excitement. the slow building of it all, i just hope they do not do this, what they did for open water, with the successor .. but anyway, the only thing i did not like was the annoying younger sister ,, i rowed for the hook all the time. The movie basically starts as it should, children pack up for a trip, they hire a guide who mysteriously left 5 minutes. before coming there, so I assume his assistant takes the two sisters, and boyfriend out on the water, now you have this the other day of their adventure, curiously the first day they used to guess, hmm a crocodile farm .. so they are out there and everything is good for a while ,, so bang ,, crocodile time ... very intense ,, you know something in this movie, you can't see the crocodile, a whole heel of a lot ,, but when you do ,, it is very scary ,, i love the hook's nose and eyes ,, and the fog cloth, which seems to pay tribute to the hook every time he raises his head over the water ,, very very scary but good ,, Generally, it's a great movie, if you can get past the annoying little sister.
