Rachael Ray appeals to viewers of all ages and backgrounds, novice cookers or "seasoned" veterans. You will be dazzled with a varied presentation of lovely but time-efficient dishes, jazzed up with its unique brand of spunk and candor. Most importantly, this hip chic keeps her audience drawn in by stimulating all five senses. Let me explain. Her program enlightens your visual sensation, sense of feeling and sense of feeling through a rich, luminous background, light-hearted, laid-back, yet engaging subjects, eye-pleasing, appetizing meals, and her hearty smile and laughter that will taste your nerves. (The scent of smell and taste is rewarded when you test the recipes in your own kitchen and among your own family and friends). Check out her show guys.
