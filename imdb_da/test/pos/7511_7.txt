this movie is fun fun fun my favorite quote from the movie "i think i saw half naked indians in my room last night" answers there were no hallucinations, it was an indian in your room "and another is" what in hell are you talking about about what in hell you are talking about "but if i ever get admitted to a hospital like this, i would be ready to write my will on the spot ... i would say that in my opinion three very funny characters in this movie is the most fun, but three are the funniest to me, even though their lines were few .. and don't get me started on the crack pot patient hehehe that i will keep secret and quick pace too.
