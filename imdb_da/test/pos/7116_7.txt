House of Dracula works from the same basic premise as the House of Frankenstein from the year before; namely, the three most famous monsters of universals; Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and The Wolf Man appear in the movie together. Of course, the movie is rather cluttered, but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the movie's seventy-seven minutes do not get boring. It is obvious that the idea of ​​making another monster mash came into the author's head before a real plot did, as the yarn we get is not without holes. The reason sees Count Dracula coming to Dr. Edelman's home and asks for a cure for his vampyrism. So what can only be described as one case, Lawrence Talbot sees, a. The Wolf Man turns up and asks for a cure for his suffering! It turns out that Dracula is on prowl for Edelman's daughter, but Talbot is really serious. When it turns out he can't be stopped from becoming a wolf, The Wolf Man throws himself into the sea ... where he ends up finding Frankenstein's monster. Overall, this movie isn't as good as the previous House of Frankenstein. The 1944 film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does, as the plot here does not give equal time to every universal monster. Dracula's plot is the biggest in the beginning, but soon fizzles out only to revive at the end. Wolf Man is the star's show, but his story never really develops, and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in. Frankenstein's monster gets the coldest hand he only appears in the film as an afterthought. and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie. The story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting, but it is a little disappointing as he is not the reason why people will watch this movie. The act is good enough, with John Carradine showing his scary side, and Lon Chaney Jr again to make sure his character is bathed in tragedy. Glenn Strange is given nothing to do and Onslow Stevens proves the real highlight as Dr. Edelman. Overall, this movie won't do much for anyone who is not a fan of Universal Horror; But as stupid monster films go, the House of Dracula is worth seeing.
