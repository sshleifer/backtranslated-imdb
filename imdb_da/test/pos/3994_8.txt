This movie, which won Im Kwon-Taek, the best director in Cannes in 2002 (bound by PT Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a Korean 19th-century painter with a common roots and a significant influence on Korean painting . One of the strengths? The movie is that I try to help us look with the eyes of a painter, so we see several scenes and objects that help our drunk painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik) inspiration. Costumes and artistic direction are all impressive, and the play is even good. It's not a movie that moved me, but it was someone who made me think of art and what it means to find your own voice in it. It's pretty cold. It is also interesting to see a version of Korea in those times just before the turn of the century, where Chinese and Japanese powers are both in Korea and Chosun's kingdom is coming to an end. More than one revolution and political ideology are gathered in the movie, but are never the center. It's fixed on the painter. In the end, it's a suitable movie about a master's life. But it doesn't just have the normal three-act structure plot, so you must be able to take a non-standard Hollywood story to see it. Yay for art! 8.10
