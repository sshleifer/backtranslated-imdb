I was not familiar with this movie until I saw it on a list of Top 20 Spaghetti Westerns I recently came across (after the marathon I made these last weeks of movies from the subgenres); It was therefore gratifying that the film had to turn almost on Italian television at the end of the night (for the first time I am pretty sure for a good number of years)! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the cable reception of the channel it was broadcast on has not been great lately: I recorded the movie on VHS, but I decided not to keep it because of this factor; As it happened, the next day I looked at the movie, I found out that it was available on a region 2 DVD from Italy (with an interview with uncredited scriptwriter Ernesto Gastaldi) - and after being adequately impressed, I decided to book it there and then, even though I knew I wouldn't come to the DVD for a while, as I would like to allow some time between a movie and the next! A short bracket here: When I recently bought a slate of Spaghetti Westerns on Italian DVD, I did not choose to order Sergio Sollima's FACE TO FACE (1967) when I was under the impression that it was a bone affair; However, I just learned that the disk actually contains an interview with the director (as was the case with THE BIG GUNDOWN [1966] that I bought). It seemed to confuse me that Sollima would not offer similar contributions to the movie's DVD edition when he actually considered FACE TO FACE as his favorite work (according to the director's talent bio included on Blue Underground Region 1 disc of yet another Sollima Spaghetti Western - RUN, MAN, RUN [1968]); The problem is that I loved THE BIG GUNDOWN so much that I followed it with a view of FACE TO FACE via the recording I owned made by Italian TV! I ordered the DVD of that movie now - especially as it is still discounted - but as I said about another look at the PRICE OF POWER (though I can still check Sollima's interview when the disc arrives) ... < br /> OK, rant over: The movie under review is quite an unusual Spaghetti Western and a very interesting, indeed ambitious one, implementing the JFK case to an Old West setting! In fact, it reminds us of Anthony Mann's terse black-and-white thriller THE TALL TARGET (1951) - which dealt with an attempted murder of the then-USA life. President Abraham Lincoln. It has one of the most popular Italian stars from this subgenre, Giuliano Gemma, in what is perhaps his most impressive Western role (many of his other films tend to have a shining bend). The supportive cast contains at least two other notes: Van Johnson (in one of his few and mostly unremarkable Italian films) that the US President killed in after the civil war, Dallas and Fernando Rey as head of a conspiracy of southern people - which not only plots his murder, but also conveniently maneuvering the new acting American leader, Johnson's Vice President, by extortion! <br /> <br /> Benito Stefanelli also has a good impression as a corrupt sheriff persecuting Gemma the whole picture and with whom he is engaged a few times in a "duel in the dark" - with the guns resting on the floor instead for in their respective envelopes and the only light in the room that was available at the end of the cowboys cigars! Also involved are Ray Saunders as Gemma's black sidekick, who eventually becomes the convicted "Lee Harvey Oswald" figure. Stelvio Massi - who later cuts his teeth as a director on a number of police theses - lies behind the film's luminous filmography; Likewise, Luis Enrique Bacalov delivers another great "Euro-Cult" score - which is different enough from Ennio Morricon's style to be just as different. Valerii's direction here may be as impressive as in other Spaghetti Westerns, but he handles the procedure efficiently (the final warfare is extremely well done); the movie is definitely one of the more undervalued entries in the subgenres, and for those who are so inclined, the novelty of the plot line alone should make it look for ...
