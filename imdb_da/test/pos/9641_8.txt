Robert Montgomery and Robert Young are excellent as a duo of young submarine officers stationed in Italy during the First World War. The dialogue is very entertaining, and Jimmy Durante is fun as the ship's chef, "Ptomaine". Walter Houston's character is inspiring as the submarine captain, a star example of an officer and a gentleman. One of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the level of technology shown in the battle scene. I was surprised at how technology in World War I was for technology 25 years later in World War II. The basic human nature was portrayed as very similar to modern times, and far from the conservativeism I thought existed in the so-called "innocent" past. All in all, I felt that the cast, the characters, the action scenes and the history of this movie were first-rate.
