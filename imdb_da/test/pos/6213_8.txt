Let's get it out of the way, so those who check this page looking for information about everything related to the word "Breasts" (and you know who you are, googlers) can move together: this is not in any way pornographic. On the contrary, if this has any value as masturbation material, then it was honest that the filmmaker did not do a good job as the goal is to keep it on topic and about women's experiences and their bodies and images of themselves and society and health and so on. In fact, I would be a little careful about the one who encountered this on DVD or, if ever playing again, late at night on HBO or Cinemax and used it as a means of joy. You might as well go to the supermarket and pick up a few mature melons and take them home and squeeze them and well, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> No, it's a semi-serious movie, which makes it possible to watch premium night shows, but it shouldn't be just for late night types. This is intimate in setting but not in tone. All the women, in their many different shapes and sizes, and running, and even with a man thrown in with fake breasts, have something to say about life experience in the simplest way. If I say semi-serious, it is because of the many small segments that the director feels she should throw in, with the archive films of old "how-to" videos about puberty and sex and breasts and super rare cartoons with the knockers flying over. This is not a problem but an asset: we need a few small visual ways to go between these interviews. <br /> <br /> Nothing is held back and we see it as feminism in a liberating form: they don't have to cover up, and though they choose not to take their tops and shirts and bras, they are still open as can Be about a natural part of their body that is the subject of sex, surprise, comfort, discomfort, curiosity, motherhood, and unfortunately cancer. In the latter part there is another brave step taken when we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast. You know you have become mature and an adult when you can see this woman who somehow has gone on to live half a normal life with a breast (the most bitter-sweet moment is when she says if a fairy godmother said she could have a desire to have two full breasts, she should think about it) and you do not sneak or go "eww, rough." It's the test, guys. <br /> <br /> It's not shot under the best circumstances, but then again for television it's edited with a tight pace. It is never boring for a moment, and we never feel like someone is holding back, especially when a man can hear the hard truth that the breasts may not really be erogenous or that a flat breast is very attractive to some men. Chest: A documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and breasts and minds and hearts that are tame. If it is worth a "I was alone" session, then, the more power for you, I believe, even if it is not the intention.
