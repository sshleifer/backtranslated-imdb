I have never heard of Mishima before I watched this movie, and although parts of it are a bit boring, I still find myself attracted to seeing it when repeated on the box. At the beginning of the film, we are told whether a famous Japanese writer behaves like a lunatic and commits seppuku publicly. As the film progresses, you are gently initiated into the twisted logic of Mishima's mind. The stages of his life are presented in four chapters. Each chapter itself is a mixture of two contrast stories, the first continuing the story with scenes from Mishima's life and appearing in black and white. The second story is an adaptation of scenes from a novel and these are recorded as a game and recorded in vibrant colors. There is another novel in each chapter. Between each chapter, the narrative returns to the present, as Mishima continues toward his possible ritual suicide. This means that drama and excitement are maintained to the end. <br /> <br /> I suppose many people will find this movie to be boring pretentious and artistic. I respect it, this is not a movie for people who want action and a strong storyline. If, on the other hand, you are the kind of person who enjoys the opportunity to penetrate the mind, a bizarre man while watching his life story told in collage of beautiful pictures set to music by Philip Glass, you will love it. I loved it. <br /> <br />
