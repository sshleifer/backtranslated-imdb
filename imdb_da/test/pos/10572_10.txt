I watched this movie recently and fell in love with it. I loved the story and the actors. It has a bit of everything. I was completely taken by the unfolding of the story. It has so many surprises along the way. I highly recommend it. In fact, I loved it so much that I ran out and bought the book. I felt I had to read it to appreciate the art of writing behind the film. I also wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything in the book, but kept out of the movie. I recommend people who love the movie to read the book because there is enough difference in the book, especially in the second episode, to read it. It's become my favorite movie. I'm now a Sarah Waters and Elaine Cassidy fan !!
