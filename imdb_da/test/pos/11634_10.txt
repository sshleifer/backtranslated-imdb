yes barney is something wild now, but when i was a child it was perfect sense. I didn't get any smarter, but I enjoyed it. as a child I was mocked because no one could say my name so I changed it. ever since I was 4 I have been named Tina from barney because I could relate to her from another culture. i am 17 now and barney is a big part of my life. ... my name came from it .... I can't see the show I grew up with no matter how stupid it looks. I don't care if I get blocked, I have nothing more to say. They should not make a minimum of 10 lines because some people just don't have much to say. ok, done
