Yes!!!! Fassbinder and Ballhaus are at the top of their game, back in 1973! It's about the same subject, but in my opinion it's a much better movie than THE MATRIX (1999), at least it was 200 times cheaper! Very nice camera work by Michael Ballhaus and the wonderful "Albatross" by Fleetwood Mac at the end. Fassbinder creates a very humorous tone for the entire movie. It's a pity that this movie was never released on DVD. But now after 37 years, they finally came to the conclusion that this television movie is not only one of the best Fassbinder films (although there are many Fassbinder films), this is an excellent example of a science Fiction movie, made without much money. Buy it!! See it!!
