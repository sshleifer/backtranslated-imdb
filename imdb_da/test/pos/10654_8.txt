It was surprising that a quiet movie could be so easy to see. The economy with which it has been edited and the film structure itself are the key elements contributing to this. <br /> <br /> The film really takes the spirit of the revolution it is dealing with - you really sympathize with sailors and citizens. Of course, this film has its own agenda, but since it is virtually redundant, it can be seen as an entertainment in a much clearer sense. The excitement created on the screen is excellent - starting with the battleship itself and then moving on to the mainland. Things are escalating credibly and for a movie of it's era, it's really quite incomplete in revealing the victims of the characters in the movie. This is really worth sitting through (that's if you can adjust your modern viewing habits for 90 minutes).
