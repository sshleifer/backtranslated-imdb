This is a rather unclear, silly screaming movie in the 1970s Everglades. It is really stupid and paralyzed in the first half, so it actually begins to be good for the last half. There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends, scattered with shots from a cemetery song, I don't know. It's fascinating. I was impressed with the night scenes because it actually looked like the night, unlike most low budget horror movies where it still looks like daytime. I feel that the director was really talented, but worked with a small budget and a hard plan. There are a few scenes towards the end, one mentioned above and also the final credits that are extremely cool. This movie could have been a true classic if it left its Scooby Doo conventions behind and went straight to the neck. I was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be. I couldn't take my eyes off it and I had to ask myself "why?"
