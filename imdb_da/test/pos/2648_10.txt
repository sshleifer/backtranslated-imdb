This feature is definitely, certainly one of the greatest films in its or any other genre. Kubrick is not just one of the greatest directors at all times, but his entire filmography must be put in a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike anything I've ever seen on the screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors who can pull you in and keep you imprisoned from start to finish, even with lack of extended dialogue or plot development. Only with visuals together, 2001 is able to present a picture of the future that is both sublime and scary. 10 out of 10, no doubt. For my money it won't be much better than 2001: A Space Oddysey .... now, the sequel, 2010 ... it's another story.
