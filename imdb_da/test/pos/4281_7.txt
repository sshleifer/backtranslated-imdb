I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has something to blame for, everyone is right. I have not read many other viewers here and complain about Anne's morality and whether James wants to maintain her love for her, despite her cheating on him, but I do not agree. <br /> <br /> I found Anne (Emily Watson) absolutely wonderful and I felt love for her. <br /> <br /> She was a heavily repressed woman, her actions were not planned: when she started breaking free, she was in confusion and made many mistakes. But then in reality, when you get freedom, you will probably make mistakes (especially at the starting point). Was she a little too ungrateful? Maybe. But we must remember that she is driving with her feet for the first time. She knows that James is after all a good man, maybe a little too stiff, serious and work centered; but she also feels the urge to live life as herself. <br /> <br /> Is she blamed more than him? I think no. <br /> <br /> But the trip that happens in their lives creates some changes. <br /> <br /> Instead of letting his wife leave her life (as other viewers suggested as the right choice), James bites the ball and waits, hoping for the better. He begins to understand that what he was superficially OK (his marriage) was in fact a control game played by him on his wife. <br /> <br /> This is not a story of characters that have over-emotional and insecure character (ie, the usual clich√© Latin American or Italian jealousy), it is a story of men and women using both heart and mind. brain. <br /> <br /> It can be very painful but if you really love a person (women or man) and if you are not a terribly unstable nature, you will probably forgive his / her cheating and leave him / her go. Unless you are a jealous, prehistoric, criminal-of-passion inclined, possessive and mentally unstable person. A really good movie. The last scene where James - after all that happened before - joins Anne to the train station, really moves: She is free and he understood what freedom means to a person. <br /> <br /> Guido
