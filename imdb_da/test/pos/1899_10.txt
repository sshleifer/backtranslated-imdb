Someone interested in what black film does was like in the 70s watch this movie. Some dialog in this movie is so funny the IE summary of my submission. Also note that the boom microphone appears in some of the scenes as well as some of the best karate acts ever. Don't take the movie seriously, or you will be disappointed, go into it with an open mind and enter the world of the worst mutha in the world Dolemite !!! Editing wisely its compound as it was cut with a razor, but once again this movie is so much more than what you see in the movie it has affected the black community in ways you cannot understand !!!
