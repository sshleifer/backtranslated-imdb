I would like to thank you for giving me a chance to be one of the first to actually watch the movie. It really grabbed you. John Paul eventually gets to see the light and make a life for himself without being tied to his mothers disguise strings. <br /> <br /> I imagine there should be so many families these days in the same position (especially with children who leave home older, but I don't want to say wiser) with very sad parents who don't really have their own lives and that make their lives miserable. I think this movie should definitely have a wider audience. I would also say that the other actors also played brilliant parts. It is such a deep film and very moving.
