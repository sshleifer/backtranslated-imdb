KRAMER VS KRAMER won five Oscars, including Best Picture of 1979. This intense and profound family drama follows an advertising consultant whose life is turned upside down when his wife goes on him for eight years and lets him take care of his son and build a relationship with him he never had. Robert Benton's sharp plays show us flawed but real people with hearts, souls, and brains. For example, in the scene where Joanna announces Ted, she leaves him, she just storms out of the door ... she gives him the keys, her credit card, the cleaning card, tells him what bills are paid, and informs him that She has withdrawn from their bank account the same amount she had when they were married, no more. This decision to leave was not a whim. Didn't think it was right to take Billy. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer, a man so obsessed with bringing the bacon home, he had no idea that his home life was crumbling. Meryl Streep also won an Oscar, which played Joanna, the unhappy wife we ​​feel sympathetic to at the start of the movie, but that everyone changes when she returns to her son. Hoffman is at the top of his form here. I always hit the stage where he tries to explain to Billy (Justin Henry, Oscar nominee) why his mother left, and he does it all at one stage whisper or when he meets Joanna after her return and slams her drink into a wall (a Hoffman moment not in the script that Streep was not told to get a natural reaction). Justin Henry hits all the right notes like Billy, the confused little boy who doesn't know why his mother is gone and doesn't know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also got an Oscar nod like Ted and Joanna's neighbor, Margaret, who changed allegiances at the film's conclusion. This is an intense family drama, but there are laughs here too ... Billy and chocolate chips ... Billy pouting because Ted is late and picks him up for a party ... Billy catches his father's stand with one night JoBeth Williams) road to the bathroom that is naked, but it is the moment of human drama you remember ... Ted runs through Manhattan with Billy in his arms to get to the emergency room after BIlly falls out of the jungle gym ... Ted gets fired just before he begins his defense fight and instead of making a scene he tells the guy with a whisper ... "Shame on you." And of course, the final, where Joanna tells Ted, she doesn't take Billy, which I found a little hard to swallow. Why should she go to all the problems of suing for custody and then just change her mind? But this is a small question about a wonderful movie, masterfully directed by Robert Benton and perfectly done by a top-notch cast. A must-see.
