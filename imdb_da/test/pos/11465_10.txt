This is a great scary movie for people who don't want everything that throws up and throws up and sensationalism. This movie has equal amounts of horror, excitement, humor and even a little light nudity, but nothing big. Linnea Quigley is not over the top as she was in the "Return of the Living Dead", where she danced naked on a crypts, but she is still essentially the same slutty character. Cathy Podewell is a virgin and giant character before moving on to Dallas, and we are also introduced to Amelia [soon Mimi] Kinked, the sexy and scary would be dark matron in the house. When she and Linnea possess and take over the house, they re-animate the bodies of their dead friends to scare the boundaries out of the survivors. I've heard many people compare this movie with "The Evil Dead", but if anything, this movie is a rival to the same way Freddie rivaled Jason. However, this movie series is far better than the one!
