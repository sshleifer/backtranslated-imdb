Of course, my 10/10 rating applies only if you are willing to become completely and completely exhausted *. Because you know that only John Waters can do it. In "Pink Flamingos" (his direct debut), he portrays two families locked in battle to see who can be the dirty person alive. What Divine celebrity at the end broadly answers the question. But even so, the movie is basically an excuse to shock people beyond what you would normally imagine. You'd better have a very strong stomach to watch this movie. Even some of the lines are pretty insane. <br /> <br /> * Otherwise, avoid this movie as if you wanted Ebola virus!
