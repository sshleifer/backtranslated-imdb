Imagine spending the summer without your family or friends from school and meeting new people. Or, it is your first time when you are a nobody and the only person you can count on is someone from the camp. "Meatballs" pack lots of comedies in this movie. In the camp there is an eccentric adviser (Bill Murray) who knows how the boys and girls can feel good. Enter a child named Rudy (Chris Makepeace) who has no one to look up to. He doesn't fit in with anyone, only Tripper can make him have fun. The rest of the can is just as crazy as Tripper. Camp Northstar is an average camp with an above average team. The one hand Camp Mohawk is an elite camp that has them running for their money. In the basketball game, the Mohawks pants! And in the Olympics, the Northstar war got the revenge they needed when one of the members took the saboteur. And Morty (Harvey Atkin), this poor soul can never get into gear if he tried. A very, very fun comedy, and it's a great goalkeeper, I say. This movie shows that the camp can be fun if you wanted to be! 5 stars!
