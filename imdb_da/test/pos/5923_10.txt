A great movie about victory over all the nay-sayers trying to kill your spirit, achieving the impossible. I will not continue with that, except to say that I like to reflect on this movie when I face something particularly scary and realize that if Lindberg could do what he did, I can certainly face the task in front of me . Definitely a "feel good" movie. <br /> <br /> See it. You will not be disappointed.
