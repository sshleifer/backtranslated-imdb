James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just beautiful and charismatic, but really open and vulnerable in a sincere manner. On the Tristan screen, some people were on the back to be pouty and sullen and do the whole of James Dean things, but I don't think that's true. Blind Spot is proof of his enormous talent. In this movie, he carries completely different weight. It is a unique achievement. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his diary cut you like a knife. You feel a sharp intelligence behind his words. The tone is everything. He carries it through action and excitement, as well as the ugly chunks of gallows. I also like the other two actors. The blonde girl is absolutely beautiful and the man is hysterical in his twisted fierce first-classism. Some of the thugs seemed a bit sketchy but this is a mini-point really. The movie is absolutely solid, and Franco is very cool all the way around.
