Of all episodes in all series, this holds the closest to Roddenb's original set. According to the book MAKING OF STAR TREK, in Roddenberry's author's guide to his story writers, he states that any alien creature, no matter how scary it is, impossible to believe, benign or malevolent, MUST keep some kind of humanity that television view the public can empathize with and / or relate to. The devil in the dark HORTA, who does not resemble anything more or less than a large lump of cow's soul, is a mother who protects her babies, the spherical silicon nodes that the miners continue to find throughout the mine passages and destroy because they have no idea what they are! This is one of my absolute favorite sections if only for it!
