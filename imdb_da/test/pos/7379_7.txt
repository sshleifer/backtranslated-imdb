This was an interesting study of social sexuality and human "dark interests". <br /> <br /> While I can't say the wife was a strong character - she was the wrong choice for that part, in my opinion - she was a nice kid in search of escaping her quince life. She was a rebel indeed and never fully matured for her husband, a lawyer (Rickman). It is obvious that he married her for his money and covers his sexual desires, which is taboo. Rickman played his role in a tee, his flirtations with the young man and very subtle undertones of gayness. The young man was gay to the hilt! When he did Marilyn imitation, that should have told the wife everything. He was also perfectly thrown. He has hustles written over him. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the end when I knew what was coming. Overall, the actor from Rickman was great, Reedus was good, Walker was okay but I had concerns. For a gay theme film, it was average, but not at least blatant. It's worth seeing if you don't have "really Madly Deeply" lying around for a spin.
