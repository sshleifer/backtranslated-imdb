The film opens in an exciting British men's club full of gentlemen in leather chairs, backpacks. This is Denistoun's world. A messenger delivers a small box to him, which he opens to find a pair of gold earrings. The earring rejects a reminiscence of the time he spent in company with gypsies. The rest of the movie is flashback. <br /> <br /> Golden Earrings has been a favorite for me and is probably the most romantic movie I know. Dietrich is playing against his usual type. Here she is dark-haired, earthy and not at least mysterious. Instead of a femme fatale, she puts a strong and energetic effort to use all her resources to help Denistoun survive and reach her goal. To make sure he is a really convincing gypsy, she pierces the ears and has him wearing his dead love gold rings. With her clothes and some fat, she transforms him from a true British gentleman into a wild and sexy-looking man. <br /> <br /> As I grew up, I used to hear the song "Golden Earrings" sung in the movie. I think the song is a bit of Dietrich. / There is a story that the gypsies know is true / That when your love carries golden earrings / She belongs to you.
