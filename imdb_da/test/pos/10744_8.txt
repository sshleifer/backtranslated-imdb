Hi! Being able to speak Cantonese I found it very fun and could all the jokes you couldn't get because of language barriers. The fighting scenes are spectacular and it's a good movie. However, I have my criticism. First of all, I find that it is not as good as the first project A -GO and look it now! :-) The reason is that SPOILERS ARE NOT READING IF YOU DON'T HAVE SEET FILM !!!!!) because in project A Jackie stops by fighting his enemy; The man he's sent to kill, Sanpao. That's what he's been doing to make the whole movie, and the showdown is spectacular. But in A II, he is fighting Chan, the showdown scene between Jackie and his nemesis is not long enough, and most of the action is against Empress men. They are almost not so "bad" enough and have only played a minor role in the film compared to Jackie, so even though their fighting sequence is spectacular, they are not the ones Jackie chases through the whole movie, and thus he leaves the viewer a little unfulfilled. But it's just my humble opinion, so don't take it word for word-go and see it for yourself! It's a great movie in itself! Beware and hope your admiration for Jackie grows! Sincerely, Ian PS. Do you know the police chief of A II? He's the same guy in First Strike-nice to know he's still strong!
