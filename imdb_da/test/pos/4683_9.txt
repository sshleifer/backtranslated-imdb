I enjoyed the movie a lot. Everything in the Italian job is simple. An explosive guy, a secure cracker, a computer genius, a wheelbarrow and a man of spectacular plan to steal 35 million without using a gun. This movie is entertaining, though it has no central idea. It's a non-stop movie with lots of actions. All the stunt work is beautiful. From the speedboat hunt in Venice at the beginning to the hunt for the busy roads in Los Angeles with three mini coopers and even a helicopter. The best boast hunt has ever seen. I like mini coopers. The expert thieves used mini coopers for the escape cars. The chase between the mini coopers and the motorcycles is fantastic. They hunted underground. I can say that there wasn't a moment I was bored. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (Left Ear) and Edwin Norton's job. I like the actors in this movie. I've seen a lot of heist movies but The Italian Job & is one of my favorites. A great Hollywood action movie without a blood drop. After all, I love this kind of movie.
