I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date, this year it is one of my favorites. The story was excellent, although the twisted end was far too predictable and I knew what would happen too soon. Usually when that happens, the movie is spoiled for me (like "The Other"), but even knowing the result, I've still had it all the way to the end. Looking through the comments of others, many were impressed by the performance by Kelly Overton (Eve), I'm afraid I wasn't. Her performance seemed to be the weak part of the movie to me as opposed to the amazing performance (or characterization) of James Haven (Don Wake) ... I hope we see more of him. What a great little movie, highly recommended to everyone!
