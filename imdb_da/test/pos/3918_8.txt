This is one of the best horror / thrill movies that Hollywood has made this year or maybe even decades. Although this movie was, in my opinion, predictable in parts, it has everything a good movie in this genre should have, CHILL, THRILLS and AND YES VERY GORE !! HOUSE OF WAX SURE SUPPLIERS !!! In parts it was kind of removed, the play was not that big, but my review quality for the HOUSE OF WAX is an eight out of ten ...... if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats, this is just the right one movie for you, I must admit, it was kind of nice to see the whole city made of wax ...... I myself enjoy these museums, but after watching this movie I will now look at them in a whole new way !
