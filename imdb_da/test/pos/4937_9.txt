Over the years, some of the most entertaining films have been about dysfunctional families. Bonjour, Monsieur Sholmi is such a movie <br /> <br /> This is an Isreali movie about a Moroccan Jewish family. <br /> <br /> This could be about any family, in any culture. We all know or want to know people like them in this cartoon. <br /> <br /> This joy in 2003 was written and directed by Shemi Zorkin. Let's hope he's a long career. The film is seen through the eyes of the 16-year-old son who seems to be concerned about everyone in the family. Hello brilliant played by Oshri Cohen (he was 18 when he made the movie. <br /> <br /> He has been in a couple of years and I know I will chase them. Hopefully this young man will be an international star. < br /> <br /> The whole cast is magnificent, I hope I see them again. <br /> <br /> I loved everybody in the cast to some extent, I think everyone who sees this , agree. <br /> <br /> It has been nominated for many international awards and has won 8, it deserved every one. <br /> <br /> Now a movie in a language other than English it had a very limited race in the US that I feel is regrettable. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, you'll be glad you did. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (off of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> NOTE: Since history is not new, it is as high a rating it can get.
