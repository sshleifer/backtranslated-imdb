The above overview is really not meant as a slam against this movie, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar ("The Saint") meets a lady in need and comes to her. He also comes to the aid of a policeman who was framed by accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as "Pearly" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not very convincing mystery (neither of them really is), Templar is extremely honest and simply cool! George Sanders is again the sophisticated sophisticated British do-gooder and he once again succeeds in making an outstanding B-detective series film. Nothing special but a well known and breezy product that is sure to please fans of the genre.
