I think anyone who enjoys Eisentein's Ivan the Terrible movies would enjoy this well-developed movie. This movie appeared as "Lord of the Rings: The Right of the King", but without the special effect, but as a good and better drama. <br /> <br /> We have captured the Germans who dressed as KKK, Novgorod for Russia. The Russian called Nevsky to lead them to fight the Germans to save Russia. Nikolai Cherkasov, who played Ivan in Ivan The Terrible Films, was charismatic as Nevsky. The first 10 minutes how he handled the Mongol transient was captivating. <br /> <br /> Many of the scenes were beautiful even in black and white. The prediction of the war did not require any dialogue such as "how many enemies we will kill", etc. Apart from a few speeches, the film can basically be played as a silent movie. The battle situation can end up with those of the civil war's struggle situation for a nation's birth. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the movie is the great musical score, by Sergei Prokofiev. The music gave an epic feel to the movie in these scenes without dialogue.
