There are 3 of these films, all equally designed and each extremely entertaining. Red plays radio sleuth Wally Benton, aka The Fox, who is shocked to solve real-life crimes along with his fiance's game of your typical wartime girl next door looker, Ann Rutherford. Many of the one-liners and gags are stupid and probably were in the 1940s as I expected. But just as many people made me laugh loudly, which was unexpected to say the least. Red Skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence, surprisingly I say because I grew up with a much older version of the man whose charm really didn't play well in my formidable years. I have to give these movies forward, even if you are in the mood for this type of nostalgic fare. I almost threw in the light heart, but in truth people are wasted and turned up and dare I say it, the excitement is sometimes well above average. As with most movies from this era, it gets a PI (politically incorrect) rating for reasons you can imagine. Wartime is fun in the way I guess and then again these movies. See one, see them all.
