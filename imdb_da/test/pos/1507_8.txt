At the end of the eighties and early 1990s, the decline and death of independent video companies as Vestron and Media effectively closed Italian horror movies to much of the American audience. Randomly (?) Italian genre films also fell in quality and profitability. <br /> <br /> Occasional movies like Primal Rage, "sequels" such as Beyond The Door III, Troll 2, and a pair of Dario Argento movies limped out on video but most remained unreleased (until DVD) in the US in almost a decade or more. Movies from these lost years were highly sought after and talked about among horror fans. <br /> <br /> Of these movies, Cat In The Brain is probably one of the most hyped of all because of the legions of Lucio Fulci fans and the fact that it was not only directed but also starred idol Fulci himself. Although not quite Fulci, it is still better than most of his later efforts. His quick fan base will probably love it. Italian horror and giallo aficionados can also enjoy it, depending on their taste, but I'm not sure anyone else. People who only look at Hollywood stuff might not take the many glowing reviews here. One thing I personally found fascinating was scenes that probably gave Benito Mussolini's only lasting contribution to Italy, Cinecitta Studios. The name is instantly recognizable to any fan of Italian movies. Until I saw this, I could only imagine what it looked like.
