everyone is a genius in something. Albert Einstien was a genius in science, William Shakespeare was a genius in literature and the boys of the Chasers war on everything are truly comedy genius. Their satire TV show is a constant hit on the Australian broadcast commission (ABC). After a little start as a satire newspaper, chaser's popularity shoots when they get their own TV show. Never short on controversy with the cast members will do everything some of it even gets arrested for. Chris Taylor goes to Sunrise, a very popular live morning television show and tells her partner to f *** k off, create a fake motorcade and enter the APEC high security area and make a very fun satire of an Australian ad nicotine ad To follow smokers around shouts "NO GARY NO NO GARY NO". While controversial, the show is growing fun and worth the run in the coming years.
