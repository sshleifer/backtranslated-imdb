I watched this movie when I was a kid and have been looking for it ever since. It is set up with the Cabin in The Sky, Stormy Weather and Carmen Jones as a must see in movies that featured the amazing talent of African Americans. The 60s local Los Angeles TV stations wanted a movie a week and some stations would show the same movie for 5 days. Porgy and Bess were one of them, and my whole family would be there all 5 nights in front of the TV and just moved on commercials. video store. It would be a shame to let this collection of some of the best talent America had to offer be forgotten or locked in a vault. Make the movie available to the public.
