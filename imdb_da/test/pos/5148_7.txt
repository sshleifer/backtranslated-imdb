I saw this at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2008. There are some amazing descriptions of this movie from other commentators here and they seemed to have really enjoyed it so I don't want to go too far into giving a movie synopsis, but you could see a bit of Woody Allen and maybe a little of Federico Fellini in this movie's collection of about 50 short sketches or vignettes stroked with no real outstanding plot. A couple of the vignettes are related to each other in their character and plot lines however and a one corner bar is often used as a central stage where they always give last calls. The beginning and end scenes also have a common theme that bookends the movie. It took three years to film this, and much of the time must have been used to find the cleanest and most cozy people in the whole of Sweden to make the cast. This is Sweden's official submission to Best Foreign Language Film for the 2007 Academy Awards. It's a nice movie, but hardly worth the official submission to best foreign films. Last year, Sweden's official speech was the very weak farewell Falkenberg, and the year before it was expensive, but boring ZoZo, so once again Sweden has no chance of recording Oscar. This movie has its moments and would have made a good 20-25 minute short film, but it gets a bit old and cold for a full length feature film. Roy Andersson leads. Gustav Danielsson is a film photographer. Editor Anna MÃ¤rta Waern deserves a lot of credit for the work she must have put into this. Benny Andersson of ABBA fame gives an entertaining music score. It's an interesting movie with very dry humor and I liked it, but it's nothing special and could only give it a 7.0 out of 10.
