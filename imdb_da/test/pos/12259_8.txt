Spunky journalist Holly Hunter produces investigative news reports for a large news network. She is a mouthpiece in her mouth, dazzlingly good for her job and with a little time for romantic relationships. Enter William Hurt and Albert Brooks, two men who dedicate to her love. <br /> <br /> Brooks is an old school journalist who loves Holly because she represents everything good about journalism. They both believe that the media exist to test the gods, educate the public, and fight for the truth. Children in the sixties, they represent hippie values. They are defenders of the public good. Knights fighting safely with pen and camera. <br /> <br /> However, William Hurt is a far more complex sign. Initially, he initially reveals clumsy, clumsy, and self-defeating that he is a sexy and manipulative high-performance, skilled at climbing the corporate ladder. Unlike Holly and Brooks, he is symbolic of modern media values: news such as acting, journalism as entertainment, news anchor as celebrity, truth as editorial board. We will despise him and his blip-time junk food journalism, but we just can't do it. He plays the game by his own rules. Do we condemn him for a lack of moral backbone? Do we condemn the game? Can the game exist if its rules are disobedient? How have these rules evolved? <br /> <br /> This is not the Lumets and Chayefsky's Network, and the movie never has trouble answering or raising those issues. Content to keep things at the level of light comedy, it ends with Hurt being promoted to the London Division and Brooks being started to a small community network. Holly, who has rejected both men, remains trapped between them. The last bastion of media integrity, this spunky reporter remembers its roots, causes the loss of Brooks and warns them to be wary of future William Hurts. It's a cute ending, but compared to the "Network" movie seems to be positively tired. Chayefsky's vision is one in which global media, despite its ubiquity, provide less meaningful information. He predicts a world where globalization has homogenized cultures, information has become the subject of corporatisation, and a handful of media monopoly controls all international news. This is a world where truth is subject to shareholder meetings and financial interests. A world where viewer certificates determine content and opinion polls dictate top stories. <br /> <br /> Therefore, "Broadcast News", which longs for journalism's glory days, ends with such a bittersweet note. It knows what the future holds. Made in 1987, it has lived for at least a decade. <br /> <br /> But today it is even worse in digital age. Mergers and acquisitions have left a very small number of massive companies dominating the communications landscape. With this, hyper-commercialism of content has come, the barrier between the creative / editorial side and the commercial side all but coincided. Today everyone can start their own blog or website, but it is grassroots affairs. As the individual's communication reach increases (due to technological advances - email, internet, electricity, airmail, etc.), the size of the individual's world also grows. He must project his voice both longer and higher, in vain fighting the deaf white noise, the incessant verbal static global society. So in the end you need two things according to democratic theory. First, you need a tight command of powerful people and people who want to be in power, both in the private and public sectors. Secondly, you need a wide range of informed opinions on all important issues during the day. In a democratic society, the media system as a whole should produce this kind of culture. Unfortunately, the structure we currently have in the global system has a direct need for democratic journalism and the needs of a democratic society. <br /> <br /> 8/10 ?? These are easy things, but a witty script, some fun moments and a short como by Jack Nicholson, lift it over most other films about journalism. Interestingly, unlike most movies about the media, it never falls into satire and instead plays things like a straight love triangle. <br /> <br /> Worth having a view.
