I really enjoy this particular production of "The Mikado." The producers added a few details all the time to make it more entertaining for modern audiences - for example, "As one day it can happen" ("the purple list" song) is completely up to date, and a few lines ad libbed throughout the game. Freedom was also taken with the setting. The costumes are not Japanese, but rather the 1920s English (although some of the "Tittipudlian" girls wear '20s inspired kimonos). This production is well choreographed with some 1920's dance styles, and there are some extra dance friends and bellhops to keep your eyes (as well as ears) entertained during the songs. If you are a Gilbert & Sullivan purist, these changes can disturb you, but I think they are fine - and I love the costumes! <br /> <br /> Felicity Palmer (Katisha) is absolutely fun; all her scenes make me laugh aloud (one of my favorite additions is when she first makes an entry - the dancing bellhops annoy her with their antics so she screams at the top of her voice "STOP IT !!!") . All the other main characters also do a fine job. I especially like Mark Richardson as the Pish-Tush (the toupee!) And Lesley Garrett as Yum-Yum. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that this is a stage production that is filmed and puts your expectations accordingly. There is no change in the setting, although the filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest. If there is a buyback for this production, the scene makeup was not changed to close-ups with a camera. Foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be an excess of eyeliner, lipstick and blush everywhere. I've seen the kind of things that happened before with movies of acting and it's a bit broken at first. But I hope you will get used to it and enjoy "The Mikado" for what it is worth - a thoroughly enjoyable reproduction of a classic!
