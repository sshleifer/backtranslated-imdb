I was fortunate enough to record this wonderful drama, both as it was originally broadcast at the Masterpiece Theater. I loved it but lost it. Then one day, while walking through old bands, found it again. I recorded it on DVD and then and --- WOW! I still love it! The wires are excellent and my only complaint is that I wish we had seen more Kester! What a man! And Prue. She is so strong and wonderful ... living in a time and age where her suffering and how she handles it are seen as unfortunate and evil. Even her own brother tells Prue on her face that he doubts that a man ever wants her. * sigh * Unfortunately, my copy is not the biggest, with wear and tear over the years, and I would also love to own this on professional DVD if ever it happens.
