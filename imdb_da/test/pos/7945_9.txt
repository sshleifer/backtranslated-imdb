I watched this movie back in the early 70's and I was fascinated by Judy Geeson. For me, it caught the secret character of Rod Steiger's irrepressible obsession with the young and extremely sexy hitch hiker played by Geeson. <br /> <br /> You couldn't help feeling a little upset by the wife who played brilliantly by Claire Bloom. I was really disappointed to see that the original cut could have been lost and there is a small chance of being released on DVD. <br /> <br /> I defy anyone who watched the movie, and it's a strong message not to be just absorbed by the three main personal achievements, and I would have loved to have seen it again if nothing else nostalgic ground. <br /> <br /> Going back in time, about 35 years. <br /> A real classic.
