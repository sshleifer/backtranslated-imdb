Mute Witness is a modest yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves. The movie ?? written and directed exclusively by Anthony Waller ?? is an exciting, action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences. No pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twists ?? just to the point of mystery. Mute Witness is about the bad topic of `snuff 'film and is effectively set in Russia. *** SPOILERS *** As the production costs are cheaper there, an American movie crew member temporarily moves to Russia to shoot a horror movie. An old hangar is used as a film placement. The team's female makeup artist accidentally gets locked up overnight, and when she tries to find a way out, she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snus movie! She is trapped and trying to escape, but since she is a mute, she cannot cry for help, nor can she explain what she saw the police correctly. The girl's life is in real danger now, as there is a completely hidden network behind these snus productions and they do not want the witnesses to live ?? *** End Spoilers ***. Mute Witness features several very exciting action sequences and is pretty bloody. Some of the mystery tracks are actually kept secret until the end. As for the same subject, I would say that it is certainly better than the more famous "8 mm" directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Nicolas Cage. The action in Mute Witness is not amazing, but the leading actress (who is Russian himself) looks really cute. Sir Alec Guinness also makes a special look. And a very cool one, I have to say. Certainly recommended with guaranteed fun and scary.
