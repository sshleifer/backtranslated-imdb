Do exactly what you expect and see some. The first movie was a step up from the television show with sick stunts that aired uncensored and a gnarly factor that had risen. Surprisingly, Jackass's number two is even more twisted. The stunters have become more dangerous and spectacular, with some insane painful antics sprinkled with good fun sketches to keep the smile that turns into a curl of disgust. Knoxville always dominates the dominance, but this time he has a central stage when volunteering for the most dangerous and idiotic of all the stumbling blocks, with Bam Magera also appearing wild as always, despite his image was toned down in 'Viva La Bam'. Surprisingly, the infamous Wild Boys (Steve O and Chris Pontius) seem to participate in fewer of the sketches, despite the fact that they focus on the earlier excursions. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass or Dirty Sanchez then you will definitely enjoy this movie and will laugh your gut out for 100 minutes of its duration if you see it as childish, disgusting or a boring snapshot of youth culture today, you will find it as offencive as ever. So f ** k off.
