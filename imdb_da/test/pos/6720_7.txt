Like many other reviewers here, I am surprised to see many negative reviews on this movie. Dan O'Bannon's previous action was the groundbreaking 'Alien' from 1979. Because it and 'Star Wars' introduced the stylistic approach to 'Used' or 'Dirty Space' in artistic direction for these kinds of functions, it does not mean that this was the one only way to produce them. <br /> <br /> Instead of rejecting "Lifeforce" out of hand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploit, it's important to recognize that the movie draws on the "valued" traditions of British horror and science fiction - especially Hammer and American International features such as Quatermass (specifically 'Quatermass and the Pit', 1967), Doctor Who and 'Triple Day' (1963), if not Gerry Anderson ('UFO', 'Space: 1999' and 'Thunderbirds'). But none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized author O'Bannon's genre-scientific appreciation for the 'Queen of Blood' (1966) and 'It! Terror from Beyond Space '(1958) - the immediate sources of' Alien '(1979). <br /> <br /> Granted this movie has some 'heritage' elements, but perhaps it is worth comparing this movie with its more immediate peer - 1981 'An American Werewolf in London' and 'The Wolves Company' (1984) - Other 80 movies that share a "look-back" while adapting these stories to 80-inch zealots. All three films featured previous incarnations of the same, but substantially sexy, themes (because they could), while recognizing the heavy-in-cheeks, humorous aspects of their projects. <br /> <Neil Jordanas 'Wolves' played to many of the psychoanalytic memes that floated around during the 80s, while 'American Werewolf' curdled its theme as a 'coming-of-age' movie. It's called artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the last-day drama devotion associated with the 'Scream' franchise, 'I know what you did last summer' and 'final destination'. But these teen-targeted movies seem to be part of a box-office trend, while the 80 films like Lifeforce belong to a British sci-fi gun - though written by an American. <br /> In many ways, this movie is much better than the last disasters and alien invasion clicks ('Independence Day', 'Armageddon', 'Deep Impact'), as "solutions" are not in gunfire, weaponized payload and testosterone. At the opposite end of the bar, it is unfortunate that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron did not investigate Tarkowski and Lem until they traveled 'Solaris' ... The goal of this movie was fun, not ponderousness or stupidity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
