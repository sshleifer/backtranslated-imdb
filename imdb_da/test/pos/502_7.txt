Interesting twist on the Vampire yarn - fast, loud and moody. Despite my first fear, Kris K carries its share fairly well, and Snipes aka Blade provides a formidable physical presence. Lots of blood, steel, silver, burning and exploding bodies give a pleasant :) 110 minute distraction. If you like the black look of The Matrix so that Blade will appeal to you, Blade even has a 'dodge the bullets' sequence.
