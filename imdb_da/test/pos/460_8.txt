Seen in Hungary in November 1956, this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who tried to leave the country at the time of the uprising. When the airport is closed, the first journey begins on a bus taking them to Austria. As it will be clear, they are stopped on their way as they come up against the almost flawless Yul Brynner whose military power, as Red Army Major was marked by loneliness, his inner struggle between right and wrong, his quest for truth and his needs to feel feelings for other people. He was saddened by the fact that his job had alienated him from his friends and enemies alike, and he longed for social contact. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley plays the immensely rigid upper lipped Englishman, no matter how serious that role manages to maintain a near-light logical outlook on life, while Jason Robards has an amazing movie debut that enforces the cause of that he had so many roles throughout his career. Deborah Kerr, as the leading lady, shows the grace and femininity we have come to connect with her, yet manages to bring the strength and solution required for her character. <br /> <br /> The movie deals with a very violent time in European history, but it never ceases to remind us that there is good in all of us and you can never completely judge a book by the cover. Fabulous scriptwriting ensures that for the whole series' seriousness, there may still be large one-liners and comedic cases that add to, rather than detract from, the movie. The chemistry of the cat and the mouse game between Kerr and Brynner enables you to understand why they appeared in more than one movie together. <br /> <br /> All in all, a thoroughly exciting movie that I would definitely see again. 8.10
