From the first to the last scene, this film is portrayed very realistically, even too realistically, that sometimes we cannot see details in night scenes (it's dark as real night), in the desert (sunshine is as strong as in real desert). <br /> <br /> Script and actress games are also very realistic. Shots and episodes are edited to not "show" things and events "effectively" to "explain" them or, as many Hollywood movies do, to "entertain" viewers. Editing here is to represent the events as if they really happened in Afghanistan. The camera is sometimes far from dying soldiers, even at the moment the protagonist Major Bandura is shot and killed. Such a method reminds me of masterpieces of Italian neo-realism. And the construction of the story here is based on the same principles as "Pais√†" or "The Bicycle Thief" - the chronological series of "true to life" episodes and a few pathetic moments which initially seem to be sudden and illogical, but has inner reasons. I believe that the inner cause of Major Bandura's suicide is religious feeling - Repentance for the death of innocent people (not just his accidental killing of family in the village, but also the death of soldiers under his command). He is not depicted as an avid believer; on the contrary, he is depicted as tactful and responsible officer. For this reason, his final decisions (going back to the ruined village and turning his back on an armed boy whose family he killed) are acting as repentance. <br /> <br /> The end of the Russian Orthodox choir ("Evening Sacrifice") is another context in which the whole movie can be seen from this point of view.
