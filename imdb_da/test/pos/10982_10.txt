At a time when Hollywood thinks that higher, faster, and bloody is better, Manna From Heaven is comedian and touching to look at something we've all thought of: What would I do if a lot of money fell from heaven. <Br /> <br /> Interestingly, the signs took many years to realize that money had not made a single difference in their lives. They all become what they were destined to be. Unfortunately, in most cases, they were unhappy, despite their happiness for all those years ago. While Manna offers the well-known Hollywood story Good vs. Evil, or in the case of Generosity vs. Greed, what sets this movie apart is that God wins out by transforming Evil, not by crushing it. <br /> <br /> I think the important message in this movie is that you can change the world ... even if you do it one person at a time.
