This movie has it all. Great actors, good dialogue, drama, comedy and excellent writing and instruction by Paul Thomas Anderson. I've watched this movie several times and enjoy it every time. It doesn't get old, it's consistently entertaining and stimulating. Burt Reynolds is easy to play and he does a good job. John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle also provide excellent comedic performances. There is not a faint element in this movie.
