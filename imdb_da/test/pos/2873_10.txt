This Horror movie is definitely one of the best I've seen in my life and there are many reasons. The story is really good, it has lots of action and great horror sequences in it. The actors aren't that good, but it's not that bad, but Kane is definitely the best actor in this, but he was always a good actor as well. The actor is very good. as Kane as Jacob Goodnight, Christina Vidal as Christine, Michael j. Pagan as Tye, Samantha Noble as Kira etc. Also I just have to warn you that the killing scenes are very disturbing, but you are very creative, but it just does better and you can't have a horror movie without blood and do . They also look very realistic. So I'm sure you won't be disappointed with seeing something bad because it's a really good movie. So make sure you rent or cows do not see anything bad because it is just so big. <br /> <br /> Total Score: ********** out of ********* * <br /> ***** out of ** ***
