I don't catch Gilmore Girls when it first came out and still makes some catch up in the first season. I read through most of the user's comments and for the negative ones, should I ask, which show are you watching? <br /> <br /> This show is a classic, beautiful line, character and good acting. And best of all, NOT your standard formula always shows up with an occasional twist to the story. There are probably more women who see themselves reflected in the Lorelai / Emily relationship, then in the Lorelai / Rory relationship. People and stories are not PCs, but they are real! <br /> <br /> If you find the dialogue annoying, I suggest you bend the show so you can reinstall the parts don't understand.
