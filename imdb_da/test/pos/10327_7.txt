This movie was burned by the boys at MST3K, but it is actually a nice and uncomfortable piece of low budget film noir. The plot is tight, the characters are trustworthy (within the good boy-get-occupied-with-bad-girl genre), the pacing is solid, the climax is well-handled, and the cast is enhanced by several fine character actors. True most of the time, you will hit the protagonist with a brick, but he is actually quite efficiently scary when playing mastermind. The scenes between him and his father are quite powerful, in a minimalist way. Sure, it's depressing, but that's the point. Good movie.
