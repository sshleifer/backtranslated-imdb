Each frame of the movie is a lesson to new directors or existing directors to know how to take a movie. Hats off to Sekhar. He is undervalued in the Indian film industry. The director has all the qualities of taking this movie in the reach of Satyajir ray, Adoor. Each character is portrayed effectively in the movie. Although it's simple history, it's taken so much that it can be considered one of the best in India. I don't have enough adjectives to praise the movie. Like the way life goes in day-to-day atmosphere, the movie is taken. Although the songs in Indian movies are considered a weak area, songs in this movie have given extra energy to the film's potential. Especially background score .. it's great
