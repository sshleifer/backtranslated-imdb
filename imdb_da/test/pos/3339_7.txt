I want to start my review by thanking the decision makers in this documentary. It is, of course, a love work, and I think they did a good job of putting together a fun documentary about someone who had so little information available about him. It certainly has a fan-worship that's a good thing. <br /> <br /> I had heard of Bruce Haack, but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talking about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept too far away. I would see this Bruce Haack guy !! I felt as if the creators assumed that I already knew him as well as those musicians on the screen that I did not, so I felt a little back in the dark. <br /> <br /> Finally, as Bruce was shown in action it was amazing and gave me a taste of who Bruce Haack was, but it was just a taste. We were treated to several musicians, and I felt like I was told "See - all those cool musicians are in him, so he must be cool!" I was very worried about the musician's comment on Bruce. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see Bruce as a person. They know the important things - several interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. More about his life, and yes, his use of drugs and other problems. I wanted to know so much more about his "Hackula" project. I wanted to get into his mind. Although they did this via some "voice of good" comments and pictures, it would be ok. <br /> <br /> The animations were good, but again I felt they were used as fillers, they didn't do anything but allow me to hear his music and see some pictures based on Dimension 5 records. I thought it was wise and creative, but again ... I wanted to learn more about Bruce! <br /> <br /> Possibly - in the end, I enjoyed this documentary and felt a kind of grief that such amazing pioneers and geniuses as Mr. Haack is forgotten as a march of stamps back and forth. I'm glad this movie is educating people about Bruce Haack, even with his mistakes.
