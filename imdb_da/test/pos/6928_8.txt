At first I thought this movie would annoy me. It was as if I had seen this movie somewhere before. The disillusioned heroes, father figure and the 9-year-old sister who are older and wiser than his years (see Gregory's girl), but then no more than 15 minutes became a laugh with a cartoon of a movie. Dylan Moran (who I thought was just bugging me) was excellent. As was Mr Gambon and the true Scottish hitman. Lena Headey was extremely sexy. For half of the movie I tried to remember where I had seen her before. Parole officer. She has the most amazing smile. But clearly the gentleman in this movie is Mr. Caine. This man had to do a lot more comedy. This goes hand in hand with some of his best comedy roles (Without a Clue, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels). He is a pleasure to see in all his scenes, but especially in the end. <br /> <br /> No one can tell how I can Michael. <br /> <br />
