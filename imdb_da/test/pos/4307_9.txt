Do you like "Dead Man Don't Wear Plaid"? What about "Top Secret" and "A Chorus Line"? Well Müllers Büro is a wonderful melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. Very fun "heavy in cheek" Movie Noir homage with amazing songs and great dancing. You must have a little strange humor for this movie, but it is very worth seeing. I've voted it a nine. If the end were a little more logical, it would have been ten. That's how good that movie is.
