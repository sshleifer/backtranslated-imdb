Chaplin stars in a dual role as a Jewish barber who with amnesia fails the dictator Adenoid Hynkel (ie, Hitler) A movie made in 1940 when the war was in its dark days and by no means was won by allies. . It was banned in Germany by Hitler and was a risk in some way for Chaplin because if the war had been lost, he would probably have been sent away to be "re-developed" <br /> <br /> A fun satire with it classic scene by Hitler throws around a huge balloon in the world .. good fun but with a message .. a little sermon in the end. This was the last movie with Chaplin's small mustache brand. on a scale of one to ten .. 9
