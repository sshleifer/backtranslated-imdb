Red Skelton plays a radio detective known as "The Fox" in "Whistling in the Dark" and also starts with Ann Rutherford, Conrad Veidt, Eve Arden, Virgina Gray and Rags Ragland. Wally Benton, aka "The Fox" finds his plans to marry his fiance Carol (Rutherford) disturbed when he was kidnapped by a leader of a sham cult (Veidt). Joseph Jones (Veidt) has just learned that his cult, The Silver Haven, does not receive a promised heritage because of the existence of the old woman's nephew, who is to be of interest. He wants Wally to design a perfect murder plot so that the man can be killed on the plane on his way to meeting his lawyer. For backup and because he is not sure which is Wally's fianc√©, kid-cutter Jones Carol and also the radio sponsor's daughter (Gray). <br /> <br /> For me, this is yet another superior movie for the second entry in this series, "Whistling in Dixie." The reason is better, the cast is better, there are less slapstick and fewer corny jokes. Skelton, when he does not make faces and rolls his eyes, is very gracious, and Rutherford is very good. Veidt has always played these evil men to perfection. Eve Arden is Wally's agent who arranges a date for him and Gray to ensure that his contract is renewed. I had only seen Gray in movies from the 1950s onwards. She was always a beautiful woman, but who knew she was such a knockout in her 30s and 40s? This is a fun movie with a nice throw.
