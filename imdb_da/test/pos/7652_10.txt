My girls 4 and 6 love this show. We stumble across it on a PBS station and they always ask when it is on. It reminds them of their grandmother, who takes care of them every day during the summer. It's also fun, and sometimes they can't stop talking about a scene or another. I would definitely recommend this show to all young children. It is very clean and shows you to slow down and it's not about watching TV all day long. When Nana reads a story, it's slow and she talks about each side with Mona. It reminds me to slow down when I read the next book for my girls at bedtime and talk about the book instead of going through it quickly just to make them sleep.
