Bluff I really think this movie is very good. <br /> <br /> Basically, another kind of Colombian movie. Is hilarious and the actors use local expressions that are so much fond to listen. It shows another face o Bogot√°, and I think it is very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we have to show it to the world This is the first film by director Felipe Martinez and I am really except this movie that is the beginning of a great career as a film director. We must continue to support the Colombian film industry because this movie and other great films are the beginning of something big.
