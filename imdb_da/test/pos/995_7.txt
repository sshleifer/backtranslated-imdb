Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller stars in the story of two of the women in the life of Dylan Thomas. Knightley is Thomas's boyhood sweetheart he meets again during Blitz. Meetings in a bar connect them again, but things get complicated when Thomas' brings his wife (Miller) the next time he meets her. The women beat it off and things keep pace until the trio is joined by the man who becomes Knights man. This complicates additional things like jealousy begins to show its face. Beautiful to look at, extraordinarily written and wonderfully acted (everyone disappears completely in their roles) this is a sumptuous feast for the eyes and ears. It's so nice to see a movie about adults being adults. On a purely visceral level, I really enjoyed watching the movie, because the film is so artistically appealing. Rarely have I ever seen a movie that is beautifully crafted. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is, I'm not quite sure what happened. Something seemed to be missing, and a couple of times I had to play the movie to see if I missed something. It is not bad, but it is not entirely satisfactory as a result. (I tried to look up the line to see how much of the movie is true, but I couldn't find anything). I still think it's a movie worth watching. It's a beautiful movie for adults with probably the best that the leaders have done.
