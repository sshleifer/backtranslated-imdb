The first thing I wanted to do after watching this movie was to watch it again (because I had missed a lot with all the grin I did). I am European and I have studied abroad and I have been as good as living with Spanish, French, Italian and German people. The movie was full of stereotypes, which more often than not, people read, and read some of the other reviews I see that made people go away. But this movie gets the stereotypes so right, I can't fault it. Apart from perhaps the way the French guy became a drunk party animal. The English guy was the perfect "geezer" stereotype. Drunk, annoying, insulting but shining through in the end. In addition to the stereotypes, the film also got the emotional aspect of studying abroad correctly. In the beginning he is shy, does not know anyone, misses home, does not know the way around. As time progresses, it becomes his home, and when the time comes to leave, it is extremely difficult. A sense of people can only understand if they have experienced it. I highly recommend this movie.
