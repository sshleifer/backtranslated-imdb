I think this movie was made as good as it could have been. With only 4 months and a budget of $ 52,000 - I'm surprised this wasn't worse. If you don't care about CG or special effects, this movie is amazing. <br /> <br /> Okay, the movie isn't so well made (I'm sure it could have been, but you're trying to do better in just 4 months), but the story is good and the movie is pretty exciting . <br /> <br /> Don't trust me when I say this movie is good because I also find 1933 King Kong to be good. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I'm not looking at the complete movie either ... I might have quickly forwarded a few minutes here and there ...
