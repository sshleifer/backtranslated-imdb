(Spoiler's warning) I can't say enough good things about this movie. It's a great horror comedy / spoof that does everything right for a change. The humor is great and ranges from fun to fun-you will cry fun. In one scene, Ed becomes a editing run and deletes a large scene. When his boss looks at Ed's editing, he shouts: "Where in Fu% # is my beaver-rape scene?!?!" Hysterical. There are also many other amazing, humorous and memorable quotes and moments in all the time: Ed shouts "Don't you look at me !!!" while you punish some poor schmuck repeatedly on the face. Very funny stuff. The film in the film itself is so ridiculous that it is invaluable: Ed is a gentle way, everyday guy who is moved over to the scare editorial, and after a while it goes nuts, sees monsters and attacks people while quoting horror movies that he has edited. This movie has it all and is simply fun. The DVD costs only about $ 7, and it's a bargain as it's the unwarranted widescreen cut. I own many DVDs, most of which cost much more money than this one, but not many are as big as this movie. My evil Ed DVD is one of the highlights of my collection, and I would hit anyone with a phone receiver if they tried to steal it. Evil Ed edit style and quality - something that Hollywood filmmakers need to learn to learn. Evil Ed is a rare gem and I would like to thank everyone involved in making this wonderful movie - you did everything right and I love Evil Ed! 10 out of 10 !!!
