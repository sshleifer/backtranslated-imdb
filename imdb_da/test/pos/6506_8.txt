Being a big fan of hip-hop and turntable at first, I always knew I liked this movie. However, I was not prepared for how well the documentary is actually. It covers almost all the important aspects of the only element of hip hop that has been there right from the start. "History" begins in the early 70s and follows the development of turntable as an art from the beginning of 2000 (turntablism aficionados will point to this as significant). Editing is almost perfect throughout the film. Apart from the excellent visual "scratch" techniques they used, the quick cut between interviews and stock footage is excellent, giving the movie speed when needed. Sound editing is also very good, with some nice sweeping sounds used to help with transitions. <br /> <br /> The absence of a narrator was also welcome. We are not taken over by history, and as a result, the audience is able to make their own assumptions easier. Each DJ adds another page to the story, and it's so interesting to hear about the hip hop's unknown stars, especially those who were there when hip-hop was pushed to the left, right, and centered by the music industry. <Br /> <br /> Although there are many good things about this movie, I have a few grips. The biggest of these is the absence of several notable DJs, such as Ca $ hMoney and Jazzy Jeff, and also DJs from abroad, such as Scratch Perverts and DJ Noise. But if you see the comment on the DVD (something that I strongly recommend), the producer and director go into a depth of how they regret not being able to function. The deleted scenes include many interviews with Ca $ hMoney, Jazzy Jeff and Scratch Perverts. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best documentary I've seen in hip hop culture and music. It stops short of showing the true potential of turntablism; for this I highly recommend checking out DMC and ITF videos. But it is a less ambiguous one. I highly recommend this movie, not least for the phat soundtrack, with excellent music throughout. (9/10)
