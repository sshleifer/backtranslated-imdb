Fuckland is an interesting movie. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it lasted longer. It seems to be already dead. Many critics tried their fate to shut it down. I do not know why. It is the most interesting movement that takes place in the cinematic world since the French new wave. In addition to Fuckland, I have seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne and Mifune. They were all great, the party is a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland is not up to the others. I was just fascinated with the film creation. It is played as if it were a real documentary, with a real person so obsessed with his camera that he refused to put it down. At a few points in the movie, it becomes clear that it is a work of complete fiction, but that illusion was prolonged in a tremendous amount of time. I wish the filmmakers would have come up with something a little more interesting to put on the screen. It is basically about this guy, Fabian, who is an Argentine who visits the Faulkland Islands. The Argentines were only allowed on the islands for the last couple of months, and Fabian plans to impregnate the women with Argentinian children. He puts his eyes on one, and most of the film is spent on his seduction. The two actors are very natural. Camilla Heany only kind of hints that she is an actress. Fabian Stratas seems completely genuine. The policy of the film is somewhat confusing to me as I only have a limitation on the situation around the island and its recent history. I was 3, I think when Faulklands was invaded. The final bit of the movie doesn't work at all. I don't understand what the filmmakers went to. Yet Fuckland is an interesting dogma experiment. However, it violates dogma rules, though not the extra diagic music rule. There is a lot of it. 10.7.
