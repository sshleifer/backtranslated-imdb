The beauty. Terror. Poetry. Horror. That innocence. SHOULDER STRAP. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's all about everything I have to write in this commentary on a two-sister talk. The best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it. I didn't even know anything about the two girls' story when I went into this movie. I just looked at the nice cover art, not even read the synopsis on the back and popped it into the DVD player. I only knew that it won several awards at festivals around the world and that it was highly recommended. The DVD cover read "The Most Scary Film since THE RING, THE GRUDGE and DARK WATER". Although the scary part may be right, you can forget about the rest, for the only thing a TALK OF TWO SISTERS has in common with that movie is ... a ghostly behavior with long black hair. It is even a little unfair to compare it to the famous Japanese films because this Korean movie has much more to offer and is actually a bit more complicated and intelligent than the others. This movie is simply a small masterpiece, and here are some reasons (without telling anything about the plot): The film itself caught me vaguely at least twice with wise surprise actions. And just when you think you've got that conclusion (whether you get it or not, it's irrelevant for the moment) and you think the movie will end ... this movie goes a little further. The kinematics are amazing, using bright colors during the day and dark shades at night. The camera work is excellent with the instructor sometimes choosing impressive, if not innovative, angles. Some shots are pure poetry (eg the top shot with the two sisters at the lake). It all looks very stylish. There are only four main characters, but the plot around them is intense. The story itself starts a bit slowly, but there is a lot of variation in tone and emotion to keep it interesting. There was even a scene (when the girls went to the lake), which suddenly made me remember Peter Jackson's HEAVENLY CREATURES. But when the horror kicks in, it is quite effective. There are also a few successful surprise attacks in it. Damn, I just jumped up from my sofa. The musical score is great, and at times as it shouldn't be scary, I couldn't help but notice that it had some sort of Italian feel to it. A little strange for a Korean movie. But still a good score. So much care went into every detail of this movie, including a perfectly balanced surround sound. I also think the call A talk of two seventh, just a horror movie, does not give enough credit. It is more a mysterious horror drama that works both at a psychological and supernatural level. No matter how you look at it, this Asian scarecrow that goes far up there is among the finest. It may not be gory, but it gets pretty scary at times and the subject is quite disturbed. So if you haven't seen it yet, find a copy, pop it into your DVD player, go with the stream and make sure you give this movie your full attention for it's 110 minutes of playing time. <br /> <br /> I hope I did a good job praising it without destroying anything.
