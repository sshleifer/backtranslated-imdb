Good drama film about a child's custody with good performances by all the actors. A good example of what an excellent script can do to drive a simple story to a much higher quality. The play was just average, and that's what kept the movie from the list of the very best dramas. The great actor makes this movie a good one to see if you are a fan of courts or a big fan of leading actors. The movie should have been a bit longer though for more excellence but it would really be nitpicking ......
