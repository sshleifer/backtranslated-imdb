I like Dylan Moran from his work in Black Books, although I found some of his stand-up to be really indulgent about long confused holes ... but I was fascinated to see this movie with the star he and Michael Caine and curiosity got better from me. <br /> <br /> I was stunned. <br /> <br /> Dylan's vocal range and characterization of the various people he played in the movie was absolutely perfect, something beyond a stand-up comedian and really really on par with alec guinness, John hurt and the others greats - he was really good at his portrayal. Michael Caine was a very convincing prima donna and the British standard film Unity to have an outdated child available to be overly smart and confusingly worked - the only aspect I didn't really like was the unbelieveable plot characteristic of Dolores and Cockney Gangsta's hard man played by Dylan. <br /> Other than that, it was good. <br /> <br /> I also like the non-cop-out ending where it ended happily ever after, but with MC got a hit. Okay, it's not exactly got off your goolies and gets unpublished (which is what a real crime commander would do for you if you nicked Â£ 50k of them), but at least it showed a small measure of reality in history. /> <br /> I liked the movie and I would recommend it to anyone - but - I would also warn them not to turn it off after 15 minutes because it started a little slow. If you stick it out, it'll all come back. <br /> <br /> And with regard to swords-yes, they are in Ireland. It wouldn't be right otherwise.
