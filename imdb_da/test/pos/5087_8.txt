Although the short life "The Amazing Spider-Man" was one of the best for television versions of a famous cartoon hero. Only "Wonder Woman" (Lynda Carter) (the best of the genre and "The Incredible Hulk" (Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno) was better. <br /> <br /> "The Amazing Spider-Man" outclasses 1966- 1968 " Batman "because the highest elements of the latter often destroy the adventure." Spider-Man "outclasses all three television interpretations of" Superman "-" Lois and Clark "," Smallville "and of course George Reeves" Superman "who brings the rear up. <br /> <br /> "The Amazing Spider-Man" was an action drama, in the late 1970s, pre-CGI era, where stunts were to be performed by stunt men, not in the database of "Spider-Man" had his own very talented stuntman to perform the deadly daredevil acrobatics, his name was Fred Waugh, who donned the spidy suit for the action sequences, Nicholas Hammond, better known as one of Julie Andrew's full-time kids "The Sound of Music" was Spider-Man during the dialogue scene. Hammond's Spider-Man also had his own secret t entity like Peter Parker, resembles Christopher Reeve-Superman / Clark Kent, Adam West-Batman / Bruce Wayne and of course Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman / Diana Prince. It is unfortunate that the series only had thirteen episodes. Because when the first episode hit the airwaves in November 1977, the whole country hit CBS on Wednesday night. CBS should in all fairness release this pilot episode as well as "The Deadly Dust", "Captive Tower" etc. In DVD shortly. "Spider-Man" was short-lived, but had a cool sequel, and in my opinion, it was much better than the movie interpretation of the famous cartoon hero who played Toby McGuire. <br /> <br /> CBS may be reluctant to release these episodes for two reasons. (A) There may not be a wide market for them based on the series' lack of life and a generation of children and adolescents who were not born when the series originally broadcast in the 1970s. (B) One of the early episodes of "Spider-Man" treated a terrorist with design at the World Trade Center, which was attacked twice many years after this show left the air in 1993, and of course the devastating attack on that country 9/11/01, where the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost. <br /> <br /> But I don't think it would be bad to release this episode "Spider-Man" even though the show was fairy-tale, derived from a cartoon and nature camp. The living action "Amazing Spider-Man" does not have a big succession, but it has a cult following. If and when CBS releases it on DVD, this cult feeling can be explained along with the episode where Spiderman rescued the towers in 1978, but how in September 2001, real life differed from the movies. I like to follow the news, but I also like Science Fiction / Fantasy. That's why I'm eagerly awaiting the release of "The Amazing Spider-Man on DVD".
