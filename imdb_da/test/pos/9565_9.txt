I saw this movie with an open mind, without knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film was written, directed and acted in such a way that every minute it is a lovely watch. The people do not seem to act, more like they are real people who really train dogs and lead the lives portrayed in this movie. There are some wonderful moments where you laugh or chuckle, some jokes may be dry, but presented in a very visible way. Highly recommended!
