I must also apologize for a slightly biased opinion on this effort as I contributed to the audio track. Still, I received my copy, sat down, and enjoyed the role of characters that might be more colorful than the characters they created in this story of a filmmaker Shanghai. For those who feel George Bush is a "trustworthy Texan", you don't have to look beyond this movie to destroy the picture that Texas is full of trucking, one-dimensional rednecks. The cast contains some of the most intelligent, peculiar and humorous people you find everywhere, jumping their stories of grief, bliss, and disappointment into a great movie feeling, no budget, guerrilla style (ie, "punk rock style "as each person helps define). <br /> <br /> This is a great documentary made with passion and gut and all the poison you will have to break through to the other side of whatever industry bs and doublespeak you have to deal with (note writers, painters, musicians and fellow players). It belongs again to the credibility of the first wave of American hardcore music when the phrase "D.I.Y." was the standard, a period where courage, passion and dedication were more important than technique, style or precious calculations. Not that there is not enough technique or style for this ... the tone of the documentary is quite refreshing. The editing cuts provide as much drama as the dialogue therein. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​making a documentary out of the sad death of cast, crew and director's original intent is brilliant, quite Texas and absolutely punk rock. In the proper sense of the word.
