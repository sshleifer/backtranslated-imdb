I was very impressed with Martha's story and how it drew on the audience's emotional heartbeat, as well as how it should have affected the family. The forward-looking story was well done, and usually I don't enjoy movies with the flash-back / flash-forward effects. Throughout the development of the film, I felt that "surely Tommy did it". It gives you a sense of how these people lived their lives almost completely devoid of each other and the consequences of not wanting to answer the question "It's 10 o'clock. Do you know where your children are?" And also, "What are they doing?" !! Or "am I interested?" !! Rich, spoiled brats literally get away with murder. Or they thought .......
