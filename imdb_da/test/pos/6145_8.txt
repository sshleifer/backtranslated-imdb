I, as many IMDB patrons seem to have, stumble upon this little movie when it appeared on the Canadian "Showcase Network". I was so many of you also sucked in and looked at the whole movie. I was primarily connected with the literary dialogue and wry sense of humor that the film is rich in. I drove along comfortably to some sort of "Kevin Smith meets Killer Film's wave until halfway when the movie really dented and explored the themes in more detail ... with a certain darker and more exciting edge. Far from being taken out of the experience I was brought on. This is not the best movie of that kind and will certainly not have universal appeal ... so I understand some of the more negative reactions to it. But I bought in ... and enjoyed it immensely. The "flash back" type movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well developed, and the issues raised were human, accessible (to my experience anyway) and interesting. I was totally impressed by the film's ability to remain sweet, fun and entertaining, while not looking away from controversial issues and raw emotional languages, dynamics, and situations. This movie is a great antidote to a lot of the schlock that has permeated the witty / clever romantic genre. A kind of man Brigitte Jones for the literary sect. Take 2 hours out of your busy schedule and jump into Wirey's world ... or you can rent "You've Got Mail" because if it appeals to you, you won't like it anyway! Those of us who liked it would be okay without you on our site ...
