Forget Samara / Sadako and Jason ... <br /> <br /> Horror has a new name: GRANNY. The reason is simple but effective. The actors are good (two thumbs up for "Michelle" and the killer) and the dialogues are even quite wise. From the beginning to the end, the action will leave you breathless, you just can't escape it. There is blood, horrible murders, fun moments and a sense of perversion that goes far beyond any rule. "Deja vu"? Certainly not: "Granny" is not another slash movie, it really is a classic of its own ... It deserves the success it had and there is even more success in its re-release. Congratulations!
