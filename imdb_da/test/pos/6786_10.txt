I just wanted to say that I watch National Velvet on TV, it is now Feb 2006 and I checked the dates details etc. Surprisingly seeing it was made in 1944 and Rooney was 24 years old while Liz Taylor only 12, what a successful English actress, she is. <br /> <br /> To put some American contributors right: There are no Irish villages in England. Ireland is a completely different country and has nothing to do with the English landscape. The scenes shown are apparently taken on the southern coast of England between Brighton and Arundel (County of Sussex). Unfortunately, no such scene exists. Like many other places, roads and buildings have been built on the hills and beaches. So please, all your lovely Americans, don't confuse Ireland with England ever! We take great exception to that. Like confusing Texas with Coney Island.
