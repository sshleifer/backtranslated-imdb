This is not "direct cinéma", it is actually the opposite. Second tranche of filmmaker Gatlif's gypsy trilogy, this French work produced by Michèle Ray-Gavras, is a film masterpiece, not pure documentary, no fiction in any way. Instead, Gatlif has chosen different locations of the route from India to Spain, where the people of Rome have a strong presence, and with the help of art directors, he has arranged several songs that tell us how the gypsies live, sing, dance, fight and have survived . The film may have strong opposition from those who question the hypothesis that the Rome tribe is of Indian origin, mostly challenged by those who look directly with the Hebrews (so, in a way, it is not surprising that they too persecuted by the Nazis.) But over any anthropological argument, this is a work of great beauty, strong colors and wonderful song and dance.
