Now I understand that this movie was not meant to be an indictment against all Indians, but it is a great movie because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy some Indians have about their women and sexuality. For some time I have known that sexism is very common in this community (with women being murdered because man's family doesn't want them more after his death or because she had a small dowry and the frequent killing of female fetuses because they are as a curse instead of a blessing). I also realize that some from this culture will be greatly offended by the movie, but the bottom line is that there is some truth to the subject - though the film was so heavily attacked when it debuted in India a decade ago. Due to the extreme misogyny of the film, most Western audiences will be shocked or at least emotionally drawn into the ladies of this movie. <br /> <br /> Although I'm a man, I'm not a refined feminist, and I'm right, the movie had a strong positive impact on me, and it's NOT an agenda movie that can only be enjoyed by lesbians and "mandhatere". In fact, I don't think the film promotes hatred for men or homosexuality, but instead gives a credible argument how in those two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative because of their evil husbands. Yes, I use the word "evil" and mean that, since both men living in this great household are intensely selfish and have no regard for their sexuality's spouse. In many traditional societies this is indeed the case, and women are doomed to an empty emotional existence. <br /> <br /> A man married a vivacious young woman, Sita, outside of the family obligation. This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for both of them, but initially, Sita makes an attempt to connect with her stupid man. But he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about Sita - and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady. To make matters worse, he did nothing to hide the case and made no excuses. In their dead marriage, sex was only meant to produce children, and Sita was unable to meet any of her sexual or emotional needs. And unfortunately he could have cared less. <br /> <br /> Another man was married to a woman who was barren (Radha). Strangely, after initially trying to have children, they have gone for the next 13 years without any sexual contact at all! This is because this man has decided to become an ascetic (ie, in Hinduism, a person who gives up to the pleasures of the world to obtain inner enlightenment). Now he would do well and good if he wasn't already married and had obligations for his wife. But being married, this was an incredibly selfish act, and like his brother, he assumed that his wife had no sexual feelings, nor did he seem to care. The closest he would give her to him sexually was to sleep beside him - when he had her next to him, he helped "overcome the wishes of the flesh". This must have brought only frustration to her. <br /> <br /> So you have two neglected and normal women living in the same household who yearn for emotional connection and an outlet for their sexual needs. Eventually, these needs come along with these son-in-law - first and foremost only emotionally, but also later sexually. The film was brilliant, how it made me look and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy in relation to a life of emotional desolation. Then in the film, when the intensity of their sexual relations is discovered, it leads to a not unexpected reaction from Radha's "enlightened" man - a man seeking religious insight and peace is yet so wrapped up in himself that true insight and growth is impossible. <br /> <br /> This is a very challenging and adult movie. While there is very little nudity, the subject is very adult and it is not a movie showing your children. Very disturbing is actually a smaller person who masturbates in front of an old paralyzed woman - as I said, it is not a movie that lets your children see. But for a mature audience, this is an excellent and very erotic movie that makes you think. <br /> <br /> The movie has great actors, complex characters, excellent writing, great mood music and a slow pace can annoy some but I found rewarding. The only serious negative I can not blame on the film itself, but on the idiots who released this on videotape. This is because even though the film is in English, the accents are quite strong at times and it is not always easy to understand what is being said. BUT, and this is the worst part, there are no closed or open captions - including them being a must for western audiences. If you watch this movie, see if you can find it on DVD, or hopefully a recent video release will get captions - I didn't know for sure. <br /> <br /> By the way, director Deepa Mehta (a popular female director) has made several other great films like EARTH and BOLLYWOOD / Hollywood. A consistent theme in her film is the conflict between traditional Indian culture and expectations and westernism - with a strong emphasis on female characters. It is not surprising that this West-thinking lady makes her home in Canada and is divorced - a truly unusual woman to say the least. For a similar movie exploring traditional culture, facing Western culture, try another Canadian gem, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN.
