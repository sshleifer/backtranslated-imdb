This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, and one of his most underrated. I think it even exceeds a 'Psycho' or 'The Birds' for technical art and brilliance. It is a macabre, tense, dark humorous product that will leave you in awe for some time. <br /> <br /> Robert Walker creates one of Hitchcock's most memorable villains as father hating, morphized (but aren't most of Hitchcock's villains mummy's boys?) Bruno. It's a disturbing, stunning performance that highlights the entire movie. His character is obsessive, apparently homosexual (look at them with deliberately slender ties and hear how he is described as 'European'), strangely charming and dangerous to cross. Farley Granger knows for sure when he is rooted in Bruno's sordid web after the couple meet on a train. Bruno by knowing some of the information about Guy's cases, suggests the two 'swap' murders for each other's benefit. Walker wants to kill Granger's dreary wife, who inhibits her marriage to beautiful Anne, while Granger will murder Bruno's father, whom he so intensely hates. Everyone is happy, right? A win-win that Bruno claims? Wrong. Granger forgets about the obscene proposal, but one obsessed Walker does not. He commits his murder and is determined to hunt Granger until he also completes his side of the purchase. 'Strangers' will be an exciting, exciting game of cat and mouse in Hitch's hands. Hitchcock was great for creating exciting little characters and building scenes. We've heard Miriam, Granger's alien wife pregnant with another man. She loosely strikes a false ice cone while he eats openly Bruno with his eyes. Barbara Morton, Anne's sister, is a deceptively sweet but smart and listed young girl who comes out with the most monstrous remarks you want to hear from a peculiar girl in the 50's pictures. Senator Morton is authoritative and self-absorbed. This is one of the most daring films ever made by Hitchcock, and it is typical of a Hitch movie, subtly sexual in detail. <br /> <br /> This fits into the film-noir category focusing on murder, lies and deception and shady movies. Walker's nut is one for many years, and Granger is a convincingly worried protagonist. Roman may be weaker than the other two, and I never believed in his relationship with Granger. Nevertheless, the overwhelmingly positive results interrupt the small negatives, and it can certainly be said that this is one of the best American films ever made. Just see what Hitch does here - the originality, the technical skill. We see the murder of Miriam reflected in his broken glasses. A game of tennis becomes one of the most exciting, intense scenes you will ever see. An innocent fairground becomes a place of murder and foul occurrences. A young boy's balloon flashes cold by Walker (Hitch obviously saw what he saw in 'The Third Man!'). The children's joy in driving the carousel turns into screaming, fast-paced terror. Hitch undermines normal everyday events like no other. The camera work here is among the best ever seen in a Hitchcock movie, and the premise is to die. It is smooth, oozing with sophistication and devilish charm. The transverse between Walker and Granger characters is magnificent - Granger's do-or-die tennis match is as important as villain Walker's rescue of an incriminating evidence that has been lost. Hitch rebuilds his villain in an unpleasant, abominable and yet sympathetic and oddly charming (Does anyone else find him strangely attractive, more than Granger?) Work - we are as excited as Walker in our hope that he can get the candle out drain. We need him anyway. He holds the key to the story. <br /> <br /> You will never see an approach from a stranger in the same way again after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Fantastic. <br /> <br /> 10/10.
