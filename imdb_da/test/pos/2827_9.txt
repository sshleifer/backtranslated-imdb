Best Robot Romantic Comedy ever, using the robots as the romantic characters that leave short circuits out of this category. This was Andy Kaufman's best bet. Bernadette Peters shows her versatility here with a fantastic performance. Although it's not a good movie in many areas, I give it a 9 on gut and quirkiness.
