Running Out of Time rests somewhere in the middle of Johnny To's cannon, in the "solid good" category. As a criminal thriller, it's not terribly original or overwhelming, and the action scenes won't blow you away, but it has something else to do with it. It's a johnny for movie. It must. <br /> <br /> Andy Lau has 72 hours to live. He decides to play a strange cat-and-mouse game with a HK police hostage dealer played by Lau Ching Wan. It is plotted in a nutshell. On top of that, piling layers of phrases that keep the matter interesting all the way through. It occasionally becomes too violent for its own sake, but never lets it get the best out of it. But just as Johnny To is handing over a smooth and well-made crime spider (which we face are dime-a-dozen), he slips into pieces and pieces that bring running out of time as a full emotional experience gives soul and heart to the well-oiled skeleton. The concepts of synchronism and minimalism (staples in his work) are explored with great effect here. Always subtle, so the pictures speak for themselves, giving them time to evolve with long traits and slow tracking shots, as examples of cutting the score are all here. A little love story in a bus between Andy Lau and a girl is among the highlights of the movie and part of the "heart" I'm talking about. So simple, but so powerful. Ditto to Lau's and Lau Ching Wans car scenes and bowling-room showdown. <br /> <br /> But something stops me from claiming to run out of time is a masterpiece. All have the ability and craftsmanship to a notch, but he can also be too laborious or bland at times. When he's good, he's really good. There is even an isolated moment of sheer shine that is just too good for their own sake, leaving a bittersweet aftertaste for the rest of the movie. I am convinced that if he puts his heart to it, he can make a really good movie. As it is, it is another of his films that is flawless but comfortable. Under the sleek HK style, it's the black humor and the profound drama that makes this a compelling movie. Worth to see, absolutely.
