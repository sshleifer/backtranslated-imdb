I LOVED this movie because Bobbie Phillips can really fight! I always hate when actors are not credible in action parts. It was great to see, no offense, but a woman who can skillfully perform martial arts and combat. If you compare this with most action movies with women, then you will definitely see what I mean. They do not have to cut the shoots with anyone who can fight and it flows better. I was very impressed. I hope there is more!
