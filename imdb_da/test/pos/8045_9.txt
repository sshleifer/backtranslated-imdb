This film really proves that the world is all too often an unfair place, especially the world of film pictures. "The Assignment" hardly received any attention to that release and was not surprisingly flopped at the cashier's office, but when the story is written, this movie will surely receive some much-lost praise. <br /> <br /> Thank God I'm surrounded by friends who know what's good for me. Being a film like myself, a friend recommended "The Assignment", a movie I hadn't even heard of. I decided to see what Leonard Maltin gave it, and not surprisingly he gave it 1/2. Knowing that this was the same class, he gave classics like "Alien", "The Usual Suspects" and "The Matrix" (I'm not asking you). I knew his opinion didn't mean that diddly squat jack's ***. So without hesitation I went out and bought it on DVD. This was about 3 years ago and the film is still one of my proudest items in my DVD collection, despite a tire design that echoes a low budget stink with Casper Van Dien. <br /> <br /> "The task" is academically oriented and delivers some really intense moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. In addition, it boasts a sometimes brilliant story that you know will be riddled with unexpected turns. It stars Aidan Quinn in one of his best performances and serves him with great support from Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley, both in good shape. Something like 40 out of 42 user comments like this movie, most of them can't seem to praise it enough. So what are you waiting for? If you call yourself a fan of action thrillers, you should have bought it, rented it, seen it yesterday!
