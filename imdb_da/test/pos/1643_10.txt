Wow! It is difficult to put words into my feelings for this episode. Ice cream is one of the best episodes of season one safe. It's my favorite in the season. Six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of the arctic with an unknown organism causing murderous aggression, the drama cannot be better than that. Paranoia ranks highest, because even Mulder and Scully have doubts about each other's hygiene. I've heard people complain about the similarities of this episode with the movie 'The Thing'. I haven't seen it, so I wouldn't know. Ice cream is more than worth seeing just to see Mulder and Scully really test their ever growing trust in each other. This episode is intense and exciting to the end. You will not be disappointed!
