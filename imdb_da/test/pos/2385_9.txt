I am a Talent Manager. I've been for 15 years now. I've discovered some wonderful talent. They have been in movies, shops, braodway and television. In my opinion, Eddie Monroe was cast wonderfully. I love to see the real people's ability. Not just a name. The actors in this movie were very natural and credible. I was very entertained by this movie. I love a movie with a few twists. I also enjoy when the puzzle at the end of the movie is resolved. I still want to know what happened to the big sum of money. (When you see the girl, you will understand what I say.) Mobsters look all right ???? I would like to watch this movie on the Big Screen. The footage was shot really well. The landscape of New York was New York, which I know. Have a happy 2006 and this movie can make it to the prices.
