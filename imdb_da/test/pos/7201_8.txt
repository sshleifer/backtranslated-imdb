Wow! The French are really hanging out of it. If we look at their first Asterix movie, we see a good story with fine actors (especially thanks to Gerard Depardeu), but very lame special effect. In a fantasy story like Asterix Special Effects is really important. Well ... they did it right this time! It looks fantastic. I personally think Mission Cleopatra is the best Asterix story ever written. In the movie there is not a moment you are bored. Go see this! A thing! they did not go right by the script, which i think is a bit pittyful. For example, the comical Obelix breaks the nose of the Sphinx, immediately all the small storekeepers begin to break the nose of their miniature sphinx. (really fun to see). Well, they didn't put it in the movie, instead they buried their nose under the Sphinx. Asterix: "They'll never look for this" (guess again). Be fun, but not as good as the original. Another thing I didn't like about the movie was their choice for music. It made movies for the child. But nevertheless ... It's a must C! <br /> <br /> Grz Da Jean Holland
