Inexplicably, I saw this movie for the first time a few days ago, and understood right from the start what everything about it was. This film kept my attention from the beginning to the end and ran me through the whole range of emotions (and could have helped me discover a couple I never knew about.) <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman shines absolutely like Ted Kramer. He is absolutely convincing as a man to juggle at least three different challenges in life: jilted man, workaholic ad executive and loving father. Meryl Streep as Joanna Kramer was less central to the movie, simply because Joanna was absent for a good deal of it, but when she was on the screen, she gave Hoffman a run for her money. However, the actual standout (in my opinion) had to be young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. Children are always the innocent victim of a marriage breakdown, and Justin seemed quite natural and completely credible in this role as he deals with the conflicting feelings about his mother and his adaptation to life with father, only to get the confusion about why he would have to leave his father when it was his mother who went out to him. Young Justin did not seem to miss a blow in this very difficult role. All in all, this is an excellent, Oscar-worthy movie whose only weak point was what I thought to be a really disappointing decision to go to the juicy and happy ending, which was completely unrealistic considering the destructive care that Ted and Joanna had been through. But there is not much else to complain about here. <br /> <br /> 9/10
