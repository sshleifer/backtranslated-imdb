Very pleased to see that this excellent movie gets such high marks from IMDB users. The best years of their lives are still the finest cinematic statement on veterans returning from war that I have come across. Easily the finest achievement by the often overlooked Frederick March. In fact, the whole play shines, including music legend Hoagy Carmichael, who treats us all with a subtle version of his classic Lazy River. I would recommend this excellent movie to anyone who loves movies.
