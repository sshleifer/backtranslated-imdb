Having rented One True Thing the second night, I've learned to respect my family and not take their health for granted. I have never seen such a real-life depiction of a cancer victim on the screen that delivered Meryl. She deserves Oscar nomination, but she has some tough competitors in the race. All I can say is beautiful movies, great plays from Streep and Zellwegger. Meryl Streep revealed his only true ability in this great movie!
