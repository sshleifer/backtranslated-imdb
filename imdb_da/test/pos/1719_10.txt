I have some of the older videos and DVDs of Dr. Who. I've played them over and over again. I love each of the "doctors" for various reasons. But because of a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who has been canceled even though it was still one of the BBC series headlines. With the departure of Sylvester McCoy, the doctor became alive with the help of the fans. The BBC graciously gave fans fans to write books and cartoons. The dream of Dr. Who has been stable right after 1989. Then they took a chance with Paul McGann. The movie was flawless, but it gave the BBC an idea of ​​what we wanted. In 1999, the "man" was gone, and the beginners at the BBC felt it was time to bring the doctor back. It was a complete success. Here in America, the Sci-fi Channel took a chance and it has also become a complete success, even though the authors should start again and explain Dr. Who mythology for new viewers. It's amazing to me that they've done it. In season 1, Christopher Eccleston stared with Russell T. Davis as lead author and Phil Collinson as a producer, the doctor came back to us, and in each episode we learn more about who the doctor is. Doctor Who Universe has always been about "Choice", "Love" and "Sacrifice". This is what they gave. It makes me want more, and it makes me feel that Mr. Eccleston has chosen to leave the show. My first doctor was Doctor No. 3, Jon Pertwee's Doctor. Mr. Eccleston doesn't have to worry about his position in Dr. Who the universe. It's as solid as the rest. He's the 9th Doctor. I didn't know about Mr Eccleston before his performance in Dr. Who, but I do it now. I wish there was some way he could know that is pushing out in Dr. Who fan community to find his second job and enjoy it. We have already seen that he is a great actor.
