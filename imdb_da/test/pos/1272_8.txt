Great British Director Christopher Nolan (Momento, Insomnia), leads this odd film about a struggling writer obsessed with the following people. This turns out to be harmless first but soon it becomes dangerous after taking the game one step further after meeting a like-minded man who shows him the ins and outs to break and enter. The two men quickly come across their heads in a strange world of mafia and prostitution. Jeremy Theobald plays the author and Alex Haw the like-minded friend. Both are good performances. This low budget film was shot in total guerrilla style without permission for anywhere and no big stars, but has what many great budget films do not have, which is a smart script and creative direction. An impressive debut of one of today's best directors. Good stuff!
