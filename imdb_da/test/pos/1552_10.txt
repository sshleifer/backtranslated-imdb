This film takes the psychological thriller to new depths. Well written by Shane Black, the film is made phenomenally by the cast under the apparent eye of Director Jack Swanstrom. It is clear that Swanstrom is a director that we must take care of in the future. His strength lies in his adaptation of personal experiences on the screen and in the classroom. <br /> <br /> This thought-provoking film is a must see for anyone who appreciates action, drama, excitement and mystery. As with any good movie, the viewer goes on his own journey to find their individual interpretation of the movie. The mysterious aspect of the movie is exciting and adds excitement. You find yourself looking for the answers with Marquette. The audience has wanted the film on the festival circuit - with many awards received, they must have agreed to A.W.O.L. (2006) is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I love to own a copy - how do I get one?
