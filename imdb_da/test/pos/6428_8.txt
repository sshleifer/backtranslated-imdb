This is actually a very good surreal mystery movie, despite the description trying to sell it as a Sci-Fi movie. Balkan stars as a woman haunted by mysterious visions and lost memories as she tries to piece together. She spends the majority of the film trying to make sense of her visions. Very atmospheric and efficient. It is true that Kinski does not look much in this movie, but the starring actors are very good. There is only one English-dubbed version available in the United States, and duplication gives something to be desired, but the actors do a very good job. The camera, by Academy Award winner Vittorio Storaro, is excellent. A former Giallo of director Bazzoni, FIFTHORDET, is also excellent and also the lens of Storarro.
