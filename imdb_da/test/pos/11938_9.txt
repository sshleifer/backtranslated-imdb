This is one of the films that is very undervalued. Again I vote for an undervalued movie. This movie has a good story line, maybe a little farfetched, but it could happen. Sean Astin (one of my favorite actors) again shows us a good performance. The guy does a good job, but is never recognized for his roles. He has done well since the goonies. Not just him, but Louis Gosset JR. Do a raising job. Maybe I thought this movie would have made more money in theaters, but who cares for money anyway. Around this is a good movie that will get you at the edge of your seat at times and the plot will keep the movie moving. I enjoyed this movie and hopefully the rest of you will too.
