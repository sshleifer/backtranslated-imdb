Satya was excellent .... The company was just as good, but more polished, probably because of the money earned from previous films. Ab Tak Chappan, however, is even more entertaining. The dialogue is rough, raw and sometimes fun. Nana Pataker shines once again in a role that he can only fulfill with authority, but the supportive cast is very talented. The direction is tight and the story develops at a satisfactory pace with a very dramatic climax. As a portrayal of reality, it can be over-dramatic, but at the end of the day it's a movie, so the balance is spot-on. I booked my DVD and can't wait to see it again at home. As a lover of this type of gangster flicks, this is very gratifying and highly recommended for the refreshing "non-Yash Raj" Bollywood gangster girl lovers out there.
