This movie is engaging from start to finish with outstanding performances, a stunning soundtrack of original music by Douglas Brown, and a well-functioning script filled with surprises. Full of new and not-new faces, this movie shows promising talent especially in the case of Craig Morris, who plays the protagonist Eddie Monroe. Morris, who also wrote with the script, shows a silent strength combined with a strong emotional performance as he creates a credible sign on the screen. Also an exciting supply of Paul Vario, playing Uncle Benny with a genuine warmth, was so convincing that he made me hungry when he lovingly prepared his Italian sauce. Great new faces, great new music and a great new story - what more can you ask for. This movie is highly recommended!
