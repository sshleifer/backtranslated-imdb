EXCUSE ME!!! HellOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!! CUBA GOODING, Jr. Would have won an Oscar for his depiction in this movie !!! He was the movie! While the movie is lacking in some areas, Cuba was amazing ... and for me it is the best role he has ever played! The scene in the movie, where he finds out that his mother is dead, made me break down and cry in THEATER !! I suppose I could really relate to this movie because I saw the same treatment of people as such in my own school growing up ... what a tragedy! Getting to see the "real" radio and coach at the end of the movie was also special! If you can watch this movie and not move to tears, you need a heart check! If you liked "Simon Birch" and "The Mighty", you will also love "Radio" too! I wish they made more movies like this ... Radio is the right deal!
