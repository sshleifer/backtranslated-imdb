Sick of the current cinema exit, especially American cinema, I have made an effort to watch the Oscar-winning foreign films. That was when I came across this gem. Slowly to start, it gets nice when the war is declared. Basically an old-fashioned girl-waiting-for-boy-to-back-from-war story, the show, the cinematography makes it so much more. Why Tatyana Samojlova as the young woman did not become an international star after this is beyond me (though she has been successful in her own country). You take the journey with her: Young, tired, outrageous young girl, who through the army of war becomes a very sober, gloomy woman, holding a glimpse of hope (her last scene is devastating). We love her as much as the camera does. And the camera work! Was this a pioneer in handheld camera work? It really adds an immediacy to the story. And the beauty of it (as when Tatyana's character runs up the stairs and beside a slaughter line). I am humbled and grateful to see this movie.
