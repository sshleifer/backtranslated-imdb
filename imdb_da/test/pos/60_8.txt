The main reason for seeing this picture is to enjoy the amazing performance of S. Ephata Merkerson. Mrs. Merkerson dominates this movie with her huge presence as Nanny, the woman who believes in doing well, no matter who, without strict attachment. This actress clearly shows a range that is fantastic. Thanks to Director George Wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best Black Americans actors together. This ensemble group in its tight direction helps create the right atmosphere where the action takes place. <br /> <br /> Of course none of this would have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson hadn't written his wonderful game. Working with Mr Wolf, perhaps the best theater director of this generation, has opened the game in a way that evokes that not too distant past where a child lives under the influence of Mrs Crosby when his own parents are not about to take care of by him. Mrs. Crosby becomes the little sons of Rubens; In a way, he represents his reward for having lost his own daughter. Unfortunately, there is no time to develop any of the characters, as the action focuses solely on strengthening the relationship between nanny and young Ruben, the game with such charm of young Marcus Carl Franklin, who is a natural. The only thing that could have been done differently was the voice of the narrative, which is sometimes intrusive, as it does not clarify or justify what one sees. Quite frankly, just by seeing the interaction between the players, self-explanatory. <br /> <br /> In the background there is always music. No matter what difficult times these people go through, but Nanny's House is full of laughter and the glorious music that takes us back to that era. <br /> <br /> Except Ms. Merkerson are other notable performances given by Terrence Dashon Howard, one of the rising stars at the moment. Mos Def, Jeffrey Wright, Marcy Gray, Louis Gossett Jr., Delroy Lindo, Rosie Perez, Carmen Ejogo, Jimmy Smits and the rest. <br /> <br /> Ms. S. Ephata Merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience. In "Lackawanna Blues" she clearly demonstrates that she can do everything she wants because of her huge talent and charisma.
