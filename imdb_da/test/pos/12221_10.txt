I bought the entire season surface. saw it for 3 days! I was so caught up in the plot, theories and basically everything about this show. The actor who plays Miles is great. Mile sister, mother and father acted as family would. You can connect on so many levels, it's fascinating. <br /> <br /> I find that animals are so wonderful that you can almost connect them as a parent is a child. It would be something if a creation of this kind of nature really exists. <br /> <br /> It's sad that the surface doesn't have another season or at least four more shows. I have so many questions to be answered, and hopefully they may create more or maybe a book. <br /> <br /> Love the show a lot. For those who haven't seen the Surface, if you like sci-fi, you should see it here !!!!!!!!!!!!!
