A proof that it is not necessary for a movie to have a deep multi-layered history and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie. Although history could be expanded in many directions, especially in a more sociological way (people want money), it seems that it is perfect, just as it is. Through many sudden changes it takes the spectator to the end without unnecessary complications and without letting the viewer take his eyes on the screen. <br /> <br /> But the play for me is not so good. With the exception of Lindsey McKeon, the others were average or even worst. In some scenes they just empty themselves. Except for Lindsey, who was more convincing. It's a really simple movie where you just sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br /> 7/10
