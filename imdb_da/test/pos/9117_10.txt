I could see an example of this movie through the UCLA's pre-screening program and let me tell you: THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLE GOOD !!!! I have seen many movies, but few have made me laugh so sincerely or talk about the film afterwards as much as this one. I had a decent respect for Tenacious D before I saw the movie, and now I'm MAD about them. I will definitely buy their album when it is released on the 14th and will see this movie again. <br /> <br /> If you were on the fence to watch this movie, come and see it !! It is worth the extremely expensive price of movie tickets these days as you will probably bust a nut that laughs underneath it all. <br /> <br /> Apart from the comedy, the glorious and divine music flowing from KG's guitar and JB's voice is awe inspiring. The audience is left in a stupor that such beautiful harmonies and amazing riffs can be created in connection with such ridiculous (and hilarious) texts. If nothing but the music itself, this movie is worth the price. <br /> <br /> With an amazingly coherent storyline in almost every aspect of the traditional "D" story and characteristics, great new songs, hilarious comedy, and some beautiful awesome cameos, this movie goes up there with the best! Go see it !!
