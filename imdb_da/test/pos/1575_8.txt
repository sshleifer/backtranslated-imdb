"What Alice Found" was a pleasant discovery. As written and directed by A. Dean Bell, this is a combination of a road movie with a warning and a voyage of discovery. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, you may need to stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Alice is a case study on a young woman who wants to break away from the unhappy life she leads in a New England city. Her pretext for leaving goes with her best friend, studying at a Miami University. Alice is the product of a single mother's home, one who struggles to make ends meet, in stark contrast to the ease she turns to live. In flashbacks we get Alice's life before we go on the road. <br /> <br /> Alice, as her namesake in "Alice in Wonderland", begins on a trip to the unknown that life has not prepared her. The engines in America are full of predators in search of the weak and innocent. Alice meets with disaster when her car breaks down the road and a friendly couple comes to her when a strange man approaches in the dark with the excuse, he wants to help her. Sandra and Bill convince her to get together in their sumptuous R.V. heading south. <br /> <br /> Nothing has prepared Alice for what this couple turns out to be. After all, in her protected life she has not dealt with what Sandra and Bill, the new welfare workers do during the nights in the rest of the American highways. It comes as a shock to her the realization that the black Sandra is other than a prostitute who plagues her trade among the truck driving people you meet in those places. <br /> <br /> Alice, brilliantly played by Emily Grace, is a study of how the young woman awakens the new reality she cannot escape. In fact, Sandra makes it so easy that Alice tries her luck in the oldest profession on earth to raise some badly needed money. Judith Ivey gives a huge performance like Sandra. Ms. Ivey is perfect as the seemingly normal woman you would not suspect that she is uncomfortable with customers she and Bill find along the route they travel. Ms. Ivey is amazing when she reveals the truth about her life to an accusing Alice. As a man, Bill Raymond is good at his portrayal as a man who is in fact a lawyer. Under the good direction of Mr. Dean Bell, the movie is not afraid to go to places that are ordinary movies dare not go. Congratulations on this director who has written a plausible story and has put together the perfect cast to play it to our advantage.
