Crossfire is one of the films from the sixties that cries for a remake, if for some reason it may not be time it should be written as originally written. The story about which the film is based is about killing a gay man. But anti-Semitism was certainly a hot topic in the days after World War II with the Holocaust fresh in everyone's brain. In the Lee Server biography of Robert Mitchum, Edward Dmytryk, the director was interviewed and and certainly said that the film could never have been made about a hate crime against homosexuals at the time of The Code firmly in place. It could have been because Robert Ryan's character is such an equal opportunity hate of everything that differs from his social norms. <br /> <br /> Mitchum was told in no uncertain terms that he was in the movie strictly for ride. Robert Young was thrown as a captain in Washington, DC Police, catching the case, and while Mitchum was second billed, he knew from the beginning that the movie should belong to Ryan. But he was RKO's new star in his performance at The Story Of GI Joe and Till The End of Time, so he was there for box office insurance. Mitchum's part was as sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case, George Cooper. <br/> <br /> Crossfire is not a whodunit, although we do not see the crime it becomes clear that Montgomery is the one who kills Sam Levene, the quintessential Jewish seller. And it becomes clear to Young and Mitchum that Ryan is the guilty party almost as fast as it does the audience. It's just a matter of getting the evidence. <br /> <br /> Ryan has earned one of several Oscar nominations given to the film, his best entertainment actor category. Although he lost to Edmund Gwenn, the movie was Ryan's breakthrough role. Similarly, Gloria Grahame was nominated for a short part as a maid to best supporting actress, but she lost to Celeste Holm for the Gentleman's Agreement. In fact, Crossfire drove up to Gentleman's deal and lost to Best Picture and Best Director of Dmytryk to Elia Kazan. This is the fifth Best Screenplay nomination, and Crossfire came up short again with the winner as Miracle on 34th Street. <br /> <br /> Gloria Grahame also had her own problems on the set that spilled over from her personal life. She had great problems with her then-husband Stanley Clements, who was an abusive man. He hung around in sets, causing Ed Dmytryk many problems. Fortunately, Graham's part was a small one. In fact, the entire movie was shot in typical RKO economy style over 20 days. <br /> <br /> Robert Young has a particularly nice scene with William Phipps, a young kid from Tennessee in Mitchum and Ryan's outfit, which Ryan constantly climbs. Young people are most eloquent in talking about the corrosive nature of hate and how it affects his family as Irish Catholics who came across potato famine years. It was one of Robert Young's best moments on the screen in his long career. <br /> <br /> As fine a movie as Crossfire is, it's time to be remade as a story of an anti-gay crime. Especially with the real killings of Barry Winchell of the last decade and the debate on gays in the military. It's a movie where time has come and almost gone.
