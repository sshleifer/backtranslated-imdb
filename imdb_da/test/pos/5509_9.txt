I do not understand where these bad comments come from. The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you scared to get to your car at the end of the night. The part that gets you is that it could all happen. Not to the extent that is perceived in the film, but the whole idea is reality. This film took that reality and twisted it into a Dee Snider nightmare. <br /> <br /> Three thumbs (the third is from the dead body in my freezer).
