Out of the 600 or so Spaghetti Westerns, this must be in the top 20 somewhere. Can't believe this has not received any reviews! Gemma is excellent in this. Van Johnson is also good, although his double voice is a little killer, but it is the charm of the Italian style. Beautiful photography and some excellent scenarios. All supporting characters are well played. The severity of the racist stripes in the evil is quite tough, even to today's standards, creating an emotional depth to Gemma's character in some of the situations that occur. Absolutely fantastic score by Luis Bacalov. See this is in the wonderful Wide Screen DVD from Japan. A spaghetti must have.
