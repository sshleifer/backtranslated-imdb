It takes a lot for a movie to reach the already stupid particles in my brain that have not already been drained because of the overcharged and redoredoredocopocopopopia world of film. But this movie has made it on my 'Magic Movies' list. To become a "magic movie", it must leave every string of my game in it, which I can only define as "bliss" and "complete satisfaction". This movie has tapped into the fibers of how my mind thinks, and if not for the deeply personal bond of my head and the head of the one who made those stocks, it would look like another 'dead rave scene' movie from back when 90 The guys exploded with their Ecstasy craze. It's not the way the movie came to me at all. It has reached me and pulled up something that I thought was dead for a very long time and pushed me as far as giving it a criticism of myself. I have forgotten how long it has been since I saw something that left me feeling good inside. I highly recommend watching this movie.
