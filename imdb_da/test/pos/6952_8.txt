Kingdom County, Vermont, 1927. Noel Lord (Rip Torn) lives with his Indian buddy, Bangor (Tantoo Cardinal) in the area where a large dam is to be built; However, Noel is not willing to give up his country, and he must fight for the dam company to prevent the county from being destroyed. <br /> <br /> "where the rivers flow north" is a poignant contemplative story driven by Rip Torn's memorable performances (recently seen in Louis XV's small but juicy role in Sofia Coppola's underrated "Marie Antoinette") and Tantoo Cardinal (" Dances With Wolves, "Smoke Signals". Director Jay Craven (who also wrote with Don Bredes's script, based on Howard Frank Mosher's novel) and film photographer Paul Ryan, created this powerful story with unique, contemplative pace / visuals reminding me of Terrence Malick and John Houston's best moments. It is an underestimated independent period of the first (electric) half of the 90s, which is usually considered the rise of the Quentin Tarantino burlesque ("Pulp Fiction" is a masterpiece, but the man suffers from Orson Welles syndrome), Todd Solondz's disruptive suburbia Danny Boyle's dark vision for the UK (let's not mention that "Beach" flicker with DiCaprio though) ... Jay Craven should also be considered on the lists of great indie filmmakers. He has pursued a respectful and discreet career and it is always a pleasure to see a constant talent like his. <br /> <br /> My vote: 8/10.
