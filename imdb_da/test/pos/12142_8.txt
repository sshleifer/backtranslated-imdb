I've only seen about half a dozen movies starring Lino Ventura, but one seems a lot like the others. He plays a laconic criminal - one who is short-worded and even subdued explosively. Given his quiet persona in movies like ARMY OF SHADOWS and SECOND BREATH, I have noticed that his minimalist performance is extremely effective. In other words, because he is so quiet and gentle when he does bad things, you tend to notice it. And like these other films, he also has a very strong but twisted moral code. <br /> <br /> Abel Davos (Ventura) and his partner, Lilane, both live in Italy and are career criminals. Both were raised in France and eventually had to flea because of their criminal activities. Now in Italy, as the film begins, they continue to live the lives of thugs and the heat is on to catch them. Strangely, instead of driving to another third country, they decide to go back to France - even though Davos has been tried and sentenced in absence - and if he is trapped, it could mean a life in prison or death penalty. Much of the first third of the film relates to their hidden returns. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for Davos, the return is not perfect, and now every Frenchman seems to be looking for him. In addition, the reaction of his old compatriots in crime is not at all what he expects. In fact, their weak reaction to his return ends in a series of horrible events at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Davos meets and is taken in my stranger, Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo). Despite the fact that Davos does not have any friends, Stark and his girlfriends try their best to make his return successful. What throws another monkey key into this, however, is Davos's two very young sons - what is Davos to do with them - keep them with him in his hiding place? <br /> All in all, this is a very good crime movie - like French Film Noir. Unlike American Noir, the many French versions I've seen have a more realistic and bleak view of them. Fatalism is the highest, that's for sure! The action is first-rate (especially from Ventura and Belmondo), the direction very safe and the writing very nice, although I am sure many do not like the ending. It just seems to be tackled - as an afterthought. I understood why they did it this way, but can also see how it can leave many dissatisfied. For me it was a bit flat. Otherwise, an extraordinary movie.
