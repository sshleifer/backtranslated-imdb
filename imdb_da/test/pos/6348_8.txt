Let me first say that I am a big fan of the original series Lonesome Dove and the book it was based on. I have dismissed this sequel for the better part of 10 years because of the bad reviews I had heard of it. If Tommy Lee Jones didn't play Capt. Call, I didn't see the point. If Larry McMurtry wasn't involved, why should I take care? How wrong I was. This is in many ways a worthy successor to Lonesome Dove, perhaps even more than the dark mood of Streets of Laredo. History, plays, production, filmography are all top class. Of course, the script is not as colorful as Lonesome Dove, but it has its moments. And much to my surprise, there are bits of Lonesome Done in this series; The relationship between July and Clara, completely dismissed in the prequel, is brought up here almost identical to the book, a very welcome surprise. The story is not all roses, it also has surprises. The biggest surprise is Jon Voight's interpretation of Capt. Call. Although it is not a direct copy of Tommy Lee Jones, he is both faithful and unique to Voight's credit. The game is amazing across the board and I don't think Rick Schroeder has made a better play than in this series. Oliver Reed practically steals the show here, he is great in a role that makes you aware of his character as much as you hate. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing this if you are not to blame for bad criticism, especially that the DVD is so affordable (I have 2-disc sets for $ 10.99 you can probably find it cheaper). It is by no means the disappointment that Dead Man's Walk appeared (that was for me). And MCMurtry was involved in the one!
