Having seen NAKED CITY and NAT and CITY (which is still my favorite Dassin) I was more than thrilled to see his "Masterpiece" (O-Word Criterion) RIFIFI. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm a little disappointed with the story. <br /> <br /> So I have at least these five questions in my heart: <br /> <br /> 1. In the last Countdown Louis Grutter shot inside a house the main character Tony le St√©phanois. He didn't know if he was still alive or not, but he didn't care about it and ran right after it outside the house (with the money) to reach his car. So of course Tony was not dead and shot him. BIG QUESTIONS. <br /> <br /> 2. In another important scene, the cashier specialist Cesar immediately after the robbery as a gift gave a diamond ring (which was part of the robbery) a woman working for Louis Grutter in a night bar. Stupid, because before this character was not so stupid. And of course, Louis knew that Tony had planned the jewel robbery. SMART QUESTIONS. <br /> <br /> 3. After the virgins behind Louis Grutter's murder Mario Ferrati and his wife, Tony and his best friend Joe planned a revenge on the Louis band. At the same time, they don't care about the safety of Joe's wife and his five-year-old child. Of course, the Louis band kidnapped the son. CHEAP AND SIMPLE. <br /> <br /> 4. The perfect hoist: Of course this is the best 30 min. long scene throughout the plot, without any word spoken in all the time, but was this a perfect hoist ?? Comparing with other movies dealing with this theme, I could only smile when, for example, Tony was taken a fire extinguisher to ban the alarm. Also too simple. <br /> <br /> 5. The groats band went to Mario's house because they knew (though ....) the jewels would be there. Then they kill Mario and his wife. Also? They are not looking for it! NONE. They ran straight out of the apartment. And more. They do not observe the apartment after that, so Tony can go after a while (which was the same day) to take the jewels. BIG QUESTIONS. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie. Due to the brilliant 30 minute silent scene. Because of the very good cut (the final stage of the car through Paris is fantastic). Because of a very good actor named Jean Servais. Because of this black and white fever you get at the same time you see it. For other reasons, other users also wrote about, but please tell me it's a great story.
