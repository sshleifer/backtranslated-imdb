I think this movie is the most misunderstood movie in Jerry Lewis's career. It's a little slow starting, but after that it is very fun and Jerry's use of irony like never before in his previous movie ..., ie. who is Minding Store, Nutty Professor etc. The idea is clear, it is clearly a mock of the Dirty Dozen, instead of getting soldiers on death row to do a suicide mission as in that movie, you have 4, 4-f and 2 tag alongs. Including the former L.A. Dodger's all-star Centerfielder, Willie Davis as Linc! HYSTERIC FUN! Love that movie!
