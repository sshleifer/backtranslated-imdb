I have to admit that I fell into the cynical trap of believing that Australians could not make drama unless it meant much crying and I am Australian. Unfortunately, isn't it? While this movie involves crying, it is not dramatically weeping, the honest feeling shining through. <br /> <br /> This film is also a whodunnit. I knew what the final result was when I started to see this, so I tried to guess who it was to do it. I missed a mile. I was stunned when I found out the director, Murali Thulluri was only about 21 when he made this movie. I would love to shake my hand. He knows how to make a movie. I hope he comes more. <br /> <br /> All the characters we face before the main title credit (about 12 minutes) are an antiheart. Everyone disturbed their own path and all of them as selfish as the next. Even when they are sympathetic. The scariest scene in the movie and there are some that are difficult to see is the final scene in which we are formally introduced to the real protagonist and we are told about their nephew. This scene made me cry. <br /> <br /> My belief in Australian drama has been restored. We are masters of comedy, but I was upset by comedies. <br /> <br /> Murali, if you happen to check this, you touched my soul, and for that I can only thank you.
