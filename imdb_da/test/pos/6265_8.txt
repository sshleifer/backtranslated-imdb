This movie is about so many things. Most obviously, the team that movies can have over an audience, and how capturing life on film can be a kind of magic. There is also the tense relationship between China and the West, so many Chinese misses (surely rightly) the "barbarians" who are trying to take over and pollute their lifestyle. Liu even seeks to preserve their lifestyle on film because he sees it one day will disappear. Their is also Liu's internal conflict between China's loyalties and traditions in relation to the West's self-determination philosophy. All these themes are woven perfectly skillfully into a coherent and enjoyable whole of Hu. A very enjoyable movie.
