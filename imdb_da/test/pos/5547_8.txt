Time does extraordinary things. It's the ultimate judge. Time has given "Married to The Mob" an extra dose of freshness. There are no dead moments or cheap shots. It is more of a joy now than it ever was. Michelle Pfeiffer creates a mafia widow that is so far away from a caricature as she has ever done. A genuine original creation that touches or suggests the stereotype just to guide us through, but her Angela is quite unique. The legendary Dean Stockwell presents us with a mafia manager that it is just as much right as he is fun. And Matthew Modine? Why did I think he had no chemistry with Pfeiffer? I was mistaken. They are wonderful together. They reminded me this time to Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray of "Remember the Night" I am writing this comment now to entice you to visit or visit this Jonathan Demme gem.
