I want to be honest, I rented this movie solely because it was part of the "Child's Play" series. I expect a boring, blunt fourth part for the series, but I was surprised. This movie was surprisingly good and I found it to be quite fun. There was very dark humor, and the idea of ​​getting two dolls was a good way to spice things up. The two dolls worked well together and added a bonnie and clyde type to the movie. All in all, it was very good for a 4th movie in the series with some gruesome death scenes (just see the Marilyn Manson type being killed at first, not to mention John Ritter getting a face full of nails). Applauds the authors for spicing things up and the end though I found it a bit odd leaving room for yet another sequel ... maybe "son of chucky" !!!
