I've gone out of a Coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. The two best examples of this are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so full of strange humor that I had to like it. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killing bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the shape of the movie. Still, I liked the movie and now owns a copy of it. Fargo made me shine with hysteria, sometimes I wasn't sure why I laughed so hard that it made me cry, but I was that anyway. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but after further investigation they were really just real people talking about real-life situations. Therefore, the man with the shovel (or was it a diet) saw side-cutting fun when he told the police officer about some fun looking down at the bar the second night. And that is also why the theater broke into laughter when he said there are some funny looks coming in. (I also own a copy of this movie) The Coen's have a way to mask their movies and their characters are somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little away from the wall. But if you look closely at some of the same signs that seem to be very much, you will always find it in some strange way that they all are true. That's what is quite unusual about O Brother, where are you? This is a movie out there. I don't even mean it in the same ballpark as a traditional movie. I reviewed the movie Shaft this past the summer, and in that I said that Shaft was an okay movie I have seen a thousand times before. But you can't say about a Coen Brothers movie, and you certainly can't say it about this. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything in it from a prison break, crooked southern politicians, muses, references to what I can only assume are historical figures, rivers of baptism, bank robbery, violence against animals, song flocks of religious fanatics, KKK, lynch mobs and so on. There are also obviously many references to Homer's Odyssey in here, but I wouldn't know because I never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it, and they believe that this cynicism and almost spoof-like quality towards it makes the movie so much better. Now coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it, I can tell you it's still an entertaining movie. There were times again, as is common for a Coen movie, I wasn't sure why I was entertained or laughing, but I was. <br /> <br /> This is a roadmap where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he has hidden from his other two cell comrades. He has to take them together because they were also chained to him as they had a chance to escape. <br /> <br /> I like all the major actors in the movie and many of them are Coen cronies. It was great to see Goodman again. It was great to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to have a place in every Coen movie. It's too bad they didn't find room for Steve Buscemi, but that's another story together. But back to Clooney. The man only has charisma. He is also a play by an actor and here he is not as big as the others, but he himself has his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is amazing and I really hope it shows that he is able to play any kind of character. <br /> <br /> Now, having honored all this praise on the movie, let me just say it too. I didn't like the movie at first. I found it to be rather boring and a little boring. There were too many ideas in here, and there was not enough care to use them for everything they were worth. But then the movie began to grow on me. It took a while, but it grew on me. I don't think it's their best movie, but it's still good and I give it a 8.5. But the reason I recommend this movie is for one reason only. <br /> <br /> Every day you can look into the paper and watch the movies that play and tell yourself, seen it, watch it, oh, seen the last year, it's the same as this movie and that is the same as that movie. Most films have been reused in some form. Not Coen's movie. They have not been reused and if they have I do not know. That's enough reason to see something they put out. Originality counts a lot in my books. Coens are original and they are good. And it's not common in today's cinema. Enjoy them while they are allowed to make movies. Because you don't get vision like this in many movies, so when you do, enjoy it!
