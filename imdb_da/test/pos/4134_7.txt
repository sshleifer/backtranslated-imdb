I must say so. Gary Busey saved this movie. If it wasn't for his fine acting talent, this movie would have been sub par. I recommend the movie but just barely. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie is its broad lack of respect for historical, geographical, and physical accuracy. Why is Lubbock green and hilly? How did Buddy's producer Petty come out? Where are the Daily Trips to Clovis, the New Mexico Study? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate lamp to destroy Holly's sound? Why was Buddy's two-week court order for Maria treated as a complex, taboo, racial stereotype? Why are Buddy's tile boxes as light as feathers? Finally, why is Crickets portrayed as trouble making roadblocks to Holly's talent? <br /> <br /> On their face, these inaccuracies must spell doom for any movie that proclaims itself, "The Buddy Holly Story." But Busey delivers a stirring portrayal as the man whose death eventually led to the day the music died.
