Maybe not Miyazaki's best work, but I couldn't help but love it to death. A five-year-old boy finds what he thinks is a goldfish stuck in a bottle. He saves his life and holds it in a bucket as a pet, but it is truly a magical creature, the daughter of a human wizard and a sea goddess. Ponyo, whom the boy names her, is taken back to the sea by her father, who tries to deter her from returning to land and becoming human, but she enters her magical elixirs and does what she wants to do. The story is simple and sweet. However, where the movie really comes to life, is in its huge work of art. The drawings are more childlike than any of Miyazaki's other works, but there is beauty in its simplicity. As with all his films, Miyazaki creates this fantasy world that I was just so admired. Seeing it in the theater reminded how it was when the opening notes of Jo Hisaishi's score for Princess Mononoke washed over me and gave me goose bumps just a decade ago (the score here is just as wonderful). I wanted to live in this world and never leave it.
