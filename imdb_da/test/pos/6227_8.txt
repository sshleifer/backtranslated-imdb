I must admit thanks to this movie, I am now afraid of mannequins. hahaha. <br /> <br /> But yes, the first thing is to act in this movie, at least of my standard, is pretty swollen. Most of the players are quite decent in their roles. The script also looks pretty good too, certainly some cheesy things in there, but also some decent written character and some amazing scary scenes. I still get tremors and think of one scene with the guy and the mannequin. brrr. Yes, I say you should check out this movie, it is pretty good and very entertaining. a good watch. 8.10
