I enjoyed this movie. The way these mutants looked, along with the tone of the film, is very good. Plus, David Cronenberg as Philip K. Decker was awesome! It makes me wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life (apart from the killings of course). <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the creatures of this movie, although this movie probably had a somewhat low budget, the mutants / creatures / monsters looked good, especially from 1990. This is definitely a unique movie and not crap . It makes me go and find a read short story on which it is based. This is an interesting movie because it shows how humans can be monsters, and "monsters" is the one with humanity.
