Man, I think people have forgotten how to watch a movie. Everyone thinks they are critics. They comment on things that average moviegoers don't even know or think about. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie. That was what I expected so was not disappointed. Steven gets a bad rap to put his views into his movies, but it's also a reason to see. What's even more fun are the people who complain about his films, say he's the worst, and that we shouldn't watch his movie, yet see his movie anyway. So they can comment on how bad they are. Who's the dummy? If you don't like his work, don't see it. Then you do not have to submit to this supposedly painful event. <br /> <br /> Stop comparing movies with other movies and watching movies on an individual basis and you can start enjoying movies again.
