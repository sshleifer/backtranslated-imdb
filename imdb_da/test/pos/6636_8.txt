Ingmar Bergman's meditation on war relates to a couple who live an idyllic existence on a small island off the coast (which country is not specified). Raging off in the distance is a war they only know from news reports. As they go about their day, the war comes to them and it soon becomes a struggle to survive as both sides do not seem to care about them. Weakly looks at the human war price and those who are not easily involved in battle, but caught in the cross fire nonetheless. Its a movie ahead of its time like about 40 years since it was made by armies in war, where most of the accidents are civilian have come of age. This is a dark disturbing movie that is told from the average person's point of view with the complete sense of hopeless and confusing best expressed in the mindset that ran through my head, "What am I doing now?". As an intellectual exercise, the movie is top notch, it's a movie that makes you think. As an emotional film, it touches, but never quite in motion. I was never moved emotionally, although horror of the situation made my brain flip flops. (I should say that I admire Bergman intellectually for the ideas he brings to the table, but I have never been moved by his film. I'm not a fan. I always sit with Fellini in the old movie class's argument that who was better when he had more feelings for his films. Reservations aside this requires the need for viewing, especially as we live in a world war, for most of us it's just one thing on a TV screen.
