Opera opens with a very close-up shot of a bird's ever eye and thus begins one of Argento's most bizarre and pleasant features (my second favorite in fact behind Deep Red). Permitted, at times, the movie is quite absurd (the lack of real concern after murder, bird attacks, the burned dummy ending ??) but it is Argento's amazing world, and when you get to it you will find that it works. However, I do not mean to completely reject these mistakes, but rather that the film's artistry more than makes up for them. For example, the aforementioned bird attack is completely over-the-top in theory, but look at the wonderful execution of it; chaos flying, adding their outrageous squawking to the driving rock beat, the panic panic as seen through the circling, bird's-eye camera work, and then the focused attack; aria of terror actually. Argento's amazing floating film is full screen in Opera, and clearly one of the highlights of the movie. I also enjoyed the soundtrack of operative themes and rock music, a good contrast of music, each used effectively (the rock goes into the murders in perfect timing and gives the scenes a very fringed feeling). The sound effects deserve a nod, staff, scissors, beak and everything. Inspector Alan Santini: "I've seen many of your movies. Yes, you really are an expert in this. I would be very interested in knowing your opinion." Marco: "I think it is unwise to use movies as a guide to reality, not inspector? "<br /> <Inspector Alan Santini:" Depends on what you mean by reality. " <br /> <br /> Be sure this is a giallo, stylish murder is a must, and Dario does not disappoint ("the ball through the door" stage may be one of the biggest deaths ever shot if you forgive the pun) . The black-haired, deep-hearted, pulsating brain (cool shots!) Killer is cold and brutal and has him ties under our heroine's eyes, so she was forced to see the murders, was a good touch. As said, as a giallo, Opera has not quite as good a mystery as it should. The killer is kept secret from the audience enough, but there is little effort in the film dedicated to actually solving the murders. This and the strange end could have used more work. Despite these problems, Opera still manages to be a valuable and satisfying horror movie. One final note: it was nice to watch a movie, once showing the correct view through the binoculars (just a circle, not two circles together)! Nice eye for detail, Dario!
