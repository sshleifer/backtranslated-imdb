Even an old cynical doctor, like a fan like myself, can be breathless by seeing an episode of my favorite program. It happened earlier during Eccleston's finals, and it happened by watching this episode. It doesn't happen often, but The Impossible Planet is an example of both the show and the television in the very best. This is great TV <br /> <br /> The doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see strange writing on the wall and the audience (many of those moving behind the sofa) immediately transfixed. A door opens and horrible monsters begin to stalk the time travelers. This could have taken a whole 25 minute episode in the original show, but all this takes place in his pre-title order. You can miss the longer drawn format on the original show, but at least this new series is tight and if we are treated to a disappointing story, then at least it is usually only for a week. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to disappoint a viewer here. It is Doctor WHO at its most traditional best. Author Matt Jones and Director James Strong have gone out of their way to make a story that will be considered in the years to come. They do this by building a deadly narrative. The doctor and Rose lose Tardis, and they are stuck with the protagonists of the distant future. It is interesting how many stories never have this type of plot where the doctor and his companions no longer have access to Tardis, giving a more exciting type of story. Without a doubt, the highlight is the scene where Scooti goes to seek Toby to find him standing on the surface of the planet where he turns and lures her outside. Everything from performing, make up and Murray Gold music makes this a scene that really shocks the audience. I can imagine immediately after this episode received the BBC boards a tsunami of complaints for distressed parents who said how traumatized their children were. That it took them several hours to get them behind the family sofa and that they now refuse to sleep with the lights out. To do this, complaint would be to deny the magic doctor of the WHO. Yes it can scare and yes, such images will burn into a child's mind, something they will never forget, even though he lives to be a hundred. But I bet my life that these same "traumatized" children would have spent the week begging whatever they are allowed to see the next episode
