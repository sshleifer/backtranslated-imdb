I really enjoyed this movie. It was edgy without being sociopath. Vin Diesel brought the Riddick character to life and made you feel good and bad about him at different levels. <br /> <br /> I also saw Iron Giant and Wine perfect. (The snowmobile movie - it's called "Triple-X" or "xXx" - was a weak example of his work.) In Pitch Black he plays an anti-hero to the max. I don't think you can go wrong when Vin stars in a movie. Unfortunately, Hollowood can throw him as an adventure action movie star - wrong! I think the manuscript for "XXX" was weak for which Vin couldn't do it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Pitch Black is a great scifi - watch it! <br /> <br /> - Zafoid
