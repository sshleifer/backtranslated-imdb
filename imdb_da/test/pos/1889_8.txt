These are the kind of movies I loved and still love to grow up. Unlike large budget films, huge plot boxes are crumbling and never recognizing them. This movie takes everything to pieces and just does something you can sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Earlier, there were movie studios complaining that it was not a list material. But it's not the intention. The point of this movie is that no one likes big CGI Clich√©-filled movies. There are many people who like movies that are meant to just entertain you and not get as much money as possible. <br /> <br /> It is also nice to know that good ol Bruce is not dead yet.
