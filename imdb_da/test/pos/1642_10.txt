Ice the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A virus pulled out of the ice <br /> <br /> Just didn't know how to play. <br /> <br /> Because the infection you want to kill <br /> <br /> Because you're sick. Cure should be infected twice. Ice is an amazing episode; one of the storms from season 1 that started shaping the show, and if you ask me, you really can't ask for much better throughout the series. It starts with a fantastic teaser, which in my opinion really is one of the best teasers in the series too. A group of scientists in Alaska have drilled something out of the ice core, which for some reason has caused them to kill each other. Now Mulder and Scully are sent with three other researchers to investigate what happened. As Mulder says, it is either because they are brilliant or consumable. I take this to mean that they could be better off otherwise ... The group quickly finds out that the cause of chaos is a small parasite pulled out of the ice core. A small worm that enters the bloodstream and causes violent behavior. Since the pilot is infected, the rest of the show becomes an exciting kind of who makes the paranoial thriller, as the others begin to suspect each other about being infected. This is not at all helped by an overly paranoid physician Hodge who does not trust anyone we learn early on the first thing he asks: to see everyone's credentials to "ensure we are as we say we are". Events lead to finding out who is infected and learning to cure them. <br /> <br /> There are a number of things I like about the episode and, of course, some characters I want to smear in the face of this episode, as well as a few loopholes, but most can be attributed to increased caution and not to think clearly . I like Bear from the moment I first meet him. It's a shame he'll die. I also like the scene shown from the other scientist's point of view as Mulder and Scully argue in the other room. It gives an interesting twist to our typical viewer and to me it seems to say perhaps we must not assume that just because someone is government means they know all kinds of conspiracy secrets. As much as Hodges frustrates me in this episode, I think Mulder was so much to blame for some of the eradicated acts taken as someone. I really like Scully in this episode. First of all, she can tackle as a frickin linebacker! Secondly, I would really like to focus on her fears of what might happen to them out there and how she tries not to trust and the possibility of Mulder preventing her from confusing her judgment. I love the scene when she goes into the living room to sleep and first looks like the picture of the previous group all the cuddles and birthday presents from them to the one who used to sleep in that room and then how she suddenly freaks out and pushes the chest of drawers in front of the door and in a last touch of subtlety as she sits on the floor with the knees pulled into the chest, we see the bottom of a poster on the wall that says "Bosom Buddies". This is such a good writing. One way to say without words, as Scully is concerned that she may not be able to rely on even her best friend. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this heightened suspicion that the group believes Mulder gets infected when he discovers Murphy's death, even though they haven't inspected him at all to find out for sure. It was my biggest problem with the signs of the signs that they could easily have solved all the suspicion by simply giving blood. But I think I probably would also have acted violently in that situation. But so stupid Hodges decides that he must assume that Mulder is infected, even though Mulder willingly surrenders, and then he would like to be inspected and infect nearly Mulder in the process. Fortunately, he sees that it really is Dasilva who is infected and we finally reach a decision. At least as much as you can expect from an X-File. "The government" does not waste time to fire evidence as it always does in these cases, and Mulder is left with another frustrating "unsolved" case. Finally, I give "Ice" and easy 10/10, and I leave you with a haiku. "We are not who we are. It goes no further than this. It ends right here right now."
