It has become extremely difficult to find a good horror movie anymore, thought this movie was a good thriller. <br /> <br /> Could have had better production values, but what kept me going was the excitement and the twists and turns. I had real reservations before I watched this movie (because of the cover). I was afraid it would be excessively bloody and gruesome. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Although there are many scary parts, there is also a lot of excitement and drama. <br /> <br /> The action in Dead Line was better than you would expect from a micro budget horror flick. The characters were credible <br /> <br /> The movie is really exciting and quite scary in moments, so it gets you to grab your place for the end of the credits. <br /> <br /> Due to its production values ​​(the sound is not very good for example) 8/10.
