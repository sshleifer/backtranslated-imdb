imagine "24" totally uncensored, given free license to explain the situation in details necessary and show how and why both protagonists do what they do to kill / prevent and you have an idea of ​​how good this tv series is. People in the United States have long known that Showtime is the new HBO, they do much better cutting edge, powerful shows, and that is no exception. The show takes the viewer all the way through the creation of a sleeping cell when an attack is attempted, taking important facets such as faith, religion, finance, means and needs. To the uninitiated there is much to learn about the Muslim faith here. Unlike regular shows such as "24", where the terrorists are only keys that the good people shoot, their purpose and mindset are fully investigated. What gives the show more credibility is the latest technology used by the cell / FBI and authentic shots in Europe, the United States and the Middle East, it is not sparse to tell the story accurately. Cast is relatively unknown, but the action is fantastic with the help of a tightly written script that constantly keeps the viewer on the edge with many unexpected phrases. This show does not have the credit it deserves, and ironically it is a bit of a sleeper who is hit by himself, to look for anyone interested in this genre
