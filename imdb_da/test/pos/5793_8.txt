There was a lot about Little Vera that was strange to me. All in all, I enjoyed this movie, but much of the way the characters behaved was not what I was used to. For example, the environment in which Vera's family lived was very tense. Almost every time the family was together, they drank, fought or shouted and it was often a combination of the three. After I watched the movie, I felt tense because of the whole confrontation that took place during it. However, I was very interested in seeing the story of this middle class Russian family. Throughout the film, we are reminded of the industrialized state of Russia because of the repeated shots of a train past the screen. It gave the viewer a sense of a mechanically lived life. The characters seemed to be focused on living their lives through work and drinking after work. There wasn't a feeling of happiness throughout the movie. The only time a sign didn't shout was when Vera fell in love with her fiance Sergei. This was very short-lived because the viewer later discovers (after Sergei locks Vera's father in a bathroom and Vera lets him out, after which the father continues to stab Sergei) that he is abusive. Another time, Vera is told that the only reason she was born was that the family could get a bigger apartment. It is very interesting to see how both Vera and the family were able to cope with each other's behavior. The film was definitely worth seeing because of its depiction of how life could be in areas of Russia.
