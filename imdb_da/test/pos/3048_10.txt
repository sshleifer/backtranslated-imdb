All I can say is that every time I see CONRACK, dir. Martin Ritt, DP. John Alonzo, I feel an extremely sense of inspiration and information about what the cinema's power is possible in such a simple movie. <br /> <br /> The motion picture Conrack is set in 1969. It is based on a true story. It's a story of a white man (Jon Voight) who teaches a group of young black children where the incredible world is outside their little South Carolina island. History places a teacher's job as a noble cause of changing children's lives. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
