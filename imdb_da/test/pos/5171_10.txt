It was good to see John Denver again, even though he went several years ago. I found this movie to be very cordial and a good movie to sit at the fire on a cold winter evening reminiscent of what Christmas is about. The scenes in Georgetown, Colorado were magnificent and made one move there immediately. When I sit here in my own mountain, seen in California, I loved the story and the plot. I hope everyone who sees this slightly older movie enjoys it as much as my mother and I did. Merry Christmas! A great movie for the whole family also see. Enoy and tell others about it. Thanks for the memories. We need more movies like this coming out of Hollywood.
