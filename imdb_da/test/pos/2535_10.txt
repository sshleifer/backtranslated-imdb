The movie opens with the director talking to the camera and says he will show a story about Brazilain street kids whose families live in poverty and have to steal and kill to survive. In fact, the protagonist (Pixote) was played by a real street kid just 11 years old. The following was one of the most brutal, depressing and horrible movies I have ever seen. I saw it about 17 years ago (on a double bill with "Black Orpheus") and never forgot it. I don't think I'll ever see it again - it was just too much. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD !!!! The scene that won't leave me is when Pixote meets a prostitute who has to interrupt her own fetus. You can't see her doing it ... but you get a quick look at what she came out. It's almost 20 years later, and just to remind you that the scene is disturbing me. SPOILER END !!!!! <br /> <br /> The movie becomes more brutal as it merges and ends the only way it can. What's more terrible are stories like this really happened in Brazil in 1981 ... and still happen today. <br /> <br /> A harrowing brutal movie ... but it should be seen if you can handle it. I'm surprised I got an R rating - I've seen X-rated movies that are less graphic. A 10.
