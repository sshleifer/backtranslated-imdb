I don't know why all the critics say this was a bad movie, this is one of my all-time favorite movies. Tommy (Chris Farley) and Richard (David Spade) are a fantastic match. Tommy is the stupid one who spent seven years in college, finally passing with a D +. Richard is the smart kid who was hated by everyone in school. How can you not laugh when the two sing "Superstar" of The Carpenter's passionate and sudden jumping hood up? In all this is a fantastic movie, I recommend it.
