Not sure why the other comment on this movie was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a special love for Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life. Jang Seung-up is one of the (perhaps most) famous Korean artists and continues to be honored as a master. Considering the turmoil of the time when he painted and his own conflict, it is amazing that he produced so much work in so many styles and with such skill. This film honors his talent as he takes a direct look at his erratic and self-destructive personality. The cinematography in my opinion was beautiful, many of the outdoor panoramic images resembled Korean landscape paintings (which I found a nice feeling rather than "too artificial") and I think Choi Min-sik portrayed Jang Seun-up with a necessary intensity and unpredictability. I would highly recommend this movie to art lovers and movie lovers alike.
