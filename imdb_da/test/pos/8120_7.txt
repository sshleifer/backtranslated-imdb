It was a fun movie to watch. Although the chance of this happening in your street is small, there are still very unrecognizable situations that will call a bell. The simplicity of the film and humor DO work. I must admit that you do not have to watch it in a theater; It will do very well on a small TV set. Tip: See it with some close friends.
