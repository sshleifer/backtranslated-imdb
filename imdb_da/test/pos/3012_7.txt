In spite of everything, it's styles and cinematic inventions, it's basically another serial killer thriller that follows the same kind of plotline favored by such old favorites as Silence of the Lambs? the police team follows the track of (particularly unpleasant) murders, another is taken and somehow they need to find out where they are before it is too late. Only in this case is the only one who knows, the killer himself (heavily played by Vincent D'Onofrio) in a coma, and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez's sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell everything. This is where the movie becomes brand new and different as we enter (via a 21st century CGI update by Dr. Who is Kaleidoscopic favorite, the trendy time tunnel) a kind of Hellraiser-y strange world of scary crazy things going on everywhere, crashed over by D'Onofrio, now a kind of superking chief of his winding mental world, inside his comatose body. The inner minds are well-realized and often pretty amazing, all the leaders work enough, the unworthiness is to the maximum if you like that kind of thing, but the hype around it all led to a disappointment to me as I had expected something brand new and in Unlike anything that had ever been done before, this rather successful blend of serial killer and special-effect horror genre staples. Sometimes horrible, often beautiful, a rather gripping story told with care and attention by talented filmmakers, but by no means is the big leap in the unknown it has been marketed as.
