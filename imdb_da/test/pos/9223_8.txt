I first saw this movie when I was very small. I was born in 1985, so it was around the age when the 80s comics were great. My mom lost it one day and thought I liked it. I had never even heard of Rainbow Bright TV show before I was introduced to the movie. When I saw it (on one of the old BETA tapes ...) I loved it. I became addicted to it. There are people who say it is poorly written and all that is, but it is a child's movie, and so it is not much for children. I loved the story and especially loved the songs and all the female characters. Of course I let myself be them, and in the scene where Rainbow first met Krys and they were rejected, they had to work with the opposite sex, I could totally relate. The story was basically good against evil, which the children enjoy, and there were enough happy moments to balance the scary. The world is a great place that will stimulate every child's imagination. I am very happy that I had the opportunity to watch this movie when I was a kid. It made a great impact, and seeing it now brings happy memories of childhood back. I would recommend to any parent with small children to rent this movie. It will trigger their imagination and provide plenty of entertainment. You are only a child once, so don't miss them!
