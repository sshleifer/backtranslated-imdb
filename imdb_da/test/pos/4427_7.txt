Video Vault By Shawn K. Inlow My Architect: A Son's Journey 2003 - Nathaniel Kahn Not Rated: 116minutes Vault Rating: 7 <br /> <br /> What One Thing To Be Dangerous. "My Architect: A Son's Journey" follows the film industry Philadelphia Nathaniel Kahn when he desperately seeks answers from his father, the famous architect Louis I Kahn, who died 30 years. Louis Kahn died in a train station in 1974 and left more than one family. The funeral service, since the filmmaker was just a boy, we should say an unpleasant surprise. We find that Nathaniel only knew his father and passover, from his occasional visit with his mother, who we are told, he loved deeply. This film is about a boy seeking his father and perhaps even visiting his work as if the magnificent structures are keeping something secret. <br /> <br /> For sure, Louis Kahn was a gifted architect, but "architect" is a cold word. The man was a magnificent sculptor who spoke of his craft in the air of silence and art. Among his remarkable works, lovingly explored in the film, is the Salk Institute (1965), The Kimball Art Museum (1972) and the monumental capital complex in Bangladesh (1983). The part of the movie where Nathaniel first visits Dhaka, Bangladesh, finds the work, but not the man. <br /> <br /> The movie benefits greatly from having a lot of pictures of the very public man working in New York City and as a professor at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania. Many of Khan's contemporaries and business partners also help throw out the filmmaker's ghost father. <br /> <br /> Even so, the viewer doesn't seem to come to a particularly satisfying place. The answers Nathaniel Khan is looking for seem hollow. Not good enough. In scenes where the director meets with his half-sisters, both from different mothers, one can feel the tensions of the years, the lamps and the evil. You can expect them to be angry, but only the camera saves them from hostilities. Each of these children has visibly lost something. It can be pointed out that Khan, who seemed a driven perfectionist, never became rich. Instead, he became remarkable. It was as if he sacrificed his family to his art. This is a crushingly sad and good thing. <br /> <br /> April 28, 2005
