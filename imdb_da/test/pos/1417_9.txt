Stephen Hawkings is a genius. He is the king of the genius. By watching this movie, I feel stupid. But it's a good movie. Not very entertaining, but very very exciting. The film centers on the wheelchair bound Stephen Hawkings, a man who makes Einstein average, and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, galaxy and black holes. Everyone in one time or another during a really intense high comes a moment when they think they have figured out the universe and cosmos and they swear as soon as they enjoy, they will write it all down. Well here is a man who actually had that feeling for more than six hours. Here is a man who, despite suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, has become the greatest mind the world has not yet seen. See this and listen to how he has formulated black hole theories. Fantastic. You won't be the same when you see it.
