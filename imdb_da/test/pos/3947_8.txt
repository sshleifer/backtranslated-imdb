the scary coat is about bendict arnold betrayed his country, but he is really not in the movie too much the main focus is on big boulton (cornell wilde) and major andre (micheal wilding) wilding steals the film as officer and gentlemen also as a friend to Boulton. When Boulton tries to uncover who is gustavus, the man leaps that British is willing. Wilde has to deal with the British, the suspect dr. Dell (George Sanders) who looks at his every move and loves love. Anne Francis, this is a very entertaining movie
