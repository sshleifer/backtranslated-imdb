This show has everything you ever want from a prison drama. There are twists and turns all the way to the season finally. The characters are very strong and it gives the show a lot of power. When you look at the show, you do not only feel the prisoners, but the prison staff. The actors playing prisoners at this show have done a very good job showing a prisoner. Also if you like law and order sweat or law and order criminal intention, there are many actors from this show that appear in these shows. The only problem with Oz is that it wasn't long enough. This show could easily have had nine to ten seasons without getting old. Even after the season finals, I find myself watching Oz all the time on DVD. This show is easily one of the best shows on television. Don't be a fool, go and see Oz.
