Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security company owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble because the owner is unknown, he has an employee selling secrets to a rival company owner (Jim Bacchus). It is not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, partly because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has one thing for Brian and Norton, asking Brian's motives to wake her up. But Brian comes with a great safety device. It's called CHOMPS, which stands for the safety of the canine teeth. The device that looks like a dog is actually a computer-controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and emit siren sounds to capture thefts. The rival owner sends two dangling spies (one is Red Buttons) to learn the details of the new invention. Will CHOMPS save Norton security? This is a fun family flick from the old school of good, clean entertainment. Of course, CHOMPS is a real dog played by the lovely and talented Benji. In fact, Benji has a duel role as Brian also has a "real" dog called Rascal. Just watching this little dog in action is pure joy as he is able to scale walls, "pull" trucks and operate machine buttons to capture the evil ones. The human body is also pretty nice, where everyone gives positive performance that is contagious. Costumes, scenery and production values ​​are also good. Although you may have trouble finding the movie, it would be worth trying to get a view for your loved ones. CHOMPS is a wonderful, healthy diversion from the world's impurities.
