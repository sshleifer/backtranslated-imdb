Of all the seasons and the episodes of the TWILIGHT ZONE, having seen all the great, insane, thought-provoking stories, this one is at the top. It is true. This story, the one called THE HUNT, tops the vast number of the finest scripts in Television History. True, there are no interplanetary space flights, no unexplained cracks in time. There is no live nightmare, no sudden change in setting. There is apparently nothing unusual for our protagonist to handle. The main character played by veteran character actor Arthur Hunnicut sets out from his hut in the hills accompanied by his faithful dog to hunt raccoons. Because raccoons are a predominantly nocturnal animal hunt, it is by moonlight. The man and the dog soon meet a large raccoon that jumps on the dog's back and tries to drown the dog in a pond. The man jumps in to help his dog. There is some sort of almost black-out, after which the couple is seen on the coast, in a lie, almost asleep as a position. <br /> <br /> Calling his dog by name, (Rip, I think) The old man sits down to return home. When he arrives, he finds the wife crying and responding to his conversation. He also observes visitors who come and go to his house, pay respect and give words to console his wife. <br /> <br /> Still seemingly astonished at the strange reception and excursions around Home Cabin, Man and Rip take a long walk down the road, noticing he couldn't remember such a long fence in these share. He eventually arrives at a rather large guy, dressed in clothes like overalls, hat, work clothes. They are at a gate leading to an area where there is a lot of smoke rising. The Gate Keeper is too eager at his convincing pitch to get the man to enter. Rip sounds dissatisfaction. The Gate Man tells the Old Man that he can come in, but the dog must remain outside and bid to see the beast for him. The man will not have any of it, and the two will continue down the path. After a little more walking, they come to another gated entrance, where Gate Keeper recognizes the man and welcomes him. When the old man reports what has happened on the road, he tells how the guy at the other gate was trying to separate Man and Dog and added, "With no dogs allowed it must be a hell of a place!" 2. Gate Keeper stated he was right! "That's exactly what it is!" <br /> <br /> Our family had lost our first dog, Lady-Mixed Lab, in October 1981. About 6 months later, lucky enough to have it, the wife (Deanna) and myself with our 2 daughters (Jennifer 9 and Michelle 6) watched this episode on television, WGN TV, Channel 9 Chicago. Well, it all made perfect sense at the time. <br /> <br /> We are confident that anyone who has had a relationship with a family dog ​​would agree. The section still provides a state of watery eyes to this now 60-year-old author.
