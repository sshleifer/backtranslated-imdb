Having just watched Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on Saturday morning blog as the link from YouTube, I used the same sources to watch a remake made in Technicolor for the Columbia comic book and animated by the same man-Ub Iwerks. The colors compared to the previous black and white are used really imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeleton band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another off or when dancing with the other with part of the other away - is as fun as the previous card. It gets a little repetitive at the end. The Frolics skeleton is still worth seeing for any animation buff that wants to compare this to the former Silly Symphony.
