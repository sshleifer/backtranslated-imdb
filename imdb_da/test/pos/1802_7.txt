I'm glad Cage changed his name from Coppolla and got this part alone. Light heart, no deep thinking necessary, but a sweet piece of contradictions attracts - even though her parents are still hippies ... Captures the early 80s voice - the valley of the valley and funk on the other. You can see the beginning of Cage's talent.
