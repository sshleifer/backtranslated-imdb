I just watched "A Tale of Two Sisters" last night and really enjoyed it. I've been a big fan of Asian horror movies recently and think this is a strong entry from South Korea. There aren't many jumps on you scares like in the usual American horror movie, but the director maintains the off-kilter and foreboding mood very well, especially in the awkward character interactions with each other. Most of the scary ones are more conceptual and play on everyone's "there is something under the bed" fear when they were a child, but in this case it is the closet and the sink. I also liked how the director was able to intercept how dysfunctional this house is through scenes like the first dinner the characters have together. He is also good at revealing people's inner life and fragility through simple scenes like the founder wipes her makeup in the mirror or her sitting in front of the flickering television. I think this movie is primarily an exploration of the guilt and consequences of living with the guilt that is over you. <br /> <br /> RIGHT SPOILERS AED (DO NOT READ ANYTHING further, if you don't want to know the doubts in the movie.) I followed the story quite well, but began to get confused under the bag that pulled. But I think the feedback at the end certainly tied everything together. The movie is much like "The Machinist" in the way that two of the common sense of the character ultimately lead to mental breakdown and delusions. <br /> <br /> Here's my interpretation of the movie. Su-Yeon, whom we see after the girls are supposed to return to the house, is either the delusion of Su-Mi or Su-Yeon's actual ghost, which only Su-Mi can see and interact with. The first founder we see is, in my opinion, a delusion of Su-Mi. However, there is a real grandmother, and she comes first in the movie when she has the gray trouser suit. I think it's the right stepmother that Dad talks to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie, and she doesn't appear until he picks her up and brings her to the house. The stepmother before this point is depicted by Su-Mi (perhaps part of her split personality?) It explains the bizarre dinner sequence when the staple brother sees her as crazy and can't remember anything she tells. I think it was Su-Mi who appeared in his divorced part of his split personality. The film shows it later in the bag that pulls the stage and scenes that the founder dries her makeup in the mirror, which is later revealed to be Su-Mi, who wipes her makeup in the mirror. <br /> <br /> I think the ghosts in the house are not entirely imagined by Su-Mi and are either by Su-Yeon or the mother or both. In the last recall, it is revealed that Su-Yeon had the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress they previously showed on the ghost sitting at the dining table while the pin looked under the sink. It is also the hairpin that Su-Yeon wore in the feedback that appears on the floor when the founder looks under the sink. <br /> <br /> The real founder is ultimately punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon coming to a scene like The Ring. Then the flashback scene coincides with how both the founder was primarily responsible for her death, while Su-Mi accidentally played a supportive role. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the "mother" Su-Yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry, in the flashback is a ghost already. Maybe the mother had already killed herself in the closet. It is ambiguous. Other things suggested, but not clearly explained in the film, are that at one time it appears that the mother-in-law was a nurse, perhaps taking care of the mother and perhaps contributing to her death. It is not clear when her relationship with the father began, and whether it caused her mother to kill herself. It has also been suggested that the mother also had mental problems that require a nurse. Stifemor refers to this when she tells Su-Mi you are starting to look after your mother. I don't think she meant just physical. <br /> <br /> Also, if we accept that the first founder we see is actually Su-Mi, then there are also suggestions for incest when the father sleeps with her. Is that why Su-Mi rages and shouts: "Don't touch me" every time the father reaches her in later stages? Is it the "dirty thing you've done" that she refers to in a later conversation with her father? This film is interesting in its ability to different interpretations. However, some of the scenes were kind of derivative, such as The woman in the black crawling around the scene reminded me of Kayak's heraldic movements in the Ju-On / The Grudge films. Finally, the last scene reminiscent of her founder remembers the Ring. In addition, it is only the idea that some characters may be ghosts, taken from "The Sixth Sense" or "The Others". I enjoyed it in general and it will be interesting to see how Hollywood remake (it is already in production) turns out. I have to be honest, I liked both "The Ring" and "The Grudge", so I'm not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can't be good too. A remake that I'm really excited about is "Dark Water" coming out this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet, but both movies are definitely on my list.
