I had the opportunity to capture this independent movie and was impressed by it, despite the lack of excitement in the plot. The action was very good by everyone involved. Amy Madigan played part of a guilty mother who is tired, yet well-informed and determined to make up for her younger daughter's condition. But in the process, she has neglected her older sister, who is more interested in playing with her savant syndrome siblings and living in a world of escapism. The men in the film are very powerful in their secondary roles. Christopher Lloyd, in a very discreet role, shows us why he has such versatility. He plays a teacher dedicated to his profession and literature research, but starved for a meaningful relationship. He and Madigan connect very well in their scenes together, but both know nothing else coming from their friendship. Their wordless farewell is nothing short of brilliant, a play for aspiring artists. <br /> <br /> And in a small role, Fred Savage is fun to see. <br /> <br /> You can tell why this movie was based on a game, it's probably very good on stage. On the screen, it is not very exciting, but it is nevertheless very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties.
