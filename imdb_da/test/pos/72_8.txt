Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth seeing and it's not bad! In fact, it is quite entertaining. In fact, it is a fascinating study of trying to manipulate a star's persona. To break Julie's "goody two shoes mold" she plays a German spy / English musical actress. She then proceeded to take her into the movie S.O.B. and play a dragon queen in Victor Victoria and other not so good girls usually under the direction of her hubby Blake Edward. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, the film is problematic. It's hard to feel for her character because she is a German spy. We want to love Julie, but she's on the wrong side of the law. Probably that's why this movie flopped. Julie as a German spy? Our Mary Poppins? our Maria Van Trapp suddenly a German spy? The romance seems to happen overnight and comes from nowhere. But it's not something it's a musical, and you guys have. Oh, and I mention the hunky rock Hudson is also in it? Julie gives a glowing wonderful achievement that any musical comedy puff should not be missed. Great WW 1 songs and fine tunes of Mancini. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie has plot holes and sometimes it doesn't seem logical. Why is Julie and her uncle suddenly persecuted by the Germans when she spied for them a moment ago. <br /> <br /> But on another note, who cares? The musical songs are fun and exciting. Costumes and landscapes extraordinarily lavish. The kinematics are completely on the ground. <br /> <br /> It has the annoying idiot detectives that Blake Edwards puts in all his movies. (Yawn) <br /> <br /> But that's Julie - desperately trying to change her image. (You can imagine dinner with Blake and Julie - Julie: "Blake we need to change my picture." <br /> <br /> Blake: "I want to make you a German spy, so we take off the clothes in another movie and then play a transvestite in another movie.They will not recognize you.It will be Maria Von Trapp's death "<br /> <br /> Fascinating study of changing a picture. Wonderful Julie. A must see for musical comedy buffs Much more entertaining than Star!
