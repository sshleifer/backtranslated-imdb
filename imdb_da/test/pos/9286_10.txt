If I was only allowed to watch a program throughout my life, I would definitely have to choose "The Chaser's War on Everything". Of all the satirical shows that have been on Australian television, I found "Chaser" to be the funniest of all. It's just so amazing, the boys aren't afraid to do anything. <br /> <br /> Whether it's dressed as Hitler to enter a Polish club or push a massive ball of string around Melbourne to try out the tourism ad or rock up to the Coke factory naked in a $ 2 bath , 40 to buy some water. Chaser boys will go there. <br /> <br /> In accordance with the comments above (and / or below) "Chaser's War on Everything" is more popular than their previous program "CNNNN". But CNNNN was just as much fun. Some unforgettable moments from the show ... Clear up Cambodia !!! Classic. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, to further stop me from Ranting, I strongly advise you at least to give Chaser a chance you will more than likely find it HILARIOUS !!!!
