In Luchino Visconti's film Death in Venice, not only is the beauty of the surrounding world falling, but in the pursuit of beauty Gustav von Aschenbach falls to a single shell of a man. To understand the decay, we must acknowledge the beauty that fights us, best described and explained in a quote from Socrates found in Thomas Mann's version of Death in Venice, "beauty alone is lovely and visible at once? the only aspect of the spiritual that we can perceive through our senses? Else what? If the divine whose reason and virtue and truth were to speak to us through the senses, shall we not perish and be consumed by love? " A lot of things happen, the man is enveloped by a longing for beauty, which becomes a yearning for the boy, Tadzio. Although the planned part of his mind tells him that worship of beauty can lead to sensuousness and abandonment, he cannot contain himself. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to describe this as a beautiful movie; We see early on the extravagance of the extermination, and we are treated to a perfect summary of the century's top-class life, all of which are recorded on film perfect by film photographer Pasqualino De Santis. But Visconti does not spoil the picturesque aspects of Venice. Instead, the glorious and sensual past of the past is based on materialism and sensual beauty, and these things are referred to the past. The city, which we know of as incomparable beauty and uniqueness, is nothing more than a recreational resort with a curious hotel staff. The streets become exhausting mazes filled with disgusting dirt and rotting, the city falling in line with the main character. Only through flashbacks do we get a glimpse of why this famous composer is a fragile and harmless man. The daughter of his daughter, and probably his wife, along with his music error, allows us to understand why he is destroying himself. <br /> <br /> Alfred, with whom Aschenbach has profound conversations about the importance of beauty and who can create it; but Alfred is more than a friend, he is Aschenbach's alter ego, and what Alfred says articulates the composer's own doubts and fears. The scene where Aschenbach decides to leave Venice is immediately followed by a clip of Alfred telling him that he is weak, alienated and lacking in emotion. Finally, we may conclude that these flashbacks are not at all real. It's a memory of memory, rather than objective rendering of the past, these flashbacks become distorted memories. We can say that these are past due memories because even Aschenbach refers to it, he declares, "reality distracts and breaks us" and after the stage in the travel agency we see Aschenbach confronting Tadzio and his family and warning them - leaving Venice, but right after The meeting we see him sitting with the clerk again and realizing it was all in his imagination, he uses long scenes without dialogue, which is framed by Gustav Mahler's breathtaking music. He gives the viewer a mind to wander when we see Aschenbach's life and respectable decay with the beauty around him. <br /> <br /> Slowly, the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by exhaustion mixed with a growing awareness that the city is stifling in dirt. The crumbling city sets the stage for the middle-aged man's attraction to Tadzio, it is romantic longing for something so idealized and ambiguous that it can never be consumed, even in imagination. This Polish boy's beauty burns a fire in him that initially makes him glow and consume him. The film concludes with von Aschenbach, who sits flawlessly in a beach chair that sees Tadzio fight with his friend, we see the black dye from his hair running down on his cheek and it looks like the mess of blood, it is a vision of the life of his life moments, even before his last breath. The final decay has happened, around him the city is dirty, and with that he has become what he rejects. As Aschenbach dies, he has the same painted face as the old one on the ferry at the start of the movie, a man who had disturbed him. It was the pursuit of beauty that began his decay, in the pursuit of artistic beauty he could not feel his own death and the city's about him; His sensuality is indulged in while being kept in control at all times by the presence of death and decay. These are the three themes that link The Damned and Death in Venice together, beauty, death, and decay, these themes are Art of Contemporary Art, the beauty of his work is in the decay of beauty itself. <br /> <br /> In this movie we are treated to deliquescence by a great man. We see the honorable composer Gustav von Aschenbach in the pursuit of true and pure beauty, and it is in the pursuit of this trait that it falls around him and leads him to a miserable lonely death that sees the goals of his love . I think through these movies Visconti is trying to tell us that what is beautiful cannot last. Decay is inherent in the world around us, and when we become distracted, it can ruin splendor. In death in Venice it is because of culture and through the pursuit of beauty that everything is erased. Beauty and deliquescence are woven together as thorns in Visconti's works, instantly beautiful and destructive, these are the themes that define his art.
