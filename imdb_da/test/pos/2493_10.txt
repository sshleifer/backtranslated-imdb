You can't see a movie like Peter Watkins' "Privilege", a story about the exploitation of a pop music business by the big business, the state, and even organized religion without thinking of creatively degenerate raw materials like Michael Jackson or Britney Spears, who hawk corporate giants like Pepsi or any other poison for money. Or any number of entertainers, in music or movies, who become tools for political parties or commercial religious interests such as Scientology and Kabbalah. A movie like Privilege must have seemed almost like science fiction when it was released in 1967, so amazing was its premise. Today, we tend to take celebrity declarations for granted and give some thought to its more alarming consequences. Watkins vision has not only become a reality, we implicitly accept this reality as "normal". Now consider Punishment Park. As Privilege challenges the viewer to investigate what is being sold to us, and why Punishment Park requires that we reckon with what is taken from us and why. <br /> <br /> Heaven helps America, and it also means the world if contemporary politicians get their hands on this movie. It is already so close to reality that, by seeing it recently, I experienced a real, nauseating sense of anxiety. <br /> <br /> Again, Watkins skillfully uses a documentary narrative. While in Privilege some rough edges to this technique were evident, in Punishment Park it has been turned into sharp, seamless perfection. Realism is reinforced by disarmed unpretentious, economical, credible depictions of the whole cast. This is the kind of spectacle Hollywood has completely turned its back on, to the detriment of cosmetically perfect projections. The cast has first class material to work with in the Watkins manuscript. <br /> <br /> Many cinematic visionaries have tried to shake the viewer out of their complacent, false sense of security. No one has ever achieved this result with as hard and chilling accuracy as Peter Watkins does here. <br /> <br /> "What seems clear now is, instead of trying to bring the strangers and excluded Americans like these people back into the national community, the administration has chosen to accept and exploit the current division within Instead of the reconciliation policy, it has chosen the policy of polarization. "<br /> <br /> In order to rewrite one of the characters, we do not need to call them pigs because they know what they are. Better than we do.
