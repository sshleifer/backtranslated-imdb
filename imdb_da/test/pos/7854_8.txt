Probably this is Clint Eastwood's best movie. Here, the action is minimal, but with lots of good actors. A Yankee soldier Eastwood is wounded and taken by female students and teachers in a school in the south, where he is hidden and taken care of. Shortly after his recovery, all ladies wanted to have fun with him, and some of them succeeded, including the school's instructor (Geraldine Page). Erotic scenes coming to the ladies discovered that their "macho" was shared by several of them, so they became angry and poisoned him in farewell dinner. Geraldine Page, although somewhat old, was able to play a very suggestive role as the school's instructor, a woman with more errors than happiness in her life.
