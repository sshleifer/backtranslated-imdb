Read a biography of late George C. Scott and you will discover why he was such a huge talent. He was asked by an interviewer what his secret was when he made each character he played his own. Scott replied he had inside him a burning fire that drove him. In one of his last interviewers, he unfortunately showed that he had lost the drive. That was not the case when he starred in the movie "The Hospital." In this offer he plays talented doctor Bock, medical director of one of the finest hospitals in the country. However, life has treated him with some amazing problems, such as losing his wife to a divorce, being alienated from both his promising children and worse by everyone, believing he was physically impotent. At this time, he is now becoming complacent, morose and often fantasizing various ways of committing suicide. To add to his growing list of personal obstacles, his main reason for being, his hospital has been under siege by students and neighborhood protesters, incompetent doctors such as Dr. Welbeck (Richard Dysart) and a mysterious MD. who kills both patients and doctors because he believes he is "the lame of the lame". (Barnard Hughes). Few choices are back to Bock. One is promising Dr. Brubaker (Robert Walden), whom he trusts by saying, "If there was an oven around here, I would put my head in it." The other is a lovely young woman named Barbara, who is attracted to Bock because he seems like a wounded bear. Paddy Chayefsky wrote the play, and Arthur Hiller did a very good job managing this dramatically interesting, dark story, but a vehicle still lit by the fire of George C. Scott. ****
