I saw what I mean to be the best Australian movie this year so far, Jon Hewitts Acolytes. <br /> <br /> Acolytes is a stylish thriller with a killer preference. Getting this two bullied and infected teens discovers a local serial killer in their suburbs and then discourages him from killing the bullet that smuggled them. Hewitt has chosen a top notch cast including excellent new comers Sebastian Gregory, Joshua Payne and Hanna Mangan Lawrence to play teens. Add to that three, yes, it's really three big psychos! Led by Joel Edgerton in an excellent performance of serial killer, Belinda McClory his dreadful spouse and Michael Dorman as the teenager fierce bully, with swastika tattoos. When you add these teens and these threatening adults, hell breaks loose? Hewitt has made a ball for the wall serial thriller, which is amazingly original and achieved. You can see the influence of Larry Clark and David Lynch's Twin Peaks, but Hewitt does it all his own, in a Qld suburban backwater that always rings with the drones of emptiness. The script by Shayne Armstong, Shane Krouse and Hewitt is tight. <br /> <br /> If marketed properly, this movie can be a break out hit with teens. The next Wolf Creek? It could be. It does all the right movements. The teen is real ala Larry Clark. They do not suck and have an attached PC agenda, they are not communicative, attractive and hip. The murderers are dark with real threat. Joel Edgerton steals his scenes as the gentle wayward local Ted Bundy who cultivates a butterfly on his 4WD reserve ala John Fowles The Collector. Dorman's petrol robbers embark on the threat that tears suburban Mayhem and gives an eerie gang that you can't wait to see buying the farm. <br /> <br /> The movie is fast, hard and brutal. Not only that, it shows a self-confidence and directorial mastery from Hewitt, who will surely win him an IF or AFI nomination, if not award! Its nuanced and poetic mise scene, brilliant sound design, excellent filmography and tight structure clearly mark it one of the best-tuned Oz features I've seen so far this year. <br /> <br /> The movie leaves you shaken, thinking and disturbed. It's a really great version for the resumption of genre at Australian cinema at this time. It will certainly outweigh Hollywood's interest. Oh, and I mention that it came into Toronto? What other Oz feature films can say so much? The world must get ready for a new author, Jon Hewitt.
