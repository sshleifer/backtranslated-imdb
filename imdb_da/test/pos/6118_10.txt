I loved this thing. The most wonderful thing about Pink Flamingos is that it desperately strives to be in terrible taste, but has really got a cult after the world. Saying a lot about us (we are people) do not. Pink Flamingos succeeds because Waters made the movie he wanted to make. A movie doesn't have to be disgusting to succeed, but it can be. When you watch this movie, you see things that are obnoxious, but are ultimately brilliant because they appear freely. What we have here is an honest piece of personal creative expression. Anyone who ever cares to succeed as an artist, whether in film or other media, should watch this movie.
