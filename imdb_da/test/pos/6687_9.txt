Usually I don't like movies with / about foreigners, but K-PAX is different. The actors are great in the movie - especially Kevin Spacey played his character amazingly! The movie never falls to a lower level - the excitement is always in the movie and you will definitely know how it ends, what is it about Prot ... You have to think a lot about the movie over the movie because there are a few open questions. .. Is Robert Porter Prot or Prot only by using Robert Porter's body as a means of transport. How can he see uv light and how can he know so much about astrology. But everyone can make their own end and can decide what he wants to believe in. Very good movie with an excellent Kevin Spacey!
