Told in flashback, the film opens in 1989 with Charlie being praised for his role in the defeat of communism. I have to admit that my heart sank as if the thought of having to endure another serious, slightly boring and prolonged life story. How wrong I was, because the short scene is as close as the movie ever gets boring. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of entertaining and fun setups and cracking dialogs in some of the most unexpected places. The next scene after the awards ceremony is Charlie in a Hot Tub with some naked women and a guy trying to get him to invest in a TV show. Another pretty entertaining scene is about 3 quarters in the movie consisting of Charlie, a group of his pretty sexy secretaries, Phillip Seymour Hoffman's CIA Man and a bottle of whiskey. As for dialogue, what about this for a line, "The Senator says he can teach us to write, but cannot teach us to grow breasts." Okay, School boyish I know, but the movie is twisted with beautiful lines. Phillip Seymour Hoffman always steals the usual scenes he is in. Hanks is OK, but surprisingly I was nevertheless Julia Roberts who is very good in the role of a rather eccentric Texas Oil Millionaires. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's war is one of the best non-musical biographies for a long time, and being the rare thing a movie entertaining, amusing and enlightening all equal amounts.
