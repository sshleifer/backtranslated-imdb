OKAY. A warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian. Beware of who you see this movie with - ie. - Don't take children to watch this movie. I will explain why. <br /> <br /> 1 - The title is misleading and the movie has nothing to do with romance - I suppose this was intentionally on behalf of the manufacturer but is annoying 2 - the movie itself is really very disturbing. I have some problems - first is the fact that the film is neither violent nor sexual and therefore not a "horror movie". But it is a very disturbing movie and involves a child and his parents and a small town. OK, it boils down to this. The movie is not suitable for minors because it contains sequences and images that are disturbing and would be confusing to a child. It's got a bizarre quality for it, and that's only because it has a child in it that makes me feel unsuitable. As a parent myself, I feel strong enough to tell people, because I only read the second day that it has a publication in theaters. I hope I do not offend the filmmakers by saying this, but I think it is my right because it becomes a release and only has an M rating (because it is not violent or sexual). Just odd and disturbing, but pretty good in itself.
