Bergman's permanent Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann star as a village village, Jan and Eva Rosenberg. The story began with an ordinary couple struggling and makeup. Jan was a sensitive person, but an escapist who isolated himself from the world. Eva is a practical woman who gets tired of her husband's lack of ambition. Because Jan is hinting at fixing their radio, they are ignorant of the impending war. Of course, the war arrived and the film was a fascinating study of their transformation of each other and into each other through the invasion as they were abused by the enemy and by their own government. <br /> <br /> There was no musical score for the movie, but the soundtrack was war noise. In one scene, the vibrant background weapon shot, the explosion and the sound of the aircraft with the planes was incredible. Bergman occasionally zoomed in the facial expression, as different events took place. When something violently happened, he zoomed out to let the audience feel the violence rather than look close. Very well finished film.
