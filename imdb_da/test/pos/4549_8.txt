This movie is fun. Laughter never stops. Each scene is packed to the limit of hilarious comedy. Chris Farley is a comic genius, and Spade plays his character to a tee. Farley was one of the best slap stick comics ever, and in this movie (as with all his films) we see how much time and energy he dedicated to portraying his character as he so appropriately. "Tommy Boy" is an excellent example of a comedy, it always makes me laugh, no matter how many times I've seen it before.
