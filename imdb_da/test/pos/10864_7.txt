Labeling this movie a "lesbian love story" is as accurate as calling Pride & Prejudice a "straight love story". Yes, the protagonist is lesbian, but her story is classic educational novel, a journey from childhood to adulthood, from sexual innocence to maturity, from personal blindness. for self-discovery. There is a stylistic element of camp to the direction of the film, but it is not an obstacle; rather, it serves to emphasize the staged and dramatic parts of the main character's life. <br /> <br /> Those who know Anna chancellor from the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice will surely be amazed at her here. Rachael Stirling is the star as the protagonist Nan, and Keeley Hawes is all-witty goodness like her boyfriend Kitty Butler. Chancellor may have played a role, except for Sally Hawkins who plays Zena Butler. This movie is not too weak of the heart, but it is also no pro-gay advertising. It's a real story, with real comedy and drama, an engaging story of convincing characters, and it's worth seeing.
