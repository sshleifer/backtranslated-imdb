I just watched this movie at the phoenix film festival today and loved it. Synopsis was listed in our program as "an old shakespeare actor inviting his three children to his suicide party". I was not sure if I should see it because when I read about it, I liked the idea of ​​a "suicide party" that sounded very interesting to me, but "old shakespeare actor" worried me that the movie would be kind of dry and boring. But I decided to try it. I'm glad I did. It was not dry and boring at least, the dialogue was great, fun in a smart way, but not pretentious and difficult to understand. Peter Falk was amazing in this role, he stole the show. I was also pleasantly surprised by Laura San Giacomo's performance, she usually cares for me, but I much enjoyed watching her in this movie a lot. I think Judge Reinhold's part could have been better done by another actor, at times he seemed like cheesy, and it looked like acting, not as if you were just looking at that character. But the movie was so good that I was able to forgive an actress's awkwardness. I would recommend this movie to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as it is available to the public. Who knew suicide could be so much fun?
