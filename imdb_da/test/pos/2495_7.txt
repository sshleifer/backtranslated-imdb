It is along the line of comedy of error, erroneous devotion that transfers from one to the other, flourishes and passes on ?? little cat and mouse situations ?? Flares of passion, sparks of sparks braided and knocked out and maybe she loves, he loves or they love ?? Circle of emotions, development, release hides, yet does not hide? Want to let him know, would like to let her know so let them know ?? Good ensemble cast in spite of the seemingly confusing mix of emotions from different parties involved. <br /> <br /> It's a refreshing charm, relaxed, free and easy, and down to earth - not Hollywood glamorous as "Notting Hill," but lots of human emotions, weakness, a-flowing vulnerability. Yes, everyone is about an accident (lost &) found love letter. Kate Capshaw as owner of the city's bookstore, with a number of characters portrayed by Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Tom Everett Scott, Gloria Stuart, Alice Drummond and Geraldine McEwan as the seemingly unaffected wife Scattergoods. Romance is in the air, love lurks everywhere. You will appreciate the talented Kate Capshaw. ("The Alarmist" is another quirky little movie that is fun to watch: Capshaw has a wonderful chemistry with David Arquette and Arquette with Stanley Tucci). "Notting Hill" is satisfactory in its story-raving around the glittering mating of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, and the wonderful support of his circle of (London) friends. "Love Letters" is lovely in its nice (Loblolly) little town, and its history involves Kate Capshaw's centrifuged ripple effects on his friends and neighbors. Both perhaps fantasies, somehow felt the latter more achievable if it were to happen to you. And if you appreciate words or poetic lines, it may be the movie for you.
