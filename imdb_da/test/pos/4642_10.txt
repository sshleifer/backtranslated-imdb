For a movie that was PG, it's a fun movie. I grew up watching this movie over and over again. It's really fun, I don't know how today the audience would react, but if you grew up on it or loved the 80s, it's a good movie. Stephen Furst is great as Harold, which I think is one of the best characters in the movie. Paul Ruebens also comes in approx. 10 minutes. I love nostalgia.
