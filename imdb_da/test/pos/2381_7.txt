One of a lot of cartoon Scooby Doo movies, "Scooby Doo and Loch Ness Monster" proves to be entertaining, exciting, interesting, fun and also a surprisingly good interpretation of Scottish Highlands. An annoying aspect of the movie is the voices of many of the characters. American people trying to sound Scottish in this movie, unfortunately, do not do all that well (although some people do better Scottish accents than others). <br /> <br /> Daphne has come to the highlands to see her cousin Shannon and the Highland games at Blake Castle. Gravely Shannon tells the gang that she thinks she's seen Loch Ness Monster. When even more chaos occurs, Mystery Inc has another mystery on their hands ... Good for Scooby Doo fans and for people who want to know more about Scotland! Enjoy "Scooby Doo and Loch Ness Monster"! :-)
