okay ... first to Anne rice BOOK fans .... sure the train's eyes are not blue ... sure he is not blonde in this movie ... but even though Marius is not reading the maker ... even though they completely changed story ..... <br /> <br /> how can you say it's not a good movie .. <br /> <br /> this movie ... is the best vampire movie I've ever seen ... and read is depicted perfectly in it .... maybe not his features ... but I don't think one can find a better read .... the way he speaks ... and the way he looks at just mortal ... his arrogance .. and pure love of fame is depicted flawlessly. <br /> <br /> If you once ... consider it just a movie .. and don't try and relate each scene to the book ... you'll love the movie as much as I do. <br /> <br /> Now ... to the non-readers .. be ready to fall in love with this movie .... it has all things .... and the goth music ... is like an extra treatment ... the dialogues ... are beautiful ... and prisoners ... and even if it is a vampire movie. you will find yourself smiling ... by the sign of the character ... and you will find yourself sympathetic with the vampires. <br /> <br /> overall ... one of my fav movies ... !! 10.10
