Of course, Ponyo can be seen as just not another silly animated movie that a studio can simply set to survive. It is far from it, and it can easily be described as a captivating, wonderful movie experience. <br /> <br /> In fact, Miyazaki has another masterpiece. For many, it has been said to be the smallest of his performances in filmmaking because in some of his "particular subconscious" he is not there. It is true - the morals and insights that are not so clear in his earlier films are very much in front of this picture. Ponyo is not too difficult to understand or understand. His idea, I think, was to make a children's film that was just as suitable for adults as their children, and that it should not be too complicated. He did this perfectly, and he also lost no substance along the way, which is why it becomes a 10. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film itself is so exciting from the start, and the way it is presented, is so beautiful it left me at times because I remembered how they were all hand-drawn by Miyazaki himself. I haven't been so enlightened and happy after watching a movie since I watched for some time (another movie not to be missed). Everything about Ponyo was absolutely fantastic and breathtaking; even the music for it was pure perfection. The only bad thing I have to say about it was the English dubbing. Don't make me wrong, they were also good, but I had seen Ponyo about 2 weeks before it came out at national level, and I thought in some parts I would like it to have kept some of its Japanese dialogue (not all however, it did take good advantage of the "English way". All in all, everyone should see Ponyo; It is completely flawless and in another league with film making entirely. Finally, and don't stick to this, but I wouldn't be surprised if Ponyo got a Best Picture nomination as there are 10 movies that can be nominated for it. It's just as good.
