Finally!!! A good movie made on the most demented serial killer in history. For those who were less familiar with Ed Gein, he was basically the insane who was known for the serious robbing and rinsing of his victims (as most terrorists flew off). Shot in a period style that reflects Wisconsin's gloomy plains perfectly, this is easily the most atmospheric horror movie yet to portray Gein and his cruel killings. Kane Hodder (Jason's Friday 13th series) and Michael Berryman (Hills have Eyes I & II), deliver chilling performances in this serial killer opus, which easily leaves the noisy previous Gein trials. So far, I have said that this is one of the best horror movies released this year (Turistas = 0).
