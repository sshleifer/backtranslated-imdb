I must admit that I had never heard of this movie. I caught it last night at TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the end. Imagine what a Marx brothers movie would have if they worked with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all fell LSD. <br /> <br /> Funny and edgy are two over-worded words these days, this movie is sure that plus plus 200 IQ points in most comedies today and surreal to boot. I had to be at 6:00 and saw it at 2:30. I slept over and missed my obligations. Still worth it. I would not recommend renting it, I would recommend owning it. It was so good. <br /> <br /> The only warning I have is that so the references are dated and maybe not received by younger people. Just with it and use your head. <br /> <br /> I have to put it in my top comedies all the time.
