This film was one of three that was later combined by Chapin into a compilation released for theaters in the late 1950s under the title "The Chaplin Review". <br /> <br /> This was an odd movie in some ways because later in life Chaplin was anti-war, and his film emphasized peace and fraternity. This film, on the other hand, is a propaganda comedy that will strengthen US efforts in WWI. It's really strange to see Charlie as the "super soldier", who single-handedly captures 13 Germans, randomly and coldly shoots more Germans in seconds as a champion, and then goes behind enemy lines to try to catch Kaiser himself! This was really a great departure for Little Tramp, although at the same time it was very much entertaining and fun. The film is exceptionally well-made, well-made, and I'm sure did much to strengthen the support at home for our troops (too badly it was a pointless and expensive war).
