Although this movie at first glance resembles the story of your parent's high school life (and many will try to tell you that this movie is outdated), and I admit it was my first impression .... but honestly, those "lessons" who are taught by the hero / heroes, is def. NOT obsolete. Who won't be famous? And who does not want to be accepted my peers? And the gay guy - isn't there a whole controversy today about gay marriage, blah, blah? This movie, even though it was released in the 80s, still deals with some of the greatest problems in today's world. However, this movie has a little too much beauty and nudity for my taste. (thus 8/10 rating)
