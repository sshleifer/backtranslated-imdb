The opening shot of Love Consequences perfectly matches this exciting and absorbing film. A travellator slowly carries a lonely out of focus figure towards the camera and puts a large suitcase behind it. Like the central character of the film, we know nothing about him and our first interpretation of him, his profession, the contents of the suitcase could be far away from the mark. <br /> <br /> The consequences of love are that kind of movie. From the title you can expect a Bergmanesq dissection of a relationship. What we have instead is a protagonist, Watch who lives life in emotional exile, apparently chooses to cut himself out of those around him. If the movie can be classified in any way, I would call it a mystery as we are involved in finding out who is watching and what he is about. What we know from the start is that he is the 50, cool, complex and costly intrigue. He has lived for the last eight years in a plush Swiss hotel, which always pays his room fee on time, but rarely shows interest to the employees or other guests. <br /> <br /> His only real companions are a couple with whom he occasionally plays card games. The couple, it turns out, used to own the hotel but have now gambled everything away and only have the room they live in the left. Their love for money, antiques and each other was their regret, and Looks seem to identify with their situation. He once had everything, but now lives as a virtual prisoner in the hotel. His brother, a long-haired surf instructor, falls in to see him occasionally, but he sees his visit as more of a burglary than a pleasure. They talk about the person who is looking at his best friend, even though he hasn't seen him for 25 years. This long-lost friend is now a phone operator who repairs the communications network that brings so many together. Tita's phone call to his wife and children ends quickly when they refuse to talk to him. <br /> <br /> Center through the movie makes Watching an uncharacteristic move and begins to open up a young barmaid from the hotel. With his judgment overshadowed by emotions, he relies on an action that will eventually seal his destiny to good. The slow unfolding of Titas falling from grace is and beautifully scripted, shot and scored. The thumping techno soundtrack does a lot to build up the excitement as more and more secrets are revealed, the last half hour becomes a taught thriller, as Watch lets its mask slip and again face the consequences of his actions. The ending, with a visual nod to Felini, is dramatically even ambiguous and leaves the audience once again questioning their motives. <br /> <br /> Patrick Bliss, 06/06/06
