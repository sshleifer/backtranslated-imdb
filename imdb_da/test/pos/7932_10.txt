I learned a lot from previous viewing reactions. Is there anyone not mentioning 'propaganda'? For glib. 'Perception is concept-dependent'. I love Fred Astaire musicals, the great, good songs, & Fred's relentless grace. But comrades, if you see inactive, brainless, rich parasites dancing on the run-down and unemployed, it is a valid criticism of 'capitalist propaganda'. Any movie is imbued with the values ​​of its time and place, not to mention those who fund it? the pipes that call the tune. Great art transcends everyone, like "Nevsky", who did "All quiet on the west side". I confess. I saw the last 40 odd years ago. But the images are burned in my brain. It is the biggest battle scene that will ever be filmed. And it makes you horrified to be excited. "Plastis" did anyone say? It's the real death you see. Real extras dead do this. 'Real looking' is now the special effects-defined it seems. Likewise 'too long' - for the age of shrinking attention span? Mozart had 'too many notes'? Propaganda, Catholic Church Fainted? The Vatican was still on it as they called on old favors to get the German Christian Democratic government. to recognize Croatia in the 1990s? Remember chaos and genocide? Forget the props, the illumination of the Nevsky painted medieval world ?? like a Breughel. There is one in Hampton Court Palace that shows a massacre. Raw Dutch nationalist propaganda perhaps, but it tears in the heart. Stylized acting? So what is Henry V (Olivier movie)? Naturalism? Does anyone think that English medieval knight fighters spoke like this? As said, Prokofiev's music is magnificent. Only Ken Russell & Eisenstein had the balls and genius to match the sound and image at this 100 octave level. Ok, you want snaffle & bite. I want to risk the thoracic nerve every time. Eisenstein did not copy Wehrmacht helmets, but his model seems to have been the buckets worn by 'Teutonic Knights' in the 1930s Nazi adventures. Eisenstein was a genius, but unlike Hollywood directors, he had almost unlimited (non-commercial) time and funding. Modern Russian directors are free of political hangers, but have no money. Even Kurasawa had to make a late (big) film in communist Russia. He was honored but unfinished in his own country (like Russell). How much propaganda is in the eyes of the guards? Imagine sane people from another, peace-keeping world. How would they react to Nevsky? Would the fight or the mourning for the dead dominate their realizations? If we didn't know about the gas chambers & SS, what about 'Will of the Will'? Where can I get a Nevsky DVD, cheap?
