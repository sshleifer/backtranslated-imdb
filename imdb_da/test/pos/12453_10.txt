I've seen most of the Tarzan episodes. Certainly the classified X with O'Keeffe & Bo Derek, which is totally unfortunate. <br /> <br /> I've seen this version several times since it was originally shown. <br/> <br /> All of them had cast memorable parts, amazing acting apes. Last night I saw the same thing in Spanish station and other than some French dialogues all in Spanish. <br /> <br /> As far as Hudson doesn't want Andie's voice, he did nothing in the end. He looked at the dailies and could have employed a dialogue coach. <br /> <br /> It seems silly that a story of monkeys and a man upright of them all speaks gibberish that Hudson attacked Andie.The story line in the movie was that she was an American cousin The last time I controlled Carolina was in USA. She was beautiful in film and her eyes, and beautiful hair, alabaster skin mystified all of us men. She didn't have to resort to Bo's level. <br /> <br /> She has been a LADY throughout the rest of her career and should look at this movie (half of her life side) as a starting point. Her performance, sincerity made this movie enjoyable, credible, that half a wild man could determine her inner beauty. Great point for Sir Richardson, he stole the movie.
