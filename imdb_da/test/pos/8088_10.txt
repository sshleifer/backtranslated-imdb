This movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is. It's a movie for both children and parents, and it's "timeless". I watched this movie before Ocean's Eleven and have to admit that the players in OE have the class in advance, but Klatret√∏sen's game is far more down to earth and moves. Why do I say Ocean's Eleven is the fact that these 2 movies have many things in common and the climb is so good! that it can compare with OE. The 3 youngsters play their role in a perfect way, not to believe in what we are used to in Denmark. The different cases of impossible actions are dealt with in a way that you would not believe by many young actors (and sometimes not even by the "old boys"). The story ? Again, it is common with Ocean's Eleven, with the exception of the reason for stealing the money, and in the climbing tree they need to climb to the strongroom. The part that the young people must take care of Ida's younger brother gives a fine element in the film. Try to imagine how to steal a bank with a 2 year old child with a diaper on your arm :-). This movie is comparable to most "adult" movies like MI2 and Ocean's Eleven. Yes, I think it's so good. It is best to watch it at a theater as all the kids in the room comment on the movie, and these comments will remain in your heart forever :-). Regards Klavs.
