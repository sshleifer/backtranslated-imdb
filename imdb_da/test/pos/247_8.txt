This is a very fun, fluffy, glamorous musical from the 40s. 'Cover Girl' made Rita Hayworth (formerly the dark-haired Latin senorita Margarita Cansino) a bona fide, American star. It confirmed Gene Kelly's amazing talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. It embraces the musical genre's decoration and color. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth is great as Rusty Parker - it's her picture and her presence is always in the lead. Her song is dubbed, but her dance is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with Kelly. I think Rita was heavily undervalued as an actress - she plays every scene excellently here. The gene choreographed the dance sequences (he got pretty much almost complete creative freedom here), and his 'Alter Ego' dance number is amazing. Such artistry. The stand-out melodies are 'Make Way For Tomorrow', 'Put Me To The Test', and of course 'Long Ago and Far Away'. The ground is quite thin, but it has a morale. It's about the dangers of fast fame and quick money, and how any happiness with only these factors is ultimately condemned. This will encourage you, lift you up to your feet and make you laugh. <br /> <br /> That said, 'Cover Girl' is not the greatest musical ever produced - it has a number of errors to be solved. One can say that a little bit of Phil Silvers goes a long way. His character becomes boring quite quickly. However, I was impressed by his dance ability and how he could stop using Gene and Rita. Another big problem is that too many songs are just not that big. The cover girl number looks great, but I'm not a fan of the text or song. 'Poor Tom' is a huge downer. I think it's one of the worst figures I've ever heard in a 40s-50s musical yet. It stinks. The grandmother's subplot borders on being ridiculous. But that's just my opinion. Others like these items. <br /> <br /> Still, except for errors, it's a very, very good movie, much better than most of the product that was knocked out today. The dance and song are sublime, the production values ​​are excellent and the atmosphere is contagious. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
