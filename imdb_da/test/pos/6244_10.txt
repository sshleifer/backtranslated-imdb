This is the greatest movie I've ever seen. Davey / Mr. The slave is at the same time: <br /> <br /> 1) Tortured about his talents (eg "I can control it, I can! I won't get it! The feeeeeeeeeels well!"); <br /> <br /> 2) Desperate to make friends, for example <br /> <br /> "How's the soup? <br /> <br />" The soup is very good. "<br />" Do you want some biscuits with your soup? "<br /> <br />" I'd like more crackers, thanks. "<br /> <br />" How is it? "<br /> <br />" Yes, the soup is very good. "<br /> <br /> 3) Proud of his performance (eg" Pretty nice trick, huh? ") <br /> <br /> 4) A ladies man (eg, "You're so beautiful. Why don't you like me?"), and <br /> <br /> 5) Sometimes, very, very angry (f "You Can't Get Away!") <br /> <br /> Connors should have been awarded an Academy Award for Best Actor for this movie. I mean, who might be better? It is weird, not all the stars in this masterpiece did not continue to have a brilliant career, I highly recommend them movies! It is available on amazon.com, everyone should own it. Get a bowl of soup while you watch.
