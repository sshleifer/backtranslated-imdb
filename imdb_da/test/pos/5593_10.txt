Great to shop with the 5 stars making this a must see. <br /> <br /> Based on a stage play, THE SILVER CORD is about "mother love" at worst. The film was highly controversial for its implied homosexuality in the younger son and the mother's unnatural "romantic" feelings for both sons. Irene Dunne stars as the new bride (and biologist) traveling with husband (Joel McCrea) to visit the family before heading out to New York City for their new job. But something seems wrong. The mother, Laura Hope Crews, seems rude to the younger son (Eric Linden) fianc√© (Frances Dee). But Dunne sets aside such thoughts and ignores some of the strange things the mother says. Then she finds out that "her" room is down the hall from McCreaas and his room is adjacent to the mother's room. <br /> <br /> Later, she enters as "mummy" hanging in McCrea and kissing him (on the lips) good night. Mummy has also worked at Linden and made him doubt his feelings for Dee. Everything jumps up and with Dee running into the snowy night towards the frozen pond. As the boys run after her, mummy shouts from the window for boys to come back and get their coats! Dee falls through the ice and rescues. When the girls leave the house the next morning, Dunne can know what she thinks of her and her affiliation with the boys. But the mummy has a tight hold, fails illness and always trusts of its victims. The girls leave, but the boys are backward ....... / <br /> <br /> Crews are grand as voracious mother (repeating her stage role); It's a few few actresses would dare to play. The sexual overtones are incredible for a 1933 movie, and crews take advantage of their best movie role. Thin is also excellent as she tries to maneuver the course without losing McCrea. Dee has some good scenes after she gets dumped by confused Linden. All 5 stars are amazing in this drama, which is bizarre underrated and unknown. <br /> <br /> A neglected gem for anyone who likes great acting ......
