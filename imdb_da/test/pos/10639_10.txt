Some users are confused about the identity of the armed men walking down the stairs in the "Odessa Staircase" order. These men are not Cossacks, but ordinary armies. <br /> <br /> The Cossacks arrive at the scene a little later, and they are the men of horses who hit the crowd with their saber. <br /> <br /> For experts in Russian history: Correct me if I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> But there are a few lines in the movie that apparently haven't commented. After the takeover of Potemkin, a person says in the crowd on the coast, "Kill the Jews!" This is on the screen for only a few seconds, but it is there. How immensely typical of history, not only in Russia, but in so many other countries, that immediately, unthinkable and instinctively blame Jews for any domestic problems! Perhaps other parts of the film are not historical factual, but the extermination against the Jews is far too real. Comments, anyone? <br /> <br /> Why can't English speakers learn to speak like "Potyomkin" instead of "Potemkin"? There is a need in Russian to distinguish between the two possible statements of "e": as either "ye" or "yo." Sometimes two dots are used to distinguish between these two statements, but it is normal for the difference to be remembered.
