The movie is not for everyone. Some may think that the play is bad when it is actually discreet and natural. There are no overtly evil acts, and there are no amazingly beautiful moments. There is much indecision, many conflicting emotions. In fact, this movie takes a very honest look at a very complex subject, Sex with Minors. It is complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex as her body and hormones continue to evolve, and both their minds and personalities are still evolving. Complex also because society has very simplified views on sex with minors and complexes, because the signs do not know whether society is right or if their instincts are right. <br /> <br /> Some will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions. Issues that were truly responsible for the relationship that was damaged, came out of it well, the art that was damaged more, made some of the issues with their relationship come from being banned by society, some of the problems stem from their own immaturity, and most importantly, was this really a crime? <br /> <br /> The movie is resolutely neutral on all this, and it is this neutrality that is its strength. That is the reason for the undervalued play, the simple sets, the lack of background music, soft lighting and the general "flat" presentation. The message is ready. We do not really understand this kind of relationship today, and quick judgments are bound to be superficial.
