Idiocracy felt like Mike Dommer took my thoughts on society and put them in film. In fact, the film is a social comment. Almost feels like a documentary at times. Luke Wilson did a good job of playing a boring average Joe (as in most of his films). Of course, the idiocathy is an extremity in the present state of society. But that's what makes most comedies fun, an extreme situation. Fiction is not so much different from reality. <br /> <br /> With children presenting materialistic Hip-Hop culture and proud to be ignorant. When people feel useless in life, they breed. Gives them a purpose in the world. And it only seems to the worse ones who breed the most. I can understand how others do not like it. It didn't help most of the jokes were 2nd class bathroom humor. Not much different than a Kevin Smith movie. <br /> <br /> Idiocracy throws away logic, reason, any intelligence (for good reason). <br /> <br /> Mike Judge's comeback was a knockout.
