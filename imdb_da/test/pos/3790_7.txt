The big names in movies tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist image is part of his contribution, although the war was almost over at the time of its release. The tramp goes to war, performs humorous acts of heroism and kicks Kaiser into the boom. It's a very funny movie, though I don't think it's almost one of his best. It is with 'A Dog's Life' as his better output to First National, before he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid.' They are his first tricycles that contain persistent, more elaborate gags than he could usually orchestrate in his two-wheeled shorts in Mutual. It can be difficult to balance a pro-war message with slapstick antics and scenes of burlesque on the front, but you wouldn't believe it as 'Shoulder Arms'. It is also preferable in many respects to a "more serious" dramatic work with a similar message, like Griffith's world hearts. Chaplin had become a true virtuoso of screen comedy at this time; He makes it look easy. He knew very well now that a movie with fewer gags - with more elaboration, sophistication and careful timing - could be better than any knockabout, the Keystone-type farce with a dozen talk-a-minute. The sequence in which Chaplin is disguised as a tree is a relevant example. Even with the rage of war, Chaplin can lift millions of spirits.
