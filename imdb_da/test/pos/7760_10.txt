Suzumiya Haruhi no yûutsu (With Melancholy by Haruhi Suzumiya) can at first glance make you think this is just another animated school comedy / drama. Well, it's not! The setting is just a school environment. This is a comedy okay, but a very smart with a lot of sarcasm. And the characters have a psychological sublimity that is almost in the same class as found in Ingmar Bergman's works. The episodes are broadcast as it seems to be out of order, ie. The pilot is actually episode 11. This makes it possible to present small tracks to upcoming episodes. The show is an adaptation of Nagaru Tanigawa's popular novel series on Haruhi Suzumiya. <br /> <br /> What about the story then? As in all episodes, the story of Haruhi Suzumiya, which seeks to ease its own boredom, enters into adventure. Haruhi himself has no interest in ordinary people, and is actively seeking foreigners, periodicals and espers (people with supernatural powers). To find this kind of people she has formed a club, which she calls the SOS Brigade (Save the World by Overloading it with Fun: Haruhi Suzumiya's Brigade). Apart from Haruhi, the other members of the SOS Brigade are Kyon. He is the real protagonist of the show. It is through his view that we follow the story. He happened to be in the front of the class when Haruhi came up with the idea of ​​forming the SOS Brigade. He's quite skeptical of most club activities and tags together to make sure Haruhi doesn't go much to the extremes, and he's the only one in the class that Haruhi likes to talk to. Another member is Yuki Nagato, who is the "indispensable quiet member" and is also the only remaining member of the literature club, which room the SOS Brigade has occupied in search of a free club. She doesn't mind that the SOS Brigade uses her club as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books. She also participates in the brigade activities. Mikuru Asahina was "voluntarily arrested" by Haruhi because the club needed a Lolita-like mascot for everything suspected to happen. She often seems like the clubs maid. The last member is the always smiling Itsuki Koizumi, who happens to be the "mysterious transfer student" (meaning he transferred two months to the semester that Haruhi finds qualifying as mysterious). <br /> <br /> Haruhi believes All Members, but Kyon are some randomly chosen people in school, but they actually have their own interest in her.
