Brilliant actors and brilliant picture !! I love chopper scene with the music in the beginning, it's just so touching and at the same time true but at the same time surreal! The Vietnam War was far from human, and I think this movie kind of shows has horrible people can act under certain circumstances. Modern war movies use so much money on effects. This is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A movie that really shows evil and hates mixed in fear and destiny. Where insane the world is, and power of will and friendship, love and passion. One must watch movies and no doubt the best war movie ever! Many tried to copy, but there are still no movies as good as this one !!
