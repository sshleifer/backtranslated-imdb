Although this movie is 11 years old, I just rented it yesterday, and I found it to be a really moving movie. The story of true friendship over a very genuine monster is an inspiration and quite touching. <br /> <br /> While I don't care much about the amount of languages ​​some of the young actors used - especially from Renfro - I understand that art imitates life. Renfro once again does a magnificent job with the rough and hard, much (and I mean VERY) disturbed wannabe bully (his role in The Client comes to mind), and Mazzello does a wonderful job with the witty, something quirky Dexter - a child who realizes that his life must end prematurely. <br /> <br /> While there are so many moving and fun moments in the movie, I have to say that my favorite was when the boys became the corner of Pony in the abandoned church and Dexter (Mazzello) cut himself and said, that his blood was married. Although it is very exciting and a little entertaining to see an adult man running away from two young children, it is one of the hardest scenes in the movie. <p> <p> Surely check this one, but prepared with your Kleenex - you'll need it!
