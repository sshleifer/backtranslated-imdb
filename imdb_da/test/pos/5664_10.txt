It is certainly not the best movie ever. But it is certainly worth looking for people with a particular kind of mind. So the one who loves sadness and depression, and scary adventures at night, and wolves and real madness - welcome! If you find a copy, of course :) As for me, I could only stand it once ... But since then, the Wolves and Saint-Lucy, the child's drawings and a headless Christ in my nightmare.
