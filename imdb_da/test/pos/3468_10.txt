I've been looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I first caught the trailer and I'm so happy now that I have. It's really a wonderful movie. The actors are amazing, the writing is fresh and genuine, everything was just spot-on. I love James McAvoy in this and I can't wait to see him in the "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" movie in December. Romola Garai is also wonderful. Be sure to check her out in "I Capture the Castle" or "Nicholas Nickleby", two of my favorite movies. All in all, I think I liked this movie because it didn't chill out. It is a difficult topic to tell a story about, as you will most likely offend many people or mess up and make it something excessive-sentimental-sugary-sweet love celebration. But they avoided doing it altogether, and instead made a movie that is genuine, honest and touching, yes, but never over-the-top. Very well done. Incredibly well done. Go and see it and you know exactly what I mean.
