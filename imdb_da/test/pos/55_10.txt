No blood, no sex (even though it does show passion), no special effects, but just one of the gems that come across your movie screen when you don't really look and take your attention. <br /> <br /> Great play, amazing set, great music, beautiful story. Only if there were many more movies made like this! <br /> <br /> The sets move us over time and make us feel like we were there. <br /> <br /> The play looks like real life and raises us to the awareness of "Nanny" to whom no one is a lost cause, least of all the inhabitants of his own "Halfway" house. <br /> <br /> Best of all, it's a true story of misfits learning to "fit in". I was a little jealous of the good times everyone seemed to have in the movie! Can we all spend some time in the grandson's house?
