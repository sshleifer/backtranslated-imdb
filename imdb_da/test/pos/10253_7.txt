This upcoming age of drama set in Chicago in the early 60's, we follow a group of high school friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives. The two key characters are Leroy "Preach" Jackson (Turman) and his best friend Richard "Cochise" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs.) Both of these boys have promising futures. Preach is a great writer, but a lazy student, and Cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball. When not hanging out at local eateries with their friends or hanging out at a friend's house or chasing girls, they go to school, drive on trains through Chicago or go to quarters at weekends. <Br /> <br /> Things go wrong when Preach and Cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two caps and breaking into a stolen car. The police are pursuing them and they are being arrested. But thanks to an affected teacher (SNL's Garrett Morris) effort, they are released. But the two caps are not and promises to avenge themselves on Preach and Cochise and think they owed it all to them. <br /> <br /> This movie is very episodic, but it still works because it's what life is, a series of episodes. Some fun, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. The movie never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic, and the situations are all credible and relatable. Like Exactly Romantic, a beautiful girl pursues, or a party becomes fierce when some asshole decides to start a fight or deal with a bratty younger sibling. But even when a situation is not personally related, as the boys pretend to be undercover police to keep a hooker out of some money so they could make all their friends a movie, the sequence is still fun. <br /> <br /> 'Cooley High' was the foundation of the classic 70's sitcom 'What's Happenin!' who aired on ABC from 1976-1979. Although the show is most famous for the character Rerun, he is not in this movie, nor is there any character like him. The mood of that show was very broad but still fun. The mood of 'Cooley High' is more lively and thus more entertaining. <br /> <br /> In addition, the soundtrack is wonderful. Classic songs from the period of Diana Ross & The Supremes, The Temptations, Martha & Vandellas and Smokey Robinson play throughout the film and add to the fun, youthful, bubbly tone of the movie.
