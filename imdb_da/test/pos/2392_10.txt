I've been writing a hard-boiled crime movie for several years now. When a writer develops a story, he always has a character / actor in mind to bring the story to life. Last weekend I found a new one in Paul Vario who played Uncle Benny in Eddie Monroe. This was a slick movie highlighted by Vario's presence both on and off the screen (as his voice-over story is also heard). I also especially liked the actor who played Benny's niece and Eddie's ex-wife, though everyone did a great job in this exciting movie about playing with evil and the dual passage that goes with it. A good job around ... and Mr. Vario shone brightest. He'll be my Tony Gangi someday ...
