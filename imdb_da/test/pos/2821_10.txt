I shot this movie. I'm very proud of the movie. It was a great experience displayed on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie exactly as we imagined when we were preparing the film. The sets are amazing and well designed for each character. John York and his team built sets that fit not only the characters, they worked well in shooting the movie so we could move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each figure has a fantastic arc, which gives a fantastic story. I want all the actors to give excellent performances. I disagree with some of the other comments that say the action was not good. See it and decide for yourself.
