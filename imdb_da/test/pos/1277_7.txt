The following is a lesser known 1998 British film made with a budget of Â£ 8000 and has a maturity of 70 minutes. When you see it, you would never expect its director to continue doing it in Hollywood and become one of the most recognized and famous instructors of the 21st century ?? Now everyone must start somewhere, I assume. The Director of Following, which you probably already know is Englishman Christopher Nolan, who would immediately continue to lead the critically acclaimed independent film Memento; a few years later he was employed by Warner Bros. to lead the new Batman series, which further brought him recognition, and so on and so on. My point is that everyone should start somewhere? although it is not in the most amazing debut ?? and Christopher Nolan introduces himself to the world in 1998 with the following. <br /> <br /> Looking at it, I couldn't help drawing similarities to another direct debut, avant-garde author David Lynch's Eraserhead. The following is not a surreal psychological horror movie in that sense, but the similarities are noticeable; Most notable, it is shot in gray black and white and has an atmosphere of what makes it unique. It is difficult to describe in words, but it is loosely similar in the smoky atmosphere you would find in the film's old. It can therefore be said that the following is a modern film noir or a neo-noir. All in all, it is a merger of it and a psychological thriller, and the story is best suited to these two genres. The protagonist is nameless, and the film's title derives from an early, obsessively compulsive feature he possessed ?? randomly, people pick out on the street and follow them, sometimes even for hours. During one of these "stalking expeditions", the protagonist is noticed by one of the people he follows and is confronted. It turns out that "confronting" is a man who is willing to be kind to our narrator and he introduces himself; his name is Cobb, and he is a little letter inviting the narrator to follow him on his burglary. From there, the protagonist is swept up in Cobb's world, and he becomes involved in crime, passion and violence as he becomes more and more intimate with Cobb. The following is not so much a character study, but instead a film that follows the tumultuous relationship between these two protagonists and the devastating ramifications it has on our narrator. Nolan succeeds in making the film look like a film noir, and emulates the respective atmosphere well. As a thriller, the following is tense and atmospheric; But as a movie in general, it's a little disappointed. If not, then you could definitely call it underpowering. The whole movie has been shot in a non-chronological and non-linear fashion, and that makes the story and the movie experience unique, to some extent ?? This style has been done so many times now is it almost common technique? And the story itself is unique to some extent. <br /> <br /> However, Follow is ultimately overwhelming for the entire movie and is disappointingly unspectacular. The story requires more ?? more action, more excitement and more excitement ?? But it gets too hot in its own story, and instead focuses on creating a complicated story. It succeeds in doing so, but without any other elements it is a film noir that does not work out completely; It has a sense of emptiness which is not enormous, yet noticeable. Moreover, the film's shocking revelation at the end ?? almost a mandatory convention in film noirs ?? is one that makes us cheat; It is unpredictable and comes out of nothing, but compared to history it is disappointing as it essentially makes the previous scenes and the whole movie seems like a huge waste of time. <br /> <br /> But the positives far outweigh the negatives, and ultimately it turns out to be a flawless but satisfying movie, yes, everyone has to start somewhere. Christopher Nolan does this with the following, and he does it in a nice way. A quiet, wise but nice way. It's not the most amazing movie, and it's not worth the acclaim that the director would continue to receive in the following decade, but it's still a good movie anyway. As you singles out, you'll find a tasty, tight and atmospheric thriller that lacks noticeable nuance or innovative style, yet manages to grab the audience anyway.
