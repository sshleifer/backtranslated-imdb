I was surprised, "Once More, My Darling," had not generated enough votes (by this script) for a "user rating". It's a "screwed" comedy I've had many times over the years. Robert Montgomery's mission places him in some very unlikely situations, and he's just the man for the job. He maintains his trademark "befuddled" throughout the film and hysterically as well. Ann Blyth plays her precocious / eccentric pursuer who assumes a relationship that does not exist. Her character is cooked enough to justify the untamed nickname "Killer", but remains sweet and cute. Among the "B" gluten from the late 1940s and 1950s, "Once More, My Darling" is a standout. This is worth looking for ....
