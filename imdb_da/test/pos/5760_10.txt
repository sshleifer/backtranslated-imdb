Why did I vote 10/10 for this movie, which is just outside? Simply because if you just let yourself find fun, you can just laugh until you shock. Some people may find that it is going too far, it's certainly not for everyone, but when I'm down and just need something really stupid to laugh at, chuck on the bottom or GHP, and I can forget all my problems and transported into a magical dark and strange world. <br /> <br /> * "totally free" is an Australian term, it has no literal translation.
