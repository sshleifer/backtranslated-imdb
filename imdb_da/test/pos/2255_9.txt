This movie reminds me of 'The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and 'Garden State' not because of content, but because it is one of the movies you do not hear, except by mouth to mouth or you read the back of the DVD in the video store and think "why not". Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised (like the above movies), how good it was and how much I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Best seen with little knowledge of the movie and with only the intrigue that guided you to actually see it. Also best seen with someone else or if you know someone else who has seen it - you would like to talk about it !! It's a beautiful movie that stays with you well when you see it. It is also an intelligent watch that requires little effort to find parts for yourself. <br /> <br /> Just enjoy :)
