I saw this movie out of the lack of anything else at that time. The movie quickly grabbed me with the depth of the characters and the subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating my satellite provider gave was not showing stars. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give any spoilers to the plot line or result, but most characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the last minute, I didn't know how to show it. Often you can retrieve the formula and predict a storyline. I couldn't do that with this movie. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this as one of the finer movies in this genre.
