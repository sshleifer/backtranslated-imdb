My sisters and my cousin (female) forced me to watch this chick movie. It's not the kind of movie I prefer to watch, but it really wasn't that bad. I didn't want to watch this movie, but after seeing it I couldn't say it was bad, just not my kind of movie. It was very accurate to identify which woman really is talking about and doing in certain situations. As a guy I was also not amused by the jokes, but the man women were definitely. They related to the movie and yes it was fun to see themselves on the big screen. "OH EM, I make it to HAHA" I've never seen the original, nor do I want to worry about it. If you are a girl, this is a must see, but maybe girls would say this movie sucked, probably. I can't see a 13-year walk, "Wow I remember throwing it when I was 30." <br /> <br /> No man would have this in here, but I can't say it was terrible, so meh.
