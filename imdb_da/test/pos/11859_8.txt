I rented this movie without having heard (or read) anything about it. What a shame! This movie is intelligent, witty, fun, fast and realistic ridiculous. The characters manage to develop without relying heavily on clich√©d, tired stereotypes. It was refreshing to see. I couldn't help believing that marketing would have helped lob this not-so-common movie to the main-to-intelligent comedy mainstream. The quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors perform a great selection of awkward, heartache and comedy are so rare these days - I felt that the actors must have benefited from participating in something that is right. How is it that National Treasure was number one in the cash register office for three consecutive weeks - it is so weak in many ways to mention. I think I'm just happy that movies like "Seeing .." are still being made somewhere out there.
