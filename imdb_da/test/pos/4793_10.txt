The subject of religion in Buñuel films is a point that one, as an eagle of film as an artist or as a person, must hardly analyze. You can look to a satirical Buñuel in "La Voie Lactée", "Un Chien Andalou" or in "L'Age d'Or". Is very difficult and effective in his critic, but once you have seen this and then you see a movie like "Nazarin" after you have seen this work, you are beginning to be questioned by the author. And much has questioned what appears to be a contradiction for Buñuel believes, but it does not say better in this way, I think there is no contradiction in his work, only that Buñuel's religious view is very different as unique in movies. <br /> <br /> This beautiful film is based on the novel Benito Perez Galdós, who told us the story of Father Nazario, who lived a humble, simple life dedicated to God and to helping everyone. He lived in a simple and poor region. There was also Beatriz, an abused and abandoned wife. She finds no sense of her life without her violent macho man. She has a kind of disgust for him. On the other hand, Andara, one of the urban prostitutes. Father Nazario has been stolen again, he blames Spirit's cousin. Andara hears this and tries to fight without success with the priest who does not believe in violence. That night, Andara finds that her cousin is actually a thief, she has stolen her bellboys. Andara struggles with his cousin with terrible consequences. With this, Andara seek mercy from the priest. Nazario decides to help her and knows that this could be against his church, of course this thing will have some consequences. Since here, Nazario will be the pilgrim. Without nothing, even without shoes, but with spirit and faith. But Andara and Beatriz will be with him and be like him to serve God. <br /> <br /> If the sweetest Buñuel movie I've seen so far is also the most spiritual. It is clear here that what most confuses people with the contradiction is that we do not see a Buñuel against the power of the churches here. We see a Buñuel whose film is about the church, but not in the typical - and great-satirical way. Whatever it is, I do not think that the right word is contradictory, I actually find it comfortable and well done and despite containing such religious issues (Like its "Voie Lactée") I found it more a spiritual movie, but that attempt not touching the diversity of the Catholic religion that perhaps he touches and laughing at other films. "Nazarin" is by Father Nazario and its perspective in front of God and the same religion, but all this is ultimately analyzed in this man's spiritual life. The other two women are not a contrast, but very well another two perspectives of faith. First, we have Beatriz, the abused woman who loses all faith in life, first with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family. This little girl was very ill. Next to her was Andara, the prostitute who runs out of justice. In the child's family, only religious women, there is great pain, but faith becomes with Father Nazario when he brings nothing to this city. He blesses the child, one says later, she's fine. The priest will continue to walk, but Beatriz and Andara have restored faith in life and will dedicate their lives to God with Father Nazario. After some complaints, Father Nazario decides to be with them and discover with some things at the end how he feels about faith, God, religion, and the necessary person, the people who must request charity to survive. This last question must then be noted as a possible explanation for the pineapple finish. This stops us listening the drums (similar to that of "L'Age d'Or") and a father Nazario who goes over and asks about these things when he denies the fruit the first time and ultimately decides to receive it as a symbol for necessity or perhaps as a response to its spiritual path that begins to become a priest. Meanwhile, the two women have to leave the father of Andara for their crime (beautiful scene where she thanks a man who helps Father Nazario in prison and then she despaires the man who hit the priest in prison) and Beatriz because she prefers to be with his macho man, even though he treats her badly just because she does not accept that she is loved by the priest. Father Nazario - and here is perhaps the unique place in film for criticism church-go to contradict the church, the religion he serves. Father Nazario is that then one (Soft too much, but not for me) critic for some things in religion (father Nazario helps a woman who is guilty of a crime, a sin), but most of all is one of Buñuel analysis of faith and life, and he really got it, with a beautiful, tender, sweet and unforgettable movie, it is undoubtedly one of his best. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the errors ... well, if any.
