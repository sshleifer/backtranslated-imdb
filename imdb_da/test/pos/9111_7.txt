When I first heard that Jack Black and Kyle Gass wanted to make a movie about their band, I was freaking out! I love their music, and I hoped this movie would be great fun! Now that I've seen it, I can't really say that those hopes weren't happy, but I think I'd expect more. The movie is filled with Tenacious D's amazing music and I really loved listening to it all. There are many good jokes, and I just love the story, at least the first bit. I don't like how the movie ends. The end is very abrupt, and in my opinion they could have expanded it a little more. All in all, I think it's a good movie to watch! Anyone who likes rock music should watch it! It gives you a good laugh!
