Kite Runner was beautiful, sharp and very moving. I especially loved the two children's actors in the movie and the actor who portrayed the father. It really made me go back and read the book again. <br /> <br /> The music was a wonderful part of the movie's fabric. If there is a soundtrack next to the movie, I will buy it to accompany my second reading of the book. It is also a visually stunning movie. The cinematography was beautiful and really added to the experience. The Brazilian word 'saudades' is very descriptive of how I felt at the end of the movie ... "it's a deep sense of longing for somebody or someplace that is very sweet but also stuffed with an inevitable sadness" (definition given years ago by Antonio Carlos Jobim). Watch it at a small cinema here for an advance screening. I would love to see it again on a really big screen with a tricked sound system. <br /> <br /> Can't wait for the formal release. I would definitely recommend the movie to friends.
