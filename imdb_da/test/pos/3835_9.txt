When the Romulans come, they will not carry gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As you know about this episode, it is a redux of the war movie "The Enemy Below" from the 50s. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American destroyer and German U-boat) involved in deadly war games, it is two star ships in outer space. In Trek's history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, the earth fought the Romulan war. After approx. 5 years of conflict led a deadlock a treaty and the institution of the neutral zone, a border between us and the Roman Empire. Now on this stardat, the treaty seems to be broken when our outposts are attacked and destroyed by a huge force weapon. Yes, the Romulans are back and are testing their new war toys, and Kirk must now earn his salary: He must make decisions that would affect this galaxy sector, as to find out how to avoid a ... oh, I dunno - interstellar war, maybe? <br /> <br /> I think what makes this episode so effective that it does not shun away from the grim aspects of the war that one would expect from a single television episode from the sixties - especially an episode from a science fiction show. It is very exciting and poignant, as the best war films that when Kirk is sitting with his key officers for what corresponds to a war council. The writers and the actors do not speak here: this is all prepared for a terrible conflict, possibly the start of another year's long struggle. The Church's goal is ultimately to keep this battlefield for only the two ships - but even then, it is an effort filled with danger and probable losses. In fact, I think this episode holds the record for ship accidents at the end of it. Right at the beginning of the episode, we see the destruction that such a blow can produce in the supposedly well-protected outer post. Then start the cat and mouse war games between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship - it's as exciting as any conflict we've seen on the big screen. Of course, if you're not in war movies, look for other things to admire in this episode. What raises this episode even more is the revelation of just what and who Romulan is - it's an electric shock of some sort. Now we have even greater conflicts between crew members on the company's bridge - the war tends to produce the worst in some people. Because of the still unpleasant attitudes to race in this future, the tension is stretched even further - Kirk has his hands full in it. I suppose the one weakness in history is the practical return of the bigotry question at the conclusion. On the Romulan side, actor Lenard makes his first appearance in the Trek universe as the Romulan commander; he is amazing in the role, Capt. Kirk or Capt. Pike's flip side, break down so it looks like Spock more than a little. Surprisingly, his character is not warlike as we would expect, another eye-opener for this episode. The actor would next return to this universe as Sarek, Spock's father, so he is nothing if it is not versatile. It also tells how the first appearance of such characters as the Romulans is usually their best shot as it is here. They appeared in "The Enterprise Incident" next.
