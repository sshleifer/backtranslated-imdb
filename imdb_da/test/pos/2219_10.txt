This film explores whether or not it creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection --- hilarity, truth, fun, talent and circumstances that make for MAGIC. <br /> <br /> From creative music to off cuff comedy incorporating actors into their very best, if I hadn't known better, I would have thought there was a comprehensive script here. <br /> <br /> what you get: a mighty wind meets conversations with god meets something so fresh and new and lovely that it becomes its own entity. <br /> <br /> peters and both gave star performances and immediately penetrate you. The rest of the casting is also phenomenal. there are no small parts ....... only small players and everyone involved here must be folded on the back, taken out for dinner and considered an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Well done!
