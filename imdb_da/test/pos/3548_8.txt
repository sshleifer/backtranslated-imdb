10 respected directors each shot a short film with operative arias as inspiration (and music). I will make each one separately: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Roeg (dir) - Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story of a murder attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roeg's wife) plays a man! Not bad - very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - Value. No story, but there is some exciting black and white image that fits perfectly with the music. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Meaningless, boring, no plot, nothing. Filled with free female nudity. The worst! <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - Verdi. Buck Henry, Beverly D'Angelo and Anita Morris star in this fun, if obvious, story of a cheating couple. Pretty good. Bruce Beresford - Erich Korngold. Short, lush and romantic. Very good. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - Jean-Philippe Rameau. Dull. A yeast. <br /> <br /> From Roddam - Richard Wagner. This has Bridget Fonda in her film debut. Beautifully finished love story with a rather explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - Giacomo Puccini. Really strange, but OK. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - Gustave Chapentier. Lyrical look at youth and old age. Very sweet. <br /> <br /> The last is by Bill Bryden doing "In Pagliacci". He has John Hurt (!) Dressed as a clown lip sync to Caruso (!!!). When this came out, it got almost an X rating (for the abundant nudity and sex scene). It was given an R with a strict warning attached that the R rating would be heavily enforced. After the film was bombed, the warning disappeared. <br /> <br /> The idea is not bad and 6 out of 10 segments were worth it. Worth to see even if you don't like opera. Just avoid the Godard segment. I give it a 8.
