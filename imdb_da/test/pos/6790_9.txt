Let me first say that I find films such as Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile, and most of Spielberg is quite angry and stomachache. Although National Velvet on the surface seems to be in the same genre and has what should be cringe-worthy moments, I thoroughly enjoyed it and laughed and shadowed the whole movie. The foundation of the plot, a young girl with an unknown horse from a small village entering the Grand National, is certainly as unreliable as it could be, but that is all you have to accept to act as an adventure or allegorie. The characters have depth and grow throughout history. Ann Revere gives an amazing performance as one of the wisest women ever depicted in an American movie. Her interaction with the good-hearted Donald Crisp is fun and sweet. While Liz Taylor tries a little to be even shorter than Margaret O'Brien (she succeeds in btw), her passion and love for her horse shines through her face. Mickey Rooney gives a coach's beautifully nuanced performance. <br /> <br /> This is far from a perfect movie. Some of the situations and scenes are a bit corny and dated (children's antics and Rooney's scenes on the track and in the pub for example), but it doesn't matter. The plot remains true to the characters and leaves a little invisible. We do not have unnatural too dramatic and preaching moments - sometimes less. The final scene is a good example of this - the emotional dialogue is left to the viewer to fill out. <br /> <br /> Strong discreet notions, rounded characters, pithy dialogue, intelligent and internally coherent history. We believe in the characters and are moved by their history. Yup - they just don't make them like this ...
