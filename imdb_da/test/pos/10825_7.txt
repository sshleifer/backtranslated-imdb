An interesting pairing of stories manages this little flick to gather seemingly different characters and stories lines all in the background of World War II and succeed in tying them together without losing the audience. I was impressed by the depth of the various signs and also how much I really felt I understood and their motivations, although the time for the development of each character was very limited. The excellent actions of the people involved in this image are easily noticed. A fun, stylized movie with a ton of comic moments and a bunch of more head shaking events. <br /> <br /> 7/10
