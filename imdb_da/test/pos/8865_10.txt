I am ashamed to say so, but I must admit that the first time I saw this movie was only about a year ago. After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and bought the DVD collectors edition and have seen it many times since. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing at many levels. It acts as your just monster or action type movie, as a scary / sci-fi and also as a very exciting look into the human psyche. The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear is lent not only by Carpenter's direction (which is great) but also by the incredible action of the cast in general. Kurt Russell (of course) is spectacularly underestimated in MacReady's main role, and as a direct result, "feels" like a real person rather than a Hollywood "American hero". The other cast members all carry their roles in style and the net result is an intense credible atmosphere and a truly amazing movie.
