I have read all Jane Austen's novels all the way through once a year every year since I was 9 years old and received the Modern Library edition of her collected works as a birthday present. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie for its romance and for the music, which remained in hauntingly in my head. It was, of course, an interpretation, not an Emma or a Sense and Sensibility, but something completely different and something that Catherine herself would have loved. And being loved by this passionate Henry! It was Henry of Catherine's imagination, and she is the romantic heroine she read about in her novels and was promised to us by the practical Jane Austen who tells us right from the start that the unlikely catarrh will actually be one. I wonder if Jane was completely satirical in her novel. Maybe she could also imagine such a Henry. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the movie for many years, at least a decade. But I have longed for it since.
