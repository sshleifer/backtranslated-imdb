Definitely the best I've ever seen on TV. It was both entertaining and informative. The reason I found this site is an attempt to find out how to see it again. <br /> <br /> In light of the current understanding of history, we must sympathize with genl. Leslie Groves, who was in charge of the nuts and bolts to run the Manhattan project. He was certainly not as paranoid about security as most have believed in the past. <br /> <br /> Casting for real life exhibited people was excellent. It was the first time I noted Sam Waterston as an actor. Apart from altitude, he looked very much like Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> The early stage where Oppenheimer leads a class of graduate students was especially exciting for me.
