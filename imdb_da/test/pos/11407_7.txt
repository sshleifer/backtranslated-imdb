If you ever have babysitting in a house you didn't know, or if you saw the original and enjoyed it then this would be a good choice. Ignoring reviews and what was posted here, I went on and rented this movie because of the memories of how the original scared me as a teenager. This film has (of course) changed some of the original story to relate to today's teens, such as. The babysitter is having trouble switching to his cell phone minutes and has to take a babysitter job to pay his bill. However, it adheres well to the original story line. If you can relate to the pram without knowing the house and it's usually pops and cracks, it's pretty exciting. When the killer is shown, he is very scary and you seem to shout at the girl to "get out of the house". If you have never been babysitting or in a situation like this, then you probably will not be able to relate and will not like it. It's about understanding her fears.
