You know you see softcore with the wrong attitude when the bad dubbing bothers you. I'm okay with the crappy lip sync, but the audio mix is ​​really too. Every time someone says something, it sounds like there's a narrator. Whatever it is, it is almost as much the scourge of boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe D'Amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. Don't make me wrong, there's a fair use in this, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser stars, and that's good because she's hot. It's a little freaky how you can sometimes see his bone structure, but she still rules over her white counterpart. You can also make a cool drink game how often she takes off her kit. Often. Any reason is good. Every person is good. Every location is good. A scene even involves a whole hockey team, no matter what they do in Africa. Sometimes the plot comes in the way, and the supportive caste consists of some really staggering people, but there is probably Laura Gemser to everyone.
