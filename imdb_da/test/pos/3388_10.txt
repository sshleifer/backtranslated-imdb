This is a fantastic movie, all 3 were. The last one was not as good as the first 2, but it was made together time after, and it was pulling on the bedding. But you want to see it because it tells the end of history. Just not how we might think it should end. <br /> <br /> These movies made me be there in all the hardships, love, tears and laughter that the people of this movie throw. It's one of the few movies that is good every time you see it, no matter how many times it is. <br /> <br /> There are some parts of the movie that the young children will not understand and the elderly cannot be old enough to see. But it is a fantastic movie that spans 20+ years.
