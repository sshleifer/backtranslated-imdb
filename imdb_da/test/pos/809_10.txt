In a better civilization, this and many other David Suchet films will be released in theaters. The grounds are amazing (no, I had no idea who had done that, but the tracks were all there if I had been more imaginative - the best kind of mystery), the production values ​​amazing, the actor (from Edward Fox, Sarah Miles, Lysette Anthony, Megan Dodds, and of course David Suchet as Hercule Poirot) simply perfect, the dialogue wonderful, the music and the thrill of excitement and excitement just wonderful things. <br /> <br /> One of the pleasures of These Hercule Poirot movies to a man is how many beautiful women stand in them! Here were two - the sexy sinister Megan Doods and the amazing Lysette Anthony. You really can't go wrong with hiring these - they are just wonderful - as the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind is constantly working because it's all there and you struggling, but by keeping an eye on it all thinking, you can keep an eye on everything - and the beautiful settings. <br /> <br /> I can't think of movies that stimulate the idea more than these Hercule Poirot / David Suchet films. It is impossible to overdo them - and I had never seen one before a few months ago or read an Agatha Christie.
