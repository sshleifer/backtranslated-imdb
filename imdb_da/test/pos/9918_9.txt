If you don't like Italian horror, you don't like this movie. On that note ... "All in all ... it was a terrible experience ... Many things happened. Vanessa Redgrave was scheduled to be in the movie and she pulled out. One of the actors was crushed by a car. I was engaged to getting married, but at the end of the picture, my father died during the shooting ... all sorts of things. "-Dario Argento on the construction of" Opera "<br /> <br /> I was really impressed with Argento and the movie he made here - especially against such horrible circumstances. The full mystery of "Macbeth" and its curse on those trying to arrange the play add countless amounts to "Opera". Throughout the film, Argento uses some of his most clever (and audience-directed) tricks. A young opera singer, Christina, is pampered by a violent psychopath who forces her to see a number of brutal murders. By losing several sharp knives to Christina's eyelids, the murderer makes it impossible for her to close her eyes: "Take a good look. If you try to close your eyes, you will tear them apart. So just watch everything!" /> <br /> Clearly, Argento is very careful in constructing the faux "Macbeth" opera on the screen and his hard work pays off. Add to these more unforgettable brutal murders, an incredibly tense hunting sequence and genius use of POV to portray a particular character (the role of Vanessa Redgrave pulled out on God) and you have one of the best Italian horror movies ever created. <br /> <br /> That is said - it's still Italian horror. Why Christina never seems to tell anyone about this brutal murder is beyond any understanding. Some scenes may be difficult for some viewers to mourn, but I felt more excited about Christina and her eyes than any of the brutal slayings in the movie. The final for "Tenebrae" had my stomach more than anything in "Opera", but that's probably just me. <br /> <br /> And the last five minutes ... Argento wanted it, he filmed it, and he's struggled to keep it in the movie. Absolutely no one likes it, even included, but it's not enough to ruin the rest of the movie for me. It's still one of Argento's best movies to date. <br /> <br /> 9/10
