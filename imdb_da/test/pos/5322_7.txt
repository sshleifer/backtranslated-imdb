One wonders about the state of a society that produces a father like Albert T. Fitzgerald, whom we first encounter on a plane as he is heading for the place he left a long time ago and where he left a wife and a child who is now accused of murdering a mentally challenged boy. When we first see him, he has caught a headline in the paper read by the woman in front of him. Rather rudely he asks her if he could get the newspaper and the lady offers other sections. Well, that's not what he asked what he wants the woman to do is give him the front part she reads. Matthew Ryan Hoge wrote and directed this disturbing film, reflecting in many ways, our society as it is today. In fact, Mr Hoge is aware of what is wrong with it. <br /> <br /> The film presents Leland, a teenager who cannot even distinguish between fantasy and reality. It is clear that killing a human being, even the sweet and innocent boy who has done nothing to deserve it, will have fatal consequences not only for himself but for his own family and the family of the killed boy. . In fact, Leland does not seem to have any idea of ​​what motivated him to commit the crime, for he shows no repentance about it. It is obvious that Leland has been traumatized by his parents divorce. His own father is a secluded man who could not care less about him. It is Pearl, the teacher of the juvenile detention center, who sees the turmoil in the young man and wants to help, but unfortunately he has no chance. The best part of the movie is Don Cheadle, a great actor who always delivers. Ensemble cast works well under Mr. High direction. Kevin Spacey has a good opportunity to play the Egyptian father of the accused murderer and make us reject him for being an arrogant idiot. <br /> <br /> Even though it is a bit long, the film leaves us with more questions than what it answered.
