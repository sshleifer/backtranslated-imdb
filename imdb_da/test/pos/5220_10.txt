Father Hood <br /> I can understand why many people hate this tale of a father kidnapping his two children and transporting them throughout America, but I have seen much worse and - when I saw years ago - I didn't think it was particularly terrible. Patrick Swayze is the worried father who takes his children away with him for personal reasons, and Halle Berry is the police chasing them. <br /> <br /> All in all, a decent way to spend a few hours in your life. You can definitely do worse - ever hear about the movie "Pod People"? <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 out of ***** <br /> <br /> Rated PG-13 for some traumatic scenes, adult content, violence and language.
