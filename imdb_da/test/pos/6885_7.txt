I walked into Blockbuster with a friend the second night who had decided that we were too broke and too lazy to do active. She decided she would look closer, which seemed like a daunting idea that I had to rent another movie once she went to bed. I'm not looking much, who interested me, but saw the Doll Master in the new publishing department. Just based on the cover sleeve (A woman with a doll-like face crying blood tears), I thought it would be interesting enough to rent. <br /> <br /> With regard to the movie itself, you see it in an almost empty house with all the lights off it was pretty scary. I must admit that I have always had a bit of a phobia of dolls since I was a child (and looking at a horrible movie called Asylum, one of the stories in the involved a mental patient who created a doll that killed people Lame, but scary at that time and the first three quarters of this movie really hit the spot for me. The first half hour was especially amazing. The ghastly forgetful atmosphere really set the scene well, and without moving the dolls seemed really threatening. But unfortunately as soon as they started moving it all, it became a bit cheesy, I was a little disappointed, as moments that could have been really scary made me laugh because they were filmed. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, it's a horror movie, you don't expect anything that is memorable. I found that I remembered names and faces better than most Asian horror movies I've seen, suggesting that there must have been a hidden character development that I had not consciously noticed. The typical stereotypes are in effect in this movie, each of them having a kind of quirk that sets them apart from the others, from shy and quiet Yeong-ha and her doll Damien to the outgoing bimbo Seon-yeong. <br /> Although the ending, which bought together many of the loose threads of the plot, seemed a little confused and didn't do anything for me, even though it had a couple of really cool plot twists that I didn't want to ruin here. The plot is a bunch of children invited to be modeled as poets by a famous, laid-back old doll producer, they must remain in the creepy house (adorned with scary dolls, some great little ones) and things begin to happen as our heroine Hae-mi begins exploring areas of the house and things starting to happen to the other inhabitants. In general, I would definitely recommend the movie, not to look with too many people, as some of the moments would probably make you laugh if you are surrounded by friends, but as something also on your own in the dark, with the windows and doors Just open a little, just if dolls want to see you. It really gives you the guess of most of the movie so you can go on wild conspiracy theories to destroy them only later. If you really get into it and ignore it's cheesiness in places, I can guarantee that you control under your bed before going to bed and maybe even turn off the light. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it's just me: P As for closer it was OK, but I preferred this.
