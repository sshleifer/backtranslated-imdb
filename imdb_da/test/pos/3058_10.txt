I watched this movie when it was released to the smaller cinemas in Britain 50 years ago; and the memory remains of a great musical score and the tragedy of history. I watched it again on video recently. The soundtrack was poor and the picture grainy; but it's one of two movies I saw again the next day, the other is Gladiator. The music theme is intensely tragic, and one knows from the outset that it is called failure or death. Definitely one of George Sanders best performances; as a man working in the black market to get repaid for what he lost in the war, but nemesis is waiting; Patricia Roc plays a refugee from Eastern Europe eaten with despair. He is attracted to her, selflessly helping to help her and falling in love with her, but she is too proud and hurt to accept help. Their love destroys him, and inevitably the girl and the doctor (Herbert Marshall) who brought the nemesis. The story is of complex intertwined destinations where subsidiaries are not as they seem to be. This is like a movie that diappointed the critics and fought at the box office; But for the young person who saw it and the retired gentleman who saw it again, it is one of the greatest films (taking into account his age) whose history is more akin to an opera.
