This excursion by Knotts includes one of his best sidekicks ever, Frank Welker. Welker makes the film. Knotts and Welker compete for the laughs and both receive lots. Knotts works for a small "no where" city, where the city is run by some of the most ignorant officials. When things go wrong, the fathers bid that Knotts can take the fall. Frank Welker's character is friendly with Knotts and together they stumble together to clear the mess and Knot's good name. This movie shows the usual Knots frightened death figure that made him famous for years on television and film. This may have been Knott's last good outing. When you have an extra 90 minutes, get a good old-fashioned laugh a good icon, Don Knotts.
