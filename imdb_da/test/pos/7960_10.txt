A photographer in the small town of Gunsan in South Korea learns that he has a terminal illness, but shows it seriously to his family and friends. We never find out the nature of the disease, but the main group of Hur Jin's first first film Christmas in August is not his illness. It is the grace in which he performs his life - his ability to accept what life has in the store without regret. Unfortunately, it was the final movie shot by cinematographer Yoo Young-kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. The photographer Jung-won is played by Han Suk-kyu, at one time, Korea's most popular star. A beautiful man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to see him approaching the end of life. Jung-Won owns a small photographic store and lives at home with his hearing aid father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji-hye), teaches his father how to play movies on the VCR and writes instructions for him to take over his shop if he was to die. As Jung-won goes about the daily business to get his affairs in order, Dar-im (Shim Eun-ha), a meter reader, comes into his shop with an urgent request for some photographic magnifications. <Br /> <br /> Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with contempt but apologizes later and she becomes a regular customer. Without obvious expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their reason for being, the place where they come from. To protect Dar-im from suffering, Jung-won does not tell that he only has a short time to live, but it does not make it easier for her. Inevitably, his growing absence from the store makes her feel betrayed and frustrated at the point where she throws a stone through the shop window. Although Jung-won's decision to withhold his illness from Dar-im is open to questions, it feels organic to his character in the movie and is not only used as a plot unit or an excuse for the character to "live life to the full" by to play around. <br /> <br /> One of the most touching sequences in the movie is when an older woman returns to her studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jung-won ensures that the image is an accurate equation, knowing that he will soon take his own image of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious movie that never distinguishes the melodrama for making its point. It's about taking pleasure in ordinary moments: cycling, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being thoughtful and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It's a love story where love means having to say you're sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process, Christmas in August brings the genre into a new direction and gives an unforgettable comment on the human condition in the process. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the greatest joy.
