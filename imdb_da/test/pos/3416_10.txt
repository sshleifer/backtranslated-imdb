We watched this movie in Toronto at the film festival last year. It was a truly fluid experience. I had heard about the truth and the reconciliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and growth that can occur when people are able to meet their past, understand the events from the views of others involved and mourn. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in the development of the T&R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions. Seeing this movie gave me hope for humanity. If we can do T&R, we may not be destroying ourselves. People will look back on T and R as the first step out of human youth and towards maturity. <br /> <br /> Of course, as a film there were errors. I haven't noticed any major problems with shopping, managing or writing - but for the first time this year I was completely lost in a movie, so maybe I haven't noticed. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. The audience in Toronto would not give up on the stage for the next movie, we had so many questions and comments on stars and instructors. Tom Hooper, Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor went outside to the pavement to continue the conversation. People just came by shaking their hands and thanking them for the movie. It moved us all.
