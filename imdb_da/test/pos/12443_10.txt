From the golden period of British movies, this has my voice for one of the funniest of all times. The screen yesterday in my film association for a rapturous audience, I was astonished at how well the comedy has lasted (made in 1950!). It's really down to the expert timing and incomparable games from two of the finest actors Britain has produced: Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim. Adapted from a game by John Dighton, this farce is handled quickly by Director Frank Launder. The reason is simple: A ministry fault draws a girl's school at a boys school. I will always laugh when I think about this movie.
