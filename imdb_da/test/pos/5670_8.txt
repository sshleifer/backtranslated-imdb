This movie is a sleeper because Rod Steiger is the only big name in the credits. Yet all the supporting actors fit well with his character. It was appropriate that Rod Steiger in his last film reminded us of his ingenuity as an actor. He portrayed a grandfather's impulsivity, stubbornness, and acceptance of the end of life in a distinctive individual and convincing performance. Because his character was close to death, history brings us closer to the most valuable things given to us: the privilege of life, relationship with family members, and empathy for those who care. His quest along with his grand daughter for one of his sons gave enough excitement to keep me waiting and expecting a highly charged climax, such as the encounter of two widely separated, older lovers who were also on the death toll in "Forever Young". "I wondered how the meeting was to be arranged and how close my feelings would be when he and his grandchildren reached the end of his quest. I was happy to find out that the story brought more than I expected. nice satisfying climax brought to me a greater understanding of the value of the precious gifts of life, love and family enjoying today by me and by all of us.
