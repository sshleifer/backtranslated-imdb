The movie is not half as bad as people will make you believe it is. What is the reason why so many people hate this movie? Is it because it's Laurel & Hardy's last together and it's not their best? Or is it because of the lack of Laurel & Hardy regulars? Or because it's not made by Hal Roach studios or 20th Century Fox? <br /> <br /> Absolutely true that this movie is not a successful attempt to revive Laurel & Hardy and bring them to the 50s. It is also certain that the film is far from their best, but honestly, the film is still entertaining, making this film far from their worst. Not the most worthy farewell movie is imaginable but an entertaining and suiting farewell anyway. Both of them retired from movies after completing this one. <br /> <br /> The movie still contains some good slapstick moments, and the chain between Laurel & Hardy is still very much present. It also makes this movie better than most of their movies from the '40s. It's a surprise that slapstick humor still works as big as it does, considering that today's slapstick comedy has gone since the 30s. The story may not be as entertaining as it might have been, and it has too many sidekicks and characters, with the result that the film loses its focus on the boys at times. A shame because they are still the ones who really carry and make the movie. <br /> <br /> Sad to see in what bad shape Stan Laurel was at the time of making this movie. He looked really sick and old, as he was, of course. He was well over 60 years old already. But after an operation he went back completely and lived another 15 years before he died in 1965, eight years after his good friend Oliver Hardy. <br /> <br /> An entertaining but not perfect farewell to the boys, Laurel & Hardy and the end of 3 decades of fun, humorous, quality slapstick entertainment of movies still seen and loved by people all over the world . <br /> <br /> 7/10
