I've seen it a couple of times and are completely glued to it every time. It is very exciting and intense. Describing it sounds boring, but it's great. It's the kind of movie you need, can't miss anything, but if you suck it in, stick it with you long after it ends. Now I'm not even thinking what Stone was trying to make us see. Just the story of Alan Green? I do not think. It was a look at ignorance, stupidity, self-absorption and a guy who just lost his grip. Perhaps he had more grip than the listeners themselves. I didn't like Barry, but still seemed worried about him for some reason. I was confused about why I couldn't get him out of mind when the movie ended. I wish I could see inside Olive Stone's mind for this.
