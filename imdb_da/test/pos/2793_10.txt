I love this movie (don't know why it's called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish and totally irrelevant name!), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, ​​not as an Erasmus student, but living with other foreigners so it just felt the same. It brings back so many good memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries and the city itself. I really want to see the follow-up 'Les Poupees Russes' (the Russian dolls) I guess it won't be released here? My brother saw it in France and said it was not so good but had much of the same roll (Brother Wendy seems to be married). Anyone know anything about this movie? and whether it can be released?
