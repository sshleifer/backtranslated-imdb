I have always felt that Ms Merkerson never had a role to suit her skills. She is known to millions as Lt. On law and order, she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases, always in a supporting role. HBO's Lackawanna Blues change it and enable this talented actress to shine like Nanny, a successful entrepreneur in a world that changes from segregation to integration. But the story is really about the colorful array of characters she and she adopted son meetings in a guest house in Lackawanna, New York, a suburb of Buffalo. The story can be set in any major African-American community of the 50s and 60s from Atlanta's Sweet Auburn to New York's Harlem. But the segregation integration angle is just a subtle undercurrent in people's colorful lives at Nanny's guest house. The story is about the nanny's relation to all kinds of people played by some of the best actors in the company (I intentionally didn't say black actors - this ensemble is a fantastic selection of talents that are black, except Jimmy Smits, of course ) I recommend this movie as a fun and colorful look on a bygone day.
