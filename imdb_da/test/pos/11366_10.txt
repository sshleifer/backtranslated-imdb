I followed this whole series when I was a kid in school, by election, not because it was necessary for the school. I used to read the game in the pace of the series. The experience gave me a lifelong love for Shakespeare and history. It gave me a bit of a play, though only at an amateur level. When I read some of Shakespeare's story games, the pictures that first come to mind, first from this black and white production, are seen on a large "furniture" television set with a rabbit eye antenna with all the "ghosts" and wobbles that goes with it. <br /> <br /> Although the sets were minimal if I remember correctly, it was completely irrelevant because the play was so good. At that time, I had no idea who any of the actors were. Now I see that many of them have become known over the years. I especially enjoyed Hotspur and Hal, which I now see was played by Sean Connery and Robert Hardy. I would very much love to see this available in video, especially since many of the players are rarely performed and even fewer are available on video. It would also be valuable as a document on television production in the mid-20th century.
