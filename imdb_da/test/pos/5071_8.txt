CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal) gets to see his first secret site lookup when Anwar (Metwally) is accused of contacting a known terrorist bomb producer. Anwar's wife (Witherspoon) is busy with her husband's whereabouts. <br /> <br /> Don't you just hate when a movie title sends you to a dictionary? I need to have an old version as this rendition is not a musical piece. No, it's the government's way of lawfully taking a resident or citizen in a place to interrogate him and possibly use some torture to get the information requested. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I was reminded of a similar story in the Crossing Jordan TV show (now out of the air) and I expect we will see even more of these stories. It is inevitable. The events in 911 are the catalysts. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see because we don't like seeing people tortured and our government doesn't tell the truth about things. We like the idea that whatever happens or happened, we can go somewhere to find answers, but when the door is closed to us, we are really lost and hopeless, as Anwar's wife was. <br /> <br /> Performances by everyone were first class and it is possible we can see more of Igai Naor (I have no idea how to pronounce it) because he looks and can seem like Telly Savalas. You do not say. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Emergency: No, Language: Yes
