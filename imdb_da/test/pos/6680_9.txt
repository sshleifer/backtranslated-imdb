at least for me. and rather unexpectedly - a subject. a movie that makes you question your beliefs, your life, your approach to everything. It helps you see the world you live in through a lens - or a wide range of lenses ... a moving, surprising and scary movie. <br /> <br /> It benefits from one of the best performances ever made by Kevin Spacey. posted very well by Jeff Bridges. There is no false note in this tango. It is a perfect dance. perfect 'to the end. <br /> <br /> What reveals the end? well ... everything you want it to ... <br /> <br /> a movie you want to see again. Maybe not right away. maybe after a few days. months. years. But it's something to go - or come back to.
