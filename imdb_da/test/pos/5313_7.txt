After stabbing a retarded boy, the fifteen-year-old troubled and pessimistic Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to a youth prison. His teacher and aspirant writer Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle) is approaching and trying to understand him, first with the intention of writing a book and later becoming his friend. Leland slowly reveals her sad world view, showing that he is a sociopath. <br /> <br /> The "USA of Leland" is a depressive and interesting study of a character. The low tempo nineteen script describes pieces of history as a puzzle; there are good lines and dialogues; the performances are good, though the twenty-three year old Ryan Gosling does not convince as a fifteen-year-old teenager; but it seems that some are missing out on completing the puzzle and making "The United States of Leland" an unforgettable movie. The disappointing clarification of "why" for Leland's violent action against Ryan Pollard is not convincing or touching, in fact, shows that this character is a completely horrified sociopath with a weird and sick view of the world. Moreover, the way Allen Harris gets Perle's knife is ridiculous. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Mundo de Leland" ("The World of Leland")
