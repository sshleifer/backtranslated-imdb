Martin Ritts first film gives an exceptionally existential answer (three years later) to Elia Kazan's more conservative "On The Waterfront." While the "Waterfront" greatly benefited from an electrifying Marlon Brando, who unintentionally spoiled Kazan's offensive theme to try to justify naming names (as Kazan was eager for the House Un-American Activities Committee), "Edge of the City" boasts a young John Cassavetes and an upstart Sidney Poitier who dared to face issues not recognized by the "Waterfront", namely, labor rights and race. <br /> <br /> "Edge of the City" delves deep into this (then) unfamiliar area, and although the quite appealing black protagonist (Poitier) may seem a bit simplistic, the brave fight against thinly blurred bigotry and violence hardly been anywhere. One wonders how shocked initial 1957 movie players were in such a bold presentation of white-black relationships (if some of the bigoted did not leave the theater early, they must be left dumbfounded if not offended). <br /> <br /> The last wheel of the movie will still surprise the audience as it refuses to sink into expected clich√©s, including those who fainted the "Waterfront". Only the most jaded viewers will not realize what a radical and entertaining movie "Edge of the City" ends up with. <br /> <br /> What's most worrying about this lost classic: how unfortunately it is still unavailable in any format, for reasons that remain fairly cloudy. This movie should be required viewing in high school or college history classes across the country, but one can only find it on obscure sennat tv if ever at all.
