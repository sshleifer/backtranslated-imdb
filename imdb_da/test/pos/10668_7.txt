Posted by science fiction veterans Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. This space fantasy is appropriately directed by Robert Parrish. Experienced American astronaut stars Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) agree on a manned flight to the distant side of the sun. The mission will be managed by Jason Webb (Patrick Wymark) and his researcher John Cane (Ian Hendry), the Euro Sec Space Agency, will accompany Ross. The two will explore a newly discovered planet that is in the same identical orbit as Earth ... except it is always hidden on the other side of the sun. Ross is the only one to make it back to earth and has a very incredible story to tell. Special effects may be better than history. Nevertheless fun to watch. The molding also includes: Lynn Loring, Loni von Friedl, George Sewell and Herbert Lom.
