Watch No Evil is the first film from the WWE movie. Yes WWE, Word Wrestling Entertainment, pro wrestling. Of course, it's a WWE movie, a wrestler has to star in it, the wrestler is Glenn Jacobs aka Kane. It's not really important as if you didn't know Kane or what WWE stood for you, never knowing it had anything to do with the wild word of wrestling, as the movie has nothing to do with wrestling. See No Evil is brutal out horror movie, it has some moments were some people can jump, but mostly just say it, hi see how rough we can get! Not that there is anything wrong with it. Jacob Goodnight (played by Kane) is a kind of Jason type actor, his mother torturing him as a child of severe (subversive) Christian denominations and combing his mind. Now he's a big scary chopping killer. 90% of the film is in an abandoned hotel where Jacob steals six teenagers (surprised?) And a handful of adults. I could explain why they are in a scary old hotel but eh, who cares? Despite the lack of originality See No Evil is well made for what it should be. Kane plays a great killer and needs a little make up to be scary. An error in the movie is the most annoying option people survive, I really look forward to getting them to be terribly killed, but unfortunately it doesn't. I wish the movie did not have the stigma of wrestling attached to it, although I said, as I said, that the film has nothing to do with breaking, people are still closed-minded enough not to see it, because of course, if they are a wrestling hate. So again, the movie can also make money because Wrestling fans will see it. Either way, See No Evil has top notch effects and little CGI and, as I said, it's pretty brutal, so I say these are good things .... if you like that sort of thing.
