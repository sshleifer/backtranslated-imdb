Create Land. The title itself tells secret thoughts. And that's really what is at the heart of this Amnesty International movie. Government secrets, personal secrets, both are integrated pieces of this story. By far the greatest spectacle seen for too long was both Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe phenomenal in their depiction of a government interrogator and Heart respectively. With only the two actors in this unusual standard-length movie, it is instantly clear that both actors were dedicated and talented enough to pull the viewer into this little bubble in a world and close the door. <br /> <br /> A word of caution ... <br /> <br /> What is not mentioned in the description of this movie is that there is a subplot that deals with sexual abuse of childhood. Although there are no graphical details of abuse, it may be difficult for some viewers to look at it - especially considering the intensity of the movie. I'm not a big fan of Amnesty International movies, but this movie penetrated me because the play was so unusual and I can't help making this movie one of my personal favorites.
