Not everyone likes this movie. It is still one of the best "you should think" movies about Satanism ever made. The fact that it does not have MTV jumps or does every seven minutes is irrelevant. Speaking as someone who actually knows Satanists, it's (spoiler warning!) Part of the movie, where the fraternity exchanges their old bodies with the pre-Christian children, it has some really scary scenes. The section where (second spoiler alert) Stror Martin orchestras transition is almost hyperreal, using very few special effects, a hallmark of this movie. McEveety was rarely given a large budget, but was often effective. It also worked in this case.
