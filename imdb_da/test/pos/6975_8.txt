I have a letter from Mrs. Knight who went to college with my older sister. In it she tells about the difficulty of making this movie. She was pregnant herself - an interesting connection with the movie's plot - and the novice director was uncertain, fairly green and had great difficulties with all decisions, logistics, etc. They were on the go all the time and it was a very difficult shooting. <br /> <br /> The movie, however, with a strong debut for James Caan, remains effective and influential. It is a great showcase for the talent that Mrs Knight has demonstrated throughout her career - on television, in movies and on stage, where she won Tony for "Kennedy's Children". <br /> <br /> This movie has a good age.
