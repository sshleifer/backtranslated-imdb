We saw this movie in my chemistry class, so of course it had educational value. I thought the film did a really good job of blending science, moral issues, and personal experiences from the Manhattan project together, but wasn't exactly focused on strong traders. I would recommend this movie to the scientifically inclined or those interested in the moral issues behind Fat Man and Little Boy, but if the subject of atomic bombs drills you, you can't see it.
