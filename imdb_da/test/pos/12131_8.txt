I agree with Vince, this movie paved the way for Goodfellas. The scene where Pesci threw peanuts on the piano player reminded me of his "How am I fun?" routine in Goodfellas. This is a very underrated movie and deserves some attention. As with many other mob movies, the theme calls The Death Collector true: Always respect Don.
