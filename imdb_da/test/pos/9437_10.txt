Do you like explosions? What about the games? Well, this movie has both of these. You know the other thing you can't have a movie without: a kick ass motorcycle, the type that jumps out of someone's head and knocks them out at the same time. You bet the stabilizer has one. There is even a classic rock scene. All in all, I am quite proud that I have seen this movie myself ... and even to get my review to be the first ... YES!
