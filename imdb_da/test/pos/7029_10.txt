<br /> <br /> When this movie was released, I dismissed as lightweight pop nonsense. It was a mistake. <br /> <br /> After repeated views and seeing a documentary about making DIRTY DANCING, the depth of this movie certainly discovers its appeal. <br /> <br /> DIRTY DANCING is a film about change. The evolving nature of relationships within the family, the changes in world views of their oldest years, etc. The story takes place in August 1963, last weeks in innocence for the American people last summer. The many personal changes that the people experience reflect the many changes in American society that would be marked by the Kennedy murder and Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Female movie guests loved this movie and repeated trips to the movie houses made it is the world's most successful dance movie. As a man, I find the romantic mating of ultimate stud Patrick Swayze with very ordinary Jennifer Gray very difficult to accept. This would be fatal for most romantic dramas, and it could also have created the intense reluctance expressed by most male reviewers. <br /> <br /> The movie's soundtrack found status # 1 before the release of the movie. So far, it is almost impossible to attend a wedding reception without hearing a DIRTY DANCING song. Near the center of the movie, the baby's mother wakes up and asks Baby's father, "Is there anything wrong?" <Br /> <br /> The children's father, the family member for change, tries to keep everything that happens a secret. He tells his wife to go back to sleep. But resist as you can, change is unstoppable. DIRTY DANCING is the story that a person wakes up at the last moments of our country's last sleep in innocence.
