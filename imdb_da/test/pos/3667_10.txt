Too bad someone didn't have smarts to release this movie into theaters. I had never heard of it since it seemed on cable. After the first shock to realize it is not like any other movie you have seen since Bringing Up Baby, you must let it sweep you together and run with it. Not until it's over, you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better. The whole cast has the feel of the plot and knows what they are doing without putting on gratuitous hamming, except where required, as with Julie Andrew's bits or Jonathan Pryce's rental videos. If you are not open, you will not get it. (See Mark Adnum's bizarre review, which he uses to move by Stephanie Beacham, her career and brother's OBE to introduce vegetable oil or something to the islanders' natives.) When I take it as a sign, I might as well spend time on practicing Amo Gulinello's stellar cameo as a television station internal or Jack Noseworthy's shower scene. So, throw away all previous concepts of movie movie comedy and have a good time. I loved it.
