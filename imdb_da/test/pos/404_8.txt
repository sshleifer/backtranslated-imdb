I saw it on TCM recently, and through IMDb I found that there were seven "Crime Doctor" films with Warner Baxter as a psychiatrist detective. Baxter is a little long in the tooth compared to his sturdy performance in 42nd Street a decade earlier. Noir, and a little campy today, the film also has a touch of the possible supernatural. The reason, black and white filmography and characters are far more complex than those in Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan series. There are subplots, unexpected twists and appearances of a number of B movies stalwartly we should all recognize immediately (no one ever made it to A status). It is a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> I would love to see a boxed DVD series of these movies.
