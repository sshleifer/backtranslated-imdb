Does anyone know why this movie is called the sofa trip? I just looked at it and am still not sure why this title was picked the movie was very fun and it is probably my favorite Dan Aykroyd performance, it even knocks out his Ghostbusters performance, I had never heard of the movie before I saw it in a sears store I read my back and thought it sounded good so I bought it and when I finally got a chance to see it, I thought it was better than what I had originally expected. this movie rates as good as animal house and national lampoon holiday in my mind i want comedies that have come out lately were written as well as this was nothing sad and the bad things happening are also fun parts if any others feel this way and would like to read a comedy script for a movie that does not have a sad situation in the mail me at killer2511@hotmail.com
