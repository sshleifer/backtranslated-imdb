Blue ribbon banners, stars and stripes forever, decorated generals and unconditional surrender from the enemies that demanded tons and tons of radiation, this was the sum of the American victory in World War II !! The celebration at Times Square as well as anywhere in the US suggests a national zenith !!! America is at the top right !! one thing, a disturbing and carefully perverted thing. The period of adaptation !! .. The actual party ended when the bottle of champagne was finished. Now all people have to continue with their lives ... only one problem though ... they must have new life ... the old life is gone forever ... polite and pleasant smile had a fragile facade with a long life of ice cubes in boiling water !! All the characters in the film are the paradise of primal doubt and unable to mask a feeling of how nothing was seriously wrong, for the simple reason that it was not true !!! When sergeants and generals and their wives and daughters and sons and virtually all other Americans affected by World War II were exposed to disability, nightmares and World War II recognition, and what it really did and neglected, none was the same !! For now social and moral issues had a self-interest ... Frederick March and Myrna Loy had to start !! Dana Andrews realized that he should never have been married to Virginia Mayo in the first place !!! Theresa Wright has become painfully aware that she is constructively selfish !! Late but not least, the character Homer is getting married, and he thinks that everyone around him is so devastated by his injury as he is, essentially in the sense that they cannot or are not able to handle !! The reason why this movie is so fabulous is that a happy ending was reached in the hard way, as everyone realized the new beginning of the new United States and the new world in general, the Second World War tragedy was recognized. and things that were emotionally torn down were taken up and treated accordingly! Frederick March and Myrna Loy have to go back to Chapter 1 in their marriage, Homer has apprised his new break on what is required to be married to him (ie, half of the times she will feel like a nurse ) and Thresa Wright's engagement with Dana Andrews means that her access to adulthood has resulted in partial responsibility for breaking a marriage ... This means learning to drive to get your driver's license at Indianapolis 500 ... The characters in the movie is typical post WWII Americans knowing they are stalemated by the rude awakening of coercive changes in their lives ... Happiness is no longer given the luxury of the adjective cop-aesthetic ... it's now about formidable conditions and good winner besides evil by the less ugly choice !! ... World War II didn't just happen !! It will dominate the social patterns in American life in the future !!! <br /> <br /> The global disaster of the Second World War has reflected most Americans' feelings of personal human deficiencies too !! I loved this movie, and so did AFI, probably for the reason that it brought problems that were at once unjustified taboo !! .. Bottom line, watch this movie !! Nightmare about struggle, dilemmas about marital accident and / or adjustment, dealing with your life when it is hit by a disability and just basic man-made people, is constantly being exhibited in movies and television today, BUT !! this is 1946 !! Very new to the Americans so .... REMEMBER THAT !! Director William Wyler has illustrated how Americans feel about the aftermath of World War II in the days when the film industry has left him with one hand tied behind his back !!! Take it into consideration and you will probably realize how sensational this movie really was !!
