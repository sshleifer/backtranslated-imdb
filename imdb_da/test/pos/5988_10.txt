This is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time! The director did a wonderful job of contrasting social classes, a situation that is very relevant in France today. All the characters are lovable, especially Juliette and her family. The development of romance, though not entirely realistic, is at least plausible, and it does a wonderful job showing how much people will change to love. I found this to be a heart-warming Cinderella story - but one in which Cinderella is a strong woman in herself. I laughed throughout this movie and absolutely loved it. I recommend Romuald et Juliette to anyone who enjoys unique characters, comedy and non-traditional romance.
