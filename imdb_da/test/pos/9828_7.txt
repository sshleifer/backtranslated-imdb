Of all the actresses in film today, Kristin Scott Thomas would be my choice if I were to choose one for stranding on a desert island. I could see her just say, sit in a chair for a couple of hours. So it's hard for me to be objective completely with regard to one of her films. But I enjoy this movie and its history in itself more than the one indicated by the average ranking of many people who have previously commented on this site. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford is not one of the actors whose performances I enjoy most. But he is one of a handful who has reached the level of moving from 7 figures to 8 per. Movies, so who should I argue for? Ford though often droll in his acting style, and sometimes seems to be in serious need of an antacid and a shot of caffeine - and "random hearts" is in this grouping. His occupation examines the losses that both he and Thomas have endured with regard to their relationship spouses are understandable, given his profession as a detective - but not to the level presented here. Although not long, it crossed the line into the "annoying" category. <br /> <br /> But most scenes after he and Thomas were involved were interesting and well-maintained. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a 9 *, but I would lower it a few levels based on Ford's overall performance, and another because it contained a bit more of the alien subplot elements than seemed necessary.
