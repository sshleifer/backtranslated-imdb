My mother and I went to Ft Worth Premiere mainly to see George Strait but ended up getting the chance to watch movie prizes at Bass Hall. What a wonderful, beautiful film that not only portrays the beautiful Texas landscape but also had a good emotional history. It was well written, directed and produced, and my mother and I loved it from start to finish! Thanks Jay for allowing us to be part of the premiere of this wonderful movie. It was one night we will never forget. As if we didn't see the movie, we were lucky enough to sit 4 rows in front of my favorite singer, George Strait !! Thanks, thank you, thank you !! Keep up the great work and again, thank you! <br /> <br /> Debbie McClendon & Maureen Daugherty Ft. Worth, TX
