No, I haven't seen the original series, and I won't compare the two if I had. This series is recorded in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well written in another story every week. Some are a little out there, but most of the time, the quality of the story is narrative. I loved the episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and Deprogrammer's episode of the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a wild animal reptile species. It's fun how lizards and reptiles are our favorite aliens like V, but yet he has three days to program a man who is completely brainwashed in serving alien species on earth. The stories are usually a bit out there but very entertaining to see.
