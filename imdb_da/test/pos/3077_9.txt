This movie was great if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then it's right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something that the whole family can enjoy and have a good laugh at. I first watched this movie when I was about 10 and got most of it. This movie is also great because it's fun of all involved: "By order of the King's Finance Secretary H and R Blockhead?" Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes (Robin Hood) in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with "Claw" or Saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth seeing
