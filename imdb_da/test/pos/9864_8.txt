I'm a huge M Lillard fan, why I ended up watching this movie. Honestly, I doubt that if he wasn't in the movie, I'd have had it so much or even seen it, but when I looked it in, the story was pretty decent. A bad end I must say, but I saw it coming. It's a low-budget movie, and some of the actors were not really good, but overall, I considered this movie 7/10. The excitement of wondering what Lillard actually was about was what really interested me in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
