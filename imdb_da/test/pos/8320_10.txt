"Walking with Dinosaurs" is absolutely brilliant in every respect. Kenneth Branagh tells in a way that really makes you want to listen. The scripture script really sounds as if the researchers and the authors had done their homework, it is so insightful and it makes you hang and never let go. The music is also brilliant, very dramatic when it needs to be. But the visual effects and nature are what make this documentary work so good. The scenery is breathtaking and the dinosaurs look so right, thanks to the simply amazing effects. This is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but also children. In conclusion, this is a must see. I didn't just love this, but it's probably the best documentary I've ever seen. If anything, it could have done longer, except that this is perfect. 10/10 Bethany Cox
