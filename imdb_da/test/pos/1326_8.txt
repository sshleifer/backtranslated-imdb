I just want to point out (besides requesting the series to be released on DVD) that a show doesn't have to be realistic to be entertaining. These days, with all the blood and do in the news and in criminal dramas, reality shows, etc. It is great to get lost in a good, cheesy show with entertaining characters. PWOG fits the bill. Was it Emmy material? No, but it was just amazing. <br /> <br /> I also have to vote for the second cast - they were more charismatic than cast in season 1. I would definitely agree that the first season had a more serious mood than the other two, but I was definitely more sucked in by the latter cast. Although the series has been out in the air for years, I will never stop hoping that it will be released for purchase.
