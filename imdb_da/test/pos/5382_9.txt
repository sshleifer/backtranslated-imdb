Man! I remember this show with nostalgic ... I really dug Bravestarr because he wasn't the conventional hero. He was more than a futuristic Texas cowboy. The man had the strength of a bear, the vision of a ride, and the agility ... I can't remember it. <br /> <br /> The action sequences were good! I remember that Bravestarr would always use his bazooka called SARAJUANA (translated into Spanish) every time he was in big trouble. <br /> <br /> This was a quality campaign. I loved the characters, the dialogues, the music and of course the opening credits order! Brave Starr! Long live to him. A cult classic in my opinion and a must see.
