The movie was excellent, save some of the scenes with Esposito. I enjoyed it with every detective on the series and wrapped some plotlines that were never resolved during the series (thanks to NBC ...). It was great to see Pembleton and Bayliss together with their most human and most basic people. Braugher and Secor did a good job, but as usual they are overlooked. It was a pity to see that this was the end of the murder. Memories, tapes and reruns on CourtTV are just not the same as seeing it come on every Friday. But the film did its job and did very well and presented a great portrayal of life after Al retired, and the family relationship that existed between the unit. I enjoyed it very much.
