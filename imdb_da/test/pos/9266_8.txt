This movie is so different from everything you would have seen before. It is an honest and chilling account of a whole family's struggle with a terminal illness. <br /> <br /> 'The Closer She Gets' is shot in a very unique style. Craig Oulette movies in a very different way .... using different angles and views, in what I find is a very conspicuous way (perhaps because of his experience with photographic works). <br /> <br /> His style gives such a clear picture of not only what the patient is facing, but what the loved ones close to her should also deal with. <br /> <br /> A very sad but extremely interesting and unique movie. One I would definitely suggest seeing.
