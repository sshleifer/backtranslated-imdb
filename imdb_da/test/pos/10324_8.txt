Clyde Bruckman borrows the premise for this short from Buster Keaton's "seven chances", which was recently made as "bachelor". In the original, Buster has 24 hours to get married to inherit a large sum of money. In this version, music teacher has Prof. Shemp only 7 hours (that's short!). This is one of the better Stooges shorts because of the story and the wonderful routines (including the phone booth scene with Moe & Shemp, reminiscent of Laurel & Hardy's "Berth Marks" and Marx Brothers famous statue scene in "Night At The Opera - here the boys keep themselves in their variation in this routine.) I'm not a big Stooges fan, but this should be noted by any comedy student as one of their very best since the early 30's shorts.
