Very memorable comedy. It is fun to see the many situations evolve and eventually converge after a long journey on the largest collection of eclectic humanity (and the world's largest honky tonk) - the great American highway. Like "... crazy, crazy world", it has lots of contemporary talent, old-fashioned politics, good comedic action and dialogue. Unlike one, it is the goal that seeks, not the ignorant asylum seekers - they have no idea what they really want, as they drive along America's great road. It also doesn't bear the weight of having a big fall guy, which is only spared at last by a large stomach grin. But the final stunt sequence is nothing short of spectacular with excellent movie editing, humor and timing, and the metropolitan scene is hilarious with very original features of a very talented character. The city's total inhabitants in the light of chaos leave a feeling like the famous fly in the attic. Slapsticket is fun, but Honky Tonk Freeway deserves to be heard and watch closely, because it is surprisingly full of nuance and character reactions that can easily be missed. All in all, a very fun reflection of who we were and are, good or bad, and the stupid situations we are in. It was just supposed to be FUNNY and it is!
