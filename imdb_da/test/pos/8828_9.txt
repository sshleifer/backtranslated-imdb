I highly recommend it to anyone who likes good plots, good actors (though not known) (often it is just that way), science and / or science fiction presented intelligently on the screen (small) itself if they didn't have billions of dollars to produce it ... <br /> <br /> much better than any war in the stars ... <br /> <br /> there was only one comment that was not necessary : Talking about the comet says the comment that Life might be brought to earth through a comet ... it's fun, there must always be a chance for a magical way, huh? Life is so good, can come anywhere, without the need for external strength
