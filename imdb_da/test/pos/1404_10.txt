Was hit on where even the play was throughout. William Haines had a play that is great for silent movies. Not over the edge. There are moments where the camera's work is most excellent and combined with the story, which, when waiting to see the superintendent, very well done. <br /> <br /> Thoroughly enjoyed the girl. <br /> <br />
