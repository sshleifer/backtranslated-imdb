This 1955 Producer's Showcase version of the musical Peter Pan with Mary Martin has the benefit of presenting most of the original Broadway cast, including Kathleen Nolan as Wendy, who was more naturally an actress than the girl they hired for the 1960s. TV playback. It is a shame that most people will no longer sit in black and white because in many respects this past production - which does not even appear in the IMDb lists when you put "Peter Pan" in the search engine! - is better than the more beautiful color version most people have seen. I got the original on disk and then worked on it to make it look and sound better digital. Now, when I put the 1960 color version on it, it seems to be skewed in comparison. I suspect that Mary Martin himself undoubtedly preferred this original 1955 w / w Producers' Showcase TV version. As an added plus, the disc I got was also shown the original advertisements and opening promo. How far away the 1950s are now - such an innocent time compared to today. I miss it.
