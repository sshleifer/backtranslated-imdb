John Cusack is stars like hoops in this stupid little movie that must be one of the best in the eighties of teens. Rate it or not Demi Moore is his co-star ... If you love the eighties, grew up around that time, or are an anxiety ridden teenage artist getting ready to laugh. Violence until you see the drawings .. what a rebellion ....
