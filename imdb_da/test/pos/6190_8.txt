To be honest, I was totally fascinated by the original concept of "Sleeper Cell." After seeing the best part of the series on the FX Channel (UK), my Sky became soft, meaning I missed the deciding final. But what I saw out of it, I assumed it was a great story line, good acting, and since I didn't see '24', I thought it was great and it has been confirmed in another season ... <br /> <br /> One of the best TV shows I've seen. Much more realistic and credible than "24." Excellent character development and plot line. Does not base Islam, but gives a thoughtful and contemplated approach that shows the difference between radical terrorist Islam and true Islam. Everyone should see this show! <br /> <br /> Stringy xx
