This movie starts when it ends and ends when it starts. What is in the middle is a collection of comedy, philosophy, music, observations, comments, mini stories, color and much more. It looks at the world and our lives and tells The Monkee's story from the very members of the group. It also looks at TV and movies and gives a visual comment. It also shocks with war scenes and shows how we are just a farmer in a big game. It says all this and much more, but if you don't look objectively at it, you don't see much more than scenes striving together to join the music. It's the kind of movie that never gets boring because it's so cleverly done.
