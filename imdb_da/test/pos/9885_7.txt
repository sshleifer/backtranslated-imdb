In "Checking Out" Peter Falk plays an older New Yorker calling his children home so they can be with him before he plans to commit suicide. As the film progresses, we see everybody's mistakes and other problems. While some people may interpret this as a "heartbreaking" movie, I have the most for Peter Falks characters, and it does not allow anything to get him down and even engage in a bit of bias now and then. <br /> <br /> So it may not be the best movie ever, but still worth seeing. I have long believed that Peter Falk has the perfect look to play this kind of role, what about his glasses and everyone. Also contributing to Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold and Shera Danese (Falk's real wife).
