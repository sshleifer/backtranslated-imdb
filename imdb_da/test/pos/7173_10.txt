This is the underrated Kellie Martin's best role. Based on a true story, it tells the story of Fusia's attempt to save the members of the Diamond family and other Jews she meets over time. One of my all-time favorite movie scenes involves a heroic action from Fusia's little sister. All children should see this scene role models as this is very few and far between. The film is well written and acted. I'm a movie lover and this movie I rate a 10 on imbd's rating system. It's on my top 25 movies all the time and must be posted on video. <br /> <br /> Mike Porter
