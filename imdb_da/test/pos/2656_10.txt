Spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> 2001: A Space Odyssey is undoubtedly the most challenging and successful movie of late Stanley Kubrick. This is not a movie you are looking to be entertained or entertained. Instead, it gives you a banquet of food for thoughts, pictures that lie in the eye of thought long after the film itself is over. It's a movie that you can meditate on. <br /> <br /> The film deliberately gives us more questions as it can answer, it is made for puzzles and mystify, yet leaves the viewer a sense of awe and reverence (it allows him to engage in watching what enjoyment of this movie requires some effort on the viewers) are the issues that it poses, large and unfortunate in terms of human origin and destiny, it is the ultimate place in the cosmic design and existence or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself. <br /> <br /> The first of the four Quartets films gives us a clear picture of the species past. We see our distant ancestors, half-legged half-human, in a state of near hunger. The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian animals are near hunger. An extremely objective, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith appears, and at the same time the animals are inspired by its presence for tooling and violence. They are transformed overnight into carnevores, and when two strains meet each other near a water source, the trunk that has developed tool capacity as well as location destroys the nearby strain. The new head of the winning tribe, empowered by the first technologies, triumphantly tells the leg he used as a weapon in the air. We see the bone transformed into a floating satellite that contains nuclear weapons. We soon learn that the world is torn apart by nuclear energy. The properties inspired by the monument's appearance, which once helped us survive, now threaten our existence. <br /> <br /> Once again, mankind is in crisis, again the innocent presence represented by the black monolith will come in to help humanity in the next step in its development. An exploration of the moon reveals a monolith identical to the one we have seen before. World governments, usually deadly enemies, are gathered in the secret to discuss the consequences. A mission is arranged. The monument has been involved in a kind of radio communication with Jupiter. A few men will travel to the transmission destination. Most of them will mostly be kept in a state of suspended animation. The pilot of the spacecraft will be HAL a supercomputer programmed to mimic all human traits. <br /> <br /> The movie has many excellent sequences. As usual for Kubrick, the use of classical music is excellent. Most memorable is the "Blue Danube" and "Also Spake Zarathustra" (especially appropriate considering the theme of the movie to transcend ordinary consciousness.) The camera is also extremely outstanding. After a single show, the movie's last 30 minutes will haunt you for the rest of your life. <br /> <br /> The HALS character is the most important from the screen of the film's central treatise. In imitating all people's traits, he will also have their negative qualities. The paranoia he develops, almost leading to the destruction of the mission, is an accurate mirror of the paranoia, which has left the political situation on the ground to reach a point of desperate crisis. The film suggests that these are the traits we must leave if we are to move on to the next phase of our development. <br /> <br /> The film's architecture is also meaningful. The design of many of the spacecraft is intended to suggest reproductive organs and the birth and rebirth process, the central motif of the film. The end of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This movie is similar to what is presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and James Joyce's novel Finnegan's Wake. It is a pattern of history and human development that is cyclical, but progressive, repeats the same events at large intervals, but with humanity as evolving in accordance with the will of a being with greater purpose in mind. Although we never learn what this purpose is, the film guarantees that humanity is not intended for failure, it is fate that is greater than its ability to imagine. It continues to amaze me that many, despite this film, continue to view Kubrick as a misanthrope. <br /> <br /> This is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adhering to any particular belief, but because of that, invoking wonder at the great existence and it's involvement in the deepest and most vital issues about purpose and truth. <br /> <br /> In the hands of any other director, this might be a little too much. Hollywood's view of life is too nice, usually to include the grandeur and intensity of a vision like this. But Kubrick was a visionary, he leads with full confidence, not only that he can handle such material, but that he is the only one who does it. The process of making this movie used all his creative resources. The writing partnership with Arthur C Clarke is the most fruitful in film history. Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects used in the movie's amazing climax. The resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time, so he led them to reality. 2001 is a completely unique movie experience. Those who miss it do so at the expense of their own intellectual and imaginative abilities.
