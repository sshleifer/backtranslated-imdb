Brilliant Aussie movies ... A little slow at first, but when it comes, you can't stop laughing. When I first saw the movie, I knew the plot line wildly, since I'm not sure many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story, and especially the director and his mother (of course names changed). I only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family. When I watched the movie, my crowd kept it secret that we were going to meet Matthew Newton after the screening ... Such a lovely gentleman (except for a particularly eerie incident with his ex)! Brillian casting also with Sam Neill and others! A great reason to continue to support the Australian film industry
