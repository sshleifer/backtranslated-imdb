A fierce cynical, sarcastic and intense movie, mocking and imitating the style of Pulp Fiction and stylized gangster movies, is an entertaining, off-putting and hilarious thrill on Thursday. An amazing eclectic mix of over-the-top characters and bizarre entertaining situations, shows this day-in-life of a gun trying to go straight out, to be a worthy addition to the series of movies trying to imitate Tarantinos genius dark-haired masterpiece Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br /> Nick (Aaron Eckhardt) stops by Casey's (Thomas Jane) house to catch up with ancient times. Casey was a former trucker for drug dealers who have since reformed, become an architect, married a successful businesswoman (Paula Marshall) and are now considering adopting a child. Nick, still tied to the gangster underworld, leaves a briefcase full of stuff in Casey's house while he borrows his car to run a few errands ?? among other things unfinished business. Disgusted and angry at the introduction of drugs in his home, Casey flushes them all down the kitchen sink. It is then, one at a time, Nick's double-crossed accomplice, rapping Rastafarian drops, and crooked police will all knock on the unsuspecting Casey, who must have an incredible Thursday. <br /> <br /> movie opens with a hilarious sequence in a gas station where Nick is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee. After considering what size cup to get, a failure breaks out with the cashier when he requires a free snackie cake and spends a $ 50 bill to pay. As a result of comically radiant bloodshed, the situation goes from bad to worse when a police officer intervenes and is trapped in the most unusual circumstances. This opening segment creates the perfect mood for the rest of the movie, which never takes itself too seriously and contains monstrous characters that seem self-conscious about their own existence in this invisible gangster flip. <br /> <br /> The movie is divided into segments based on different events and times during one day. This effect is much like Pulp Fiction, which is a similar chapter, although Thursday does not destroy chronological order except for occasional flashback. Just as Tarantino introduces music to every stage and every character. Strangely humorous creatures, like the Jamaican hitman's pizza deliveryman, raping over the phone and sharing his hash, and Paulina Porizkov's narcissistic Dallas, who are trying to rape Casey, add humor to every event, no matter how awful and unnerving some of those coincidences are. When Mickey Rourke's quiet strangling-chilling quirky politician Kasarov is introduced, the cautious staging and intricate setup is fully fitted, and Casey's adhesive situation becomes even more bold and dignified. <br /> <br /> Absolutely a wannabe Pulp Fiction with lots of violence, witty dialogue and extremely creepy antagonists, Thursday does some thing right, but other attempts at greeting must go just far enough to suggest rip-off. A flashback sequence that shows Casey shoots evil and sports a hairstyle that exactly fits John Travolta's doing in Pulp Fiction is easily a step too far. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie, www.MoviePulse.net
