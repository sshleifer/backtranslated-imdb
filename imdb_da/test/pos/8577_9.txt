Personally, I think the movie is pretty good. It speaks almost a 8. I liked the ethnographic aspect as well as the beautiful photograph. Colin Firth's character is not the most sympathetic, but he does a better than decent job with the role. Heroine, played by the beautiful Nia Long, is a well-known movie hero because she tries to do what she thinks is best for her child - to marry a respected member of her alien society - while fighting for her attraction for "bad" man - one who is not a member of his community ("outsider"). Most of the film is about this mother's struggle: should she do what is expected of her, what she thinks is best for her son or should she follow her heart? I will not give the end. Let me just say that it is a good movie with beautiful spotlights, exquisite African dress (it is worth watching the movie only for women's brilliant African clothing and headgear) and similar characters overall. The actor playing Nia Long's son is bright and sweet. The reason is a bit formal, but I liked the movie anyway. If you're a Colin Firth fan, watch this movie. If you like smart flicks, watch it. I think I'll see it again tonight!
