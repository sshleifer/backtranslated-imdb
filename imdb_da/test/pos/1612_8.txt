Thomas Mann's controversial novel is the basis of the film "A Death in Venice." Although in the book, the hero is a writer, in the movie director Luchino Visconti, who also wrote the manuscript, transforming him into a composer. As such, the author / composer Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde) on the border of mental exhaustion is a burnt-out craftsman. After a long and successful career, peace and quiet are now seeking a less hectic life. He decides to go on vacation to Venice, where he hopes to rejuvenate his dwindling ambition. However, he catches the attention of a beautiful young teenage girl, Tadzio (Björn Andrésen), who keeps an eye on curious interest and immediately knocks him off while staying at the picturesque seaside resort. Even though Gustav is imprisoned by the wonderful youth, he must still find a private time away from the boy's governor (Nora Ricci), while having to cope with an invading plague that seems to have attacked the city. The film dialogue, like the short story, remains subtle, just as they get short meetings between the boy and the artist. Finally. The audience, unlike the book, is hampered by innuendos and imaginative flights of fancy. Their affair has never been given wing, matter or opportunity, and if it was not for the short decision in the book, the film only allows 'what if.' Nevertheless, one can sympathize with the hero and wish him a moment of peace to achieve what is forbidden, elusive, but certainly criticized by prying eyes. Fantastic history and a Bogarde Classic. ****
