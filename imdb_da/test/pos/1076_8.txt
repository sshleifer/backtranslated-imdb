A very interesting documentary - certainly much more than Sideways, a pseudo-wino drama - where the capitalist conspiracy is revealed in all its greed. According to the documentary - and confirmed by the recent release of a biography of Parker - only two men dictate the nature of wines in the world: Robert Parker of Massachussets and Michel Rolland, a French wine industry expert based in Bordeaux and also known as a "flying wine producer" . The director is clever enough to deploy interviews with local wine producers from many different regions of France, from Sicily to Argentina and interviews with the major industry players such as the Mondavi family to uncover the globalization of wine making and marketing. One must look for everyone interested in the dark side of the industry. Drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial action after seeing this well-structured documentray.
