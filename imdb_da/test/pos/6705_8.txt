Something I think some people miss about great science fiction is that it predicts some of the future. No other theater movie that I remember predicted that when the space shuttle went to study Halley's Comet, a disaster would occur! Some differences were: "Churchill" (the shooter in the movie) actually went to the comet, "Challenger" was only in low ground; "Churchill" was burned out only while "Challenger" exploded - hey vampires had to come back to earth. A great resemblance (and it's always unfortunate!) Both had mixed male / female crews - the legend of Halley's comet and disaster continues! <br /> <br /> Apart from this, there is little more to say about this movie that has not been said before. As an outer space / science fiction / horror / sex movie individually it gave nothing really new, but as in all good dishes it is the combination that counts. And together, it was a very original and satisfying combination. <br /> <br /> I just wanted Mathilda May to drain his victims through another part of the body!
