The biggest tragedy about this thoroughly delightful movie is its lack of American distribution. I was lucky enough to watch this movie at the Boston International Festival of Women's Cinema and recommend it to anyone who gets a chance to see it. Amazing performances and thoughtful manuscripts and good direction from the talented and fun Rose Troche combine all to make this movie a winner!
