I don't think I want to include any spoiler, but if I do, I can cover my ass. "The last American virgin" came in a time when such a teenager came in age / high school sex romps were rave. Movies like "Prepies" (1984), "Hot Times" (1974) and the popular "Porky's" (1981) made a lot of money. Yet it is the "last American virgin" who actually has a more serious plot history in the midst of nudity and sexual situations. It is the often told tale of three colleges who want to lose their virginity. They go to the wrong places (prostitutes), the dangerous (older woman with jealous girlfriend) and the comfortable ones (lure their high school female colleagues). The movie has many fun moments, and although the cast didn't produce a single big movie star, it's worth remembering a fantastic 80s soundtrack that includes: Devo, The Cars, Journey and others. Today, standards are raunchy and may have received an NC-17 rating, but are a well-informed story of how sometimes personal fixation can only cause pain while love can be right in front of us. It's a small piece of 80s Americana and worth having in your movie collection.
