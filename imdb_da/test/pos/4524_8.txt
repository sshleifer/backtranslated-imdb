taking into account the Chan movies that would follow, it is not bad. Lots of stereotypes that begin with the black man in the beginning and when the police captain orders that "every Hindu in the city" be rounded. A parade of stereotypical characters enters the scene, including the Shemp of the Three Stooges. Charlie seems to move quickly around the city that goes from Sutton Pl. to W. Village in a flash.The end is stupid. An obvious toy airplane is used as it climbs through the sky and then nasal duck. Ed Wood couldn't have done better. The final scene is absurd, as the killer will apparently incite himself in his attempt to calm the one who knows his identity. Overall, it is worth seeing.
