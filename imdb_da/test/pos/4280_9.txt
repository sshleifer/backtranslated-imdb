Those who do not like this movie seem to think that a loved one somehow "hears" them and should be discarded if they go out with someone else. Fortunately, human nature is far deeper than that; To love someone deeply inevitably brings suffering - even if we are only lucky at their death. <br /> <br /> This film is true in the setting, atmosphere and dialogue of Nigel Balkin's original novel ('A Way Through The Wood') and by identifying a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma captures the quiet desperation that lies behind many Apparently idyllic life (and the picture of English upper class country life is very accurate). <br /> <br /> I loved the movie and hope it will appear soon as a British compatible DVD
