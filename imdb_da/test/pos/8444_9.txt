Reporter Kimberly Wells presents the smaller side of the news; puff pieces that do not keep much novelty profit. While recording on alternative energy on a nuclear power plant, an accident occurs. Friend and cameraman to Kimberly, Richard Adam's movie illegally the men who control the incident in the control room. Jack Godell, head of the control room prevents the reactor from disaster. After an investigation of the incident shows nothing is wrong, Jack cannot help but feel something is not right. By discovering that the welding gaskets on the generator pump are cracked, Jack seeks Kimberly and Richard to tell the public and close the insecure plant. Almost 30 years ago, The China Syndrome is a nit drama that still has so much relevance today. Nuclear energy has always been the subject of debate whether it is the safest source of alternative energy, radioactive waste, and nuclear power plants are waiting to be the next Chernobyl. Just about nuclear power, China's syndrome explores freedom of speech, right to press and great business. At Jack's findings of counterfeit information, his knowledge stops a massive investment on the construction of another nuclear power plant that many men seek to take advantage of. Kimberly, desperately wanting out on the puff news, sees the struggle for truth more important than increasing her career; constantly pushed by Richard, would never be silent and demanded that the public be informed of the accident. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas and Jack Lemmon are simply flawless. Fonda shows Kimberly as a fragile woman on her outside, yet emotionally hard and determined to reveal this cover. Douglas brings a strong performance like Richard, fights for honest and truth. Lemmon shines over everything like Jack. His performance is highly charged drama. <br /> <br /> China's Syndrome is a nineteenth-century view that is still highly relevant today as it did when it was first released.
