This is not a "real" James Cagney vehicle, as his screen time is exceptionally slim. Frankie Darro plays hard child Jimmy Smith, the leader of a gang of rubber forces sent to reform school with a couple of his hoodlum friends. Cagney plays Patsy Gargan, a gang leader himself, who gets a token position as a vice commissioner. When he finds out the brutal treatment completed at the Reform School, he has to make some major changes through the reforming nurse (Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> HELLENS MAYOR is fast and is still entertaining after all these years. The molding is well-rounded with: Dudley Digges, Arthur Bryon, Farina Hoskins, G. Pat Collins and Allen Jenkins.
