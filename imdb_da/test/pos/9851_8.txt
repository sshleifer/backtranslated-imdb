Well-established documentary film focusing on two Sudanese refugees who are resettled in the United States. It's your basic fish out of water history with a non-fiction twist. I found it fascinating to see how Peter and Santino lived before they came to America and how they adapted when they arrived here (in Houston, Texas.) They expected a kind of sky, but found it to be much harder than it seems to be doing well in the states. They go from aspiring idealists to some more realistic skeptics. Everywhere they go along with bureaucrats with paper paths that most citizens can take for granted. They fear they are harder than African Americans here and feel unacceptable because of it. One of the "Lost Boys" manages to leave Houston to go to Olathe, Kansas, where he finds the conditions a little better, but still less than ideal. There are people trying to help them as well as trying to hurt them in this movie. Not shown, but talked about, are those who put a gun in their heads and robbed them, which led a lost boy to comment negatively that "all black people in America are not good." I also found it interesting that they arrived in Houston in August 2001, a month before the World Trade Center was attacked by terrorists. I was hoping to see their reaction to this tragedy, but it is not mentioned at all. All in all, a really well-finished documentary without a story. No one really needs. The "Lost Boys" do a fine job that tells about the events going on around them without any help, thanks.
