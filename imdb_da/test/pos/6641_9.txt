The apolitical musicians Eva (Liv Ullmann) and Jan Rosenberg (Max von Sydow) have been married for seven years and live in a small farm on a remote island to escape a civil war on the continent. They give lingenberry to a few customers to raise some money and buy some supplies. They love each other, and Eva is twenty years old and wants a baby, but the reluctant Jan, a weak and sensitive man, does not want to have children. When the rebels arrive at the island, their peaceful and tranquil life becomes hell, and they come in the middle of accusations from both sides. When Colonel Jacobi (Gunnar Bj√∂rnstrand) originates Eve, Jan changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man, and love and love, they feel for each other, change into hatred and indifference. <br /> <br /> "Shame" is an antiwar film by master Ingmar Bergman focused on the eyes of a few artists who are apolitical and do not listen to the news, but when the war comes to their countries, they have their love, friendship and love destroyed by the pointless soldiers. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow have distinguished performances as usual, and I can't remember seeing Liv Ullmann's breast in another movie. The brutalization of the Pacific and sensitive Jan Rosenberg at war is impressive, and the gloomy open conclusion is pessimistic and sufficient for the dramatic history. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vergonha" ("Shame")
