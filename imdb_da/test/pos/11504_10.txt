If this movie is not at least chosen for an Oscar nominee for best foreign films, I will stop waking up in the evening and watch the event. Fridrik Thor Fridriksson has proven that money is not the key to making a good movie, but originality. Out of a cold country comes a warm but thought-provoking film of a mentally ill man and his struggle against an insane world. After an insight like this, you wonder if the man is crazy or the world he lives in.
