this is one of the finest movies I have ever seen .... the sharp nature ... the isolation ... the ignorant great-scale people are hiding behind their religion ... a background for some wording and sophistication ... the action is quite natural ... but for me as a "foodie" the best is the real choice and preparation of the party .. i have spent time in paris and know the kitchen well ... if cafe anglais really exists i don i know it but I know of similar businesses and the babette menu and the choice of wines is authentic ... and of course the end where even though the perfect meal brings them back to friendship is the only end that could be .. This is a 10 out of 10 film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it
