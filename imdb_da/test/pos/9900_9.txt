Morris and Reva Applebaum had been toast of Broadway in its thriving time. At ninety, Morris is widowed. He convenes his sons - the psychotherapist and the BMW car dealer - and his daughter, the television writer / producer - to attend a party in his honor, after which he will euthanize himself. Easier-minded creatures that they are, they take what he says at face value. He leads them, his grandchildren and some others, including an African-American Jewish psychiatrist reminiscent of Godfrey Cambridge, on a merry hunt through Manhattan as they try to stop him or deter him. <br /> <br /> Comedy works completely. The performances are excellent. Peter Falk is in top form. This movie deserves more than one audience: it deserves popular success.
