Most critics seem to have dismissed this movie, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as just another patchwork of thoughtless violence. And even though there is a lot of chaos, the DEATH WISH 3 is not that terrible for the effort, especially for fans of the series and star. <br /> <br /> This time, Charlie's Paul Kersey's aging of a police officer is desperate to clean up a tough part of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of the gang area, where he again becomes a one-man army in a city war of good to evil. Bronson, at least the "older" version, is really at its best. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying the DEATH WISH 3 is a classic. In fact, for the discriminating eye, it has an abundance of imperfections. The signs are generally made of cardboard. The violence is over the top. A man well into his 60s outbreak and plays dozens of young punks. But in the tradition of the original DEATH WISH and later films like FALLING DOWN with Michael Douglas, it has a certain crowd-pleasing charm. Who doesn't want to see gangbangers get their guilt? There are also some good cheesy moments and one-liners so common in the 1980s movie. When a tenant of his home building sees that Kersey creates a booby trap, the vigilant says, among other things, that "he thins the crew." A line only Bronson can really do work. So you see, the key to enjoying DEATH WISH 3 is to accept it for what it is. It's not Spielberg, and it's not art. Then throw the popcorn in the microwave and have fun with it.
