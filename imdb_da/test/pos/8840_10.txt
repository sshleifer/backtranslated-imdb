It couldn't. <br /> <br /> From cutting the dialogue to super special effects, this movie was a joy to watch all the time. The immediate sense of the bitterness of Antarctica, the affinity of the basics, before the real action is heated and the cunning final combines to make this one of the most memorable and fun films around. <Br /> <br /> Towards a long list of movies that have attempted to exploit the theme of visitors from another planet, The Thing comes out on top and laughs. Who can forget about the perfectly timed dialogue and the chilling special effects? Special effects that are much more impressive than the computer-generated images we see today. I for one found some of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie to be the way we were introduced slowly to each member of the crew, and the way they all had some characteristic features. This was not just a pointless carnage-come-slasher horror flick. This movie had a feeling. Feeling. <br /> <br /> I really can't recommend this movie highly enough. I have not yet seen anything in the class that comes anywhere near matching, let alone better, the closest perfect spectacle and timing utilized in this cunning polymeric feat of cinema.
