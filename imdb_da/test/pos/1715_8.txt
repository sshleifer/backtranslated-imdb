One of the most successful shows in the TV story is back. Now I admit that I never got into the original show .... Okay, so I never saw it at all. But the new show is impressive. <br /> <br /> Sci-Fi premieres the first two episodes, "Rose" and "End of the World" this weekend. We meet Rose, a twenty-something clerk chased by remote mannequins. She is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls herself the doctor. With the help of the Internet, she finds a conspiracy buffer that warns her that wherever the doctor follows, follows death. When she's geeky girlfriend Mickey is replaced by a scammer, the doctor informs her of a plot to use the land as a breeding ground for several of those plastic monsters that the doctor has fought across space and time traveling in a Tardis disguised in the 50s -style police protection box. <br /> <br /> She helps him save the world - there wouldn't be a show otherwise - and decides to join him. But when he puts his life in danger, he is confused and the question of whether her company was worth the risk. <br /> <br /> Although the special effects are a bit paralyzed and some of the scenes are a bit choppy, "Doctor Who" is (after two episodes broadcast in the US) a clever, well-written work. Apparently, the second season has already been sent in the UK, so I predict the same success here.
