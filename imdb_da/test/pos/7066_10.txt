"Meatballs" is an ode to summer camp. Those of us who came to camp will see many of the scenes that we remember or wish they could have been. Bill Murray plays senior boy adviser Tripper Harrison, who actually runs the camp. He reminds us of the fun, cool employee that everyone loves. Young campers gravitate towards him, and if he speaks to you, you feel like you are family. This is one of Murray's best roles. He runs the movie with one line and ad-libs. <br /> <br /> Chris Makepeace plays Rudy, the lonely camper taken under Tripper's wing and breaks out of his shell. <br /> <br /> The rest of the campers and staff in the film were also excellent. <br /> <br /> The overall theme of the movie is the underdog overcoming obstacles to finally winning. From Rudy to Spaz to the camp and even to Tripper himself, the underdogs of the movie are stars. The movie has a heart. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun and fun without being cruel or overseas, as some teens are today. The caste looks and works like real people. Comedy and heart draw you to the point that at the end, like in the camp, you are sad to go. <br /> <br /> In my summer camp experience, we had underwear running flagstones, mystery flesh, trying to sneak a peek into the girls cabin, the lunatic-with-hook stories around the camp fire and moving sleeping people out of their cabins and Put them elsewhere. But we also had a dedicated camp staff who guided us to be the best we could be. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is CIT overnight when they canoe across the lake singing a greasy song. The only line that breaks me up every time is when Tripper announces light in the evening before the parent's day, and he ends "Tomorrow is the parents' day and you have to look rested, or Morty will be sent to the state's penitentiary."
