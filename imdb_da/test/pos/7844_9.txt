This is a wonderful movie that takes place in the romantic period of the Civil War. This movie is a must see for Eastwood fans and Eastwood claims this is one of his most favorite films he did. I could not agree more. Beware! This is a spoiler Eastwood dies in the end. Eastwood and director Don Siegel rightly argued that the termination should be unexpected and should be dissatisfied for a few reasons. They wanted to stick to the book, for one. Second, there may not always be a good ending. Third, this was written during the Vietnam War - they wanted a negative statement to this terrible war war, where people became unnecessarily dying. I agree with all of this. It's a wonderful shooting movie, and I love most movies involving the civil war. It is more of a portrait of how misleading women can - that they can be more dangerous than men, and therefore the title has much to do with the statement about the movie BEGUILED - to be deceived. The song, sung by Eastwood at the beginning and end of the film, is another statement against not only the civil war, but the Vietnam War and perhaps indirectly the women he comes across during the film. Wonderful story of love and deception and many memorable scenes - NOTE: This movie is rated R for no reason. There is hardly any language, it is probably some of the subject matter of sex - but there is no nudity really. Excellent film- 9/10.
