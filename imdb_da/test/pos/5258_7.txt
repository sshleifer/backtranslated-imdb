I freely admit that I have not seen the original movie, but I have read the game so I have a little background with the "original". If you throw the fact that this is a remake of an old classic, this movie is smart, witty, fresh and fun. Yes, the casting decisions may seem weird, but they work. <br /> <br /> I'm a strong feminist, and I wasn't offended at least by this movie - despite what other women might say. This is not a movie for men to see (so please, ladies, don't drag your guys to see it with you, it's just cruel); women will get the jokes, situations and conditions. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised at the depth Annette Bening brought to her character ... she did an excellent job. Debra Messing was sweet, and Candice Bergen was great. I was less impressed with Meg Ryan ... she brought feelings to the table, but her comedian took it was less powerful. The all-female cast is strong, and it is certainly a laugh-loud kind of comedy. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and intend to see it again with my mother. Women will understand.
