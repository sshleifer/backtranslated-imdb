Although this film has never gained commercial fame, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-written artistic expressions often do not receive much appeal. The story shows a young boy who steals a car and begins a surreal, dreamlike adventure with very little foundation in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who seeks to see this film from its conformity with reality will likely be disappointed; It is not supposed to be "realistic". However, it is supposed to be metaphorical with extensive symbolism evident to those with outstanding attention to detail. In addition, the symbolic representations are open to interpretation, which can be said about very good work of art. Don't be fooled by the cover (if you happen to rent or buy this movie) - the movie is not what it seems to be on the surface.
