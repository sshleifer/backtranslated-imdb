This is one of the best musicals from the 1940s. The brilliant Technicolor shows Rita Hayworth's beauty and spectacular hair. She should have made several films in color, but then Columbia was hardly able to blow up money for Technicolor footage. <br /> <br /> Rita is a WOW as Rusty Parker - she more than quits Gene in some of the most sparkling numbers ever. She also looked beautiful in the century dress so she got a chance to play her own grandmother. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with "The Show Must Go On" - it looks good to me Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) is not impressed. His motto is work, work, work !!! One of the dancers, Maurine (Lesley Brookes) is determined to improve herself and to audition for Vanity's Golden Wedding Cover Girl Competition. Rusty just happens to find himself in the auditions. In a very fun scene, Maurine has just had such an audition and looks Rusty, giving her a few tips on how to impress the judges !!! "Don't be shy and bad - chatting and sparkle". Rusty does it with gusto !!! <br /> <br /> They decide on Maurine and go to the show to see her, but John Coudair (Otto Kruger) sees Rusty - she reminds him of someone from her past. Cornelia (Eve Arden) still has nightmares over Rusty's audition. "Whose Complaining" contains Genius (Phil Silvers) and the dancers, dressed up as working girls - (Rusty is a cabbie). John remembers a far lost love (Rusty's grandmother, Maribelle Hicks) the first time he saw her singing "A Sure Thing" - put on the races. Meanwhile, Danny, Rusty and Genius are looking for gems at their local dining room. They then launch in the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - "Make Way For Tomorrow". "Put Me To The Test" is an exciting song and dance song with Danny and Rusty. Meanwhile, Rusty has been chosen Cover Girl and Danny McGuires' is the place to see. Lee Bowman appears as Danny's romantic rival and puts a damper on things. Lee Bowman is probably the most boring leading man ever - so Danny never has to worry. <br /> <br /> Rusty (called by Martha Mears) sings "Long Ago and Far Away" and it is beautifully danced by Danny and Rusty. The dress that Rita wears is amazing. Travis Banton and Gwen Wakeling designed them. Danny wants the best for Rusty, but is afraid he'll lose her. Gene Kelly is also fantastic in the Alter Ego number where he dances with himself. "Poor John" is another look back to the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and is an extremely fun song poking fun in rich relationships - Hayworth looks beautiful in an incredibly picturesque outfit. Look for Al Norman in both "Poor John" and "A Sure Thing". He was a fantastic eccentric dancer who appeared in several early musicals, including the "King of Jazz" and "Paramount on Parade". He was easy to see. <br /> <br /> The "Cover Girl" dance is just amazing. Rita was so talented - beautiful and a fantastic dancer. After a host of beautiful models paired through covers of America's top magazines, Rusty breaks through into a beautiful gold dress dancing down a ramp to the very captivating "Cover Girl" song. Gosh, I just love this movie !!!! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
