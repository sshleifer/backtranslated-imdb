I'm afraid I have to disagree with Mr Radcliffe, who, although correct in saying that this is not a comedy, has many other benefits. The reason is a bit crazy about parts, but I think it all fits nicely together, which creates a satisfying, enjoyable movie. The last scene was pretty scary compared to the rest of the movie, but the actual ending of the plot a few scenes previously is very interesting, and shows just what a person will do under stressful circumstances. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to fans of thrillers and action movies, but if you're a fan of gangster movies as long as you don't expect to expect something as deep as Goodfellas, you still have to find fun .
