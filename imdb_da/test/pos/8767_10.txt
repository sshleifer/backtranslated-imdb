The subject is banal, even in 1942. It is war propaganda. The Fascists are among us, and they do all they can to sabotage war efforts and prepare their victory and their seizures then and their establishment of an effective totalitarian state. But Hitchcock has to make it a real thriller. So he discovers a first sabotage that succeeds, but one of the victims, the friend who dies in it, becomes the primary suspect and rapture for the sabotage. It allows him to say that he visits the country and discovers the difficult organization of local Nazis who have acquainted and supported the supreme benevolent community and use the small, small dissatisfied whites to do the dirty work. Chase after the real saboteur takes our young fake suspects from Los Angeles to New York and to the top of the organization. He meets a blind pianist who thinks his senses know that the chap is not guilty, his niece, a star of the promotional note, but also a frenetic and fanatical patriot who only thinks of going to the police. Saw the rich ranches and his nest of plotters. Then on the road a sympathetic and friendly truck driver and the long caravan of a circus going around, their dwarf, beard, Siamese sisters and a few other grotesques of that type. And he discovers the goal in a Soda City, an electric dam that gives Los Angeles and its war industry the energy they need. He participates as a gravel in the organization in the sabotage of a USS Alaska military ship when it is launched. And finally, he and the pianist's nieces manage with some ingenuity, creativity and elbow fat to get the whole party cleaned up, most of them arrested and the first saboteur, a certain Fry, falls down from the free-coal of the Statue of Liberty. One will not roast on the old electric sparkler. But Hitchcock is not yet accustomed to having a personal coma look in his own films, so don't look for him. It is well built and well done, but it is only a propaganda movie with an extra style.
