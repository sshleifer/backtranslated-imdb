This film has the appearance of being assembled in a few days, like plan 9 from outer space. Despite this, it's still a classic location among my favorite creations. ***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AWAY ******* Count Dracula and Larry Talbot; aka Wolfman arrives at Dr. Edelman's laboratory and seeking a cure for their nocturnal antisocial behavior, like killing people. Meanwhile, Dr. Edelman kindly the body of the Frankenstein monster. Being obsessed with bringing it back to life (a common trait among scientists, sour or otherwise), he opposes his better judgment, resulting in monster chaos and madness. One of the final universal classics of his time (Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein followed 3 years later), it bets 10 with this reviewer. Onslow Steven steals the show as a good doctor who has gone badly after being infected by the blood in Dracula and becomes a half-vulture / vampire creature coming to a tragic end. At 1 hour 7 min. It packs quite a blow. A worthy addition to my video collection. <br /> <br /> Rating: ***** out of *****
