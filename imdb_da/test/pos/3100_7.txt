The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were very popular and controversial. The movies that highlighted their bridge paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and tried to imitate its winning formula. An obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies', where the new home was bought with oil money, not won in a competition. You can even say that the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of ​​backward rural figures from this series. I still wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based writer who created these characters, did no more harm than good. Her portrayal of hillbilly characters shames them for many jokes regarding their alleged lethargy and laziness. (The family that Macdonald based the boilers successfully sued ... claimed they had been ridiculed and humiliated by those less than flattering references). Well, it's comedy and the situations bring us many laughs and funny moments ... and political correctness as we know it today didn't exist in the 1940s and 1950s. But I think Macdonald could have written these characters more wisely, and Universal International could get its screenwriters to show them on the screen with more dignity (there is such a good taste). The more realistic moments are when the eldest son Tom is ashamed of his rural heritage, but learns to accept his parents and siblings for who they are. For their part, the boilers must realize that they do not fit perfectly into a modern world. It's not a joke ... it's a sober truth.
