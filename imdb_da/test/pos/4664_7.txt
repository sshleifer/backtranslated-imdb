Under the secured direction of F. Gary Gray, "Italian Job" never loses its grip on being cool and fun. Although the material is rehashed and average, the film itself is masterfully done and satisfactorily good. The tone could easily have been much heavier, considering the murderous plotline, but F. Gary Gray holds the flashlight with good humor, seedy dialogues and vibrant music. It is a pleasure to see that these bad guys form a great bond and stick to each other through fraud and murder while never forgetting to have fun. This is 7/10.
