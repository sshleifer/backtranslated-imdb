Ronald Coleman had been a star on the screen for years when talkies came in and what a boost it was for his career. His Oxford English accent is so enchanting that I could listen to him, recite the farmer's calendar and not be bored. <br /> <br /> Coleman plays Willie Hale, a 30ish playboy from a wealthy family who spends his time on women and gambling. Still, he is a playful villain - not only sympathetic to the audience, but also to family and friends. He has once again broken down because of his constant play and sells his belongings in a foreign place to settle his debts and settle in England. When he gets there, he is first greeted by a father who insists he will kick him - he has it with Willie and his cures. But five minutes alone in a room with Willie and his charm, and Willie is not only forgiven by father, Dad has given him a hundred pounds to start. <br /> <br /> Willie then goes on a day of recreation with his sister and her friend Dorothy Hope (Loretta Young). Dorothy is set to be engaged to Grand Duke Paul the very night, mostly just because her father wants royalty in the family and there is no one else special in her life. It changes after her day with Willie and soon there is scandal brewing when Dorothy refuses to go through with the marriage as planned. <br /> <br /> Ronald Coleman is always a pleasure to see in these early talking films he did for Sam Goldwyn where he plays the trusty adventurer or cad or both. He has a sense of Errol Flynn, but he can't show Flyn's physical agility because of a debilitating wound he received during World War I. But what he lacks in physical agility, Coleman has always done in the agility of the soul. Loretta Young, just 17, when this picture was made, shows the beginning of her sweet girl's brand that can break into a ball of fire when the occasion demands it. Myrna Loy plays Willie's girl from the past - Mary Crayle - a showgirl. Here Myrna still plays a role similar to the exotic vamp parts she so often got at Warner Brothers when she was a contract player from 1926 until shortly before this film was made in 1930. <br /> <br /> This is pretty much a light and breezy romantic comedy from start to finish. If you're in the mood for the kind of escapist entertainment that eases the audience's hearts during the Great Depression, this little movie fits the bill.
