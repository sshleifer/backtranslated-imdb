This movie rocked !!!! Looked at a screener a few weeks ago. Only a strange story where James Franco plays this scream that marries Sienna Miller just to get out of the country and they go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon. Won't give it away the cuz movie isn't released yet, but it's totally cool and you'd never expect the things to happen. I thought I'd hate it, it's a romance, but it's also a little twisted and stuff that I like a lot. The action is really good, and Sienna Miller is completely smokin 'and plays this really cute girl. I think she should do more roles like this. James plays a jerk, but you end up with him and the end of the movie is really good. David Carradine plays a cowboy and he is good. I gave this movie a 10 because I came out of the movie that really liked it and wanted to see it again, which I didn't expect and my boyfriend really liked it and cried. good day flick
