When I first watched this movie, I was only a young child, and I fell in love with it, they really don't like movies like this anymore, I'm just looking at this again a little older and still love it. Humor is perfect and fits well into the movie really well, all gags are kind of childish, but will also make adults laugh, and in a kids movie is really very rare. <br /> <br /> The animation is amazing and seeing hand-drawn animation is a real fresh breath for the entire computer animation we see today. The backgrounds are amazing and the color is amazing. The characters are just the kind of characters you fall in love the moment you start to see girls, you will think that Chipmunks are cute and Guys will think Chipettes are really sweet sexy. The songs are fun to listen to, and some really do you if you want to cry or get up and dance, it's also fun to see visual humor to go with them. The voice effect is great without a doubt, although most of the voice action is high pitch, but an interesting thing appeared and it was one of the songs from this movie, but it slowed down to show the right voices behind them and it's really fun to see. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie in a store or a place to rent, I say, check it out, it's really worth seeing and is a perfect family movie, it's amazing, words can't express this movie.
