Two years after 'Airplane!' took off, Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker threw one of his stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this hilarious television show shows a brilliant start to old American detective figures like "Dragnet". Nielsen played Frank Drebin, America's answer to 'Inspector Clouseau'. It had the same humorous style as 'Airplane!'; Clever visual gags in the background, unnoticed absurdities and recurring characters like Johnny Shoe Shine Boy, who seem to know everything about everything. Guest stars (including William Shatner!) Were killed in the opening credits. The 'Police Squad' was the first American sitcom since 'Batman' to lack a track. Many have regretted the fact that only six episodes were made, but I think it was about right. The concept could never have maintained a full 24 episode run. Five years later, the "Police Squad" became a successful transfer to the big screen when the first of the "Naked Gun" trilogy was released. Jim, Jerry, David and Leslie had the last laugh.
