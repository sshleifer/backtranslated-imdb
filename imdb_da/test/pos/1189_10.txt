Thank goodness for this movie. It is a document of talent that three decades later seems even more unique and rarely in thought. The music is just extraordinary, filled with so many talents in writing, performance, arrangement and production that it is absolutely contagious. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. The performances of understated talents like Nell Carter and Ren Woods raise my spirit every time I hear them. While the movie may be different from the scene version, I prefer the soundtrack to the cast album, which I find really lattice and underdeveloped. Here, the events are filled and expanded to dynamic pieces that could not be produced in a scene environment. <br /> <br /> But the music is not the only extraordinary about this movie. The comparison of almost hyper-realistic dialogue scenes (reminds me of Altman movies) interkut with incredible musical and dance figures really works. All the talent in this movie - directing, writing, photography, editing, music, choreography, casting, acting, costuming, art direction - fills perfectly into one of the best musical movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing how much we know about the characters in "Hair" based on very little information or plot. They are not drawn as caricatures, but as realistic and very human people. We see a little glimpse of where they come from, but the portrait is finished with vignettes that draw the signs to the surface through completed plays, instruction and editing. There is an underlying theme for Berger and Hudy's misogyny, which colors their characters by exposing their ruthless macho-hippie ideology. Berger's home life reveals important details of his psychology, and the glance at Claude's home tells us volumes about his background through the simple, realistic and genuine interaction between Claude and (presumably) his father. <br /> <br /> I love fashion in this movie. It blends comfortably 60's ideas with the very seventies look (one must overlook Treat Williams' hair extensions ...). It is a document of how chic much of the late seventies, unlike the conventional wisdom, that the era was about bad taste. Claude's beige knitted tie was a hot trend in 1979, and the songs and dancers' hair and clothes (especially the whites in the Central Park scene) blend decades in a way that suggests the early themes of the musical. These elements blend in with Twyla Tharpe's extraordinary state-of-the-art choreography in a way that enhances the art of both artists. <br /> <br /> "Hair" is not a film that rewards cynicism. If you come to that with expectations, you will most likely be held captive by artists who are not bound by your rules. For me, it has opened my eyes and ears and spirit to an insightful and passionate musical dialogue about war, friendship and family that transcends its time and is still meaningful and relevant to me to this day.
