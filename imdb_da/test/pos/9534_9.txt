What is fun about watching random movies in random times is that you never quite know what to expect or where the next big piece of cinema will pop up. Recently, my viewing took the form of stapled classics such as "Raging Bull" or "Raiders of the Lost Ark", but this time my video recorder took me away from modern conveniences and plopped me right in front of Lionel Jeffries' "The Railway Children". This is a cleverly directed movie about three youthful children, a mysterious event with their father, relocation to the open fields of England, and finally the rewards inherited by simply departing on trains. At first glance, this seemingly simple children's movie does not seem all that hopeful, as it has been lost on VHS rarity for some time, but within the first fifteen minutes of this movie one understands that it is more than just your common place children's film ?? "Railway children" were created at a time when purity was more than just saying "no" when the family meant everything and where adventure was ready for you around all the tracks. This is more than a cute movie, it has amazing movie techniques that keep the ordinary viewer glued to the screen with unanswered questions and provide three perfect companions to follow in this 110 minute journey. "Railway Children" is a lost treasure to be seen by families and movie aficionados alike. <br /> <br /> There are several moments that stand out proudly in "Railway Children" that transforms this from mediocrity to excellence ?? one is our three children; Bobby, Phyllis and Peter. Modern cinema assures us that these three children cannot provide abundant darkness, laughter and insight into the world that surrounds them, but Jeffries' children otherwise prove. From intelligently spoken lines (both from plays and manuscripts) to sincere kindness and dedication to this small village, stop all the way to the last meeting of that train; These children are more than just children's stars that promote a story, they lead us with emotions, persuasion, and a realism invisible to today's children. There is more imagination wrapped in this little VHS than I have seen in movies for years. A favorite scene that could have been handled with generosity, as I have seen in other movies, was Bobby's birthday scene. The way Jeffries floats between guests and gifts was exciting and refreshing, as our eyes were excited about each scene as well as our minds. Another scene that caught my attention was when the kids were working on gifts for Perks when they asked a man for a gift, Jeffries just said, "No, I won't. I don't like Perks." The children's reaction is fun ?? allows moments for both children and adults to enjoy throughout. The movie in the 1970s gives this little feature real laughs than most modern comedies. It is a creative film combined with great choreography and direction. That is, as much as I loved this movie, it wasn't perfect. Jeffries does a good job of guessing what happened to the father, but it felt that the event arose, the kids were kept in the dark, and it suddenly resolved itself at the end. More details for dad, not much more, would have solidified his character and allowed us to see more of the children's reaction. There is also a scene in this movie, one of the grandiose wide-screen images of the English landscape that is just breathing, but when you look a little closer, cars are seen in the background. It made me cry, but didn't divert too much from the overall picture. Cinema like this is very much missed today, and strangely it seems that only the British have the gum to produce it. Movies like "Love, Actually" or "Vicar of Dibley" demonstrate the power and excitement of community sites, places where everyone knows everyone, and we are not afraid to be a neighbor. This is more of a theme that American audiences could have more of ?? more understanding of what is happening outside, rather than remaining secluded to your own events. Overall I loved "Railway Children". I didn't know what to expect when I first put it in the VHS player, but from the opening stage to the exploding train set to Perk's birthday, Jeffries showed that he could handle the most child-friendly story with ease. His ability to make the child's actors feel like real characters, involve the adults less, and involve the children as if they were adults were excellent. This is a movie to be seen as a powerful alternative to some Disney releases. The constant themes of friendship, kindness towards strangers and forgiveness blow through the TV with grace and power. "Railway Children" is more than just a children's movie; It is a feature that should be a staple to modern audience viewing. It not only gives a good view of the English landscape, but it also teaches (and shows) how life will be greater with emphasis on imagination and courage, rather than struggling with any CGI evil. <br /> <br /> Degree: **** Â½ out of *****
