ccmovieman-1 is supposed to be called the New York Times, who preferred Janis Joplin Big Brother and the Holding Company album for the newly released Beatles' "White" album, either evil or insane. National Velvet is a great movie. Elizabeth Taylor's performance is amazing, and I fail to even see a trace of accent, much less too much of one. Her performance is very natural, authentic and incredibly charming. The rest of the casting is great, especially Rooney and Revere. <br /> <br /> As far as the dialogue is hokey or sentimental, I suggest that cc has eaten too long on a diet of irony and has lost the ability to distinguish true straight-forward feeling and human interaction. There was a time when people actually thought and spoke in such a way. Not that this movie doesn't have a little touch of the magic permeating through it. That's the reason to tell the story. You might as well criticize the Wizard of Oz, King Kong, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, The Black Stallion (the other big horse movie) or a thousand other movies to have action and dialogue that seems richer than real life. No, my friend, National Velvet, because of his faith stuck in himself, with the tongue not fixed in the cheek. Some of today's filmed filmmakers find it almost impossible to recreate.
