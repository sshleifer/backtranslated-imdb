"L'Ossessa" (published in English under many titles and the most honest of them is definitely "The Hidden Midnight Horror Show") is one of the best Italian rip-offs of "The Exorcist". To really appreciate this movie, you need a sense of humor. "L'Ossessa" is at the same time dizzy (but naive), pathetic and sometimes even moving. <br /> <br /> Danila (Stella Carnacina), an art student, goes to an old church to see the statue she is going to restore. It is a wooden statue of Christ, a demonic Christ, perhaps already overcome by evil, or struggling against it, or perhaps planning dark deeds. The face shows endless torment. The statue dates from the 15th century. Danila is impressed by the championship that the sculptor shows - the statue seems almost alive! She lives with her parents. Her mother Luisa (Lucretia Love) lives a disintegrated life and does not care to stop looking. Her father Mario (Chris Avram) observes everything with unwanted eyes. The wooden statue will soon take on a human form (Ivan Rassimov) and possess Danila in a carnal and spiritual sense. A great scene! The bad Danila will from now on suffer the suffering of hell. <br /> <br /> Danila (the lovely Stella Carnacina) was ravished, violated, obsessed with the devil and now, according to his orders, she will try to seduce others. Isn't she imitating her shabby mother Luisa (Lucretia Love) who feels great joy when her lover whips her with a bunch of roses? There is a scene that is so ridiculous to be sublime and moving when Stella Carnacina runs in despair through the narrow streets (possessed by the devil, remember?) Of a small Italian town screaming out her heart. Luigi Pistilli is a very good exorcist. His performance is as usual intense. The exorcism scenes (especially last match) are very, very amateurish, but it will only improve the fun (and / or the feeling?) If you really have a sense of humor. Stella Carnacina is beautiful and looks fresh and innocent, and it is a factor that adds to your pleasure when she is naked, but I think the movie could have explored more of its natural beauty. Lucretia Love is a very good sleaze companion (her naked scene with the roses ... Well :) <br /> <br /> Other Italian exorcist rip-offs I would recommend that you are: <br /> <Malabimba (very sleazy and released unknown and digitally restored) "Evil Eye" (Malocchio) - "The Exorcist" was the main source of inspiration for "Evil Eye", but other films such as. "Rosemary's Baby" should also be considered. "Evil Eye" is completely over the top. Not so winding but with lots of beautiful Italian and Spanish actresses. You want to throw the whole movie. The film is ridiculous, the story makes no sense, but if you see it in the right mood, you can feel moved! - A devilish sect, possession, murder, despair, love, investigation, and beautiful women around. A wild trip! <br /> <br /> If you liked "Evil Eye", see also "Ring of Darkness" (Un'Ombra nell'ombra). This film can be found on the alternative market. Search this title in IMDb. There are good reviews about it. <br /> <br /> P.S. - "L'Ossessa" has many different faces. It is useful, but it can also be serious and moving. It's cheap, cheesy ... sleazy (but not so much) and it has an underlying "moral" message. This strange brew can sometimes be a lot of fun. We all already know that "L'Ossessa" is an "exorcist" rip-off, so why can't we see it on our own terms? Yes, Mario Gariazzo tried to earn a quick buck, but he was able to make the most of a shoestring budget. The story is told well, the film is atmospheric and generally the actors are involved in their roles. Watch the movie with an open mind and you can discover two or three new things.
