When I first saw the Premiere Episode of Farscape, I had no idea what to expect. I was incredibly impressed and pleased with "Premiere". However, subsequent re-watches have made many mistakes for me that I originally missed. "Premiere" is not a great Farscape episode, but it deserves the honor of successfully and effectively creating the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the solid characters. The episode begins with John Crichton (Ben Browder), an astronaut and researcher who prepares to start in space in Farscape Module, a small spacecraft perfected by Crichton and his friend DK. Crichton has a revealing conversation with his father, Jack Crichton, and then begins his test flight in space. Of course, everything goes wrong, and Crichton is "shot through a wormhole" and wins in "a distant part of the galaxy". <br /> <br /> After turning off the wormhole, the Crichton module becomes aboard a living space ship. From here, the characters and narrative line of the Farscape series are introduced in an entertaining but quick way. The regular characters are correctly introduced in the first half of the episode. Of course, there is Crichton playing well by Ben Browder. He offers an audience a sympathetic sign to identify with. He is lost and has no idea how to do much of anything. In "Premiere", Crichton must choose between joining the prisoners or peacekeepers. He knows nothing at all about each side, but by helping Aeryn (a captured peacekeeping pilot) it becomes clear that he intends to help peacekeepers. He probably wouldn't have caught up with the prisoners if it hadn't been for Crais, a peacekeeping captain who explained to Crichton being the killer of his brother. This puts Crichton in an interesting situation: he's stuck with bizarre, violent escaped prisoners in a distant galaxy, which he doesn't know at all. Crichton's total lack of knowledge of the Farsape world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during Farscape's first season. Support support is just as convincing. There is Zhaan, a blue partial and former prisoner. She is peaceful and affordable, unlike the fellow prisoner Ka D'Argo, a strong and fierce warrior. Virginia Hey is completely covered with blue makeup, so her character of Zhaan may seem cool and convincing. D'Argo's mega-makeup, on the other hand, is under-par. He looks a little silly with his giant tentacles and strange noses, and there is something peculiar about his eyes. They seem to have had some kind of allergic reaction to his makeup. Farscape wanted to make some improvements to his makeup in season 1, but the overall costume would at least remain a problem until season 2. <br /> <br /> Saying simple, excellent. Rygel is a small Hynerian Dominar flying around on a kind of glider. In "Premiere" he gets a good dialogue, but not much else. The pilot almost steals the show as the connection between the living ship, Moya and Moya's passengers. Even in the first episode, the Pilot gives the appearance of being a true living alien; He never seems to be a huge, expensive machine. <br /> <br /> The peacekeeping characters introduced are also quite interesting. The peacekeepers consist of a race called Sebaceans, similar to humans. The main antagonist is introduced in "Premiere" as Captian Crais, who believes that Crichton killed his brother. In fact, Crai's brother's death was just an accident due to an accidental collision with Crichton's ship. Aeryn Sun, a pilot that Crichton helps to escape, tries to explain that death was an accident, but Crais simply claims that she is "irreversiby contaminated" and refused to change. Crais obsession for revenge, justified or not (it should be clear to Crais that Crichton is not responsible), is mysterious in "Premiere" but will be explained later in the season. Aeryn itself gives a very interesting character. By being forced to leave the peacekeeping, she changes her entire lifestyle and is in a similar (but less serious) situation like Crichton. The actual episode, as previously mentioned, feels somewhat hasty and clunky. So much happens that there is not enough time for anything. Also, D'Argo (for now) looks a little stupid in his mediocre costume trying to seem threatening. Yet "Premiere" is solid entertainment. The special effects (as in the starburst sequences) are impressive. Most costumes and sets aboard the Moya are original. Despite its flaws, "Premiere" is a must-see for Farscape fans. 3.4
