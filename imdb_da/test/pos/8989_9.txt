Now I realize that most people at home trash YOUNG WARRIORS or greet it as "so bad it's fun" type of entertainment, but let me make something clear: In fact, it's a quality piece of low rental if you're willing to see such a cinema without a critical eye. In fact, it is quite a lot more entertaining and thought-provoking than most of the action films in the 80s. <br /> <br /> The key is in the movie's subject. I am always a sucker for movies tackling the subject of vigilantism, especially when ambitiously distinguishing into the psyche of the people involved. YOUNG WARNERS cannot have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first DEATH WISH movie (and yes, I think the first one had both of these elements), but it is trying to be different from the current cannon movies of the period in that it is quite unique . The plot is simple (quiet, it does not spoil): A group of college students pranksters change their ways when one of their family members is assaulted by a tough street gang. Students take to the streets in an attempt to combat general street crime, not knowing who the gang is responsible. They eventually acquire some heavy artillery (machine guns and grenades) and stifle the night fully armed. However, these are not Schwarzenegger types; They are vulnerable, inexperienced novices who make significant blunders almost every time they go out to clean up the city (usually with their frat mascot dog in tow). They finally find out who the gang is and goes after them, but in that case you won't expect a standard climax where the good people go away unharmed. <br /> <br /> One thing about the movie that struck me so strangely, but effective is that most of the first action does not give any indication that we will see any action or violence later when it becomes treated as a goofy fratcom, you want to look at US Up All Night (where I think it was actually shown at some point). The comedy setup actually hit me forgetting that the VHS coverage showed a guy driving a motorcycle with a machine gun attached to his back. So when the violence finally comes, it's not fun or sweet at all ... it's shockingly disturbing. From that time on, the film becomes a full bloodless, uncompromising yarn with some sensational weapons and gears. <br /> <br /> The action, while nothing special, is far more carefree than I expected. James Van Patten, who plays the protagonist, gives everything and his performance is surprisingly good for this type of movie. The rest of the casting is just invested, including the always reliable Ernest Borgnine as the hero's copfader. The kinematics are also over par, and the action scenarios are handled with a degree of difficulty that I personally did not expect. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people thought this movie was worthless as much of it is extremely dated, but these facets struck me as nothing less than cool in themselves. Van Patten's character studying animation and his early 80's style work, which appears in several scenes is a retro movie love psychedelic wet dream. I am sure most contemporary viewers would quote the very small moments as low points in the movie, but I disagree. Also, Joe Walsh's soundtrack - which sounds like it could only be recorded in '83 - seemed particularly appropriate and comfortable, no matter how "old" it looks today. YOUNG WARRIORS are one of my favorite action films from the 80s and I urge anyone interested in the genre to look. Unfortunately, it has only been released on VHS from this writing and it will not be shown on television these days. A good DVD presentation would make me moon-walk around my living room with such intensity that I am sure my ankles would swell. Meanwhile, I ask you all to go on Ebay or Amazon and host the ten bucks or anything for the old big-box tape. It really is a remarkable booklet of ambitious trash.
