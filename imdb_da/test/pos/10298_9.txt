"L'appartement" must be among the best French films I have ever seen (along with "Hatred", also starring Vincent Cassel, and the great Gerard DÃ©pardieu / Pierre Richard films). Cassel and Bellucci are great in leading roles. Apart from the "Wolves Brotherhood" and "Dobermann" I have not yet seen a bad movie with this couple. "L'appartement" sucks you in from the start, and the twists keep you excited at the very end. Fragment storytelling has really not worked so well since "Pulp Fiction". Let's just hope there won't be a godly American remake of this unique romance / mysterious thriller. (EDIT: Guess what! A godly American remake has been made!)!
