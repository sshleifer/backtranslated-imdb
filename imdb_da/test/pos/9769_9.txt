Apparently, this Australian movie exists based on Nevil Shute's novel in more than one form. Beware of heavily trimmed versions, sometimes shown on cable or satellite, running anywhere from 95 minutes to 2 hours. Only the full 5-hour miniseries version tells the story properly. It is a very close realization of the story that only suffers from editorial errors often found in television films: choppiness and episodic progression. But this excellent cast tells the story very well with generally good production values ​​that accompany their work. Yuki Shimoda is known as "Gunso Mifune", one of the guards assigned to accompany the women on their disturbing trek. Eventually he becomes a friend. You will agonize with him when his loss of face leads him to death. Helen Morse as "Jean Paget", beautiful but not a great beauty (she looks like Sigourney Weaver a little) just records the right amount of spunk and winsomeness as the occasion requires. The miniseries pay close attention to the beautiful love stories, three of them: "Joe" and "Jean", "Noel" and "Jean", "Jean" and Willstown. Gordon Jackson plays "Noel Strachan" appealing but as a slightly younger man than Nevil Shute is indicated in the novel. The third love affair I mentioned does not get the right weight, and the full meaning of the title is diminished. "Jean" is dedicated to the goal of bringing businesses to Willstown, who will attract young women and girls and their civilizing influence to this godly outing. She will make it "a city like Alice"; Alice Springs, that is. We only get a few hints about this in several scenes. If you have the five hours to save, these miniseries are a truly rewarding experience. Nevil Shute based his novel on the cruelty of the Japanese military by switching a large group of women and children from one place to another on the Maylay Peninsula on a true occasion. It happened on Sumatra, according to Shute, but rather than on the peninsula. The crucifixion of "Joe" by a Japanese officer to steal chickens to feed the women is enough fiction, but the Japanese cruelty of prisoners is definitely a record.
