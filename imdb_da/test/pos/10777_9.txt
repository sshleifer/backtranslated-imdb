Oliver Stone hits the bull's eye on this movie, mainly supported by Bogosien's electrifying screen presence and biting, brilliant manuscript. Every moment you crackle with an ever-growing excitement that climbs into a truly memorable movie experience. If there ever was a sign of an author and a director's ability to report two very volatile temperaments to a seamless creativity association, then that's it! The result is a powerhouse performance that is made more timely now, perhaps because of our culture's disruptive fascination with celebrity, and it distorts interpretations of fame. An ultimate accusation for our society's increased morbidity and self-qualifying hunger for the next great excitement. <br /> <br /> A movie that is not easily forgotten. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the darker side of human nature.
