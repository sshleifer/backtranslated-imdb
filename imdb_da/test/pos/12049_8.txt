Shahrukh Khan and Yash Chopra movies have never disappointed. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a romantic classic. Dil for Pagal Hai was fresh and perfect to see. Mohabbatein remains as one of my favorite films ever. And Veer-Zaara was magical. Well, but not the best, is a romantic thriller that differs from the aforementioned films, but definitely worth seeing. And SRK, who blew me away with an excellent performance in Baazigar, repeats a villain's action. And this time he gets an experienced Juhi Chawla and Sunny Deol to support him. <br /> <br /> Before I comment on the play, it's not just the play, but the wonderful script that makes it worth watching. It is the font that complements the great play. The story is poignant, but the characterization is what stands out. The comedy track goes well together. But the film tends to switch to romance too much. The viewer is bound to lose interest and you will make a few yawns. But the film is still good. <br /> <br /> Shahrukh Khan is brilliant in his author's role. Shahrukh Khan is again sympathetic and cruel. You are bound to cry at the end. Juhi Chawla is decent. Her screams are bound to become annoying after a while. But in facial expressions she is excellent. But her end stage is she's brilliant (though she was overshadowed by SRK). She has a writer backed role that makes her very sympathetic. Sunny Deol is sufficient. His character was very sympathetic, but also perfect. And it gets boring after a while. However, he does a good job. Anupam Kher is really funny, but his role felt a little out of place. Tanvi Azmi supports well. <br /> <br /> The songs are comfortable and come at the right time. Jadoo Teri Nazar (Magic At Your Sight) is my favorite song, and the presentation is very 90s film like. Tu Mere Saamne (You are in front of me) and Likha Hai (Written here) are good love songs. Darwaza Band Kar Lo (Close Door) is a decent love song too. The instrumental song is danced to perfection as well as the naughty wedding song Solah Button. The movie may not be perfect, but it is worth your time, especially if your favorite actor is in it.
