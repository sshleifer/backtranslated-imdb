OZ is an old television series published by HBO. It shows the life of a security prison called Oswald, but the main plot is focused on Emerald City, which is one of the prison levels. Oz has a fantastic plot and an excellent cast! There are many signs and almost everyone is very interesting. Basically, they are divided into groups (gangs), the Sicilians, the black people, the arias, gays, the Latinos and many others who have no particular group, but deal with many others like Ryan O'Reily). <br /> <br /> The reason is very well built, there is a lot of conspiracy inside, a lot of struggle for power. But all this is not only exposed in the form of violence, everything is very intelligent and smart, nothing happens without reason, everything is connected and very interesting to guess! I really love this series and who wants to see something intelligent, very well produced with a very good cast and performances MUST SEE OZ!
