A strong film that has restored much of its importance in this second half of 2007 following the Burmese people's new desperate movements against their tyrants. I felt a complex mix of feelings about the people there, like compassion and admiration at the same time along with a bit of anger, because I feel that nobody, neither the world countries nor themselves do anything effective to end this shame. I think these feelings came straight from the movie and they were calculated when it was made so that it is a successful movie. The desire for peace, the quest for enlightenment, respect for life sometimes leads to oppression. In fact, it is the Buddhist Burmese culture that has left the doors wide open, opening to their dictators. But how can you feel sad at these poor people?
