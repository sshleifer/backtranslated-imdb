When I watched this movie, I had no idea what it was about and I had never heard of it before. But I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The first few minutes are almost the most fun in the whole movie. The shop consultant from India is just for fun! Anyways the story is not really too much to talk about, but I think it's ok. The action, on the other hand, is quite good, and still the only actor I recognized was Mickey Rourke, who was not right in the film to the end. And the end is where the deviation I think is not bad, but I don't want it to really end. I want to have been something more. A final fight somehow. I do not know. All in all, it was a great movie and I recommend it to anyone in Tarantino-type movies with lots of violence and dark, eerie humor! I rate it 7/10.
