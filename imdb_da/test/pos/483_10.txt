I saw the first thing on Thames TV and loved it. I then saw a terrible writing by someone who had definitely not seen or listened to it. So I bought a copy and then I bought another copy! The only sad thing is that it is not available on PAL VHS or Region 2 DVD. The Australian version is great, but this one is better! I can buy another .............
