This is an incredible piece of drama and powerful that hits you. I found the film was great and grabbed the two main characters handicap, this was represented in a great performance by both Michael and Rory. Whether the story is based on a true story, I believe that history is trying to give the public a message that the public as a whole must respect and feel the needs of the disabled and that they should be given the same chance as any other human. All in all, this movie comes into my soul, and I also felt touched by the actors, and the director sent creativity out there. The whole picture is that some actors take the game beyond their character and show only part of the character that is credible to the audience, but I feel that these two have really benefited their talented talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama. Certainly one not to be missed!
