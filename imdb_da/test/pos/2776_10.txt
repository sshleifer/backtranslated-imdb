Susie Q. is one of the rare and sweet movies that gives you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but healthy, and it's character is fun and captivating. First, I thought the movie would be the clich√© seedy movie that would drill me after five minutes, but I was wrong. It made me tear up at times, and it was plot enticing, which made me mess with the good guys. I loved the movie and still remember it today, 9 years later !! I highly recommend it to anyone and the movie is family oriented so you don't have to worry about inappropriate content. Really, if Disney wanted to show more movies up to couples like Susie Q., it would be the most popular family-oriented channel in the world. Now if only Disney would show it just once more! ^ _ ^ Go Susie Q. !!
