The film is about the battle of Stalingrad. For those of you who know nothing about it, it was the worst fight in World War II. Over 1 million people died during the match. This is the only movie I've seen that apparently got caught up in how bad things were in the war between Russia and Germany. What I really liked about it is that the two ideologies (Nazism and Communism) were nowhere in the movie. Unlike most American films, the Germans are not seen as bloodthirsty murderers, but what the average German foot soldier was, a person. The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were transferred there to try to take the city. The film follows these men from August 1942 to the beginning of 1943. During this time, they learn about the war graves and try to find their way out of the battle. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie you feel the desperation of the whole battle. Unlike "Enemy at the Gates," the filmmakers did not try to put some sappy love stories or dress the facts in the fight. This movie may be fiction, but it conveys what happened in the bloodiest battle of World War II.
