This is a difficult movie to watch and would have been even more difficult if I had known that the actor who played the protagonist was actually killed in his home by the police aged 19 years. Pixote (PeeWee) is a street kid in Sao Paulo who is caught in a roundup triggered by a murder where he had no influence. He is committed to a juvenile prison where he testifies to brutality and exploitation, which ordinary citizens are trying very hard to believe, does not exist. When he finally escapes, he and three companions survive with the only means they know, which is crime. What makes the film so heartbreaking is that both the Pixote and the actor depicting him clearly do not want to be the characters the living conditions have created them. Pixote tries to trust and love and bind, but there is simply no place in its world for the gentle side of human nature. One is back in the end who desperately wants to do something for the world's pixels, but what? Building more children's prisons with higher walls is definitely not the answer ...
