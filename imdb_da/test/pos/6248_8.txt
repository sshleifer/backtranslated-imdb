Slausen's lost oasis. . . a place for food, fun. . . and DREAMS! When a guy disappears on the way to a gas station, a group of her friends go on a trip to search for him. They come across a wax museum where they think their friend might end. Unfortunately for the friends, the owner of the roadside attraction has the power to control his wax mannequins and use them for evil. One by one, the tourists are knocked down and killed by the Slaus and his legion of wax dumplings. Can friends escape or will they fall into the same destiny as their lost friend? Subsequently, in the footsteps (and twisting them around) of the great classic wax films (House of Wax, the Wax Museum of Mystery), the Tourist Trap takes the slash genre to a whole new level of wonder and fascination with its bizarre history and style. As for character development, action, dialogue, flow, etc., it seems to be just a basic slasher flick. But it goes far beyond what the director takes control of the plot and moves it to the supernatural thriller it is. The action ranges from acceptable (from the main cast) to very good (from the backwoods showman Mr. Slausen (played by Western legendary Chuck Connors)). The script goes well and the dialogue is well structured, but there are some errors in the logic, as the film moves deeper into history. Also some scenes are a bit stupid, like the moody mannequin attack on Becky. However, it is not something that would damage the effect of the film. As one would expect from a film about wax dummies, it is full of the infinite fragility provided by mannequins. It is strange that a (mostly) inanimate object can just sit still and somehow be so disturbing. . . Maybe it's the human equality, or the shining staring or the fact that you know it's about to spring an attack. . . Whatever it is, the dolls are extremely scary, and the effect is very well used throughout the film. As for slashers, it is one of the best, and it is one of the craziest movies I have ever seen. Required Slasher Elements: <br /> - Violence / Gore: The movie is full of some cool deaths. Gore is not excessive, but it is well done and leaves it as realistic. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There is an extended, skinny-deep scene with the very attractive lead females (although "very attractive" hardly begins to describe the overwhelming future angel, Tanya Roberts), but that's all a tease as the girls remain mostly underwater. However, they hardly remain dressed throughout the film. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): Creepy is just the beginning of the Slausen and his mannequins. One of the best killers in slasher subgenre. - Scares / Suspense: From the opening scene, the film maintains a fantastic mix of mannequin's fragility, jumping scares from the attacks and a strong level of tension in the stranded situation. . . It's all very well done to make a really scary movie. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: Well, mystery wasn't really the point in the movie. . . Just the meaning behind it all is what matters. <br /> <br /> - Creepy Dance Scene: All these cute girls and not a single dance. Shame. <br /> <br /> Final judgment: 8/10. See this creepy slasher! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
