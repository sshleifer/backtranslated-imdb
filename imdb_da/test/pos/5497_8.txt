Clint Eastwood scores big in this 1993 thriller. With an absolute champion on the edge of your sperm, Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood, lives only as he can. John Malkovich also goes on my list of most effective screen crooks in the history of the cinema as the demented assassin. As for Rene Russo as Clint's love interest, I think Kirk Douglas said it best when he said, referring to his own career: "I keep getting older and my leading ladies get younger." This movie is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going. Eastwood and Peterson need to work together more often. Top notch movie.
