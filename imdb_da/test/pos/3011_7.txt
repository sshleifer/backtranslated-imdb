I had no expectations when I started watching this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted film that will give your heart a good workout! It's not easy. If you only enjoy police academy style, no brains movie, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex movie influenced by movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of brand new ideas. Amazing, winding surroundings, good acting and a compelling story make this one of the best movies I've seen for a long time! Be open-minded and you will love it!
