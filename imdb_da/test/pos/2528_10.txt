I'm originally from Brazil ... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation made to that boy. They told their life story, and he never got a "centavo" (Brazilian cent) of that movie. Fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through the lifestyle of Brazil. Sad ... but that's the world we live in. It's about making money that doesn't save lives. Questions are: Where is Fernando today? Probably ... dead. We tend to want to live in this "Disney-filled fantasy bubbled life". When someone comes up to the plate to help ... along comes the higher power and says, "What do I get from this? Where's my cut?" - I want the conscience of the people to speak!
