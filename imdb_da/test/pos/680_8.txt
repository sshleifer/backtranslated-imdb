I can see that the reviews for this movie are not so high for this movie, so I have to be in the minority to like this movie so much. Well, I'm right, and everyone else's wrong (just fun). I think I like it because I'm a psychologist, and I really liked Ryan's bubbly character. While he is really dangerous as well as very threatening, you cannot completely hate him because he is obviously mentally ill and is likely to suffer from some kind of brain trauma. And wow did Ryan a really good job, portraying this man! You really feel like Ida Lupino as he destroys his life. So with such intense acting and threat, why is the film judged relatively low? Well, probably because it's not exactly credible ... but boy is it entertaining and creative. Try it and don't believe in the score of 6.4 - it's much better than that!
