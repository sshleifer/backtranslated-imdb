This film was a masterpiece of human emotions and experiences. I think many people are trapped in Leland's apparent mental illness like history, but I was drawn into the relationship between many of the characters and what they reveal about the power of human emotions. Much of the film's message is that we never know the good without the bad, which is a small clich√©, but what makes this movie so good and so original is that it very eloquently depicts the crushing and devastating power that the bad can have Whether you see the bad everywhere as Leland or experience the complete helplessness of unwarranted love or a relationship that just won't work, no matter how bad you want it. This movie captures how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie I've seen, and it's a depressing movie, as it's good.
