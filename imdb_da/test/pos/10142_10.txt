Excellent cast, history line, performances. Absolutely trustworthy. I am aware of the close knit group that exemplifies the Marine Corps. But this movie brought fear to my heart. The Marines let principles be condemned. It seems that this movie was based on reality incidents. It shows how difficult it is to go up against the company. Anne Heche was completely convincing. Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was a beginner. And Eric Stoltz as her lawyer was so easy to balance her loyalty to Corp, but also his loyalty to his client while he was high on his tightrope. He knew what his true act was. But he was pulled apart by his immersion in the marine tradition, loyalty to the corps above all else. I sat riveted on the TV screen. All in all, I give this a resounding 9 out of 10.
