Logged in to imdb to say what a charming movie Love Love is and is totally confused. It seems to me that someone has got their titles mixed up. "Plastic demon baby" what? This was not love life. A little moody dovey for my taste, but a great, fun and original movie. Especially liked the ending, which did not fall into the normal pit of the cliche, that all Hollywood romantic movies are crashing and burning it. Nine out of ten.
