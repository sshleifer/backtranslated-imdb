I see many movies. A lot of movies. Getting a master's degree in film forces one to watch 2-3 flicks a day. It all becomes very exhausting. Mostly because I feel I've seen it all. So rarely is it when I get surprised by something, mostly I hope to see something as good as I expect it to be. <br /> <br /> Death Bed is so unlike anything I've ever experienced that I actually had to stop DVD to rant over its genius. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the play is psychotic. It is structured in a way that forces the viewer to remain outside the frame. It's not like anything like Halloween with all its snappy editing and POV shots; The death bed actually comes across as a little dreamy. The most pretentious way I can put is: This is Samuel Beckett, who makes a haunted house movie. I think it's a manic depressive bed that eats people! And fried chicken! Out in the middle of nowhere! And there are bone hands! I can hardly articulate my feelings about this movie. And yes, copping to like this will open you up to ridicule. But things get right after a while. It's hard to be a cinephile and consistently remain committed. I can honestly say that this is a unique movie up and down. From what it is to how it is put together. We need movies like that, movies that shake us out of our complacency. Consider it as an existential camp. It's fun and it's stupid but also brilliant in its weird little way. The worst horrible villain all the time? Maybe, but at least it's not a guy in a mask.
