This is one of my all-time favorite movies. It is one of the movies where I know every line, but can still see it repeatedly without losing interest. I always throw this movie if I go on holiday, or if I don't want to go to the gym, I just want to see Nikki's beautiful body give me the motivation I need. It's an easy to see movie that always keeps me smiling, but I know it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if I love you, you love movies that are beautifully shot and have comedy, romance and an interesting plot You will love it. It's full of beautiful characters, and Ben and Nikki are both beautiful so everyone can stare at something appealing. BOTTOM LINE ...... YOU MUST GIVE A TEST! I watched it on TV one day of fluke and loved it that I had to go out and track it down, which took some time and I could see it every day. My Father HERO I Love You !!!
