WHAT AWESOME MOVIE !!!!!!!! I came out of the theater feeling stunned. The movie I just watched was one of the best movies I've seen in my life. I had my eyes glued to the screen. It is very symbolic, visually lush, beautifully shot and told gorgeously. It is basically about two people moving into an apartment and living next door to each other with the partners assumed to have an affair with each other's partners. Assuming this, our two heroes act on what they think their partners are up to. There is an obvious suppression of emotions for each other, using vouristic camera work, body language and symbolic stairs. It's a visual feast and hard to dislike. Some of the story gets a little confusing, but it's not something. The end is one of the most beautiful (and anti-hollywood) endings I have ever seen in my life and visually stunning. The movie's haunting score increases the mood. I highly recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and respect. What a great movie.
