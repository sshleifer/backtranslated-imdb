"Summer of my German soldier" was one of the many television films that became a staple to the small screen in the 1970s (others were "Brian's Song", "Sybil" and "Someone Watching Me!"). It depicts a Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol) who turns to a German POW (Bruce Davison) in World War II Georgia. One of the things the film shows is that many of the German soldiers were not really Nazis, but were just drawn up. See the movie, I have a real sense of how things must have been in the south since then; I mean, can you imagine being a Jewish person accused of supporting the enemy? <br /> <br /> So I definitely recommend this movie. I think it's always important to show the things portrayed here. Occasional abuse keeps the movie from being a full-scale masterpiece, but they tend to do it quite well. I hope the movie finally comes out on DVD. Also contributing to Esther Rolle and Michael Constantine ("My Big Fat Greek Wedding" patriarch).
