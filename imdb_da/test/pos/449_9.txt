There have been many good comments on this movie, and I would like to add my voice to praise. Yul Brynner has never been more powerful. His big Surov was riveting. Your eyes just can't leave the screen when he's on it. This is his movie. This is not too small the rest of the casting, which was also exemplary, especially Deborah Kerr and Anne Jackson. Since they were mostly actors, they brought many nuances to their performances. For example, I have seen this movie at least 4 times, but this is the first time I noticed the German girl's reaction when she came face to face with a Russian soldier. Although he was not threatening, her very hysterical reaction made me realize that she should have been in Germany after World War II and was most likely killed by the Red Army. The ability to discover deeper layers of history that may lie just below the surface will allow me to see this fascinating movie over and over again. Please put it on DVD.
