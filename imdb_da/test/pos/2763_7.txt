Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your fascinating epic "Alive," there was already the legendary Mexican exploitation director Ren√© Cardona who used the same drama as a sketch of his ambitious film "Supervivientes de los Andes". The unforgettable deadly flight of Fairchild 571, which crashed in the Argentine Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost many passengers' lives, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the deadly remnants of their unfortunate fellow passengers. Of course, you can't claim that this cheaply made and roughly edited movie is better than the famous 90 version, but I appreciate and respect this movie more. After all, an exploitation movie requires much more input from both the cast and the crew, while the large-scale Marshall movie, although intense, feels more like routine money making. The phrases and special effects cannot, of course, compete with "Alive", but "Supervivientes ..." deliver an equally impressive sense of hopelessness and create an even more nightmare hell of snow. Cardona films are ambitious, surprisingly compelling and easily one of the most notable Mexican productions ever. I am really surprised that Cardona takes on this story no more effectively and explicitly. The scenes where the deceased passengers are cut up and consumed are nevertheless difficult to digest, but they only serve to increase the credibility of the disaster and to emphasize the inhumane conditions of the survivors. Rather commendable for an evil director who gained fame with his infamous bad films such as "The Night of the Bloody Apes" and the Santo series. The unknown young Mexican actors do a good job and the musical score is endearing. The story is well known, of course, so the manuscript doesn't give any unexpected shock. Whether in history or previously seen "Alive", you know what kind of drama these people still have to endure before they are rescued and you can only wait for them. Nevertheless, this is a good movie that should not be based as often as is the case.
