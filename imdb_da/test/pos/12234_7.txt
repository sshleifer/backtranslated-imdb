Now I like Victor Herbert. And I like Mary Martin and Allan Jones. But it would have been nice to see a real biography by Victor Herbert. Walter Connolly as Herbert has a decent resemblance to him in his last year <br /> <br /> Jones and Martin are singing beautifully though. Herbert music is right here to boast of the plot line about these two musical artists. Jones John Ramsay is a fragile character, much like the Gaylord Ravenal in Showboat, which Jones also played. <br /> <br /> As for Mary Martin, it's a mystery why she never had a good Hollywood career. She made movies with Bing Crosby and Dick Powell as well as this one. She worked well, but the film audience didn't take her. The best musical moment in the movie is Jones and Martin in a duet of Alene. The recordings I have of the song are individual and it was written as a duet. There is also a comfortable scene with Jones and Martin bikes that switch Herbert songs while they are driving. The real Victor Herbert with his women's stroke and his Irish patriotic background and his musical training in Germany, where he developed a love for all things German would have been a fascinating study. He was also a cello virtuoso before becoming full time to compose. I have to make a strong exception to the reviewer who said Cuddles Sakall would have been a good Victor Herbert. Sakall as Irish, HELLO. <br /> <br /> Nice movie, but the real Vic would have been so much better.
