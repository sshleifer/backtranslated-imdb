"Mishima: A life in four chapters" is a visually stunning production that handles complex problems with evocative ease. It is based on the life of the controversial Japanese author Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. It's not really a biopic - at least not one in the traditional sense - but an exploration of Mishima's iconoclastic oeuvre. The film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an unmanned, completely engaging way. Paul Schrader makes you sympathetic to Mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work. It doesn't solve the puzzle altogether, but it makes you understand it. An added bonus: As we see Mishima's rage over the lack of tradition in a morally vacant modern society, Schrader gives us an excellent demonstration of dichotomy between thought and performance in cinema. John Bailey's movie is spectacularly good. The grandiose of the composer Philip Glass's work fits perfectly with the project. "Mishima" is the best movie I've seen this year, so far.
