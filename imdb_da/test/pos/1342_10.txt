I grew up in New York and this show came on when I was four years old. I had a half-day nursery and it was on WPIX Channel 11 in the afternoon. I just loved the music and the stories and remember to humming them around the house when they play. <br /> <br /> I've just seen part of an episode on YouTube and for a moment I remembered how it felt to see the shows as a young child. Of course I stopped seeing when I was in 1st grade because it was on before school came out (no video recorder or DVR is then). I grew up, didn't realize the show was still on until I was in 11th grade! <br /> <br /> I also had no idea that there are DVDs and want my nieces and nephews to be young enough to enjoy this show, but now they are all past demographic or I want to buy all of them DVD sets. This was so much better than many of the child's shows today.
