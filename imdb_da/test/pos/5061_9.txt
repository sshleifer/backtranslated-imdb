RENDITION is a movie not to be missed with solid scripture from Kelley Sane and with the direction of Gavin Hood who takes us on a story that is a journey through a man's journey through hell. Once again, Meryl Streep in a convincing role in the CIA today and good performances from a cast of superlative actors in Reese Witherspoon, Jake Gyllenhall and Alan Arkin, along with Middle Eastern actors, adding to the reality of the story. /> <br /> In RENDITION, you see how "terrorism can raise terrorism", and as the film progresses to tie the story to what is playing in the Middle East, reality is brought on the screen. The external shots add to the intensity of the story, and Peter Sarsgaard does a brilliant job of playing an assistant in "ass kissing" way how American politics is performed. Too bad there has not been a larger audience for this movie, which, along with ELAH's and LIONS LAMBS VALLEY, plays RENDITION an important role in showing an audience how the struggle and protection of democracy can go seriously on the road.
