I started to see this very tense because I heard so many different things about it. Somewhere I read was a drama on child abuse and classified PG-13 for violence. Another critic said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure of children (and I thought it was also for children to see). Well, now I've seen it so many times and still don't know in which category to put it. It is sometimes extremely fun but terribly sad and depressing the next moment. Because of the lovely relationship and the fairy tales, I would like to recommend this movie to all the young people I know, but I fear that the bad atmosphere is not suitable for children. Because of the perfect performance and the magic of the movie, I have to say it anyway: See it, especially the kids! The last thing I have to say is that I hate the scriptwriter to never let poor Bobby see his family again after fleeing from The King (who did not even return to terrorize it remained Mary and Mikey). It is very good for this movie not to have a perfectly happy ending with everyone being happy - and I did not expect it - but this solution left me very, very sorry!
