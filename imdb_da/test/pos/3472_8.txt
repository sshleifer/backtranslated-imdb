Let's get it clear from the start: I'm an asshole with the gender sensitivity. Therefore, I consider dramas of people with disabilities, social stigma or whatever suffering they have and cry on and about it as stupid movies with bad taste. I mean, if you have a message, you can tell it without the help of sick or pitiful people. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. It is about people with incredible bad luck while personal health goes, but they do not cry about it; on the contrary, they are trying to live and people are trying to "protect" or "care" them by actively removing them from real life. The message is the living life to the fullest, though the end is as sad as possible. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: Drama, like sick people, is a keeper. It's sad, yet hope. I like James McAvoy, though he seems to always play the arrogant rebel. I also say Steven Robertson played very well. Either that or he really has partial paralysis. :)
