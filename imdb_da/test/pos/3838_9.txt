Engaging characters, good animation, dynamite songs ... all this and cute kittens too. There is a lot of excellent humor, but no real threat, so don't worry about your little ones. The two farm dogs steal the show, even though they only appear in two scenes. The artwork has a linear quality that can deprive some people, but I find it charming.
