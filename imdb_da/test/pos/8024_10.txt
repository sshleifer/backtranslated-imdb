<br /> <br /> When I first heard about this in 1997, over coffee with friends, I decided to check it out. The only problem was that it was on a small screen at one of my local cinemas. <br /> <br /> It didn't stop the pleasure of watching a simply amazing movie, with a top notch cast in Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. The whole movie kept me glued to my seat. <br /> <br /> I simply found no fault in this amazing movie, I give it my highest recommendation to those who love thrillers. I am very proud to have this in my collection. <br /> <br /> 10/10 (I don't give it a bit).
