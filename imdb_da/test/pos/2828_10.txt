The movie had no help at all, promoting: if there was an advertising sample on TV or radio, then I didn't / heard it. The only newspaper advertisement I saw was at the opening weekend: a dingy, blunt B & W main picture of Andy as Val-Com, behind the prison bars headed: "WANTED! Runaway Robot!" (who was also the poster in front of the 3 cinemas, I watched it - NOT the lovely little color poster on this site, with headshots of all cast and cartoon of Crimebuster - which really wasn't that good - They couldn't have used an action scene from the movie itself - did they not have a start-up photographer? A poster should help a potential audience if they want to watch the movie - there were so many people who could not get into their sold out choices and wanted to know what Heartbeep was about - and that poster didn't help! The shabby picture, and the only other pictures that were delivered for papers, were so rude in B&W that they were worthless.) There was no trailer for the movie: only a slide at a theater , consisting of the word "Heartbeeps" in a heart shape, with a Cupids arrow through it and one that was a complete black image: just Andy and Bernadette's voices say "Val-Com! My pleasure center is functional!" "So is mine, do you think we should tell our owners?" There is no help for people who had not been aware of the movie. During the filming, Andy told reporters he couldn't eat when his plastic lip was applied so he would "load" up on breakfast and quickly "during the day's shoot. I don't know what Bernadette did: but at that time I had wondered Why don't they just sip protein drinks through long grills or eat astronaut-style puree food via tube? <br /> <br /> The baby robot, Phil-Co, seemed to have been pre-cursed for Short Circuit's Johnny-Five, with the same eyes , similar face. I tried to find out if they had the same designer but no help. I have magazine articles about the movie, and the design team was incredibly proud of their work and had a special price for their innovative unit to create odorless " Smoke "for Catskil's cigars. Shortly thereafter, LucasFilm did NOT use the device even though they should have to return Jedi's scenes to Jabba the Hut: a man created" steam "around Jabba by blowing cigar smoke into a tube and fun all that he needed was a glass of brandy and he would be a happy man. I thought LucasFilm's use of genuine tobacco products was insensitive to people who were disturbed by smoke. <br /> <br /> John Williams, who had recently succeeded in the late major Arthur Fielder as the maestro for Boston Pops (who was then a rating hit - but it was never restored from Fielder's death and is now a shadow of Its former glory), the show used to promote films that he supplied the music. He premiered "The Empire Strikes Back" score there; And you would think he would have helped Heartbeep together by playing a few numbers there? The only thing critics wanted for this movie was Williams' score - but it was NOT available for purchase! I saw a vinyl album in 1982 with half Heartbeeps, half a second movie - but it disappeared. I just tonight saw the CD listed on this site and ordered it. If I can ever get a scanner and time to write the articles, I'd like to create a Heartbeep shelf. I liked the movie and don't care which dissenters say! <br /> <br /> The only problem with the movie was that it was near the end, it was logical: the robots ran away from the factory to get the freedom to determine their own destiny, making their own choices. when junkyard owners tell them that Phil is going to the factory to get a "purpose" programmed into him, they don't even ask; they just look at each other meaningfully and they go. Along the way, each adult loses battery power and "dies". They are not really dead as they are robots and only need new batteries, but they are treated as "dead", with little Phil crying over them and rolling away. So what was the point? Phil never comes back to the factory and gets "a purpose!" And, of course, the junkyard owners can run them or give them all battery charging with backup batteries; But the real point was to have this exciting scene where the robots all went down, and Phil is crying again. <br /> <br /> In the end, Val-Com golf instructor, and Aqua-Com is - I'm not sure what. Catskill is an ENTERTAINER - what OR should he be? I'm not sure they made it clear. Junkyard owners seem to be taking it easy, lying on chaise lounges, drinking lemonade from Phil, their "bartender". Val's and Aqua's new "daughter" Philsia - I think the name is - maybe it's Sylvania - doesn't seem to be much more than a table lamp. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of recordings - from pictures that I suppose the shortcomings contain a cute scene where Phil has a Christmas where Val gives him a car's wheel; Aqua delivers a horn; Catskill has taken the firefighter helmet to give to Phil as we saw; and they have Christmas trees. I don't know if any missing footage provides better logic or if the authors just couldn't think of a better crisis / solution. The movie was trimmed for 72-75 minutes to pair it with other failing films. No other reason than that. For a DVD, I would LOVE creating, as I will see interviews with cast / crew and John Williams and Merv Griffin the interview. Making recordings; and reediting and restoring the missing footage to do better.
