I was first introduced to John Waters movies by watching "Women's Problems" at the IFC. I was disgusted, but for some sick reason I had a good time. Then I picked up Pink Flamingos DVD in the John Waters Boxed Set. The movie is about Babs Johnson "The Filthiest Person Alive", who lives in a trailer in Maryland with his overweight egg-obsessed mother and her abandoned son "Crackers". In the film you see such sick sights as sex with chickens, crowns, people eating stools, torture and all other forms of random humiliation. The movie has a soundtrack from 60s rock and roll artists. The only problem is that some parts of the movie seem to be pulling on and can become a bit boring. I found "Woman problems" a little more fun. Classified NC-17 for explicit sex, violence and disturbing images. Enjoy.
