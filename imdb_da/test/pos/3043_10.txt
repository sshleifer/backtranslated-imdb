I watched this movie for the first time just over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before, and I consider myself knowledgeable about classic cinema. A genuine, polished diamond in rough. <br /> <br /> This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character "Conrack") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the island's children, all in a school. Initially, students reveal that they know very little of the world beyond their island home. The heart of the movie is Conrack and finds inspiration to awaken their young minds to the world around them. The students quickly reward their teacher with an eagerness to learn and a remarkable ability to understand concepts that were only a short time ago foreign to them. Conrack uses unconventional and clever teaching techniques that happen to be, a little fun! God forbid. Learn and Fun? Together? Can't be, or they say the responsible ones. To avoid a spoiler, I just have to say that Conrack finds opposition with the boss man .... and the end is really bittersweet. I am a 35 year old white man with some teaching experience so I had to identify with the protagonist, Pat Conroy (aka, Conrack, Mr. Petroy). But I don't, I identify with the black children. As a child I became the bus to the school on the other side of town from the 4th to the 6th grade around 1979. These children in the film remind me of my classmates then. Fortunately, you do not understand in 4th grade as an 8 or 9 year old racism. I just remember that we were all kids, playing 4-square, kickball, hide-and-seek and running relays. <br /> <br /> This movie is very moving. There are lovely and exciting moments from start to finish, non-stop. I found myself many times with tears in my eyes, so suddenly laughing out loud. It's a fun movie. "Git away from the winda !!" .... "Sir, if you're ready to accept crap, let me tell you that the rabbit just did it in your lap" ..... "Did you see the white school teacher, Mr. Conrack. My grands love Conrack You are a great teacher, you are a good white man. "" Wind 15 mph from East boats, small boat warning, small boats watch out. Big boats OK, don't worry about anything. ".. .. "Not a roast but Eleanor Roosevelt, not a subset, but (some Latin) ... it's Latin ... he's waiting!" .... "Conrack sings like a seed .... I sing well , what are you talking about ?! ". <br /> <br /> It still mystifies me that I still don't hear about this movie or that it has very little reputation or subsequently. I intend to find out more reviews, comments, backgrounds and "producing" treats if they are out there. What amazes me is the play given by the uneducated children. One of the children, Mary, I understand was an actress and you can tell. But the other children have lots of lines and real reactions. I wonder how they did it! I guess Conrack and Mary had a precise dialogue to work with, while some of the scenes unfold naturally or ad libbed. <br /> <br /> Conrack is a special movie. In my opinion, it is one of the very few films that are as good and so unknown. Others in this category are King Rat ('65), Dark Passage ('47 with Bogie and Bacall), Gods Must Be Crazy ('80) and Bad Day at Black Rock ('55). I recommend them all. But first put yourself in the class of Mr. Conrack.
