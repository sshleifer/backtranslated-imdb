I don't think I've ever seen a movie in my entire life about a high school kid who creates his own college just to impress his parents. Today, films are either remakes or sequels or plots that have been used in many different films. This one has an original story line and following it up by making it a comedy movie only facilitates the deal. With this well thought-out story and with a grin mixed in, this is a good movie. Now I've seen better, but when I went into the theater, I thought of another fabric / beer / frat party with something sexually induendo thrown in (also an "American Pie" flick), but I was surprised. To sum up, I enjoyed the movie and the next time you push through the paper for movies, look for viewing times for "Accepted". If you want to laugh out loud then it is.
