Trey's favorite from the first round of season 10 and also one of my personal favorites, Manbearpig has Al Gore's adventure before going on global warming, and before the movie it was an adventure determined, Al Gore also tried to witness the world of something, who can change the earth, something really dangerous, this time about something half-half-bear and half-pig, Al Gore had only one thing in mind: to witness all Manbearpig and to kill it! All Gore here is more than fun, everyone who sees him is sad and yes, he can be childish, do tantrums when no one believes in him, but he's just a prison bastard. Basically, four children are trapped in a cave because of Al Gore, but certainly he does not have that in his mind, there is no room for other issues, just Manbearpig in the case of Al Gore. The four children are Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan. Basalt Stan felt sorry for AL Gore, and the four boys just played in Al Gore's game, which never pictured that Gore could almost kill them while trying to kill Manbearpig (hilarious scene - "they are just kids, damn Manbearpig") . So on this side we have everything on the one hand with the rescue team, which is also sad Al Gore, and on the other hand we have a small but extremely hilarious Cartman episode and there are no surprises about Cartman's attitude after that he finds a treasure inside the cave, surely everything with this treasure is amazing and it is good because you want to see a sick Cartman in both senses, he is really sick for the boys and really ill for us. And finally, Al Gore kills Manbearpig! This character is a fantastic and I am corn! Great fun in this episode, a very re-watchable one. 10 out of 10
