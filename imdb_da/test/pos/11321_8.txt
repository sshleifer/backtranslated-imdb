Daniel Percival's "Dirty War", a BBC television production was recently shown on cable. The film has a documentary style in the way it goes after the people who caused the nearby holocaust in one of the big cities in the world, London. In fact, this movie, produced in 2004, is almost a warning of the events of the following year, when terrorists put explosive devices in public transport, killing innocent people in the wrong place at the wrong time. /> <br /> The film impresses the pace that the director and production team gave to the project. There are no dull moments in the movie as we see the preparations of the terrorists and the people who follow their dirty work. Though the inevitable happens, it is great just to think about what would be the consequences if a real "dirty bomb" was planted in such a densely populated area. <br /> <br /> The last pictures of the movie have a chilling effect. The moss scenes and the way in which the whole area is polluted sends tremors of fear and reflects on how it can be done anywhere.
