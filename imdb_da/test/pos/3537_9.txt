Obviously inspired by the Se7 and sometimes even more cruel; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a little too much for my taste). Fantastic script and plays (I was particularly impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points to throw). Good movie and very realistic stereo sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on the BBC in three parts, I saw the Messiah on video at once. A criticism; The villains' motivation was not very convincing.
