I loved this movie the first time I saw it. It gives a detailed description of which leaders involved in the news industry will do to get a story on the air: especially Jane Craig rushing Kenny to finish editing the piece to get it off, and then Joan Cusack fights to Get it in and William Hurt, who, according to Jane, commits an incredible violation of ethics, falls into tears during his riot interview, an error pointed out by Aaron. Another highlight is when Tom uses Jane for his own benefits and turns around and sleeps with Jennifer. The script is brilliant and the control is almost as good. All three major actors were great in the portrayals of their characters, especially Holly Hunter, and Albert Brooks, who is the funniest in the movie. William Hurt is also very good. This deserved at least three Oscars, best actress (holly hunter), best supporting actor (Albert Brooks) and best picture. I liked the last parts of the movie, which shows that they are reunited 7 years later. <br /> <br /> 8/10
