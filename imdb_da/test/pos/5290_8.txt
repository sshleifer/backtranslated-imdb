I have read many different opinions and reviews of this movie and I understand why many people get mixed feelings about Ponyo, whether it's the storyline, the animation, the dialogue, and so on. And I think the simplest way I can answer here is that it is a movie for a much younger age group. An age group much younger than Tonarino Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro). <br /> <br /> Being a Miyazaki fan like most surfers on this site, I expected the wonderful animation, music composition, complex storytelling, the great, stable sign development, how history mingles with today's society, etc. etc of a typical Miyazaki movie that we grew up with. And to tell you the truth, I didn't quite understand what the hell this story was about, or what hell was going on for an hour and twenty minutes (with twenty minutes left in the movie) that this movie is NOT for the deep thinkers and hard core Ghibli lard, but for toddlers and kids' and happy go lucky Japanese people. I also think this movie is based on simplicity and creative animation; just up the grassroots Ghibli Studios style. <br /> <br /> The fact that a villain is not present really surprised me, except father and maybe the crazy typhoon. But apart from that, this movie is simply fun; to stimulate a kid's mind and to make a good good time feeling. That's all. <br /> <br /> The animation goes back to the older school in the mid-80s of the 90s in Miyazaki's movie, where very specific details were not a major focus, unlike Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) and the latter. I admire the simplicity, what kind of little nostalgia created when I first looked at Ghibli movies like Tonarino Totoro when I was a kid. The children's reaction and movement are very much like the children, and much of the studio Ghibli's body language is very noticeable. Studio Ghibli added some creative moments and scenery that they can only do with his wonderful animators, but it will not take the ritual of Ghibliad into awe. The Japanese dialogue also sounded very child-friendly and many scenes and dialogues are very, very relative to what Japanese children and mothers would say and act. The music if very hoppy and "fluffy" I think you could say (looks like Totoro) from start to finish. Even the darker scenes did not seem confident. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this movie is one of a kind. Almost every aspect of this movie is for children. And I waited quite a few minutes to realize it. Frankly, I've never seen a movie told or shown what Miyazaki did. It is refreshing to see Studio Ghibli still be able to tell a story for a wider and very diverse range of audiences and still keep that brand Ghibli impression.
