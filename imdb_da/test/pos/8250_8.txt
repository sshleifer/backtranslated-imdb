A gem of a British caper comedy. The poor American club Pinky Green (Richard Jordan plays another bad guy but this time a sweet one) comes out of a British prison and tries to go straight, but his maintenance job in a bank is too attractive for his never-reformed criminal friends, led by a really nasty Ivan (David Niven in one of his last roles). Pinky resists, but the lure of all that money is just too much for him. Things unravel and rerel, and it is quite gratifying to see. Jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career, but he never played the same twice - one is just too lovable to hate. Niven has never played a slicker bad guy, oil everywhere. Two fine actors we've lost that I wish we had left.
