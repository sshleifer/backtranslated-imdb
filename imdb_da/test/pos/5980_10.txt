Larisa Shepitko's ASCENT (1976) is an extraordinary, disturbing account of the partisans' struggle against the Nazis in the German occupied Belorussia. Ascens reflects the Russian occupation with the horrors of the great patriotic war, but unusually both are steeped in religious symbolism and ready to recognize the existence of the lesser-than-large Russian collaborator. The true battle is not with the Nazis, who float in the background as an extra state, but between the Russian Nazi investigator and Sotnikov, the captured partisan who finds the spiritual strength to go to his death undefeated. With its many references to the crucifixion, history takes heroic proportions to the delight of the martyr's suffering and his influence on future generations. A remarkable job.
