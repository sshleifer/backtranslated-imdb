Over the 21th film version of the Ruth Gordon game, detailing its experience of trying to keep the marriage with Garson Rabbit after serving, Irene Dunne gives one of his better later roles on the big screen. It's also in line with what was an optimistic spirit in America about how we wouldn't turn up peace as we did in World War I and saw the seeds of yet another global conflict. <br /> <br /> Playback Ruth Gordon wrote and starred for 221 performances in 1944 on Broadway and was limited to the bungalow that Gordon and Harvey Stephens who were the male leader had on a training base. If you look at the Broadway Circle, it says that the production was "staged" by George S. Kaufman as opposed to being directed by him. I'm not sure about the distinction, but I can imagine that with a wild and strong will that is strong as Kaufman, it must have been an interesting period to put the production together before the opening of the night. <br /> <br /> When Columbia bought Screen Rights, Sidney Buchman had to do some significant script reconstruction to move action beyond the bungalow. The film carries very little trace of its stage origin. <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays the man and Charles Coburn, a writer for both Dunne and Knox. Knox has graded not only the editor but the highlighted columnist. His words and thoughts help sell the paper, and Coburn is in a tie. But Knox feels he has to get into the war, the usual event of his time to speak authoritatively about the kind of post-war world he wants. This was not an uncommon theme these years. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne has some great comics, the kind she used to have when she came over to Cary Grant. In fact, Garson Rabbit directed both of them in My Favorite House a few years earlier. Coburn is his usual cantankerous old water buffalo by a boss who ultimately has a good heart. Over 21 was an optimistic picture that was sad to say, not really what the Allies and I believe they could all bring to the peace conferences to create a better world. Hopefully, a new generation will get it right.
