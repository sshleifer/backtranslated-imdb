Three American boys backpack their way around Europe, challenge each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and Hot babe lie as they can, but Andy is looking for true love. He finds this during their bungee jump attempts at the Eiffel Tower when he crosses and exhilarates saving a suicidal and heartbreaking beautiful Julie Delpy. His attempt to find this girl and the secret he reveals leads him and his friends to a fast paced adventure full of action, romance, make and inspired humor without taking themselves seriously or striving to be anything but a game entertaining 90 minute drive. I have seen this movie a number of times and found it a much more rewarding experience than the "London" original, although both films are so different, it is not fair to compare the two or even to regard this as a sequel.
