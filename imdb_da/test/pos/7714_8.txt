I've seen three of the Animatrix episodes, and this is my favorite of them all. The second renaissance gave a weak back story to the already spun universe. The program was a stylistically impressive number, it just felt a little stupid. I guess what gives this a special touch is the direction from Shinichiro Watanabe, director of the incredibly popular (and for good reason) series Cowboy Bebop. It has some of the best elements of Bebop: smooth, sci-fi adventures, a no-nonsense, a little apathetic hero who works to hire, a bounty-head (more or less) and a hunting scene, all wrapped in an excellent film-noir packaging. Watanabe's Tarantino-style slickness comes here full throttle.
