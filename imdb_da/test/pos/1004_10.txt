Can you catch the moment? When do you hear rain on the roof? Some things go beyond the sum of their parts and express the poetry of life. The things that matter. <br /> <br /> Poet Dylan Thomas captured the seemingly unpredictable "A good poem helps expand everyone's knowledge of himself and the world around him." (Bob Dylan named him after him). So why has it taken so long to make a movie of the great Dylan Thomas? A simple biopic could have missed the point. Author Sharman Macdonald has taken another, better approach. <br /> <br /> In the Love of Love she creates a world of passions and complexities that fill the poems so we can swim in them. The lives of four friends. Dylan who loves and loves fully. Wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller), his feisty support. War-hero William (Cillian Murphy) who rescues him from a street cat. And then there is his childhood sweetheart. Vera. Dear Vera. Take the breath Vera. She is Caitlin's closest friend. Williams wife. And as a mouse, the star of Dylan's dark sky. It all starts in 1940 London Blitz, with bombers in the underground. Enter Vera (an impressive Keira Knightley) under projected scene spotlights. She meets Dylan for the first time again this year, her heart is rinsed. Their eyes shine through smoke in the room. The purity of their past passion. Dylan (native Welsh speaker, Matthew Rhys) is not a sanctified, disinfected poet. The master of his vices he must fully experience them. He introduces his beloved wife, then he continues with Vera. <br /> <br /> Edge of Love is a visual treat. The soundtrack leaves you who want more. Performances may be the best of these players in their careers. As a lush love story, it's pretty good. As an insight into Dylan Thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives, not at all bad. And as a tribute to a great man, inspiring. <br /> <br /> Production has been difficult to project Dylan Thomas's spirit without compromising on historical accuracy too much. Dramatic excitement involves a trait between artistic freedom and conventional morality. Audiences seeking an experience based on the latter may be disappointed. And it will play less well for the public whose borders are Albert Square. <br /> <br /> Sharman Macdonald seemed to pay attention to the mainstay of artistic freedom and its boundaries as she spoke to producer Rebekah Gilbertson (grandson of the real William and Vera). "Think of all the things you don't want me to write about," she said, "because I have to have a carte blanche." For Macdonald, the boundaries were if she were to reject Dylan's memory. But for many artists, especially men, the boundaries are those that wife and family could put on them. A woman will not let high ideals interfere with practical sense problems and will even put her children's interests to herself. (This happens occasionally inversely as when towering genius Virginia Woolf refused to let loving Leonard bring her down to earth - in the hours). <br /> <br /> Despite the tension between Caitlin and Vera, these two women become closest friends. It is one of the film's most important (and very beautiful) themes. <br /> <br /> The film's colors tell a story in itself. In a killing, wartime is Britain, Caitlin and Vera living highlights of a gray sea. Shortly after the meeting in Vera's enlightened scene persona, we encounter Caitlin through his soft blue eyes, sparkling in a dark railroad car. Her dramatic red cloak cuts a dash through streets of colorless homogeneity, triumphing on a beautiful staircase as she reunites with Dylan. But Vera's lipstick brightness is less durable. For her, marriage is best even when she has been obsessed with true love for her husband. Outstanding cinematography involves using montage to put together images in the same way as the poetry's equation of non-related words to create additional meaning. Terrible war scenes in the Thessaly are narrowed with the cry of Vera during pregnancy. Is it born or is it abortion? We are not told immediately. Pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present. <br /> <br /> Constant echoes of Dylan's poetry throughout the film take us beyond earthly contradictions. It reminds me of Marlon Brando, who reads TS Eliot in Apocalypse Now. A light beyond the horrors of the world. Another way to see things. "I take you back to a time when no bombs fell from the sky and no one ever died," Dylan says to Vera as they walk along the beach. Elsewhere, Caitlin recalls childhood with Vera: "We are still innocent in Dylan," she says. <br /> <br /> There is time to leave your knickers at home or share a universal cigarette. (Not literally, maybe.) A time to be inspired. Enjoy what might be the best British movie of the year.
