By watching the last 2 episodes, I remembered a TV add-on from my childhood. It showed the wild west, very dusty and dry, and there is a small salon, a man walks into the bar / lounge, he is thirsty as hell, lips cracked, etc. .... he has just gone through the Nevada desert and hasn I haven't been drinking water for days. He croaks to the bartender "Gimme a packet of potato chips" While he eats it, we can feel the drier he gets, we hear a voice in the background and say .... "Continue building the thirst, build it until you can't hold it more ............. then blow it away with TEAM "The man drinks TEAM (a soda) It feels like a few dozen bags of potato chips thirst is so intense that I can't keep it more, season 2 has even more turns and season 1. end many questions, but many ask many more questions hopefully we will know the answer in season 3, but i doubt it because i feel lost have momentum going much longer than 3 seasons if the people behind the camera stop their good work. <br /> <br /> I for one will continue to see. <br /> <br /> From Pakistan with love
