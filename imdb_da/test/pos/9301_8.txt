The movie seemed a bit slow first. But it took off and got right to that point. It showed exactly how the government and the scientist claimed humanity and the reasons for the "gadget". I enjoyed it. It's very close to reality like any movie about the atomic bombs that had to be released in Japan. I have recommended it to friends. I was particularly pleased with Dwight Schultz's ability to function.
