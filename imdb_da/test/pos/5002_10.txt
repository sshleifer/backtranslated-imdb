"Who do you dream of? Hoot Gibson ... Howdy Doody? I'm talking about the * theater *!" [Harry Crystal] <br /> <br /> Nothing beats a fantastic stage show ... nothing! And Harry Crystal lives that faith. A scene actor still waiting for his big break, brings Harry the magic of live theater to a small town and to Artie Shoemaker (TOM HULCE) ... a young man who has big dreams (but didn't know it until he met Harry ). <br /> <br /> With scenes and songs from many of America's classic musicals ... These lips, these eyes convey both the ups and downs of the people who, for 2 hours, take us to a fantasy country, but who manages Keeping the magic alive in their hearts all day long! <br /> <br /> Like Artie ... when you've seen these lips, these eyes ... "You're hooked, baby!" [Harry Crystal]
