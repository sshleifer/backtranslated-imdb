The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was created. A quality film all around. <br /> <br /> I suppose you could love this movie just for its action but I liked it more than that. <br /> <br /> This is a pure thriller / horror movie. It gives a more full-scale script than most horror movies do. I thought at least the American version ended excellently and was great throughout. The story felt honest and brutal. <br /> <br /> The movie has an excellent, tight script that keeps the action moving, with credible characters in virtually credible situations.
