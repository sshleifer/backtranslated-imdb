The original premise is based on the American Civil War, but it is ultimately a love story. We start at the beginning of the war, where the protagonists (Kidman & Law) are of course aware of each other, and there is an obvious attraction, they have a passionate kiss on the day he leaves for the war. The main film in this movie is for the character of the law to return to Kidman's and his struggle to reach it and her struggle to survive until he returns. The reason why it does not convince is that we do not see enough of this relationship before the nature of the law leaves battle - it is hard to believe that 2 people yearn for each other so much as they have had so little contact. Everything else is just about fine, Renee Zellweger and her established father and his affiliations are lovely additions, just as the threat from the band is chasing desert. Sure it's a long movie, but it keeps the interest, and the cinematography is amazing. A reputable attempt that doesn't quite make it, but worth looking at.
