Admittedly Alex has become a little podgey, but they are still (for me) the greatest rock trio ever. I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD to any fan. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed that they canceled their planned recent Munich gig (logistics) and regretted not making efforts to see them elsewhere. The DVD is a little comfort - the biggest incentive to acquire a proper DVD playback setup. <br /> <br /> Maybe, but I still don't understand the importance of the tumble dryers on stage; I would be grateful for any clarification. <br /> <br /> Bowl, Iain.
