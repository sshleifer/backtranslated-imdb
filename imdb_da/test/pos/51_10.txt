This was definitely one of the best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances from a stunning A-List casting that will move you from smile to laughter to tears and back. <br /> <br /> I couldn't help but worry about the characters. Mrs Merkerson will blow you away, just as the young man plays the young lead. <br /> <br /> I also thought the set design was top rate. The viewer is really placed within each era as it is presented. <br /> <br /> The music is also a blast. Nice choice to represent mood, time and place. The blind blues man is stereotype, but he delivers some good songs. <br /> <br /> This is a great story that survives many repetitive prospects. Take the time to see it!
