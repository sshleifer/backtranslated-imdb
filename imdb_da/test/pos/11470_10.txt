I thought this movie was good, I loved the plot, I loved shooting scenes, except few, they were not needed, and I also enjoyed Mama's character, she was a rider, I liked. I have to say that in this gangster movie the actors were picked well because sometimes some players just didn't fit the role. But even though I hate to say so, but I hated the end, I felt like it should have gone in a different direction. Also it would have been better with a little more detail, it is based on a true story but there was so much of the fact excluded but except that it was good. If you enjoy movies on the former gangsters, you will enjoy this movie.
