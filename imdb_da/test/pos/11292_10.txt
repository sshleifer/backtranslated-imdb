The visual effectiveness of this movie is unmatched by everything I have seen. And the work to be done must have been incredibly long and boring (don't just keep "Kodak Grainy Film" in your camera to get that look). Don't look at this movie to be entertained, watch it being visually stimulated, see it being challenged and provoked in your thoughts on film and any other topic that comes to mind, religion will probably be a thought. <br /> <br />
