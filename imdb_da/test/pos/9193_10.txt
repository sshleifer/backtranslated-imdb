Someone reviewed this movie as a "waste of time" because he expects the "beautiful landscape of Brazil and Portugal", but then everything "washed out" or gloomy or something like that. I think this person missed the whole part of the movie. This is reality. The point of this movie is to show that life is not actually ideal and to show what people are going through in their lives for family, love and survival. A young man leaves his slum in Sao Paolo, Brazil, to go to Portugal to visit his mother's homeland after her death. He discovers that not everything is free and that the Brazilians are looking down on native Portuguese people. He eventually finds a life, a love, but the story does not end as expected, and this is not a fairy tale story. The part that got me the most was the final song, "Zeca Bailero (Honey Baby)" by Gal Costa. It fits so well with the movie; especially the end.
