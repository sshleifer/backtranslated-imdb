Looking at "Cold Mountain" gave me the impression that its director Anthony Minghella intentionally attempted to overcome himself and his own film of his "which he tried to beat was the almost impeccable" English patient "from 1996. Comparison of the two films, the premise is very similar. We have a passionate love affair between two people in a turbulent war-time, and they end up treating the war more or less as a disturbance in the background as they try to get back into each other's arms again. The primary plot differences are that Nicole Kidman's character is not married, Jude Laws is a deserter, and the conflict is the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> Historically, "Cold Mountain" is more water and mellow than say "The English Patient" and it's more at the level of people who want a simple love story with some kind of external turbulence that causes a problem. It's a shorter movie, which is a plus for people with less patience. But it's not as spectacular or original or really poignant as "The English Patient." My * only * big complaint about "Cold Mountain" is amazingly the love affair between the characters Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Amazingly, their love was the least interesting thing in the picture. They do not have a genuine relationship; We do not feel any genuine passion that comes from them, and the passion we see is more physical than emotional. I was more intrigued by the friendship between Nicole Kidman and the Oscar winner Renee Zellwegger and also Jude Law's travels across the country, dodging vigilantes and hostile soldiers. If Minghella had strengthened the meaning of the love story, he would have had a better picture. Of course, the film is entertaining, though the love story is uninteresting. The Civil War sequences are absolutely great; they are of the modern tradition that shows war as horrible and dehumanizing. The resumption of the Petersburg campaign, where tons of explosives were detonated from the ground and then followed by a hand-to-hand battle, is terrible. Minghella is not shy to show blood and do artistic and sensible ways, and he is not afraid to show innocence and life in these scenes. There are moments where women as well as men are killed, often by crossing. And there's more to it. Just the sound design of the movie creates excitement. There is a scene where Inman and another deserts make up for a meal by looking at the head of a dead cow. We do not see the slices, but the sound effects of the knife that goes through bone are diseases. Finally, I must congratulate the cast for the performances. Jude Law was fantastic in the movie and deserved the Oscar nomination he received. I feel that Nicole Kidman also deserved one, even though her character was a little low. Renee Zellwegger had the most personality and screen-stealing atmosphere. And then there are only those bits that really work to complete this stylistic world that recreates a terrible time in America's past. Perhaps "Cold Mountain" would have been better as a war image, but it certainly would have been spectacular as "the English patient" if its love story had been driven and made more passionate by writers and director Anthony Minghella. As it is, it is a most enjoyable image, I do not regret it and I recommend it. I'm just saying that its love story - even if it's a central plot - is a little more soft than is necessary to be, and all things around it were what really worked.
