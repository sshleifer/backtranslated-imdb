Can't believe that Bostock's Cup is not yet available on a proper video or DVD. I've only seen it once, on a dodgy copy taken by the TV, and despite not being a footy fan (whatsoever) thought it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The famous sloping pitch where it was, the clueless coach driver ("Ponty-this, Ponty-it", "I take the next exit"), the meaningless plot; It all set up for aching sides. <br /> <br /> Being stuck in the US, I'm desperate for some good British humor, but not quite enough to spend the amount requested by the manufacturing company. Come on, take it out on kosher dvd pronto.
