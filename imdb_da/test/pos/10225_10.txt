This movie is a perfect example of Barker's cinematic gifts for the horror / monster genre. I thought this movie did a great job of keeping the feel and look of the novella and the comics (or actually the comics may have come another thing I forget). This movie was made for Barker fans. It helps to read the book in advance, but it is not so important if you can follow a movie. I saw everyone who is on the fence about this movie, reading the book and then watching movies again. You might find a new respect for the movie. I came to this movie a great fan of Barker already, and after reading the book before, loved the movie instantly. There are good comedies, makeup, writing, steering, etc. in this movie. This movie does something that most monster / horror movies fail on showing monsters. They are there in full color, not hidden in shadows, and take most of the screen time. Unlike other movies that use fast cuts or trick lighting to hide the creature, this movie celebrates the grotesque and throws them in the lead as the good guy. Two thumbs on Clive. We are waiting for the thief forever:)
