One of the best horror / suspense movies I've seen for a long time. Wow, it was a great surprise and stunning on how good this movie was, sometimes a gem like this one will surface but is rare. I was expecting a popcorn monster flick and a mildly derivative way to spend a late night, but instead a very well-crafted and directed movie with great acting and made with passion and heart. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that makes you feel the characters and what happens to them, and it is recorded as if you were there and it really happens. I know some people in other reviews compare it to "Open Water", but I disagree because I thought Open Water was quite boring and mediocre, while this film was the opposite, even though they were superficially filmed in the same "realistic" style . br /> <br /> The actors are unfamiliar, at least to me, but they are all very effective and convey the quirky situation with frightening intensity and realism. The story is well done and flows smoothly, the plot is logical and seems to be something that could happen, all actions and thoughts on the characters are quite what a person would do and think about. Very trustworthy and it makes the movie more real because of it. <br /> <br /> At the end I had tears in my eyes. I have to say that a movie rarely has this effect on me, it is so powerful and emotionally this movie was performed and I am appropriately impressed by the director and the actors in this amazing movie.
