Necessary viewing for anyone watching TV news, as it may be a little more skeptical or even cynical. On a personal note, I remember taking a course some years ago about being interviewed for TV - what to do, what not to do. Course instructors impressed that TV news was a "show-biz branch". The depressing view, which is probably even more valid today than it was made, is reinforced by this film. Never mind journalistic integrity, what counts is the ability to look good and smile nicely. And make sure you don't sweat the camera. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the three main characters forms the central part, each with its own ambitions, abilities and beliefs. Brooks takes these differences and puts them into the fleeting setting of a television news studio, adding more than one pinch of love to the mix. The result is a complex, slightly over-depicted depiction of how we compromise every day to meet our ambitions and take others with us. It's always entertaining, though the final scene might be unnecessary with everything that had gone before.
