TROMEO & JULIET - 10. Annual Report <br /> <br /> William Shakespeare's play Romeo & Juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in movies. Sometimes, literally, the original text (which is sometimes vague in directions) sometimes follows new interpretations where directors chose to show their own perception on the piece. Some are good, many are mediocre. Lloyd Kaufman's film certainly reflects one of the most original and modern versions of the bard's creation. It can be placed in a modern discouraging New York and full of today's antisocial behavior, body piercing, dismemberment and kinky sex (which for Shakespeare's more than occasional reads away) but at the same time remains incredibly close to the overall feeling and point of what The play is about, which is quite the effort. Kaufman wrote the manuscript with his co-director James Gunn, now famous for writing two successful Scooby Doo films, making it impossible by making a perfect remake of an already perfect movie with his Dawn of the Dead script and directing it of this year's best horror movie: Slither. Lloyd Kaufman's innovative management show along with James Gunn's original and unlimited writing allows for an interpretation of Shakespeare's games, which may not all "get" right away, but will surely be recognized by a truly unique and extremely important perception of a classic game. With a script written exclusively in Iambian meters, the appearance of Motorhead's Lemmy and a monstrous soundtrack is to see Tromeo & Juliet something that no one will ever forget. Apart from it's historical significance, Tromeo & Juliet is a treasure for movie lovers of all kinds. Not only for the James Gunn script, now a good influence on Hollywood while working from the inside, but also because it includes an early part of legendary actor Debbie Rochon. Well-known by anyone who is familiar with movies made on lower budgets. The 10-year anniversary edition on DVD adds to all that by including as many as yet undiscovered gems that not only all the information you could want about the movie itself and the experience of doing so are presented in ways that make it impossible to Turn off the DVD, but also a very honest (and disturbing) look is given in the ways that independent cinema must survive these days. In many ways, the extra on the disk is an invaluable addition to the already impressive amount given at Kaufman's film school "Make Your Own Damn Movie". Several historical things from the Troma vaults, which include James Gunn, Debbie Rochon, and all other contributors to this masterpiece, are included, and the film itself, apart from looking better than ever, is accompanied by no less than four voices, each and every one informative, rude fun and everything made for serious addition to the movie rather than the boring and nonsensical comments that are so common these days. There are new comments (one with Kaufman and Gunn together), but also one James Gunn did for the original release of the DVD, but could not be included there for any honesty as he shows if some other people are present at this disk. With fan recreation of a couple of scenes from the movie, a video diary by Lloyd Kaufman's visit to the set of James Gunn's Slither and a visit the two brought together to Eli Roth's Hostel Birthday Party and more, this is the ultimate set everyone should own The weather you are a film historian, someone interested in interpretations of the Great Board's work, a fan of great cinema, a fighter for independent cinema, a fan of James Gunn, interested in learning more about making low budget movies, a fan of Lloyd Kaufman or anything: This is the most important DVD release of this millennium!
