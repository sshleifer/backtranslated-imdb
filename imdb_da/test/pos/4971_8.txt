This is a great Italian shark movie, probably not a full action-type shark movie, but it has a great story of a native American in the form of a killer shark that attacks a small beach community. the film has real scenes of real sharks and some not, but how they did it is pretty good, the cast is not so brilliant to appear in this shark movie, but it turns out better to appear in some other italian shark movies such as cruel jaws, last shark) they show some pretty bad plays, but most Italian shark movies are good, which means these voices are best the best Italian shark movie ever, some scenes in this movie show violence / gore, making this movie good, that it shows it so i wanted this to be the best movie for all shark movie fans.
