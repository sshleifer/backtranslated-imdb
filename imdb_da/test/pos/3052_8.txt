Along with virtually all republican images ever made, "Murder in the Music Hall" seems to have faded into oblivion. A shame because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written and devoted mystery-tense object spans an alluring ghost against Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's nice penthouse apartments suspects the delicious Rockettes - among them, Vera Ralston (who, in addition to providing appealing subtlety and vulnerability performance, gives a pair of dazzling skating numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford Julie Bishop, and several other lovely B-movie stars from the '40s. Long, blonde and beautiful William Marshall (usually thrown into musicals) chases down the killer as the complex and more sinister plot unfolds, against the most difficult settings you will ever see in a movie noir. The end is as much of a surprise as this sad forgotten classic murder mystery. Worth restoring and reviving on cable TV, VHS or DVD. The Republic sank a tremendous budget in this Grade A production, and "Murder in the Music Hall" is as slender, uncomfortable and immensely enjoyable as any of the great studio films in its era. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Pay attention to the rhapsodic song composed of the victim just before his death. Then, between the showgirls' incessant chattering in their changing rooms, one tries to determine who is humming the deadly melody. You will discover who the killer is like William Marshall does. Great fun, the kind of movie they really don't do anymore, and what a loss - both to movie goers and actors.
