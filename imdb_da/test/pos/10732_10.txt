I have seen many Dustin Hoffman's films as Straw Dogs or Rain Man, and I liked them, but his characters are very often quiet or even shy people. I expected him to be in this movie as he was in straw dogs, but I saw a completely different person. He was much more energetic in this movie and reminded me of Al Pacino in Serpico. The film was very interesting from the beginning to the end. I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do almost anything to stay with his son. This film is also revealing. Personally, I think it shows that people have to learn to find a compromise themselves without involving other people in the matter.
