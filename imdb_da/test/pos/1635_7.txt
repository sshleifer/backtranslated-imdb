Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure of Angels & Demons, which Hollywood decided to do after The Da Vinci Code, as the latter's more controversial topic struck a raw nerve on the belief itself. The Catholic Church was in arms over the first movie, but apparently unclear about this. And it's not hard to see why, when Ron Howard had chosen to make a flat play piece that serves as a major tourist video of Rome and the Vatican City, and likely would increase the number of visitors based on the many beautiful scene scenes. to St. Peter's Square and Basilica, which was a scaled model. <br /> <br /> So, I assume that with the majority of the budget going against the sets, the ensemble key had to be downgraded accordingly. Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female past that was abandoned by Audrey Tautou, but when Tautou had character, Zurer's scientist Vittoria had much less to do than just wait in the wings to change some batteries on a container filled with anti materiel. In the book, of course, she is feeding to Langdon to converse with her great knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati and the great feud between the two, but here she is neither loving interest nor his intellectual equal. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Ewan McGregor ticks every scene he is in as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, temporarily taking care of the papal office, while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel choosing a new Pope. And he plays Patrick with the glint in his eye, with nuances enough to tell you that there is more than meeting the eye. There are no surprises here for the novel's readers, but McGregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the movie when Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks. <br /> <br /> The book itself is rich with probably accurate content as always, and had many more plot points on science versus religion and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked in an engaging fictional work. While reading the book a few years ago, I thought that if a movie were to be made of it, it would be easy to leave and dwell on the inmates. Unfortunately, the Ron Howard movie did so at a pace that did not allow a temporary pause. Unlike the first movie where you had the characters set down for a "talk time" over a cup of tea, this thing moved so fast, it's like reading the book all the time again, after being skipped to come to Catholic Reviewers have called angels and demons harmless because I assume it did not drift on its many controversies, unlike the Da Vinci Code, which hit a raw nerve in the center of faith. And if anything, this movie served as a great advertising video with tourism with a good showcase of the many prominent tourist landmarks that would entice many around the world to visit. Of course, certain areas such as the catacombs below St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican archives are beyond the borders, but walk along the path of illumination, now it is almost free. <br /> <br /> Nothing new to those who have read the book except to see it come alive, but for those who don't, this movie can only force you to gather Dan Brown's novel just to read a little more about the meaning of the landmarks and signs such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini, which are intricately linked to the plot, but very left uncertain. Satisfactory popcorn entertainment leaves you with something spectacular.
