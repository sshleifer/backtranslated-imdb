Don't expect a classic military comedy that claims to make fun of the military, while only reinforcing a militaristic point of view. Instead, they deconstruct the elements that make the military such a murderous machine. Kind of East German version of "Buffalo Soldiers". "NVA" works at a meta-level that it sympathizes with its heroes' attempts to escape from the drill, any way they can. It's not about tall laughs, but about long-lasting smiles. Utopian, of course (in one scene you will be shown the hard reality), but very thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Just to fill in the required 10 lines: Don't go into the movie if you've been a chief officer and liked your job.
