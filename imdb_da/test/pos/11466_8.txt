The 80s were overrun by all the HALLOWEEN / Friday's 13th slasher-style scare movies, so it's a relief. Ten incredibly annoying teenagers (would you like to hang out with these jerks?!) Decide to throw a Halloween party at a local former funeral home called "Hull House". During a "past life", a demon is accidentally released, and each person is obsessed and kills the others. <br /> <br /> The whole thing sounds very EVIL DEAD / DEMONS ish, but Tenney lets some director style matter there are some good one-liners, the music is excellent, Steve Johnson's prosthetic makeup FX is scary, and Linnea Quigley is pretty fun as a boy-crazy bimbo who pokes out eyeballs with her fingers and makes a great new thing with a tube of lipstick! <br /> <br /> Great fun at a no-brainer level! After checking the distribution of the vote and the other reviews, I do not understand how this only received 4 out of 10 (?!) <br /> <br /> I give it, 8 out of 10.
