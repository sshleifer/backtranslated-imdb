Coen's strike again. I had no preconditions to go in, and I was amazed at the bizarre story of a good-bad lighthouse story. Although Clooney can easily be replaced in this, his cornball style is welcomed. Turturro and Nelson are dead inferior. And I loved "I'm a man of constant grief" as done by "Soggy Bottom Boys". Catchy tune ... <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
