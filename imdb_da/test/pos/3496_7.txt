The Ali G character works brilliantly within the framework of a comedy show, but as a movie it doesn't work the same way. Do not understand me - it is a very funny movie full of biting, witty dialogue that cariculates the modern British chav wonderfully, while the viewer gets a hilarious, unrealistic story. <br /> <br /> One problem with this movie is that the script and the content are either brilliant or embarrassing. When I say embarrassing, I don't mean funny embarrassingly a la Office or Extras, but you'd rather wish they hadn't included it in the final cut. An example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the movie is finished, in the same way as "How we do it." When I watch the movie, I stop the DVD when it says the end and let it know. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ali G Indahouse is a great movie worth seeing a couple of times. The script is pleasant to an extent and there are no problems as far as it is concerned. However, sophistication is the keyword here. <br /> <br /> Ali G is a better TV show. Borat is a better movie.
