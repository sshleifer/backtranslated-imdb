This is undoubtedly one of the most accomplished debut films for any director. The movie is only 90 minutes long, but manages to say almost everything about life and death. Not much action and the dialogue is minimal, but the film flows perfectly and requires your attention because of the wonderful natural feeling of everything going on. The leaders' performance is perfection, and even some supporting characters get strong emotional scenes. The movie will be something lost in today's modern audience, but it is one that everyone should see. Relatively unsentimental and honest, this is on par with Oze's works. <br /> <br /> Scratch my title, this one is perfect!
