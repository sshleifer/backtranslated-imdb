Governments were elected for three years, as Reg Whithers said in 1973, the Liberals were determined to continue forcing the Workers into the polls until they were defeated. If you ask me, this is portrayed in the docudrama, but anyone who says that Kerr has acted properly in this, fails to recognize the self-serving and expensive strategy of the Liberal Party in Australia. On the series myself, although Max Phipps was a poor Whitlam, his voice was too ghostly. Also, several of the major political actors on both sides should have been used, although it may have been a reflection of budgetary constraints at that time. Nevertheless, I recommend it with caution.
