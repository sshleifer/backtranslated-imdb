A look at three geishas that are far beyond their prime. Now they look back on their past with love and regret their present. Kin (played by Floating Weeds' Haruko Sugimura) has sworn by men and made a good life as a moneylender; everyone on the block owes her. The other two, Nobu and Tamae, want them to land husbands, but are not bad enough to believe they will ever. Meanwhile, their children - one a son and one daughter - both get married (not to each other). Tamae is annoyed at how much more beautiful she has become than her, and bitterly tries to convince her not to marry the man. Nobu's concerns over her son are more legitimate in nature, but they are also (understandably) self-serving. After her son goes, she becomes alone. A little in the film, two of China's former customers are looking for her, a man so obsessed with her that he was trying to get her to commit double murder with him, the other of her most beautiful customers. Unfortunately, he comes for her money, not her love. The way I have described the film makes it feel unintentionally depressing, but it really is not. Sad, but not badly so. It's more bittersweet. Unfortunately, I only looked marginal late chrysanthemum. The story works better when I look back at it, but it is very slow and boring. I actually nodded twice during the movie, and I wasn't tired at all until I started it. This is the kind of movie I can appreciate more than that; It reminds me a lot about my reaction to a couple of Oz's more famous films. 10.7.
