Six-shooter, tunnel sergeant, Dr. Death, Pinhead, Cyclops and Blade help young Andre Toulon take out Sutek's Egyption henchman in the best sequel this series has seen. <br /> <br /> The retro doll star is atmospheric with many sets, quality plays and some fun puppet lyrics. What it lacks in gore is an interesting, successful plot. <br /> <br /> Best Quote: Dr. Death: "Don't you know my friends? Smell the sulfur, see smoke ..." <br /> <br /> This is easily the best Dave DeCoteau movie I've seen. The actors do a more than credible job: Jack Donner as "Azfel" gets inspired and the young Toulon does well with the puppets. Oh, and the ring needle is cool. John Massari's score is a delightful symphonic recording of the original doll star melodies by Richard Band, which keeps the movie playful and eerie. It is rare that a full moon score actually adds something to a movie and this one does. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Dave Allen didn't seem to be affordable enough for Band and Co. in the late 90s and beyond, so all the puppet action is made rod and string. There is no stopping movement like the famous and fun scene in the original, where Pinhead is looking for his pinhead. And of course, as with the entire Full Moon ticket price during this time, RPM was shot in and around Castel Studios in Bucharest, so most bit portions were thrown to the Romans: hearing their "Parisian" accents was a little annoying. All in all, this is probably one of the top 10 Full Moon movies. It is certainly the most inventive of the puppet master's successors.
