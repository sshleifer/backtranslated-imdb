This is one of Chaplin's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More sumptuous than the mutual films, it continues with Chaplin's attempt to complete his comic expression. Most people forget that the movie is actually a dream Charlie has while waiting to be sent to the front. There are lots of slapsticks via the glue burst cheese used to gass the enemy, and Chaplin is foray in the enemy area dressed as a tree. At this stage of this career, the great man had become so immersed in cinematic expression that his film gives the impression of making himself. It was undoubtedly not the case, but it still provides a convincingly realistic view of life on the front that I can remember, albeit from an ironic humorous perspective. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, knowing all of Chaplin's work should be a prerequisite for all cinephiles - don't delay!
