It sums it up ... corny. MacDowell's inability to act is sometimes painful, and Hurt must have the money to take such bad roles, but I still enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Why? In a single word, Travolta. He's amazing in this movie. Still, I can't give the movie a high score, but it certainly deserves better than it seems to be.
