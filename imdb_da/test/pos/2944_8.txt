This movie was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it's Canadian to start! It's a movie that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The location in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days, it's great to see that someone could come back to an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or obstacle - be it financial or disease - this movie hits a resounding chord! It approaches the idea of ​​the afterlife in a modern way - without cheap capitalization on all the "gohst" and supernatural themes that have become staples in Hollywood and the television network.
