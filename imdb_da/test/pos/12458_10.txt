Before reviewing this movie, I have to make a statement that is quite a bold statement to make as a film auditor. Anyone who has already read any of my previous reviews may know that I have always been controversial in low key fields and give high marks for flops such as "Captain America" ​​and 1985's "Creature" and panning of such movie classics as Alistar Sims "A Christmas Carol" and "Shakespeare in Love." With that in mind, this confession cannot come as a surprise: <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that Christopher Lambert is probably one of my favorite actors. Woah, now, don't start getting mad at me yet. Let me explain to myself: I do not think he is the greatest actor in the world. I clearly admit that he is not. He is certainly no Morgan Freeman or Anthony Hopkins, but I will say that his working ability is probably somewhere up there with at least Bruce Willis. However, what I admire about him is the human qualities that he brings into his hero of action. He is just an average guy laughing and crying and bleeding, who is a hero because he has to be, not necessarily because he wants to be. It takes a great deal for me to bring these qualities into character (especially in the films he has worked with), and Lambert's heroes are far from Schwartzennegger's or Stallone's. Frankly, Lambert's sign is easier for me to relate to. That's why he's not the greatest actor in the world .... He's just a personal favorite. <br /> <br /> However, I can't say the same for his movie. But much I appeal to his action, it would be foolish not to acknowledge that his choice of film leaves something to be desired. Most of them are quite frankly horrible, and any ridicule he has suffered over the years is not due to his actions, but to his poor choice in scripts. With that in mind, I can say that his debut film, "Tarzan", is one of his best films and probably his greatest achievement. As I mentioned, it is effective because of the human he brings to the role and for how seriously the director, writers and actors handle the material. This is a great leap from B-movie action adventure with the 1940s Johnny Weismeller. In fact, I would hesitate to call it an action movie. Instead, it is a serious drama that takes the whole of E.R. Burrough's material seriously and shows Tarzan's attempt to discover his real family in Scotland after realizing he doesn't fit in as a "white monkey." He is torn between his old family and his new one, which includes a wonderful Sir Ralph Richardson in his final role. In an attempt to adapt to humans, his monkey instincts also spring in and he cannot decide what he loves anymore: his real family or the one he is always known to. All in all, it is a wonderful commentary on society and a wonderful character study. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it launched Lambert in international stagnation, which continued in the 1980s with films like "Highlander" and "he Sicilian." Unfortunately, it didn't last. But just wait a moment ... His latest career movements like "Gideon" and "Resurrection" have proved that even though he still has a long way to go, he is a competent enough actor to make a ... ahem .... comeback if he just picks his roles better. <br /> <br /> Now, however, it's the verdict on its first movie: <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
