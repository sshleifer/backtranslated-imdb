I missed the start of the movie. I came in when the partisan was in the yard. I can truthfully say it was terrible. The moral branches are staggering. <br /> <br /> My fear of pain and torture does not allow me to see myself as wrong. I see Christ as the ability depicted by the brave patriot, and I can only pray that I could or would have the moral turpitude to follow his example. <br /> <br /> I see it as a main theme for the movie to show the weakness / strength of the torture, but what a stupid decision to face. Everything because the human soul can be distorted in such a way that pain and suffering are brought on fellow human beings is somehow satisfactory. It is mental or physical. <br /> <br /> I found the movie very thoughtful.
