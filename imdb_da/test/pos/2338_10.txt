I just watched the DVD of this award winning film. One Life Stand is a sharp drama that paints a very convincing and honest image through its pace, black and white shots and atmospheric music. It is a story of life's dilemma about power, gender and control highlighted by a few sad lonely lives. The mother (very well-liked by Maureen Carr) is upright and drawn to herself. The father only appears on the sidelines, and yet it is a strong and crucial part of the drama. Money is hidden in boxes and shoes. The writing was amazing, and I liked the sensual close-ups of details such as nails, red lips, a candle, mirrors, etc. The way the camera was used made it very intimate. It's a horrible tale with sexual undertones, while the Glasgow nozzle on the dark streets adds to the despair of the sad characters. <br /> <br /> There are some very memorable shots that are only carried by a trip or a fallen shoulder - as Trise goes under the bridge. And the anesthetized and evil looks at Tri's face in the call center, which hopes to help people use tarot cards as she listens to a caller on her own abuse. <br /> <br /> Initially, we see John Paul, tall and innocent, having pictures shot when he wants to try modeling. Trise, his mother, gets deceived and poor choices for him in a way that pushes him away while trying to keep him. John Paul's modeling turns into escort work, and Trise's boss offers his money, and eventually they go on a date. There are also moments of humor and subtle irony. An excellent scene is when they have a fairly normal meal and start to open a little when their dad comes with his dark presence and shoots everything over. But this and other things give moments of hope. I sometimes felt that the pacing of the movie was a shadow too intense, but it's a little detail in another cleverly challenging and memorable movie, and something a little different. It contrasts with most American films, which are either the total fantasy or the real 'world' as seen through seized glasses. This film depicts life with all its rough edges and displays unforgettable images. <br /> <br /> This is not 'light entertainment', but a thought-provoking and real drama. <br /> <br /> One Life Stand is a truly involved and emotionally honest movie.
