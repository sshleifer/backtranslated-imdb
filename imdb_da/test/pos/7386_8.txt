A few things to touch as a response to the previous person's comment. Just pay attention to what's going on in the movie. <br /> <br /> (I assume they are spoilers) <br /> <br /> The red stuff under David's mouth? Poison ivy, wife says not to scratch it otherwise "it will spread". David goes "crazy" because the stranger tells HIM to get out of the house, which probably proves David's theory of an affair between wife and stranger he runs after the man. <br /> <br /> David doesn't lose him in the woods, he just hits the stranger a couple of times and leaves it to his wife to collect the pieces. <br /> <br /> Only wife eats the sponge. <br /> <br /> I have to say, after one point with wife and stranger, I began to feel disappointed. But the end was for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And for that and the very first scene ... this is one of my favorite movies ever. I should have put it together earlier, but let myself be sidetracked. I was really surprised, honestly. <br /> <br /> This movie is interesting, to say the least. But if you don't see this for the performances that the actors give, I would say you better let this go, because that's all that holds this particular movie together.
