Tight, up-to-date political thriller that takes square aiming at the controversial US retaliation policy, another horrible Orwell inauguration (collateral, somebody?) To the illegal interrogation, even the torture of terrorist beneficiaries passing by legal process . The inhuman interrogation is monitored by the Egyptian police minister, even the goal of a fundamentalist suicide bombing, thereby concluding the two main plot lines of the film. Both work really well, the bombardment that is graphic and chilling in its realism, with its degradation revealed in a stylish Tarantino-type flashback, and the torture scenes of an innocent man also exhibited innocently in all their good details. The film musicians tell pointer about the use of torture as a credible means of intelligence - gathering in the war against terrorists and against the unpolished faceless bureaucracy (here personified by an appropriate cold steel Meryl Streep, which the CIA chief, who randomly gives the order to retaliate) who can destroy innocent lives. Never mind Kafka's fiction, think more about the latest killed by the innocent Brazilian in London in 2005, with the Metropolitan Police still in his job, and no one tried the murderous man's murder. The action is excellent all the way through - the two important roles of the innocent man and terrorist bombs are realistic and are told by the unknown actors Omar Metwally and Moa Khouas. Likewise, Yigal Naor as the scary police minister and Zineb Ouhach as his idealistic love daughter call true with their beliefs, their lack of knowledge (at least to me) adds to the credibility of their characters. Of the larger Hollywood names that are growing, Gyllenhaals stature grows with subsequent films, playing the originally detached but later conscience-hit and distressed governor who does the right thing in the end. Witherspoon plays his distraught wife part mainly in a key, but is credible the same, while David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin convincingly discover self-serving senators and their lies that will only go so far to help you until their career opportunities are threatened. There are a few weaknesses plot-wise; There is a little dramatic need to create the "excitement" of El-Ibrahimi's escape, and Streep's character may be too obvious a bogey man / woman. Worst of all is the meaningless involvement of Gyllenhaals on-the-spot girlfriend, just about decoration and a short, free love scene. On the other hand, however, it is an enchanting thought-provoking movie experience.
