I was stunned by this movie. I have rented Antonionis film / rediscover them, and this movie showed me climax and fruit from his 50 year director. What an eye for setting, color and detail! I have never seen such visual beauty and poetry filmed before. I had to stop after the first story and keep the tears back. Yes, beauty moves me, just as it moved Keats to write Ode on a Grecian Urn. This film is made for the mature, emotional and intellectual audience. They hope to see physical action and soap opera will be disappointed. I have to watch this movie several times before I really appreciate it and judge it. This movie must be required viewing for all filmmakers and directors. <br /> <br /> Possibly a great movie, according to the order of Kurosawa Dreams.
