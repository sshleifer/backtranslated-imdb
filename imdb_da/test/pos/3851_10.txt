Oh, my goodness!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's so incredible ...... I loved it as a young child and love it as an adult. It's my favorite Disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should see it, see it and love it. My friends and I see it a ton ..... It's soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child in the heart. My favorite part is the song and dance number with all strays and Thomas O'Malley. The writers / producers / directors followed this completely ..... yes, nailed it to the wall. <br /> <br /> xoxo ~ Wolly ~ xoxo
