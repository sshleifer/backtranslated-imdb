Let me clarify that. This is not a "good movie", but I'm so glad it's out there, I'm so happy I saw it, and for the role it plays in my DVD collection, it's sublime. It's the ultimate PG-13 romp, it's college when we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it might just as well happen on Mars. It's so healthy that even when trying to be dirty, it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable. Seeing it requires so little sophistication (actually thinking too hard about what is going to get in the way of your appreciation for this work), it makes me feel like I'm 12 again. And that kind of experience is more than $ 9.99.
