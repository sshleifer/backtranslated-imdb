I'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (I'm not counting super bug budget, no story Batman is either) <br /> <br /> A few of my favorites are The Phantom and a budget movie called The Demolitionist. The black scorpion can be added to that collection. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the Demolitionist, get this movie. It is basically a copy of the heroine. (That is even true with the same guy in both films) <br /> <br /> If you don't, let me explain ... a policeman is being murdered and she's seeking revenge. She winds up in the black clothes (a sexy kitten-like, skimpy outfit that looks amazing on Joan Severance) and goes out to kick some treasure. <br /> <br /> It's a fun, action-packed movie, imagine, don't want the kids to watch it ... without first screening it to see if you approve of the beautiful graphic sex scene Severance has in it . Which, in my opinion, was a bonus (okay, give it an extra star <grin>)
