As if reality is shown as "American idol," it was not enough where judges such as Simon Cowell shoot sharp sharp barbs for contestants trying to make their mark on the music world - barbs that many times have even reduced excellent singers to tears After what was considered a "poor performance" has now "America's Next Top Model" over the past three years invaded the bobbin with its own version of "looking for the next big thing" in a company that appreciates superficiality, beauty concepts, and body dysmorphia. <br /> <br /> A concept created by Tyra Banks, who is also the judge of the show, gathers it around fifteen participants from all walks of life and has them persuading them to countless "tasks" in which to prove their "talent "In front of the camera and not only submitting to the now written Janice Dickinson (self-baptized" American's first supermodel "), but the just as cuddly Jay Manuel and Nore Marin, who may at one point focus on a girl who doesn't perform well and blithely ride her to tear as if it were bad morning coffee. As in many other reality-based shows, each evening is tuned and they have to pack their bags and leave immediately (one thing they are reminded of by Tyra at every turn). Of course, there is an exciting excitement between several of the more type A women, female bonding, tears, dramatic swells of music at key moments and some truly breathtaking images that transform formerly ordinary beautiful girls into unattainable goddesses. <Br /> <br /> I must admit, the show is a guilty pleasure. Maybe it's the state of mind I'm in, but I wondered where the vomitory was in cases where the already thin girls had to throw to make the cut and see the way judges and photographers and many bad designers would feel were right at the moment. Still, it is drawn to me despite my previous section, possibly because I have always been interested in the fashion world and have always loved to see amazing women being made even more unusual with makeup and perfect lighting. But I wonder where they go with these increasingly difficult photo shoots. It's as if they were competing with the "Fear Factor". Shots that resemble resumes of battle scenes in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, shots where the models are to be placed under the water or in almost impossible situations. What's next: posing while tied to training tracks like a welcoming Amtrak roar on them at 70 miles an hour? Or a shooting, where they are underwater, chained, trying to set themselves free in record time and at the same time looking in the chiffon and never ever forget to smile their bulb whites on the camera? What about a "Pit and the Pendulum" version of a photography? <br /> <br /> In one thing, the show should be given some kudos, and it is somehow similar to "American Idol". With this, I would probably justify the hardest of both shows and its weary judges - and essentially go against my introductory section. "America's Next Top Model" is a show that is an expanded audition, like "American Idol", and in it the girls will get the kind of test treatment they will receive in the real world, where potential designers and photographers as monstrously weak as those may be, will crush them to pieces by the drop of a hat, if they cannot sell as they are expected, and where one is asked to leave, another will supplant her with the necessary requirements. It makes it strange that any girl will get into such a difficult medium, but that is what dreams of. <br /> <br /> Entering its fifth season, it has been a major disappointment with the end of Janice Dickinson; During her race she was a pretty hard barometer of how the girls should go, talk, emote, express themselves and eventually present themselves as a living, living product that sells. With the cold addition of Twiggy, I wonder where it will go from here - Twiggy just can't replace Dickinson's over-the-top temperament. So with Janice's absence, the show has lost some of its edge and may even have signaled its slow transition, but in the meantime it is still a joyous pleasure to see, mindless entertainment on weekends, if at all for the beautiful pictures. If at all, the show launched Adrienne Curry in the spotlight. Curry has made a name for herself because of facts that have less to do with modeling as much as her theatric love affair with the once child actor Christopher Knight in their very own reality soap opera.
