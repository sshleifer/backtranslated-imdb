I can't believe how perfect this movie is. Great CG graphics, good story and fighting, oh the matches !!! This movie was amazing !! The grades. They look real enough to be considered genuine. They certainly resemble those from the game perfectly. The scene where .... well all the scenes made my jaw drop. Fantastic 10/10 graphics The story. Perfectly explained. Plus, how Aeris will help Cloud at many different times in the movie. They explain it very well and make your jaw drop from how perfect it is. But the repeated battles take a little history, but that's just a minor thing. History 9.5 / 10 Everything else, great. The movie was just amazing. I really don't know what more I can say except that this movie was pretty much perfect. I LOVED IT !!!
