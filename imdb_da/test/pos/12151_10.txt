If you get the easy pleasure out of pink Floyd's music, you will love this movie. The score is completely pink Floyd and of course the fabric element plays a big role in this movie and gives you doubts about life within the weakest moments. This movie also touches the heart with the story of love and the people around you ... there is also a huge connection with the world around you with the environment of a personal island. This thing tells me I need ten lines to summarize a movie, but I'm done, that's all you get, so this movie is a 6.1 that is greatly disturbed by any movie with a score like this. take a look at the requiem for a dream and fountain .... just as good results for our generation but overstated
