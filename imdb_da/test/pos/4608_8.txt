Universal Studios. The name evokes so many memories to scary fans of beautiful food paintings ... there ... landscapes, land-covered landscapes, full moon, howling wolves, tavernas and flashlights. But it is quite strange to look back on these movies, how little the era that produced the true classics lasted. The '30s had masterpieces, but they were mostly from the same directors, and many of their films are mostly of historical interest today. The '40s produced more fun funny matinee movies than it did high art, and most fans agree that the classic era of Gothic horror films ended in 1945 with' House of Dracula ', along with Abbott & Costello The comedies were officially dead in the 50s and in the Atomic Age. <br /> <br /> It is strange that perhaps one of the universe's finest Gothics was made in the 50s! That alone makes the movie a weird one, as costume dramas were coming out everywhere. It can't be compared to classics like James Whale movie and 'The Wolfman', but damn condenses all the fun elements of these movies into a delicious treat! Get ready for nothing but pure entertainment! Since various social mores had been changed, the film also welcomed violence that would not have been allowed in earlier eras; there is no blood, but we see signs shot and shattered directly, and there is even a burning torch in the face! <br /> <br /> The movie may not be a horror movie, but it certainly has the atmosphere, look and feel of one! It begins in the night's death with howling winds (and wolves) that two men seal the tombs of two apparently dead young lovers, but wait! One of them is not dead, but he cannot move! He is trapped, but speaks quietly in his own mind, unable to communicate! What is his story? Now it's how you start a horror movie ... The English businessman Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene, who gives one of his best performances) describes under Richard Beckett's alias investigating the disappearance of two friends of his who disappeared at the castle of the Austrian Count Von Bruno (see Sacha Baron Cohen see this?). It seems many years ago that Von Bruno constituted a god for the natives of Africa to steal ivory, he was exposed to Burton's men, and the natives confused him. Now he's wondering about revenge. <br /> <br /> The movie has all the clichés, a Jonathan Harker-style tour of the castle, an inn full of cautious villagers, death traps and a caving servant (Lon Chaney Jr.). The torture chamber scenes are really exciting, including a panel in the floor that activates a dungeon door (allowing a brilliant holiday scene later), a hunting expedition involving an imported panther (!!! ??) and even an alligator pit! And then there is the fake death in Romeo & Juliet style leading to the movie's prologue .... <br /> <br /> The plot is cliché and the world image is black and white. But it is still incredibly entertaining, with director Nathan Juran making each scene pile on the atmosphere and seems fresh and new. There are also several plot holes. Why is Ronald trying to leave the castle so early? And he never solves the mystery of what happened to his friends, even though it's obvious, but he doesn't know when he gives up, and he seemed so safe earlier. Nice. <br /> <br /> All the players are good. Despite being a rude opclassman, Richard Greene makes Burton one of the most sympathetic protagonists I've ever seen in a horror movie. Rita Corday is excellent as the Count's 'farmer's wife', who becomes Burton's love interest, she can get the stereotype 'in love with a look' problem of any movie hero here in this era, but her portrayal of a long-suffering woman in a lawless marriage with a sadistic monster is very convincing, she also shows suspicion, and there are few movie hordes in this age, and Burton even sees a forced attempt to put her (and paw on her necklace, even if it is just analyzing what it has important clue) as a rape race, but she never seems ugly in her paranoia, the audience sympathizes with her. Although he can't make Von Bruno seem foreign and World War II (he is a villain in a horror movie), Stephen McNally gives a truly chilling performance as the sadistic nobleman. When he reveals his burned eye and laughs maniacally, it's really scary. Lon Chaney Jr. is also amazing as his dumb henchman Gargon. <br /> <br /> But the best performance is undeniable by Boris Karloff as the mysterious doctor Dr. Meissen. He first has a small screen time, but steals every scene he's in. It's a show that is both creepy, sad, mysterious and ultimately heroic. As he teaches evilly as he uses leeches to one of Bruno's artisans, spies on our hero and speaks in the famous 'You Know I Don't Feel Good' only Karloff could do, you ask yourself if he is a hero or villain, always shrugging. And even though he acts as the principal agent of our hero's escape, he still shows human frailty as greed and fear of his own life, even the cold of a human being for Burton's advantage before he himself gets Burton to agree. His plan to help our hero and heroine escape also puts them directly in Von Bruno's clutches as he arranges an incredibly sadistic (if incredibly flawless) death for those who may have inspired similar scenes in Corman's Poe series. He may not have much screen time, but it is easily one of Boris's best performances. <br /> <br /> While the end may seem sudden and antique-climatic to some, half of the fun is there and there's a lot of excitement. to be had. Kick back and relive the days when heroes were heroes and villains were villains. It's not a masterpiece, but it's escapist fun at it's best.
