I watched my videotape last night, for the first time in at least ten years. I found the work itself and the performances just as poignant as they were in my memory. George Hearn was, of course, the champion of Sweeney's role; there is never a touch of softness in his will to avenge revenge on those whom he believes caused his wife's death and his daughter's disappearance; at least not to the end when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has caused him to murder his wife. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex depiction, like Mrs Lovett. She understood that Sondheim wanted the role to be something of a "comic" counterpart to Sweeney; and even some tenderness brings in her courtesy of Sweeney and her nourishment of the boy Tobias. For those with long memories, this performance goes back to its debut performances in The Picture of Dorian Gray and Gaslight; long before murder, she wrote. A year ago I saw the music at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. with the current opera superstar Brynn Terfel as Sweeney. Others have commented on the operational quality of the score. My conclusion is that "Sweeney" works better with actors who can at least handle the vocal lines than with operaticists who have limited action skills. As a final note, I am looking forward to the performing artist who portrayed Tobias. with his mixed loyalty and confusion about what is going on around him. It seemed appropriate that he almost had the last word.
