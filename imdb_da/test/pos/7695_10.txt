I was @ 13 years old when I saw this very underappreciated movie at The ADAMS Theater in Newark, NJ, I bought the program and later bought the soundtrack ... still have both .... I am now 55+ years. . and haven't seen it since (maybe even on television networks in the 1960s)? One of the greatest casts ever gathered, great score and production, let another generation see this amazing movie ... It was my introduction to opera and helped with my understanding of tolerance. Please family of Gerswhins or Premingers, drop this classic soon !!
