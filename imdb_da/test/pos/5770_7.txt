If people were really so stupid, I could be the top leader of the world. In this one, Knotts plays a dimwitted bench for a small little town run by a group of crooked simpletons, slightly lighter than he is. When things seem a little shaken to the bad guys, they go to a frame of patsy Figg. Lots of laughs as Knotts does its usual bumbling, stumbling action. I especially appreciated the extension cable scene; asininity at the highest level.
