There was something about the original three films that made them so special and lovely - probably the length of them. Unfortunately this lacks the charm, but it still ends up being a fun movie. <br /> <br /> The bright and glittering side is that our favorite plastic figures still do a crushing good job. Good plasticized animation has been used. There is a stupid but well-structured and entertaining plot, an exciting, fun adventure, a good plot idea (a war-rabbit and a giant vedgetable competition) and great new characters! <br /> <br /> In addition to the original charm, the only other gloomy side of the movie is the humor, though good, is slightly exaggerated, especially in relation to the original films. The popular Giant Vedgetable Competition is approaching, and Wallace and Gromit help control rabbits from eating any vedgetables, now they are Anti Pesto. They do a good job, but soon there is danger in danger. A war-rabbit is nearby ... Recommended for all Wallace and Gromit fans and for people who like plastic films, enjoy "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Wererabbit"! :-)
