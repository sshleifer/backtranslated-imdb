Eric Bogosian's ability to scroll from character to character in this one-man show exhibits his true reach as a character actor. Every person has their own message to convey the truth, society, class, drugs, etc. This is an absolute must for anyone who is a serious fan of acting! His performance includes some of the most Hilarious and Real moments I have ever experienced as an audience.
