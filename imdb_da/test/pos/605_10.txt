In many ways, the perfect movie. "Incredible Journey" and Horatio Alger story come together for a positive spin on the normally depressing subject of existentialism. In essence, the busier of the muppets cuddle down to the movie's final song: "Life is like a movie, write your own end, continue to believe, continue to pretend." They create their own reality, which has all the steps of every epic tale: a high end at the end of what is necessarily a hindrance journey; an ever-increasing group of like-minded individuals for companionship; a creepy set of villians that are not over all redemptions; And a big budget Hollywood ends because it does everything they can. <br /> <br /> Only Jim Henson could pull this out. He goes the line between sentimentality and philosophy without swinging too long or too hard into either. Of course, it seems odd to invest such weight in a movie starring doll, but in the end they are perhaps the perfect doll to make these points. The movie's atmosphere allows for the pure enjoyment of the Hollywood dream, the "happy" end, unnecessary cameos and bursts into the song of the hat of a hat. Usually, these aspects are anathema for quality in film, but the self-defeating way in which the story is delivered allows for guilt-free viewing. One of the few movies that can really be called "suitable for all ages." <br /> <br /> The other muppet-related movies (including "The Empire Strikes Back") while sweet, don't touch the simple grace of this movie. Take e.g. The song "Hope there is something better," duet Kermit and Rowlf. Entertaining in his vaudevillian goofiness, yet makes another bitingly crucial point about the motivation behind life's choices. Brilliant.
