This zany movie rivals Ghost and Mr. Chicken as one of Don Knot's finest movie performances. Knotts is the auditor of a Podunk town hall that is good for swimming the citizens. They fire the "three competent bookkeepers and keep it stupid" (Knotts is of course the stupid). When his cohort waste collection unintentionally empties the wrong trash, Knotts finds himself in a bizarre trap set by the city council for him. Quiet moments in the movie include the Bowling Alley Restroom scene, and the cemetery scene is absolutely fun. Typical knots, the nervous ninny action are well-used, and as usual he is surrounded by lots of crazy character actors from the sixties. Such actors as Frank Welker and Pitt Herbert add to the chaos. As you can expect Knotts armed with a big car, a beautiful girl and no real clue about what he is doing. Fun for everyone, especially nostalgia buffs, but almost everyone will love it.
