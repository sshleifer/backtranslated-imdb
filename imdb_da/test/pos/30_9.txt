'The Dresser' is one of those films that is so perfect that you really struggle to find something that doesn't like them. Written by Ronald Harwood (even a former dresser for the legendary Donald Wolfit), it sparkles with energy and true love for the life behind the headlights. As 'Sir', the indulgent actor and main focus of play, Albert Finney is a joy to watch - to complain about the lack of storm during "blowing, winning ..." bits of 'King Lear' or chatting with his faithful stage leader , Madge (Eileen Atkins, good as always) about the ancient times. As Norman, Tom Courtenay, he gives a fabulous performance, angling around the pitch and call of the lear, collecting a bottle to go to the pub or bitchily disparaging the former stupid, Mr. Davenport-Scott (often mentioned, but never seen! ). In an engaging supportcast, there is Edward Fox as Oxenby (a typically arrogant second leader), Zena Walker as her Ladyship, Lockwood West as a replacement, and many others. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of energy that causes some of the greasepain in its scene, it's true, but it's true you didn't feel it. Very well done indeed.
