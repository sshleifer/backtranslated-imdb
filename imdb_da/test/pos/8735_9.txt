Everyone told me to see "Cactus Flower" and I finally did. What a wonderful movie - the perfect pick-up for a Sunday night / terrible Monday morning. Matthau and Hawn were good, but Ingrid Bergman really made this movie - it was after all about her. The truly amazing actors can do everything and Miss Bergman proves it. She shows us - during a movie - a few people in their careers. The scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it touched. Even when the film made its obvious conclusion, I found myself cheering for Miss Dickinson as if she were the Boston Red Sox. Fortunately, she made out (no pun intended) much better. ;)
