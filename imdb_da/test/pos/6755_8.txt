One of Starewicz's longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog ​​in search of an orange after being animated by the tear mother of a girl who yearns for an orange. The dog comes on an orange after falling out of a car on the way to being sold, but at night you have to protect the orange as he enters a devil's nightclub with many bizarre and scary characters. Using a stuffed cat, the dog gets orange back to the little girl, and she is rescued from a horrible scurvy death. The mascot has new techniques I haven't seen in Starewicz's movies yet. The addition of sync sound and a mix of live action with the stop-motion animation gives a new twist to Starewicz's old style of doll. Live scenes of moving cars and people's feet pass by as a doll sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh. It is noteworthy that cars are being sold and cried by street vendors because of the fact that small studio shifts to sound were expensive, and Starewicz's exploitation of the new technology seems to be old-fashioned. New dolls in this movie are scary contributions to the devil's club scene. Twigss and newspaper strips come to life. Skeletons of dead birds lay eggs that close skeletal chickens. Signs come in from everywhere on the flaps and pans and rocking horses. A new editing technique uses fast zooms that are achieved through editing to accelerate the pace of what could previously have been a slow stage. All in all, Starewicz is able to update its style of film making to meet the demands of a new audience that makes this movie one of the best examples of his work.
