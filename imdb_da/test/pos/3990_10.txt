First, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan I have to say I expected more comical situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His depiction of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly executed and unambiguous to him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was excellent in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on the spot, he has turned the world upside down. He never expected him to accidentally find the one person who could change his life. Sammy and Max's journey are unique and move, and even humorous at times. Plus, the location in the Czech Republic, where parts of the movie were shot, was absolutely beautiful. I must say, this dramatic comedy made me feel a number of emotions. I thought it was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
