I liked this movie. I saw it as a packed house at the Toronto International Film Festival the day after the gala opener, which must have gone well. The director, Gavin Hood was supposed to be present for the day's screening, but unfortunately his twins were born just hours before so he had to fly back on a flight. "2 births for 24 hours" was how he talked about it. <br /> <br /> Submission refers to "extraordinary transfer" - a term whereby suspect terrorists in the United States can be sent without legal consent from their parent nations, to prisons abroad to be questioned and detained. It's a pretty predictable - innocent Egyptian-American man who is mistakenly accused of being a terrorist 'goes away' while on his way from South Africa to Washington DC. He is sent abroad while wife at home (Reese Witherspoon) is struggling to find him and free him. But what makes this movie special is some good choices in storytelling: 1) a human-touch story of what is happening in the local area where a suicide bomb detonated; 2) The CIA agent's humanity is trying to understand and be honest with what is really going on; and 3) the storytelling chronology, which makes it a tight, tight story that moves and moves the right moments. Ah - relief! And a mix of emotions that work around as history struggles for an end. <br /> <br /> Allround strong deals with Meryl Streep as a standout vixen.
