I love everything about family guy. My favorite people in the family are Brian and Stewie, and I like the episodes when they mainly contain them as "Road to Rhode Island" (Season 2), as they interact very well. The comments they make just have me in stitches. Peter's behavior is also very fun, as some of the things he does "are just as brilliant they are retarded." The voice action is excellent, especially Seth MacFarlane, as he gives the votes for half the Griffin family as well as their perverted neighbor Glenn Quagmire and how he manages that range (especially with song). I just don't know. He deserves his two Emmies to give voice to the evil baby genius Stewie. Adam West also steals the show with his fun and utterly insane, ordinary character mayor of Quahog. What I like about Chris (pronounced by Seth Green) are the things he says he is following his father when it comes to intelligence and common sense. The only thing I found annoying is that UK Fox has decided to change the seasons to increase DVD sales, which in no way reflects the program itself, but rather marketing. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Family Guy, I would thoroughly recommend Seth MacFarlane's second project American Dad, who uses a different humorous style but still very hilarious.
