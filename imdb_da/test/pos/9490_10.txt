just another show of led Zeppelin at their finest and their absolute rocking best. every band member is on their best jimmy side and his bow and guitar JPJ with his thundering bass bozo pounding away and Robert sings like theirs not tomorrow. I have to say when we get into the first song where we are going to track is the beginning of something special. this DVD follows zeppelin through their 11 year Carree starting in 69 at the Royal Albert Hall then Madison Square Garden 73 followed by a much older and mature band in 75 at Earl's Court and finally another looking band at their last English show at Knebworth in 79. This DVD is amazing showcase of zeppelin and if you are not a fan, you will be after. N
