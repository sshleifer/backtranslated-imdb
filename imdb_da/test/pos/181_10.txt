While Boris (Aleksey Batalov) is fighting for war against the Germans for his mother Russia, his beloved Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) marries his insidious cousin Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin) in a moment of weakness shortly after her parents were killed in an air raid over Moscow. Through various trials and betrayals, Veronika will wait for words or letters from Boris, no matter how long it takes, and hope he returns to her. Powerful piece of filmmaking boasts incredible photographic work by cinematographer Sergei Urusevsky. Some of the many splendid framed movements include the stage where the camera follows Veronika through a crowd of loved ones who say goodbye to each other as she hurries through the mob of bodies to say goodbye to Boris .. and does not quite reach him even as we see Boris looking impatiently in the swarm without success. The sequence of air strikes, where Veronika climbs up the standing stairs circulating in the ruined building, she once called home and the scene where Mark makes his merry move on Veronika as another air strike continues right outside the building as the wind rustles The curtains and flashes of light emanating inside are just two of many examples where Sergei Urusevsky shows his genius by framing pictures that will last forever on film. But without the power of history and the tragedy of how war can forever shape the fate of a couple who deeply love each other, this movie cannot stop with the visual beauty alone. Together, however, we are back with a great movie. Just a haunting masterpiece from the Soviet Union, after Stalin breathed his last breath. I feel honored, just watched such a big movie.
