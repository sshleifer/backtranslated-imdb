Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is nothing but shooting and fighting! For those people who say they don't make shoot em ups they use. Well, this is really the hardcore! David Bradley is really good and his character takes a pounding in the movie. He gets hit by the stick over a dozen times, gets stuck in his back and is in a coma for three days and then wakes up and struggles again, gets up, recovers and ready for more action! His character is incredibly tough! Charles Napier was also very good and he probably steals the show! The protection Wells was good! Professor Toru Tanaka had a card and an unredited role in Hard Justice! With regard to the action, it is really great with all the gunfights and the huge stop as a scene in the beginning has cars blown up and turned up in the middle of the air! There is so much going on in 95 minutes. For action fans you will be blown away by all the fire and fighting that this movie has to offer! Hard Justice is a movie that is not easy to find and if you are in a video store and you see it for sale, buy it because this movie is great goalkeeper and d and the box is cool! There are a multitude of actions to be seen to be believed! See and see if you can find some great deals on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com's Z-Shops and Market Place Sellers! I strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves to shoot ems and giant movies and has been disappointed with other movies that look like a true non-stop action flick but fail to deliver it to get Hard Justice!
