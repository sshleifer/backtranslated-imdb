Loved shots from airports - Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the trimmers and the well-dressed passengers. Fast forward 75 years .... But what really was for me was the hammer and seal emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram next to the logo, rearward of the pilot seat on the starboard side of the hull. Remember when the joint acquaintance Neil and Jill meet, says Jim became general in a Chinese rebel army? That based on the hammer and the seal could only have been People's Revolutionary Army in Mao Tse Dung !!! Never think of the undies and the unwrapped twosome in bed - would that logo and reference have survived during the Cold War? <br /> <br /> Additional Observation 12/27: This movie of the 30s with the Soviet emblem can / must also reflect the influence and charm of communism in Hollywood and much of America during depression. Adds the historical value of this amazing movie. <br /> <br /> I also liked the American dreams aspects of two guys from Winnemucca taking at least part of the world by storm, red-blooded (literally and basically in the case of US) American boys. <br /> <br /> Others have commented more ably than me on aerobatics, etc. I loved it all. <br /> <br /> This gem deserved more than just 1.5 stars Osborne and Co. rated it on TCM if it was only for recording parts of American history in the early 30s.
