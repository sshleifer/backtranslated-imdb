I finally found a version of persuasion that I like! Anne does not look like a scullery girl in this version, just a very thin, aging, beautiful woman, as she is described in the book. Captain Wentworth doesn't look like he's 50, and he doesn't always look angry, but rather, as he described in the book, he hasn't lived as much as Anne and is pretty beautiful. And they play their parts with such conviction and realism ... the act that is about. They were trustworthy. They created real characters, and that was how the characters in the book came to life. If you haven't seen this version, I encourage you to find it, order it, or request it from either a bookstore or a library if you need to. It is well worth the price and the wait. <br /> <br /> I saw the 1995 version and the 2007 version, and this tower over the other two. Why it is not classified higher is beyond my understanding. The book conveys their tenderness, and this film makes the book life.
