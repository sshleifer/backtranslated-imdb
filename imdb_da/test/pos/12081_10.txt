I watched this movie when it was broadcast on television in February 1983. I was in the hospital when I had just given birth to my first and only child. I will refrain from telling you to what extent I was moved. Suffice it to say that the reminder of the movie has remained with me this day, almost 23 years later. I hope I can find a copy of this movie if such a thing was ever done. This movie should be remembered pleasantly by anyone who has ever seen it. However, I must admit that the fact that it remains somewhat unclear is just fine for me. In this way, it will always be a little secret for me and those who were also moved by it. I've never seen Ms Margaret do a better part. Nor have I seen her in a more convincing role. I will always respect her just to accept such a lovely part.
