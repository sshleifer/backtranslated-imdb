So often, these "Lifetime" flicker are one-dimensional, with overall characterizations and notions, and with preferred plot lines and climaxes intended to trade any kind of drama reality. <br /> <br /> But most of all, many of these flicks give marks where it is difficult to feel a trace of sympathy or empathy for even the "good guy / good mad" characters, far less the "bad". <br /> <br /> But, here the performance was good, the characters realistic, and the relationship between the three leaders (as well as the previous man / father and the two women) lay right throughout. <br /> <br /> The mother's boyfriend was portrayed as about halfway between the mother and daughter, and the actors were aged according to their actual age. None of the characters were portrayed in an extremity - either good or evil - and everything went right. <br /> <br /> Without any charge his allow the relationship with his potential death daughter to advance to the level it did - you can still feel sympathy for him without withdrawing the blame. Neither the mother nor the daughter were perfect, neither good nor bad, but simply two people whose relationship seemed realistic and not distinct from the manuscript writer. <br /> <br /> Lifetime flicks - even those beginning with some fate of normality - often end up with a horrible character that burns a carving knife or the like. Other stories seem to have to give "all people happily ever" close. <br /> <br /> This movie presented a realistic premise, story and resolution from start to finish - a welcome variation to the norm of this genre /
