This movie is a very downward remake of the famous Fritz Lang's masterpiece "M-Murder". It is well made and with an entertaining key to talk about rather serious events and modern problems in the Eurobe, but not just the whole world. Ethnic intolerance is such a huge evil and much contagion today. So "children of wax" or as it is known in American distribution reveals the issue of German and Turkish hat in a fun way. No doubt it is much appreciated to be taken in favor of the great Weinsten brothers. And there is another fact I most like is the participation in this movie by Lars von Trier's favorite actor, the great Udo Kier, who shows playing with such a pleasure for the Bulgarian film director Ivan Nichev.
