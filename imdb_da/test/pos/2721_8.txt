After wife and Mr Iyer, this is yet another very good movie of the Aparna sen (mostly in English). In the previous film, she dealt with a contemporary political environment and its influence on individuals. In this movie, it is the effect of mentally handicapped family members and its impact on the family. As a parallel theme, she deals with a philosophical concept of "reality". It's a movie that leads to thinking about watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Mithee's younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) suffers from schizophrenia, which is taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi). Mithee after her marriage to Jojo and separation from him believes that she is still with JOJO and her five children in 15 Park Avenue in Kolkotta. (There is no such address in Kolkotta - it seems that there is one in New York) and she is intense in her faith. It's almost like an intense religious belief. In the end what is reality? In a scene she tells Anjali "if I tell you that you are not a professor, but just imagine you are a professor". The open end reflects this reality. In a presumably search for her home in the park road, Mithee is lost. The penultimate scene is Mithee, who looks at a group of five children playing, and she looks at them with pleasure to return to her family, and then she is lost. About this concept of reality I am reminded of another movie with the fifties called HARRY with James Stewart. The protagonist thinks that a large-sized rabbit (?), Called Harry, is always with him, and he always talks to him. Eventually, the doctor might think there's Harry. What is reality is what the main character thinks or what others think Shabhna Azmi dominates the movie with its sterile performance as the strong older sister with the undercurrent of frustration. Konkana Sen Sharma gives equally good performance as the schizophrenic. <br /> <br /> But the movie is not as tight as wife and Mr. Iyer. There seem to be some loose ends. And maybe there are too many signs. Those who want a closed end should not appreciate the open end here. But the end fits the movie's theme. <br /> <br /> Another good movie by Aparana sen.
