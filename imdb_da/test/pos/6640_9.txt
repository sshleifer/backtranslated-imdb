This is one of the gloomiest, the most offensive of Bergman's films I've seen. I also think this is one of the most powerful films about war cruelty and what it does for the human souls. <br /> <br /> The couple of musicians who left a big city for a remote island and made a living as farmers find themselves capable of indelible and shameful acts that would normally have been impossible for themselves to imagine when they struggle to survive the terrible reality of the war. They betray their souls, their friends, and even each other in a desperate attempt to simply survive another day. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow are brilliant as usual as lost, confused and frightened couples who were caught in the midst of a civil war. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
