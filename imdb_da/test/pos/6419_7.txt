Footprints are a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to categorize. "Psychological thriller" is the most appropriate description I can think of. The female protagonist, Alice Cespi, discovers that she can't remember any of the last three days. The only clue she has is a torn image of a hotel. She is also haunted by a recurring, very vivid dream of a science fiction movie that she believes she has many years ago. In her pursuit of the truth behind her amnesia she does not trust anyone, but gradually it becomes obvious that she has visited the city where the hotel is before. This is an exciting flick whose main virtue is that it is almost impossible to predict how events will unfold, and especially how it will end. The unusual loneliness of the main character and the inaccuracy of all others ensure that the good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film, while beautiful colors and some spectacularly recorded sequences also make this a visually attractive film. The important part of one and the only Nicoletta Elmi, everyone's favorite favorite red-haired outrageous child star in Italian horror, is an added bonus.
