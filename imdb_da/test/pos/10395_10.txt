I was stunned by this movie. Subsequently, I would not even see any movies - any other movie would be so unsatisfactory by comparison. For many, it can be the worst Antonion-very slow without an engaging conventional line of history, microscopic studies of human emotions and interactions - and the worst of Wenders-verbose, confused transcendentalism. It is composed of short different episodes associated with Wender's typical meandering hero's stream of consciousness, so it does not create the temporary oblivion of the escapist cinema. <br /> <br /> But for fans, the worst thing is the best and the inconsistent story line outlines a single poetic image that spans the movie. Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seek out the heart of things. <br /> <br />
