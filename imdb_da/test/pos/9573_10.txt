Works as a kind of centerpiece between "Waiting for Guffman" and "A Mighty Wind", "Best in Show" showing a dog show and the various people who bring their dog friends to participate. Some are weird, some crazy and otherwise, but they do all the movie well. Director Christopher Guest is especially fun as a homosexual Harlan Pepper, who is very much trying to promote his dog. Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara and Bob Balaban are also doing great jobs (I can't imagine they are not doing good jobs, at least not in a Christopher Guest movie). As one who has never participated in a dog show, this film is my greatest exposure to them. They certainly look good.
