This movie was a new direction for Natalie Portman. A much more adult role, although she comes to it from traces of a child in the film itself. Ann, (Portman) and Susan Sarandon, who play her new mother Adele, travel from a small town in the middle of heaven to Beverly Hills. There, these tortured souls try to express themselves with their new life, and their new relationships as the character of Portman grow. Unknowingly, Adele grows up and becomes a better mother of it. Ann sees her mother telling her she wants to be an actress, or she thinks. Adele uses that crutch every time there are problems in their lives. We see their struggle as mother and daughter expressed between each other and with being alone, having left their old lives. <br /> <br /> The action is top notch from both. They seem to be mother and daughter to your eyes. You can almost feel there is a ribbon out there besides the actual movie. Although this movie really does not take us to any new reason in these types of movies, the fact that the play is well done and the story is not too bad, let us recommend it. <br /> <br /> However, I would say it will probably go away soon, I don't think it can have the resilience needed for a big Christmas season of movies starting in a week or so. See it now before this happens if you like one of these actresses.
