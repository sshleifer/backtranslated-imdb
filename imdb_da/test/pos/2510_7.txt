Though it is certainly an enjoyable way to spend a few hours and it is always worth seeing, this movie never fully meets the goals it should for two reasons. First, after the first 45 minutes or so, it focuses heavily on Helen and Johnny, who are far less interesting signs than most others. Janet, Jennifer, George and Miss Scattergoods are much more tempting. Although it does work at first, as we in life do not always know everything about everyone else, and because it is supposed that Helen might be a little self-indulgence, it quickly gets thin and we will see more of the other characters. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film seems to lose weight in the second half. The letter itself has far less significance than it does in the first half, and again, although it works well in some ways, it seems odd to leave as much of the potential shown in the first half behind. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is sweet and good-natured, with some really hilarious moments - for example, Janet explains spices to an avid audience. The lazy but quiet desperate atmosphere that Helen feels is heavy, and the feeling of living in a small seaside resort is accurately depicted, but the movie is not as intelligent as it is trying to be. It just lacks to be a light romantic comedy and be a smart portrait of life. However, it is still good, and if you get the chance, it is definitely worth seeing.
