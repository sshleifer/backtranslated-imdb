IMDb forces reviewers to write a certain amount of lines, but all I really want to say is - "This is an incredible movie, and you can't see yourself as a movie fan without seeing it." You should just trust me on this one and stop reading this review and get the movie and push games. But I have to write something. So let me point out the following: <br /> <br /> (1) River's Edge contains what can still be like Crispin Glover's all-time fun and best performance in a movie, and if you've followed Crispin Glover at all, you know that alone justifies giving it a 10. Quiet lines to a large extent. (2) River's Edge features the second-highest performance of Dennis Hopper's career (except for the Blue Velvet), and it is truly outstanding. Dennis Hopper is really fun. <br /> <br /> (3) River's Edge offers the best performance of Keanu Reeves career and is excellent. It was the role he was born to play. He has lots of good lines, but one is really really fun. Listen closely when his character and step-father talk to each other. <br /> <br /> Still the best Stoner movie, it's much more than just that. It tends to appear in the drama sections of movie rental stores, but if this is a drama, it's the funniest drama all the time.
