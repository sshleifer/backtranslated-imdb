Sit back and let director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual journey of India's mind and spirit. When was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that can only exist in India. If you don't want to visit India before this movie will definitely make you visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase scene and the mafioso involved. But it has much more. Thank you, Bharatbala, for taking such an exciting and wonderful story. I loved the end. We women do not want illusions in life, we want reality. P. S. I was Carolyn's friend at the Sonoma Film Festival and met you briefly. Good luck with your distribution efforts, and I speak up in the movie a storm.
