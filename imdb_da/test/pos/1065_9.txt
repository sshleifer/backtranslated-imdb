It finally hit me watching my VHS of Christmas in Connecticut, which other movie one reminded me of. If it wasn't for the fact that the other was made 20 years later, I'd say it was a remake. As Rock Hudson was a fake fisherman expert for Abercrombie & Fitch who had to get some On the job training at a fishing tournament, Barbara Stanwyck plays a forty-one version of Martha Stewart. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a cooking policeman who has built this whole picture of living on a small Connecticut farm with husband and baby boiling all these great delicacies. Problem is, she is unmarried, childless, writes her column from her apartment in New York and doesn't know how to boil water. But her writing is a hit with the public. Trouble comes when she is hijacked to cook for the home of a warhero sailor played by Dennis Morgan, who also sings a few songs. Must maintain the picture at all costs. And her publisher Sidney Greenstreet likes the idea so well that he invites himself to dinner. <br /> <br /> So with borrowed farm, baby and Reginald Gardiner who want to do the right thing with Stanwyck, she tries to braze it through. <br /> <br /> Christmas in Connecticut is now a Yuletide classic and deservedly so. The wires are warm and human and they get great support from the overall players. S.Z. Sakall as the Hungarian restaurant owner / friend of Stanwyck from whom she gets her cooking information and Una O'Connor as housekeeper has a good chemistry between them. Reginald Gardiner and Stanwyck have no chemistry at all, obvious to everyone, but Reggie, and he's fun in his full-bodied shirt fashion. <br /> <br /> Most people can remember this movie as one of Sidney Greenstreet's few comedian ventures. If he is not a direct villain, a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon, Greenstreet is getting other things on the screen. Christmas in Connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to burlesque his own image, and he made the most of it. <br /> <br /> In a biography by Barbara Stanwyck, she mentions that she loved making Christmas in Connecticut as a welcome change from some shameful things like double income she had made recently. One of the things that made the movie so fun was that between taking, director Peter Godfrey and Greenstreet would do something impromptu entertaining with cast and crew with English music hall numbers. Made for a relaxed and warm set, the cast responded accordingly. <br /> <br /> Now if only someone had filmed these numbers.
