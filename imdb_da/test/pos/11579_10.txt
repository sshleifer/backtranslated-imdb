One of my friends asked, "Shouldn't you be pro-euthanasia to like this movie? Is it a mistake in the movie to conclude that most quadriplegics want to end their lives?" Interesting questions. <br /> <br /> As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to end his life in The Sea Inside. Think Ramón Sampedro addressed this also in the film. He is the one who wants to die. It is he who fights for his right to determine his death. He speaks for himself and not for other quadriplegics. Although his pioneering work, depending on one's perspective, may prove beneficial or harmful to quadriplegics down the road, his primary goal is personal. But one thing that this movie does (my opinion anyway) is that it forces us viewers to ask us even the inferior questions my friend so briefly makes. <br /> <br /> After my first viewing of The Sea Inside, I went home in a disagreeable blur. I struggled to unite with this terrific performance; Why would Ramón die? Given love, care, and sacrifice, which was so widespread on Ramon by the people who surrounded him, why should he cling to his harmful decision? Then came a common thought between Ramón and the lawyer into my consciousness by my second view. It threw up a narrative observation: "... total addiction comes at the expense of intimacy." Most people want such intimacy. Of course, how much we value such "needs" largely depends on the individual. As a person with a familiar pre-tensioned sensitivity, I felt strongly with the caregivers in this movie. Why can't Javier consider victims and love from his family and friends? Is he blind to everything? I wouldn't believe it. The Miracle of the Sea Inside is therefore its insightful portrayal of a very humanistic trait. When we face a sane, but inappropriate beloved, who has expressed a calm, conscious, and rational intention to die, what is the right thing to do? Does this beloved live and hold against his or her will, a pious gesture? Does it show the value of our love? Or does it only relieve our "selfish" fear of irreplaceable loss? With so much understanding given to caregivers, would their invalid charges by adhering to others' overall dependence on survival also be an overlooked sacrifice of sacrifice? Rhetorical or not, how much is "worthiness" worth for a person? Is living (or dying) with dignity a privilege or a right? If we really care and love a person, should we also respect their final decisions in life (as in death)? A thrill of questions that the movie might have asked, answers to which I have no ability to give. <br /> <br /> In our eagerness to intellectually delineate the benefits of pro-life or pro-choice, we run the risk of ignoring a sea of ​​weeping, engulfing the most affected people, the caregivers, and those they care about turn around. The Sea Inside therefore tried to present the delicate but complex relationship dynamics between them. Intuitively, this film understands one thing; that the nature of "victims" is never one-sided. In this draw, we should strive not to win arguments, but to observe and hopefully determine who is the "stronger" party to make that sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The Sea Inside is a sobering movie. It opened my eyes to things I didn't want to see. And for that I am grateful.
