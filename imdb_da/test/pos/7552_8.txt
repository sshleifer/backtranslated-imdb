Four friends are one of the movies you go to without expectations, only to find yourself turned on a loop. You kind of file it away, but then you hear the song "Georgia On My Mind" by Ray Charles, and pictures and vague emotions begin to flicker on the edge of your consciousness, and then you remember this crazy movie that made you laugh and cry almost at the same time. Why is this movie so memorable? First, at least for people who lived through it all, because it captures so well the tenor of time - its sharp hopes, its successes, its sincerity, and above all, the emotional roller coaster ride that leads to an exciting nostalgia. And then the play is just so amazing. Danilow, all anxiety and passion, Georgia, so difficult to understand as a will ... but enchanting anyway, and Louis, the disabled roommate with charm to spare, attacking life with gusto and taking every moment with a crooked smile, for he knows only too well that it can just be his last. How long has it been since you saw a movie that made you really interested in the people of history? Even though they were far from perfect? The film presents you with people whose choices are not necessarily legitimate, but the film never moralizes, it only allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its variety ... even the lower case letters have a well-defined personality and a story that why This movie seems so real, though some of the actions and reactions may look like the top ... because that's the way life is when you think about it. And why this movie involves you with a complexity defined by character. Really a wonderful and satisfying experience.
