I love the TV competition. Hate to see it end There are so many talented participants. It's a shame that only 2 are picked. I also love to see the judges too. At times, they are as entertaining as the participants. I've been watching the show faithfully every Sunday night. Wouldn't miss it for the world. It is the best reality show ever on television. Good luck to all the participants, although I have already chosen the two that I would like to see playing Danny and Sandy on Broadway. I am eager to see if my decisions are correct. I'm not aware how long the competition will continue until a Danny and Sandy are selected, but I will keep an eye on the end.
