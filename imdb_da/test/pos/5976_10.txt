I watched this movie many years ago (along with another of Shepitko's film, Wings) as part of a Soviet film series on a local film archive. But none of Shepitko's films, as far as I can tell, have ever made it into video or DVD in the US. Ascent is a good movie of any standard, with stunning black and white photography, hypnotic direction and actors so deep in their roles that you have no sense that they only give a performance. Although period details of Russian resistance to (and co-operation with) German occupation are very narrative, history is timeless. Two Russian partisans are captured by the Germans, and the interrogation tests their integrity as well as their courage. I suppose why it has not been released on DVD from the Russians (here comes the spoiler), that the Jewish intellectual (and not the hard Russian farmer) is the partisan who resists both threats and temptations, goes quietly to his death, and sets one heroic example for the villagers.
