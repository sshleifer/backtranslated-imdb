This is an extremely involved series that is well-molded and portrays a sensitive subject with great splendor. We follow Michael Ealy as the undercover FBI agent Darwyn, set to infiltrate a terror cell terrorist connection (Oder Fehr). The series is very well written and has enough plot twists to keep you sitting at the edge of your seat and waiting for what happens next time. Michael Ealy is, in my definition, one of the best actors I have seen portraying an undercover agent. Ice cold on the outside, but still a good person downstairs tries his best to keep his head beautiful in a highly emotional roller coaster ride that the FBI has got him started. Oder Fehr, on the other hand, comes from a guy who could largely fit into any social scenario. Big and strong, yet able to disappear in the gray mass, if necessary. Very authoritative and extremely clever. The way the two communicate on the screen is nothing short of spectacular. <br /> <br /> The way the story develops and the level of detail the script offers make the whole story extremely credible, and also very true to life I would imagine. It's like you're back with the feeling of being insecure, without knowing what can happen next in real life. We read about terror every day, and here we get a good sneakop in a underworld, which most of us know very little about. <br /> <br /> It's a series that will surely come back for more, sitting there at the edge of your seat waiting for next week's episode to move on. It is a sure winner in my eyes and I have no trouble saying that this series is on my best time list.
