This is an extraordinary movie. As a courtroom drama, it is convincing as an accusation of the US legal system, it is scary. For Brenton Butler, the consequences of this system can be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental errors of the legal process, that it is not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather about who is better off in court. In fact, the consequences of this case are beyond the possibility that an innocent man is found guilty or a guilty man is free. Every citizen has the right to justice, whether it is an offender or a victim. But do they get it? The film is well paced, discreet and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.
