I see a lot of movies in the cinema (103 so far this year) and I have to say that this is by no means the best movie I've seen this year, even though it was released back in 1954! <br /> <I was in awe and saw this genius work and felt quite ashamed that I had never heard of it before my local art cinema decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new print. <br /> <br /> The best part of the entire movie should be the 28 minute break in which there is no speech and no music, only the sound of the men performing the hoist. Clean quality. <br /> <br /> Although it's very dark in places, it shines with the dry humor. Not many movies score 10 out of 10, but it does and also gets a gold star for effort !! <br /> <br /> If you ever get the chance to watch this movie, don't hesitate, it's a classic. <br /> <br />
