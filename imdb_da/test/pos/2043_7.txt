I was happy to find out that at least now this movie has begun to get the appreciation it deserves (see just these voices). Not a first-class act like "Die Hard" or "Lethal Weapon", but still something like a solid 7 out of 10: fine script, good actors with work chemistry and a director who knows what he wants (unfortunately the director Harlin's last good movie "Deep Blue Sea" managed to reach an "OK roller coaster ride" status, but "Cutthroat Island, and especially" Driven "are well-deserved flops!) Personally, I think the turn-off at box office could have been "Woman as a action star" theme. Well, give her a chance because Davis delivers a performance over couples. And after all, this film does not concentrate much on the "feminine" side, but instead of good ol ' action, buddhism (Jackson as a sidekick gets a lot of space here plus his share of action - and about a thousand kills wisecracks!) and on the plot (from Shane Black, the author of "Lethal Weapon" and "The Last Boy Scout". film is on many levels much like this ... the theme, the clever plot, also so good and undervu All in all: if you haven't seen this yet, don't forget to rent it for the next quiet Saturday night!
