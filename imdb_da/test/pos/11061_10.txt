I first saw this movie when I was in primary school, back in the 1960s. I was fascinated by the character that Ingrid Bergman played, and that was my introduction to the French Quarter in New Orleans. The first part of the movie is the best when she comes back to exactly some revenge on her father's wife and daughter (her mother had been outraged). During this time she meets the wonderful Clint Maroon, played by Gary Cooper. The chemistry between the two is great. The other half of the movie takes place in Saratoga, NY (the title Saratoga) and I never enjoy it as much as the New Orleans setting, but it's still very good. I give this movie a ten - in part out of nostalgia, but mostly because it is just a darn good movie, and the characters besides Bergman and Cooper are just as wonderful (Flora Robson comes close to stealing the scenes from Bergman). It used to be shown on television on a regular basis, but it rarely appears if it ever is - it would be a good thing for one of the classic movie stations to download and get into their programming cycles.
