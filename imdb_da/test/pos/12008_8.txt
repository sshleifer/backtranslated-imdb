What can I say about this film besides the story is one of the most exciting in film history ... and based on a true story! Being old enough to remember the Berlin Wall as it was still used to contain a country, this film gives you a dark insight into the wicked interference of the Eastern Berlin, and their desperate attempts to escape whatever the cost. The film follows the lives of two families who decide to escape by means of a balloon made by themselves. Serious fear of arrest by the authorities being scrutinized by neighbors, they must calculate a plan to reach the other side of the wall. An exciting and exciting story of courage and determination that truly pays tribute to all those who succeeded and failed the treacherous journey to West Berlin and freedom.
