Wow - Most of the audience just seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary on the pure wizardry on the screen. <br /> <br /> The shift from the early days as a New York-based black-and-American phenomenon to contemporary days as a racially diverse subculture (and virtually West Coast-based) is well profiled. The humble turntable is not respected for any traditional musical instrument, but it can be so much more versatile and technically complex. These DJs take the necessary skills for any musical instrument - including dexterity, rhythm and timing - and apply them to a new technology with multiple variables. <br /> <br /> DJ Qberts comment that he pictures what "music" should sound like on advanced planets and then it seems, stupid at first, becomes more and more sensible when you see these guys go and spit out a multitude of sounds that no single traditional instrument could ever create! <br /> <br /> Some critics have said that this movie focuses too much on certain 'stars' and throws a chance to profile the wider hip-hop culture. A movie at a time people!
