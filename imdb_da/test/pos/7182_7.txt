Cleopatra (the delicious Monica Bellucci) is challenged by Cesar (Alain Chabat): To prove that the Egyptians are better than the Romans, she promises to build a fancy castle for Cesar for a period of three months without delay. She calls the one-armed architect Numerobis (Jamel Debbuzi) and gives him two options: to be covered in gold if he does his mission or becomes crocodile if he fails. Numerobis will ask for help with Panoramix (Claude Rich), Asterix (Christian Clavier) and Obelix (Geraard Depardieu) (with Ideiafix). This movie is very fun, especially those parts where Obelix and Pirates are led by Red Beard participant. However, the writer and director should have noticed that French is not a universal language of English. Therefore, the jokes with words (such as In Austin Powers movies) do not work well for people who are strange to French language. French and French people will surely like these jokes, but they have no meaning for me, who do not speak French. My voice is seven.
