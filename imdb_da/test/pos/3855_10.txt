This is one of my favorite Disney movies. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, an unpleasant villain and lots of adventures. The story begins in Paris, where the aristocrat Duchess and her three kittens live with their mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until Mistress's haughty butler Edgar discovers she is planning to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realizes that if he himself has a chance to claim wealth, the cats will be out of the way. An excellent, often forgotten masterpiece from the 1970s - a time when the Disney studio made few animations - which contain songs like the title number "The Aristocats" and "Ev'rybody will be a cat", this will enchant the viewers young and old with their persistent jazziness.
