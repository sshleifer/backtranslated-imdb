Pavarotti and the entire cast are excellent in this beautifully recorded opera by Giuseppe Verdi, the world's finest composer of operas. The coloratura soprano is particularly spectacular with its perfect pitch. The title role is well-designed and well-sung. The whole production is as perfect as one might expect. <br /> <br /> A masterpiece of cinematography! <br /> <br />
