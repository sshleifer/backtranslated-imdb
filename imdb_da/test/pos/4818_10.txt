Ride high on the success "Rebel Without A Cause", a tidal wave of "teen" movies came. This is probably one of the best. A very young McArthur stands out here as it is not really for the troubled teen. History concentrates more on perceptions of crime than any traumatic occurrence. The support is memorable, Frankenheimer counts as an old pro. Just a story of a young man who finds others takes his actions too seriously.
