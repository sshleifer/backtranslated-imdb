Although this movie is set among the sophisticated English upper classes, it is a simple story of a few torn down. It has a slightly dated air, an adaptation of "A Way Through the Wood", a 1950's novel by Nigel Balchin (once hugely popular and now forgotten). Julian Fellowes, who, despite an academic award for "Gosford Park's script", has a somewhat anachronistic person himself, wrote the script and directed (the latter for the first time). With the DVD version I saw, there is a brightest audio commentary from Julian. His primary focus was on getting his characters right, and basically he succeeded. In this, he was assisted by two outstanding performances by Tom Wilkinson as James, the pricked City lawyer and Emily Watson as his attractive wife Anne. He also kept it short; Driving time is only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> James and Anne have a townhouse in Chelsea and a comfortable former vicarage in Buckinghamshire. Anne is a few years younger, but they are childless. Externally, they seem happy, but James, one of nature's moralists (unusual for a city lawyer), is a control freak. Along the way is the aristocratic Hon. William Buel, who is not a middle-class moral, and he is more than happy to exploit. But there is a complication, a traffic accident where an elderly cyclist is turned into a highway by a ruthlessly driven Range Rover like it. Bills. Soon, James, Anne, Bill, and the victim's widow (who happens to be James' and Anne's cleaner) are attracted to a conspiracy to hide what really happened. The primary focus is on the corrosive effect of all this on James and Anne's relationship. <br /> <br /> The third person in this m√©nage a trios, Bill, is played by Rupert Everett. From the casting's point of view, his warm, superior way is right for that part, but somehow he doesn't get there. Partly because he has to be ill for some of the time, and he looks good when he has to be sick and vice versa. The part seems underdeveloped. Interestingly, John Neville as Bill's father, who has only one important scene, manages to create his character beautifully in the time he has. <br /> <br /> The world of five star hotels and superior restaurants is nicely developed. As Julian Fellowes says in the audio commentary, these people are able to convince themselves that the Edwardian age still exists. At the bottom, the film is about what pulls a couple together and what tears them apart. Nigel Balchin went through a marriage breakup when he wrote the book, and Fellowes made a good fist to convey the atmosphere. As he says, his is a pretty free fit, but the central theme is the same.
