I know what most people will think of this movie without even seeing it ... 'The typical movie from a famous singer ... It becomes a pink movie, a teenage movie, it gets stupid ...' and things like that. .. and yes it is ... I mean it's a pink movie ... But do you know what? .. I LOVED IT. Seriously ... It's a very romantic movie ... I think any girl in this world has dreamed of something like "Popstar" plot ... Meet her favorite singer, know him as a person ... and even have a romance with him ... not? ^^ I really enjoyed seeing it ... Besides, it's really fun ... I think the actors did a good job ... There are many loving characters ... And Aaron Carter (JD) is not the exception ... To be honest, for the first five minutes to see him act, I thought "it will be terrible" ... But then he really surprised me ... <br /> <br /> I must also say that the music performances on the movie are great! I especially loved the part when JD (Aaron) sings without music, (with guitar only) a very beautiful song ... This guy is really talented ... Time will tell ... <br /> <br /> My advice to you? ... See it! Don't do prejudices ;-)
