Well in 2002 I got something to catch up with. And looking back on a dark year, Best In Show shone. No great story. Little action. Just a cavalcade of magnificent figures. Special reference to Fred Willard and Jim Piddock as a rattling couple of TV commentators. Well done. Worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Ron (Set March 24, 2001)
