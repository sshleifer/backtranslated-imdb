I would say that this was on an equal footing with films such as "Devil's Rain" and that kind of movie, although it is probably a little better done. I love 70's horror and it has most of the elements that make up other movies I like so it was pretty easy to enjoy. A family on their vacation stumbled upon a small town where the people seem to be gripped by some sort of hysteria. Seems the kids have disappeared. After an initial attempt to escape from this place, the family somehow stopped at the edge of the city and found their way back, but not without finding a house where the children are gone, and mom and dad died. It seems that we have another kind of twist on an older community center in this city, they are all satan worshipers, and they need the kids to renew their lives so they can continue in their service, I believe. Not that anyone seems too keen on giving up their children to this business. It is quite classical considering that it is scary and scary without the belly of the belly or the high-sighted events that are trying to make people jump into movies today that seem to have replaced the actual scares. We have Hank Kimball (Alvy Moore) from "Green Acres" as Tobey, a sheriff's deputy who reads UFO magazines, and LQ Jones as the sheriff and a very well-known character actor as the father of the stranded family. And great Martin plays the doctor who seems to make duplication unknown to his fellow human beings. These are pretty good things, but a bit on the confusing side sometimes, but generally it works well and is recommended for fans of the 70 series. 8 out of 10
