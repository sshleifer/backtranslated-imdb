Yes, I know my title stinks. I couldn't think of any other title. x] Ice is a brilliant first season episode. Very interesting idea and good acting too. The whole worm-looking thing was really scary in my opinion. I have never been a fan of insects, so all the insect episodes are scary to me. x] Anyway, let's move on to the good and bad things about this episode, <br /> <br /> The good: the parasite thing. Awesome! <br /> <br /> Scully trusts Mulder. Awww ... <33 <br /> <br /> Put another parasite in the ear. Even if someone told me, they had to put it in my ear ... I think the whole cabin would be dead. <br /> <br /> The bad: How did the dog stay alive for so long? <Br /> <br /> How did Huffman not get the black spots? Or maybe she did, but no one saw it ... Conclusion: Very good episode, especially for season 1. 8/10
