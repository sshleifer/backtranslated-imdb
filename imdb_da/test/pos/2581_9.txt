Craig Brewer is now officially a writer / director for whom I want to watch movies, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year with its emotional history and realistic, beautiful characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking about seeing this sophomore effort. The support seemed good, the trailer used music effectively, but it seemed that there was a good chance that it would go into absurdity and quickly. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan is killing all his marks. The play is amazing, the amazing writing, and the editing style, as well as juxtaposed music sipping all the way. Brewer seems to be a champion to get his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and evil, as they advance on their paths to redemption. <br /> <br /> The first moment I knew I was for a treat was under the shortened credit sequence at the beginning. Just as he did with Hustle and Flow, Brewer puts the music across the widescreen shot perfectly together with simply named static-style fonts. The 70-aesthetics were welcome and helped to show that this would be another great piece of character in vain for those from the decade of some of the cinema's best. From here we continued with the short excerpts of both Lazarus and Rae's life, each vignette reflecting the other while traveling to the fateful moment when their paths finally cross. The editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than sharp to cut before the scene finished its purpose. Rae's boyfriend leaves his service and Laz's wife leaves him for his brother. Who feels the loneliness and returns to what they know in that situation? Rae for sex and Laz for the bottle. Only when Rae is back to death next to the road and her savior comes from his farm to take her in, the reasoning for their actions finally begins to clear. Samuel L. Jackson is great as the older bluesman farmer tries to unite his life with God and that of the flesh and the pain it has brought him. There are moments with stoic sternness as well as those of kindheartedness with his trapped / patient. You never really look at the setup as comic or unrealistic, because he sells what he does so well. Also the character of Rae is not chained for a very long time, despite what the trailers wanted you to believe. The situation starts a little awkwardly until we see that the chain was for its own good and actually only used for a day or two. As for the chain girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I have never seen her as something special, but this role is a real breakthrough for her. This girl is so worried that her former sexual abuse has cut her down very deeply. Every time she's away from her love, she begins to see flashes from the man who took away her childhood innocence and scratched to be touched by any man who is available to let the image go away. Her nymphomania is not for pleasure, but rather for survival from the joking nightmares that always hide behind the eyelids. Ricci fully occupies the role and shows all emotional trauma to great effect and realism. It must also be mentioned Justin Timberlake, who again shows some real actors. Where this guy came from, I have no idea, but hopefully he will continue to take more movies and steer away from the mostly crap music he churns out. <br /> <br /> Although not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan is still in it for me, because when it's on, it's spectacular. Towards the end, we have a truly enchanting sequence of "This Little Light of Mine" that sinks out, and earlier the interplay between captivity and captor, when the chain is first introduced, shows some top-notch work. The truly magical moment, however, is when Jackson sings (yes, he is the whole, as was Terrence Howard in Hustle) the titular song while a thunder storm roars and the lights flicker. If I don't see a more beautiful shot sequence all year, I'm not surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what mankind is capable of. One thing I think I really enjoy with the brewer's work is the fact that he does not show that sinners are being redeemed heroes. Instead, he shows us that no matter how bad you have been or how bad life has been, everyone can strive for redemption and be better people. We don't have master here, but false people are trying to fix their ship. If the course remains true, or if it falls back in the dark, nobody really knows, but at least they can say they tried as hard as they could.
