Like any good art, this movie can mean different things to different people. For me, this means that the lack of opening your heart to the others could rob you of happiness and leave you with an empty live. The selfish convenience is like junk food: it feels good, but can ultimately make you sick. <br /> <br /> Almost everything I see in the US is a commercial mass production of action waste, superficial dramas and stupid comedies, and this sensitive, deep and poetic movie really touched me. Thanks, Nuri Bilge Ceylan (and everything else in the cast)! Ivan Yanachkov
