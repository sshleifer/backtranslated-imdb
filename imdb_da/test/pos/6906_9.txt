I just saw this at SIFF and I absolutely loved it. There were parts where I laughed so hard that I couldn't breathe. The writing and direction of Glenn McQuaid is amazing. I can't wait to see more of this talented young man. The performances make the movie. Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan are just lovely as engraver Willy and his apprentice Arthur. Ron Perlman becomes a great achievement (as usual) as a less than sympathetic jailhouse priest. Bonus: Angus Scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! As always, he perfectly balances threat and humor. <br /> <br /> This is a horror comedy style that has not really been seen since Vincent Price did "Comedy of Terrors", "The Raven" and "Theater of Blood." The movie is really scary in places, so It will suddenly return to fun mode, keeping you completely out of balance. Some parts are scary and fun at the same time. <br /> <br /> I can only afford to watch three movies at SIFF this year, but even though the other two are horrible, "I Sell The Dead" was worth the price of all three. I'm looking for more movies from Larry Fessendens Glass Eye Pix. He gives the horror genre a much-needed kick in the row.
