Being in the suburbs of New York when Z-Boys created history in Dogtown, I was only exposed to a glimpse of what was happening. I had a P-O-S Black Knight skateboard with clay wheels. It is far away and on the ash hill in my personal life. But I never forgot. It's like seeing far lost brothers and friends, and it hits me right where I live. I can't see this movie enough. Every time I see it, another aspect rises to the top, another point of view comes in sharp focus. The vintage film, the incredible still pictures, the present personalities intermittent with the bright shadows of the brightly lit past, the heartfelt and not exaggerated tale, all beautifully edited together in such a way that they make a landmark movie of a true piece of American history. In the words of Glen Friedman - "It was F-ing incredible."
