one of best movies ever ... Four ... it's not much about the sociological description of India today ... it's the mind that blows the use of light that never stops, never gets ... normal. .. even when .. . In that sense, the movie is almost unique ... both leaders are of very good quality ... The origin of the street performer is quite obvious ... her performance is a great "cammeo" ... but the use of the light ... I have looked at it and looked at it again and again ... still in mind blowing by age ... nothing terrible in history ... rather "clean" way to face the subject ... somehow it is sad that in the bizarre world we live today, a large work of art is usually known as a gender film. Fire can be face to face with Dryer's Jeanne D 'Arc or Ichikawa's Biruma no Tategoto or some of the great Kurosawa movies, just to name "some". Wanting my entrance could help a little this movie to its deserved way of praising.
