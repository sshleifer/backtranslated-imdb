See no evil with Kane. The movie has a great story But it just wasn't a hidden eye, screaming out Loud Horror Flick I thought it was from watching WWE Superstars on Monday quarter red when the movie first came to theaters. I've had the movie, even though I loved the story, it played out. <br /> <br /> BIG MOVIE EXCELLENT WILL LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 <br /> <br /> It doesn't mean if Kane is killed the end <br /> <br /> or they haven't killed other horror stars in each movie <br /> <br /> They are out and they are still back for more so part 2 would <br /> <br /> be very interesting.
