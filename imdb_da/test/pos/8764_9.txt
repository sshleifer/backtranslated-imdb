'Traffic', despite the title, is not entirely about drugs. Traffic analyzes and moralizes in its best tradition of crossing British television drama on its apparent subject, which is not a mythical scourge, but a matrix or process of identifiable social, economic and historical roots, causes and effects. There is something almost scientific in the way the movie takes four sets of characters from spectacularly distinct global and class backgrounds - a poppy producer forced into the Pakistani underworld of poverty and a cynical government; the English, ex-Olympic swims wife of a drug baron for human trafficking; two shambling German police officers whose willingness to judge the latter arises so much from the class's anger as any belief in the law; and a Tory junior minister whose Cambridge student daughter has become an abuser. <br /> <br /> "Traffic" is unapologetically didactic - from the early stages of Jack Lithgow in Pakistan, examining government success in removing drugs before sanctioning more British help, we are bombarded with facts about the problem. But these "facts" come from a number of sources - disseminating government representatives; Leftist lawyers interested in corruption (ideological and domestic) poor farmers who need to grow poppies to survive. <br /> <br /> Facts, usually calming markers on a card, are obviously not enough - the more facts we get, the less controllable the situation looks. It is only until Jack, the film's moral center, the man who connects all the narrative threads, actually enters the heart of the drug darkness, that he learns to throw his tory hypocrisy (regret the use of drugs, but refuses to pay serious money To solve the problem and create conditions through various free-market initiatives where drug trafficking is flourishing. Just as the gentlemen of the old Warner's gangster movies were actually model American capitalists, the traffic is the ideal measure that Thatcher and Reagan) at least recognize the reality of the problem . <br /> <br /> As I say, 'Traffic' is not really about drugs. As Jack finally acknowledges, drugs are not really the problem after being tamed as a Tory minister. It is a society that was dismantled by a woman who said there was no such thing (as evidenced by Jack's non-existent family life) that systematically deprives most people of hope and happiness, several of which become drugs . <br /> <br /> What is most frightening about 'Traffic' is not the graphic, numbering depictions of drug abuse (the technical details that ironically reflect the presentation of more 'legitimate', verbal factual information), but the dystopian a British vision of a joy, beauty or community, a gloomy wasteland of abandoned buildings and rarely modernity, a community of defeatists ready to smuggle and barons in their trade. <br /> <br /> This is not just a modern British story - it records the decline of an empire built on trade reduced to drug-free trade. It is certainly important that the other places in the program are Germany and Pakistan, decisive agents in the empire. Here, the old imperial amorium comes home to roost, the former slave victims, their bodies abused by their master's power and returning to the emperor center in London. The seeds of its decline literally carried in their bodies and admit the fear of all the late '19th century Gothic novels.' Traffic 'is one of Britain's best television performances and is in many ways better than the recent Hollywood remake. The political focus is clearly sharper. Jack's decline is far more effective than Wakefields because, as an agent of government policy as well as a poor father, he is very much a part of the problem, while the only economic flaw in the US is complacency. In almost all cases, the characterization is tighter and far more plausible (compares Lindsay Duncan's Steely Helen, already bitten by experience and failure, and her superficial resistance). <br /> <br /> Contrary to the questionable race undercurrent of 'Traffic' (making Mexico dark and Other; the ultimate WASP horror is sex with a black man), portrait of Pakistan is abundantly tragic drawn with disturbing arguments on drug protection underlined of scenes with cruel violence. The whole is the inextricable interconnection of public and private experts. Visually, the film is remarkably inventive, without always being flashy or "cinematic" - especially in the last episode where buildings and decor appear to be moving when the system enters. If 'Traffic' as its remake feels like coastal fragments, then the sense of waste and loss so far is very damaging, Jack's speech bitterly despairing.
