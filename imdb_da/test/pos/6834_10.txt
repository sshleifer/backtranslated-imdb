This is a really good movie in the pulp fiction genre with a touch of film noir thrown in. Really one of Emma Thompson's best performances to date ... this movie has everything it is well-written, well-directed, beautiful movie and has some great achievements. I do not know why it did not address it. It's spectacular!
