Didn't have much demand for this movie, but was pleasantly surprised. Very well made film, very well cut, does not really reach the height Human Traffic did, but it is a very good effort. Well directed and I thought the main actor had a great performance! In fact, the only really bad performance in Tim Curry's movie was the name. <br /> <br /> Cool Film surprised it hasn't done better than it has. I had never heard of it before I saw it with a friend. <br /> <br /> I'm not a raver, but I imagine people who really like this movie.
