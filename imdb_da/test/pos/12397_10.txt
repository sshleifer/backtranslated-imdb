As an adult, I am grateful to have caught this movie by chance when I was a teenager. Over time, I experienced family problems. This particular movie managed to capture what I saw from a closed world. How much peer press is too much? I actually had to buy this movie because it reached me at a level unlike most movies trying to reach an audience. How far can a person go for social acceptance? Who is the "bad" crowd? Teens struggle to find out the answers to these questions, but ultimately ... who is the "pack leader" if there is to be one? Is it the strong one? The beautiful? Maybe the person we all like to like? Could it be moral in character? As far as the film goes, the thrown worked as though it were predetermined. I just hope that more directors and producers are trying to create a job that reaches us all as this movie reached me. I wish I could vote more than ten because this particular title deserves much more.
