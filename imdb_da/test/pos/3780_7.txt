Pretty funny stuff. Charlie was still working towards its peak when he made this rather daring brief about soldiers in World War I trenches. Bold because the war was still going on, and it was a comedy about a serious business. The gags are fun without being either fun or tearing. A successful scene follows another when Chaplin and his companions try to sleep in a pile that is knee deep in water. (This is where we got the term "trench foot" from.) It is probably the most ridiculous episode that Chaplin is disguised as a tree and follows a number of German soldiers as they attempt to perform an allied soldier trapped behind the lines. Edna Purviance, Chaplin's greatest press at the time, is a woman who works with the Americans and is also rescued from execution. <br /> <br /> Chaplin would continue to do more disgusting and more ambitious things, but it is better than most of his shorts in this early period.
