When I was younger I saw the end of HAIR on TV. I just watched the last 5 minutes of the movie. And I was really impressed with that. I got goose pimples and I told myself that I need to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> And I did and I have to say: This movie is amazing. The songs are good, the actors are very good and the message ... The message of this movie is one of the most important: "Love, no war". This film is a real masterpiece. Meanwhile, it's my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> The last song is one of the coolest and happiest I have ever listened to. I could almost feel myself watching the crowd. All I have to say, "LET SOL, SKINE, SKINE YOU"
