Looking back to the year 2002 when "Furia" was made, one can easily recognize the heroes singing in today's New Generation in Romania. <br /> <br /> The key qualities of "Furia" stand in a very solid script, with a significant dramatic core and a real professional development, plus a cast of outstanding actors. All four leading roles are admirably performed, both with depth and relaxation: Dragos Bucur and Andy Vasluianu then confirmed to be two of our best artists today, Dorina Chiriac follows them closely and Adrian Tuli, a non-professional (in fact, a cemetery) manager!) cast like Gabonu, was a true revelation! <br /> <br /> In addition, Radu Muntean's instructions are skillful and expressive, creating in a very convincing style the sense of "a fateful night" and inevitable fate. One can easily pass the few awkward and even flawed moments when the time turned out to be only the uncertainties associated with a debut, never repeated in his subsequent film: "HÃ¢rtia va fi albastra" and "Boogie".
