Brilliant movie! I'm sorry to say that it looks like a little like Pulp F. but that's the way it is with the post-mass era. Many pictures are automatically compared to that for just being a gangster flick. But this is well-written, fun coincidence, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good equality! In any case, the film is about a guy in Australia who gets mixed up with a hard-hat gang and ends up in a debt and deep s * it. For his help, his deceased brother (someone remembers Val Kilmer in True R.?) To pay his debts and escape from gangsters who are on his track. The gangsters are cold-blooded, but take the time to play chess and focus on the upbringing of their children! They also serve tea from their grandmother while planning a bank robbery and having trouble with what to do with their children during the robbery. Saw a humorous gangster flicking with Heath Ledger in good shape (though I'm not a fan), and Bryan Brown in good deed as a gang leader.
