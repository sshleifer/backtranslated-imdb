Although it hardly compares to other sci-fi movie giants like 2001: LIVEFORCE, LIVEFORCE or LIFEFORCE, LIFEFORCE works as a completely berserk and bizarre message of science fiction and horror elements. Somehow, despite a dialogue approaching the ridiculous and action that does the same, it manages to work because of a few very different elements. <br /> <br /> Loosely based on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel "The Space Vampires", this film by director Tobe Hooper (POLTERGEIST, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) focuses on a common US-British mission aboard the British space shuttle Churchill to study Halley's Comet. Led by an American commander (Steve Railsback), they discover a strange spacecraft in the comet's comet. And when they examine the interior of the spacecraft, they find alien residents resembling giant bats. Later, Churchill reaches Earth's orbit, but no response from radio calls issued by Mission's home base, the Space Research Center in London. Columbia is launched to rendezvous with Churchill, but they find the whole ship beaten by fire - all except the alien creatures encased in glass, which are far from untouched by the fire, look absolutely perfect. Foreigners are bought back to Earth ... and this is where the incredible happens. <br /> <br /> These space vampires escape from the Space Research Center, and instead of draining their victims of blood through bite wounds, their victims suck out life force completely out of them. One of them is Space Girl, a thoroughly nude vampire game by Mathilda May. Railsback, the only actual survivor of Churchill, was purchased by SRC's chief (Frank Finlay) and a British Special Agent (Peter Firth) to track May who is in telepathic contact with him. But soon the vampires have turned London into a scene of pure holocaust; People are either designed or transformed into zombies, and NATO's threat of sterilizing the city with thermonuclear radiation is huge. Railsback finally catches up with May and sacrifices herself by introducing her with a large metal saber. Undoubtedly, it is undeniable, undoubtedly uneven, but nevertheless worth looking at, LIFEFORCE, despite the fact that its script is frequently incoherent and its plays, enjoying some drop-dead excellent special effects work by John Dykstra (STAR WARS), some of the best ever seen. The second piece of work and a surprise is the incredible orchestral score by Henry Mancini, almost Wagnerian in the same way as John Williams' score for STAR WARS - and Mancini, who Williams before him, uses the London Symphony Orchestra to start! <br /> <br /> Very forgotten these days and a critical and box office disaster in 1985, LIFEFORCE, if for no other reason yet to be seen by anyone with a taste for the bizarre. There had never been a movie similar to that before, and there certainly won't be anything like it again.
