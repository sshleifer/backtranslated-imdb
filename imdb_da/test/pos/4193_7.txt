The Beatles had just done the 'Magical Mystery Tour'. There was the general belief that performance, peace and drugs went naturally together. In LA there was a movie subculture that knew something was up. Nicholson was in several of these gangs. Before he really decided to become an actor before 'Easy Rider' before 'Pink Flamingos' before 'Day of Night' there were several experiments with what to do about this. One important is 'Saragossa Manuscript'. This is another. Jack writes. He plays with circular narration, self-reference, movie reference, self-confidence, pain of creation, all on the edge of safe kiddie pop. You should see this if you only want to know something about Jack. <br /> <br /> Certain actors act by digging into themselves. It is a common technique. Some dig deep, but after a while they become boring because they are incredibly superficial. There are not just enough things in there to maintain a career. Think of DeNiro and Hackman. <br /> <br /> Others are pretty interesting people who seem to be more interesting over time. When they dig into the barrels, they put things back because of the grave at the grave. Think Sean Penn and Jack. At the bottom of Jack's barrel, he turns around at the end of the thread, as all characters are the experimental, risky writer / film maker. <br /> <br /> Who cares if it's a bad movie? It's bad because it took risks. See when a tear is erased by Annette's cheek by the instructor. It is a loving deaf on the whole Brando thing, something I heard Marlon laugh about. It's one of the richest moments in Hollywood's film history. <br /> <br /> There is another reason to see this. Music in movies has a strong mess in the dance. The revolution in film is often dependent on music. Thus, whole cultures are swept together. <br /> <br /> An unsung giant by perceiving how billions are now dancing is Toni Basil. She was so influential in pop choreography that the Beatles were in music. She was already well into her career when he was invited to work on this. But this is one of her earliest screens. You can see her work all the time, and she even in the beautiful, cool "Daddy's Girl" segment, over one of Nilsson's better songs. (Followed by Frank Zappa cameo.) McCartney would refer this scene in his TeeVee special year later. <br /> <br /> A third reason to watch is early (about 6 1/2 minutes) in the movie: a character named 'Lady Pleasure' kisses each monkey in a long continuous shot and then resigns. She is credited as I. J. Jefferson, but is truly Mimi Manchu, Nicholson's lover at that time and LSD partner. Red hair, psychedelic behavior. Lovely. This scene says it all to me about how Jack feels about the boys. <br /> <br /> Ted's Evaluation - 3 out of 3: Worth seeing.
