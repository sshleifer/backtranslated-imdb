This movie is simply amazing. It is so funny. Although skating and other installations are played out, comedy is fantastic. Raab Himself and Brandon Dicamillo are fun. There will be moments when you can't breathe, you laugh so hard. Plus, there are scenes you can see hundreds of times and still laugh. This is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.
