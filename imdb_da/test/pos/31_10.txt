I've just seen The Dresser tonight and have only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago. It is not a "big" movie and does not attempt to make a great gift, but my God, the glory of the two leaders, leaves me speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing short of amazing in this movie. The dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespeare actor (Finney) and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), a kind of servant, produced a production of King Lear during the flash of London in World War II. These are two men, each of whom are dependent on each other: Sir is almost helpless without the help of Norman to cuddle, whirl and bully him to come on stage for his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; Without Mrs. needing him, he is nothing, or he thinks he is. <br /> <br /> This is a character driven movie; the plot is secondary to the character's interaction, and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. Finney, only 47 years old, is completely credible as a very old, very ill, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. He accommodates and steams with his fellow players even when they take their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as a mincing chest of drawers, which sometimes has to act more like a mother than a servant to her older employer. Employer is really the wrong term to use. For, although technically their relationship is employer and employee, most of them are Sir and Norman, as nothing as much as an old couple. Yes, there are others in this movie, but there is no doubt that the true stars are Finney, Courtenay, and the amazing script by Ronald Harwood. That is not to say that there are no other fine performances, especially Eileen Atkins as the long-standing scene manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old wishes, old remorse, and what could have been. <br /> <br /> Although not spoken these days, it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates) and Best Custom Screenplay. <br /> <br /> I had remembered this as a good movie, but I wasn't prepared to be as completely fascinated as I was from the beginning to the end. If you want to see an example of what is about everything and be very entertained all the time, I encourage you to see The Dresser.
