Jewel Thief is one of the exciting thrillers where the viewers are left guessing to the end who the villain is. Suspense builds from the very first scene when the jewel thief becomes a national problem, and there are cleverly hidden traces in the movie so you can guess who is the jewel thief. The story shows that Dev Anand (Vinay in the movie) and the jewel thief have identical faces. But you get a 1000 watt shock when you finally get to know the villain. There are many surprises and many fishy things going on, but there is time for romance and six melodic perpetual songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Kishore Kumar and Mohmmad Rafi. <br /> <br /> This movie was also talking about his song's videos. Consider teasing and controversy in Asman Ke Neeche. Or blocking the way of Dev Anand when Tanuja went out with his friends in Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara. Or the romantic Dil Pukare is in the beautiful Sikkim. Or the wonderful dance at Vyjantimala in Hotho Pe Aisi Baat. Add to that Rulake Gaya Sapna Mera and Raat Akeli Hain and you will never forget this movie for any reason. <br /> <br /> The act of Dev Anand, Ashok Kumar, Tanuja and Vyjantimala and the direction of Vijay Anand (Dev's younger brother) can make this one of the best-loved Hindu films of all time, even today.
