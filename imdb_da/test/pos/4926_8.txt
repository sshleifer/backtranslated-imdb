I love this movie ... it can make me laugh! = ^ _ ^ = It's a little hard to do. This movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations ever. It doesn't distort the characters like other movies out there. Everyone has character and plays a role! <br /> <br /> The movie focuses on Buster and Babs, who descend the river after a flood (with Buster), to Plucky on a trip with Hamton (fun stuff), Elmyra runs around to torture animals (as usual ), Fifi follows her around for an autograph, and Shirley and Fowlmouth go to the cinema. <br /> <br /> In my own opinion, I didn't think about Buster and Bab's segments so much, even though they had a remarkable dialogue and jokes. I have to say Plucky and Hampton 'Vacation' parts were the best! Hamton's family is HILARIOUS! I especially like Uncle Stinky. Fifi in the hotel was also fun. I love the actor cameos during this scene. : D <br /> Probably the most famous part of this movie, again IMHO, is when Fowlmouth and Shirley are in the cinema ... LOL! You have to see it to appreciate it! And when Hamton and Plucky go through the tunnel to make a wish ... :) <br /> <br /> Although this movie moves slowly under the Buster / Babs sections, the rest is pure gold! I rate this movie 8/10. Show it to your children someday ... or even grown up yourself - SEE THIS MOVIE! You will not regret it.
