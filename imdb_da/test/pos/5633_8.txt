I enjoyed this one because I can relate to it. <br /> <br /> At one point in my life I tried to make movies and saw many of the same issues Mark Borchardt did to try to make his movie. And I also went through a long period of self-absorbed arrested development, where I refused to grow. But so miraculously I was married and had children. I realized that being a fighting filmmaker probably wouldn't give birth to my family. So I got a decent job and did what I felt I needed to do to make it happen. That's what a mature, responsible adult does. <br /> <br /> Mark has not faced that reality yet, and in that sense he is a retarded youth. For this reason, there is hopelessness about him. Like Don Quixote, he seems so unfortunate and self-confident that he doesn't know how bad he really is. The viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle. Mark has children and a former wife and bills to pay, but the film portrays him when, in principle, he usually only pursues his "artistic vision". <br /> <br /> Despite this, Mark crosses the film as a sympathetic person, surrounded by a very interesting family and a group of friends. Unfortunately, Mark lacks many of the things needed to succeed both in life and in a career: maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, prioritization, financial complaint, etc. But he draws on, like Ed Wood, apparently without any clue about a clue. <br /> <br /> I suppose we should be encouraged by the play of this noble individual's "never say die" attitude fighting against the odds. And man, what odds are there! Kiefer Sutherland, Colin Hanks, Tori Spelling and Angelina Jolie are all offspring of big-time movies or television people; No doubt they will all like to lead one day if they are not already. How much space is there for an independent Mark? It's like seeing a guy hit his head with a table over and over again. Come to think of it, it's pretty close to what happens to one of Mark's actors, with the kitchen door, in one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in any movie. <br /> <br /> Despite these concerns and apparent criticism, I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone. Uncle Bill is great. I have a friend who met both Mike and Mark, and he told me that in reality these guys are exactly the way they appeared in the movie.
