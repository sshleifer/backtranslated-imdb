I was lucky enough to be an extra in this movie when I was about 13 under the runway scenes. My junior high school drama class was invited to participate. It was a fantastic experience. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey, Charles Martin Smith and Don Stroud played the music all day long! As a musician, I can appreciate the tireless work and commitment these guys put into their roles. They must have played these songs 20 times. It is very difficult to maintain consistency and energy under these conditions. This is visible during a cut to a close-up on "That's the Day", but fortunately the unsuspecting audience probably wouldn't have picked it up. Skating around all day, getting that day out of school and being transported back in time was an incredible thrill. I also had my first "date" on film. I had to go to a girl to the box. Woo hoo! Even with an out-of-date haircut and warm light melting Vaseline in my hair, it was still worth it. Fun stuff. <br /> <br /> The film is top notch and is very satisfying as a whole. Busey delivers his best role ever and the supportive cast is amazing. I'm happy to have participated in a great movie of the day. Believing I could have been in Corvette Summer or something. Does not. <br /> <br /> A fun ironic end to this is that years later, I was in a video store in Malibu that looked at the movie the week it was released on video. Gary Busey went in and stood right next to me. I showed him the cover and babbled on how great he was and how I was an extra and whatnot. Quite strange but very cool for what it is worth.
