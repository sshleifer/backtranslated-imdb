I saw this on television in 1989 and regretted not losing it. I was very exciting and exciting. It's great when the events unfold, and this man's past picks him up. <br /> <br /> The play is first rate, and the story is exactly what the title claims ... "Destruction" ... but no one could run away from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie.
