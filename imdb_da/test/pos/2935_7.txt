After dabbled in the modeling industry (as a model) I see this show with a slightly different view than most forces. While I admit that ANTM can be a fun and entertaining show as the seasons continue, it seems to continue to slip from any reality. The view seems to be almost pure publication for its participants, as it appears that none of the show's winners (or co-competitors) have made much of a name for themselves from the show's show umbrella. Maybe it's because truth is any girl with real potential to be a high fashion model, shouldn't have too much trouble sending to agencies (you can do it via email or snail mail whose distance prevents you from joining In an agency open call) sign up for an agency and start a modeling career. Yes, the process does not guarantee success, but apparently ANTM does not. And joining a reality show seems to offer less of a boost in the modeling industry than signing to a top or decent agency (which only one participant in each cycle is guaranteed anyway). Nevertheless, the show can't hurt, can certainly be entertaining and has some kind of magic that works especially for teenage girls I've found. Although I have to add, the ANTM can become a bit tedious and boring after seeing several cycles as it has become for me. And besides some unrealistic situations (each more outrageous than the last), the only other irritation is overuse of "Tyra, Tyra, Tyra!" Tyra seems to really lead these girls to success, but it is necessary that each of the models' temporary tombs be covered by Tyra images; to virtually all panels and challenges to include a story or scenario that "Tyra" experienced and overcome? I do not think. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, take a little Tyra, sit back in a little more reality, and ANTM could be a 10-star show instead of a 7.
