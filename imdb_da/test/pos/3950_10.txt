I can't get this flick from my brain. It is certainly different from something out there. I've seen lots of movies during the holidays, and while some are okay, nothing really rocked my world as BlindSpot did. There is just so cool about the actors and the way they put the movie together. It is as if there are really scary things mixed with some beautiful features with hilarious black humor. Franco is great, but the older coarse guy steals the show in a couple of scenes, as when he beats the baby into the trench. I think some politically correctos will not appreciate the vibe (not bringing your grandmother), but it is absolutely fantastic. The best thing is the kaliedescope style. There are some really serious things mixed with super-interesting footage. The movie makes you really sad and scared in parts, but it also spins the head with what happens and how it gets filmed. WTF is up with the world? So many critics welcome all of these presumably revolutionary groundbreaking films, and when you see them, they are boring and predictable and not all. I don't understand it because there are many other better choices. Blind Spot is really good because it gives you excitement and chills and greater upcoming star power, but does it in a way that is completely fresh and quite clear.
