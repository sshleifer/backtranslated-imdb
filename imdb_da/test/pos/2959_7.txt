Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Indians for doomsday, for what seems to be no apparent reason. That is until Lone Ranger discovers a conversation with the Indian chief Tomache, who each had a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts that we later learn when combined, will give the mastermind behind hooded raiders with a card for a legendary lost gold town. Can Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals with the medallions before hooded raiders get their hands on it? Is there really a lost city of gold somewhere in native land? <br /> <br /> I saw this and I knew what was going to happen, and everything seemed really well-known until, ultimately, I realized I had seen this exact same movie when I was just a little child. And I remembered having a fun time as a child enjoying this with a bunch of friends. However, as an adult, the plot is somewhat predictable, but you know this, while it is not quite in the same league as the 1956 movie, remains very fun to watch. Clayton Moore is perfect as Lone Ranger and Jay Silverwheels as Tonto steals much of this movie, as he is probably in more action scenes than even Lone Ranger. There are some very familiar faces available here, including Douglas Kennedy like Ross Brady, head of the Hooded Raiders band, Charles Watts as a bigoted Sheriff, and Ralph Moody as a friendly Padre.
