It's so nice to see Bruce Willis come down from his action throne and let's see he's really a talented actor. He shines in this movie as the near 40-year-old image consultant who has completely lost touch with his inner child - until he meets him face to face. This is one of the rare movies that doesn't speak to the audience and really offers something for the whole family. It's about looking after each other, keeping some of the baby inside you and realizing that you're not growing up exactly as you thought you would. Willis seems to build an impressive track record to work with kids (just witnessing "The Sixth Sense" with Haley Joel Osment) and he has great chemistry with Spencer Breslin here. There is some good photography and music, and the end is wonderful and uplifting. A great movie to watch with every family member.
