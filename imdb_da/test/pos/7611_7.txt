Josie is a journalist from a newspaper who is tasked with going back to high school when she turns 17 again. . <br /> <br /> When she is there, she remembers some really horrible things that happened to her the first time she was in high school as we see in flashback scenes. In the feedback they show that (little spoiler) Josie was a nerd in high school and was picked a lot, and one day, she says tough that he takes her to the promenade, only on the prom night when she leaves her house, she gets the egg off the asshole and his bitch. what a terrible thing to do (some will find it hard to see, as it is so uncomfortable and it will make you feel warmer for Josie). I didn't find this movie so funny, but there were some really fun things in the office scenes much more fun then something happened in school. <br /> <br /> This movie had the perfect happy ending as it brought tears to my mother and sister's eyes. The action in this movie was not excellent, it was good for most of the movie. There are some bad ones that work in some parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> I want to give this movie 7 out of 10.
