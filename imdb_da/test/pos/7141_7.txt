True, it is not John Sayle's finest movie (Brother From Another Planet), but it is not entirely forgettable, if not for any reason other than its message. Like Batman, the Wild Things parents were murdered in front of him and let him defend himself in 'The Zone', a corrupt section of a named city where greed and violence prevail. Instead of falling into as Chopper (Robert Davi), Wild Thing fights for justice, using his Tai Chi powers and eerie cat impressions, occasionally occasionally on fire. He becomes something of an urban legend, a modern Robin Hood, and a hero of the age. 1987 at its finest, WILD THING LIVES
