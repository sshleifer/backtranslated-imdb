This movie looks very much like Death Warrant with Jean-Claude Van Damme and also has some similarities with the Island of Fire with Jackie Chan, and I have also heard that there are some other very similar action movies, but this movie has a much better action than Death Warrant or even Island of Fire (that's right, Jackie Han's movie). Rarely American action movies have such real action sequences, although there were many negative reviews on this movie, it easily beats most action movies from the time that were more successful. There were many martial arts images, David Bradley was quick as Bruce Lee in this movie, and what was good was that fighting situations were much longer than in most American martial arts films. Shoot-out scenes resembled John Woo's movie, perhaps not as good, but still very exciting. There were also many impressive explosions and a big hunting scene. I've seen some other David Bradley's movies, but this one is the best in action. OK, this movie has some cheesy moments, but what movie doesn't it have? The action was decent, Charles Napier was incredible, and his character was really tough. Adam Clark, who played squid and Yuji Okumoto who played the biggest bad guy, was also very good. Other actors also acted quite well, although the play is not important in this type of film. If you are an action movie fan (I mean the real action movie fan who can really appreciate the good action) than you should see this movie.
