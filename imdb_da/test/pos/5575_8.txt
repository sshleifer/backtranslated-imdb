I remember ignoring the TV series when it first debuted because of its 'look' with Jim Hensen's muppets. But recently, a friend let me borrow his Farscape DVDs, and I am now aware of what a terrible error was. <br /> <br /> As with any TV series, there are episodes that shine and those that don't. I run adrenaline and emotional rush during the major episodes and suffer through the noisy. However, I endure regardless of the core law that binds all the episodes together. What I am talking about is the growth of the protagonists and their love for each other. Let me warn you, this is something that is absolutely irresistible to see. I can't remember other TV shows (Babylon 5, Buffy, Angel, etc.) that cleverly and intelligently put together such a heartbreaking (sometimes) and exciting trip. I think at the end of the fourth season things were finally focused, and I'm shocked at the decision to cancel the series. I eagerly await the release of the miniseries and invite others to discover this incredible gem.
