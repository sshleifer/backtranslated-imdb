I love this movie. There's something for everyone. It's fun, sad, passionate and dramatic. The mixture of two completely different cultures creates a whole new world, which the viewer cannot help but will be a part of. I have to admit that I am a little biased when Colin Firth is my favorite actor and then nothing he does wrong in my eyes (!), But in this movie, his huge acting talent is evident and it is further enhanced the beautiful act of his fellow star Nia Long. The problems that their love affair suffers make it ironically more credible, and the simple features of the contrast between the colors of Matthew's and Nimi's clothing alone make this movie more enchanting. I defy anyone who cannot be moved by this story. I find it enchanting and have seen it at least ten times since I bought the movie a week ago!
