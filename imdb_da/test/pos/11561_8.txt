Okay ... it's 2005, and when you finally get to watch this movie, you'll probably say it's dated. But here's the case, the manuscript was brave, the exposure of the music industry at that time was just as bold ... and it took time to get music created by African Americans to be promoted at the same level as white acts. In some cases it is still - but back in the 70s, this film took some of the "background" that many never knew. Now we have "American Idol" - "Pop Idol" and other such things that allow us to realize in "record execs" and how they think they should market something that sells and doesn't market talent. <br /> <When I was a kid, I loved Earth, Wind and Fire the release of "That's the Way of the World" which featured some of their greatest hits: "Shining Star", "Rationale", "Yeanin" , Learnin '"and the title. Little did I know this was a SOUNDTRACK of a movie ... until I moved to Los Angeles and got the wonderful" Z "Channel." Z "Channel showed this movie as part of a" Harvey Keitel "retrospective. Gee, I didn't know Harvey Keitel had so many movies - and when I saw this, I was surprised. This movie is not a cinematic masterpiece, but it deserves more profit than it was. It's a nice little movie More than a "vanity piece" for earth, wind and fire, Harvey Keitel does a good job as a torn record performer trying to "fight the system." There are many lessons to be drawn from this and a lot of "insider "trading that was exposed. <br /> <br /> If you can find this carefree ... it's worth seeing.
