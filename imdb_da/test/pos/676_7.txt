We are in a small town, a domestic widow (Ida Lupino) hires a craftsman (Robert Ryan) to look after her house. She soon begins to regret it when Ryan grows unclear during the hour, it seems she is hosting a dangerous schizophrenic, and now she is unable to escape her house. Beware, my lovely is adapted from Mel Dinelli's {The Spiral Staircase} story and game called "The Man". Almost a single film and a two-characterized piece, the film boasts of two major key performances and provides an interesting experience on mental illness. However, one should not be fooled into believing that this is a violent and nerve-cutting image because it is not. Clearly, from the start, Ryan's Howard Wilton is a dangerously troubled man, but it's another kind of "danger" movie. One who throws up another shine on psychosis and thus makes it hard to hate our dangerous protagonist. <br /> <br /> Ryan and Lupino are a great combination, they had also made it excellent and far better at Dangerous Ground this same year. So with both actors clearly comfortable together, it brings out a fine-tuned cartoon, all based on a house, for example: prison. Ryan is particularly strong when his character flashes in and out of madness, with some scenes powerful and sometimes evoking fear and with others giving deep sympathy. The direction from Harry Horner is certain {he will certainly not do much more than let his actors run with it}, and George E. Treble's cinematography contains some clever and influential visual features. With one involving Christmas trees is immensely memorable. Falling some where between is average and large, beware, my lovely has enough to make it a recommendation for borderline fans and easy to follow movie noir. For fans of Robert Ryan tho, it is something of an important view, oh yes, and some. 10.7
