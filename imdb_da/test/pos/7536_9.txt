This is a cleverly crafted piece of cinema that deals with a teenage boys' confused sexuality. The cut scenes in can be long, but the cinematography is beautiful. This movie would not appeal to many people, especially those who are crazy about gay teenage relationships, but the more obviously they can sympathize with the confused protagonist.
