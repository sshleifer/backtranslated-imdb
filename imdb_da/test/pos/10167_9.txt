A movie that tends to be buried under prejudice and pretense - It's a remake! Doris Day is in it! She sings! - Hitchcock's second crack at 'The Man Who Went Too Much' is his most underrated movie and possibly a full-fledged masterpiece in itself. This is in more ways than a Doris Today's movie. Not only does she give her career the best performance, more than keeping herself against James Stewart, but the whole movie is subtly structured around her character rather than his. This is a movie where music is both a motif and a plot unit. What better casting than the most popular singer of his generation? Consider: Today's Jo McKenna has abandoned his career on stage to settle with her husband and raise their son. This seems to be a joint decision and she does not seem to be unhappy. But watch how Stewart teases her in the carriage over her concern over Louis Bernard, which means she is jealous that Bernard didn't ask her questions about her career. This is obviously a recurring joke between them - she reacts with a 'ha-de-ha' who denotes the confidentiality of that gag, suggesting that she has some latent anger over her confinement and that they both realize it . br /> <br /> After their son has been kidnapped, Stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news. This is a cruel scene played brilliantly by both actors, illustrating the balance of power in their marriage - he seeks to control and suppress her reactions, essentially by using his professional knowledge to suppress his voice in marriage, like his medical career. has suppressed his singing career. The strength of the force is demonstrated in the Ambrose Chapel sequence when she is to rule in her highly educated clarity and volume to interfere with congregation of female drudges - they almost act as a warning of what will become of her if she continues suppress his talent. At Albert Hall, her need to shout out is to exert the impressive lungs that save a person's life, and in the embassy final, it's her talent and reputation that allows them to find their son. In contrast, Stewart's masculinity is counterproductive - his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end, left behind in the church, while everyone else moves on to Albert Hall, and his efforts have only succeeded in killing the killer, thereby depriving the police of potentially useful information. It is only when his action is linked to his wife's voice for rescuing Hank from the embassy that he actually succeeds in doing something useful. <br /> <br /> Far from being forced into the movie to give Day an Opportunity to sing, 'Que Sera Sera' acts as the first musical entity in the movie that overshadows the nightmare of engulfing McKennas ; 'The future is not ours to see'. It also prepares fine for the final, where the close band mother and son share through music, will give Doris the opportunity to save the day. <br /> <br /> The best-known sequence in the movie makes music the central feature - Building for the Albert Hall murder trial. This long wordless sequence can be the most uncommon thing Hitchcock has committed to film, the ultimate expression of his belief that movies should tell stories visually. We see people leading conversations in this order, but we never hear a word they say. We don't need - the pictures say it all. It is also his most exquisite excitement sequence, where the pieces move slowly in place when the music builds. The editing is incredibly tight, perfect for the music. There is no frame out of place - something that does not directly relate to the murder, gives the viewer a sense of the environment, the geography where all this plays out. It builds slowly, but at the end the excitement is almost unbearable. When Jo screams, it's not just a relief to her, but to the public. The Ambrose Chapel sequence is witty and particularly effective for anyone who has had to sit through a service at a particular non-conformist church. The Embassy Sequence seems a little flat after Albert Hall one who preceded it at first view, but the second time it seems actually more effective, with the final tour at gunpoint really benefiting from the beautiful use of Dagsang in the background, reminiscent of music as-ambient noise in 'Rear Window'. The result as a whole is subtle, so the music from screen sources can be anticipated effectively. <br /> <br /> Bernard Miles is a low key villain, a small banal but with a dry white. He is widely used by Brenda de Banzie as his wife, who goes a fine line between creepy and sympathetic. Just look at the way she smokes a cigarette while her husband performs the murder - her attitude is pure gangster's minor proving Middle England exterior, but she clearly has a soft side and possibly the mother's feelings towards Hank. <br /> <br /> Stewart is excellent, though if Hitchcock really always threw him as "Everyman," as the director's daughter seems to think, confirms that Hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. Stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who anchored Fascist ideology in Rope, a voyeur who mistreated his boyfriend in the back window and an obsessive nephro profile in Vertigo. Day is nothing short of phenomenal. Just look at her reaction to the news that her son has been kidnapped - she never exaggerates anything, but also does not sell it short. This is one of Hitchcock's most emotionally effective movies. He never lets us forget what the effort is for McKennas; They feel most fully human of all his key characters.
