This movie is a refreshing change in the pace of the thoughtless Hong Kong triad movies I've become so tired of. There are no spectacular armies. No car hunts. And practically minimal action to talk about. The audience is kept in excitement for the most part, though some aspects of the so-called "ploy" by Andy Lau are quite obvious. <br /> <br /> The film has been hailed as a departure from the violent triad genre movie and as an "intelligent" crime film. To an extent it is. But to some extent, it still fails the "credibility test". One can hardly see any triad member being stupid enough not to look through Andy Lau's female disguise for a second. It also seemed to have fallen for "if someone was seriously ill, someone said coughing up abundant amounts of blood regularly" things Chinese movies seem to go on all the time. The subtle relationship between the two main characters is a refreshing change. All in all, an enjoyable movie, although the concept is not new and there are few surprises. >
