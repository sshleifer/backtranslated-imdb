This is a movie to be taken in context. It shouldn't be seen unless you've seen the first two movies, but the kind of people watching this movie will probably own the boxet or at least know someone who does. And you shouldn't go in for expecting Blade Runner; The film's budget does not extend so far and it is a much more zany ride. <br /> <br /> The movie is essentially a science fiction set in the future Yokohama (shot in Hong Kong as it is obvious) about a society where it is illegal to produce. Sho Aikawa represents a similar role from Dead or Alive 2, and Riki Takeuchi is a detective for birth control police. Takashi Miike is not one to give all your reasons to you on a plate, but one can assume that the law of reproduction (enforced by giving people the pill) is there because of over population, increased longevity and so on. Interestingly, the dialogue in the movie is mainly Cantonese, while Sho and Riki (who play their parts as always excellent) speak Japanese and some speak English. People have criticized English as a tree, but I found no problem with it. Another person also found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive; said Takashi Miike was anti-gay. He may well be (and not all artists should be left), but I can't see this movie as an insult to homosexuals. He only calls back philosophies in ancient Greece when gay or bisexuality was more prevalent. The movie features similar proportions of action-packed instant moments to DoA 2, although in this movie the action is more martial-arts-based and is made in a very good Hong Kong style. The cinematography in the film is very nice in the eyes, with symmetrical shots, a good control of the colors to give the air a contaminated look, and it is nice to see the rude, long shots that are so rare in Hollywood these days. Basically, there is a lot to like in this movie: a good sense of humor, exciting action and some very beautiful moments. It's a fantastic finish to the series. You could criticize it for being a bit cheesy, but isn't that part of the charm?
