mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary. In the wine world there is a big difference between the large vineyard and the small vineyard. It's not just about the size of your vineyard, but also the amount of money and power you have. If you have enough money to place ads in the wine spectator and hire a so-called "wine except" then it doesn't matter the size of your property. In today's business world too, wine often has a mass market and adapted to people's tastes. what many times means wine filtered by that origin. mondovino shows the commercial side of wine compared to mega producer Robert Mondavi and the Michael Rolland wine expert, who forms wine to the taste of today's critics such as Robert Parker, who is also in the movie. Now these men are not evil or wrong, for they have done very well for wine. But they have power on a large scale. as we all know about power disturbances. mondovino also shows small wine producers such as Aime Guilbert from Languedoc and Hubert de Montille of Volnay in Burgundy. These wine makers are not starving wine makers, but they can, like all great wine makers, be about where grapes are from. The best example of this is not explained by a wine producer, but by a Haitian man working for the Neal rosenthal wine importer. The area where the grapes are grown is the terroir that matters, that an indicative hand that knows this makes important real wine.
