What hurts this movie is all, and their aunt Matilda compares it to her famous predecessor, who is always going to hurt any show. If you take it as a western, it's a darned good show. We discover how our characters in 'Lonesome Dove' come up in the situations they start in (For example: Why are two Texas Rangers living on adventure in a dead city? And how did Gus manage to lose love His life?) The performances are very good, and we see exactly the same ways that the characters will have on the way. The actors did a really good job. The cinematography was amazing, and while the music didn't live up to the legendary score of nearly two decades earlier, it was an impossible task and it was still fine. It also helped that we had three episodes that you just don't see in a miniseries anymore. Heck, it's actually impossible to see a two-part phone these days. <br /> <br /> Fans of the West, look forward to it!
