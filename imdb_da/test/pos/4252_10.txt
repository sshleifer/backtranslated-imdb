1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey movie to gain some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much broader release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and unpleasant. These 2 films were mediocre thrilled to the point that they actually stopped the Prince's feature film career for several years. <br /> <br /> The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it's a crazy farce / satire to be seen as being believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here. What plot ?? People looking for a plot must cope with their heads. Keep scratching !! This movie is not about PLOT! One could compare this to a Mel Brooks movie; Only without the Hollywood parody party that Mel always threw. I also see a little bit of Monty Python in this. By the way: This movie was shot before Monty had debuted on the BBC !!! <br /> <br /> I notice that Gags and Lines, which are dead dead hilarious. DO NOT transfer well to mouth. You should see them within the scope of the movie. There are some flaws in the movie; But even the errors are unique. For example: Actors often repeat the same line over and over again; and somehow it works. How Many Syllables Mario? Putney says Borman Six girl has got soul! etc ... <br /> <br /> B / W photography is excellent. Sound / Score is even better! Editing is only so bad. The action is above average. The script is invaluable. The jokes are like un-pc that you can get: MR. Bad News says, "Sonny Williams has just been caught in a motel with a 13-year-old girl." Putney says, "At least he's not superstitious". Uptight Conservative Beware. The anti-establishment mindset of this movie will drive you straight out of space. Nothing is sacred. <br /> <br /> There are many things to do with this movie today: SMOKING! Reverse Racism; with African Americans who treat Caucasians as a garbage can. Treating mass media over the masses; Madison Avenue, Deroit, Hollywood intentionally pedal anything that any 8-year-old can tell is pure waste; Internet, I'm talking about the "drum"; Interracial dating; I could go on and on .... I should also mention that there are approx. 8 min of this film shot in 16 mm color. These are the advertisements shot by Putney's agency. The spots work pretty well the first time. They become tedious, however, by repeated views. The real magic here is within the movie's B / W sections. These are the non-scenic lines they remain with you: "Hire yourself a short Schmuck". "I love you, I love you, I love you ... did you take your pill?". "All I have to say would just be superfluous". And a lot of others. I also like the bit with the mounted shelf on the wall: "The game's creator wanted me to throw it back ... I made such a fight, I decided to have it mounted!" <br /> <br /> Standouts in the throw include Buddy Buttler as Putney Bodyguard # 1. He should have been a much bigger star. Antonio Fargas as the Arab. He went on to stardom on television and in movies. Arnold Johnson has the right look as Putney Swoope. Robert Downey used his own voice instead of Arnold not remembering some of his lines. Downey also realized that he could fill in further dialogue / jokes later if he called his lead actor. <br /> <br /> The movie has some flaws. Short term time is one. I want the start of the white board members to have been extended. Stan Gotlieb and Allen Garfield are excellent. The final stitches have been thrown together as if he just couldn't think of more gags. All in all, this is one of the best low-budget movies of the time. A time when very few indys are played outside of New York, Chicago, San Francisco and L.A. Anyone who loves satire and comedy should see this at least twice. Downey's Putney Swoope is ahead and beyond that time.
