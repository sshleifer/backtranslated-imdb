I had been interested in this movie for a long time, especially after reading a few online reviews of the DVD edition; But I stopped replacing my purchase because of the excessive price tag and complete lack of relevant supplements. As it went out of print earlier this year, I finally gave up - but the entire order (which included a number of other highly desirable titles) was lost in transit! Fortunately, the DVD has been re-issued at bargain price - and I'm sure I picked it up! <br /> <br /> Still, it's a weird movie and a real sleeper: initially confusing but strikingly occult narrative that manages to hit bullseye with regard to both its banned atmosphere in small towns and the intransigence of outrageous disgrace -on. A small casting responds perfectly to a sharp, absorbent and intelligent script: mainstream Martin especially makes the dialogue better than it actually is with his sophisticated performance as the witch's chief consultant / leader L.Q. Jones and Alvy Moore (who both produced the movie!) Offer solid support such as the non-nonsense sheriff and his comic-strip aficionado assistant. <br /> <br /> The plot merges elements from various previous films dealing with witchcraft and the supernatural and not just the obvious titles: That the city is kept under a spelling that cannot be first identified, immediately brings to mind in the same honor for a particular bourgeois household in Luis Bunuel's sublime surrealistic EXTERMINATION ANGEL (1962)! The angle of the "possessed child" might have been borrowed from DAMNEDS VILLAGE (1960); there have been many films - especially of a recent vintage - where the satanic rites of a witch association are shown: from THE DEADS CITY (1960) to the DEVILEN RIDER OUT (1968), but since the procedure takes place in modern-day america (albeit in remote surroundings ) and is about older witches (seeking a 'renaissance'), the movie they are most fond of is ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968). The occult scenes (accentuated as much of the foggy exterior as by the shady illumination of the garishly-decorated house where the diabolic events take place) are presented in a quite objective manner to make them disturbing and extremely effective - especially the opening sequence involving a hero's crushing a car (!), a devil's rampage (a concept that has been killed over the years, but here it raises an undeniable frisson), a surreal dream sequence (set inside the ice chamber where all the victims are kept as they are not can be buried!), a sequence in which the witches attack a doubting member of the cove, a hiring committed by a knight medieval knight (!) and the long 'black mass' finale (with the witches, accompanied by the respective child, they will "take over" all dressed in red - except for a black-dressed Martin presiding over the ceremony) culminating in ritual killings suicide! <br /> <br /> The movie also has the courage to deliver a downbeat 'curtain'; It's so refreshing to come across a title (albeit low-budget production) from a major Hollywood studio, Columbia, which is about to go so completely against the grain (as I said the movie is quite strange - also for editing and score)! It is also odd that such a classic - and cinematic - horror offer {sic} should come from a television director most often associated with Western and other family fares! By the way, the same theme was dealt with almost simultaneously in the ninth Christopher Lee / Peter Cushing collaboration NIGHT BUT NIGHT (1972; as Lee produced himself!) - a movie I badly missed in 20 years back when it appeared on local TV and who has been MIA ever since !! <br /> <br /> P.S. This review of Satan's embroidery will certainly include spoilers, but it is clear that the synopsis and artwork on the DVD cover gives away everything anyway!
