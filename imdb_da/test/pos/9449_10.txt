This is a classic American movie in combination with comedy, romance and dream. you might say, "There have already been many of these kinds of movies, but just believe me, you find this good because it is well-targeted, scripted and played. Amanda Bynes is just amazing! She is humor, sweet and charming both inside and outside the screen she is really MAN !!! The message I get from it is to pursue your own adventure.What I mean by 'dairy story' is not the one with prince and princess, but indicates 'belief'. namely, it tells us to keep your beliefs, dreams and things that honor you for your whole life if you don't, one of those movies you can't miss in your life.
