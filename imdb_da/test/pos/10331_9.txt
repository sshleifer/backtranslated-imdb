This film should have easily qualified as a movie <br /> <br /> that best promotes human understanding among humans. Trying to understand that a young Jewish southern girl might be suffering from a buried German prisoner of war can be quite annoying. <br /> <br /> Kristy McNichol depicts a stunning portrait of the unhappy, young girl who dares to accept and love. Michael Constantine gave a remarkable performance as his hard father and Esther Rolle, when the girl Ruth gave an excellent Emmy winning performance as an understanding girl who was hit by these events. Bruce Davison portrays the German who is allegedly not guilty of Nazi atrocities. This is how his role looks. He has fled, but he joined the German army and he could have been a member of Hitler's youth movement. The action takes place in 1944 Georgia, in a rural area. The cities are full of prejudices. Even the FBI inspector acts as if he wants something on the Jews. Note the opposite interpretation that when McNichol is in bed, Davison is being chased and eventually shot. It is interesting to see that society sees McNichol as a traitor to house a scattered prisoner of war. The film also deals with an extremely complex relationship that exists between father and daughter. Constantine's outburst with his daughter at the end is some play. As the mother Barbara Barrie gets a little to do. It was annoying that she is stereotyped as the typical Jewish mother with the high shadow of lipstick on her lips. <br /> <br /> Memorably done and worth seeing.
