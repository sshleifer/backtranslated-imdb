The true life story of perhaps the greatest football game the game has ever known. Knute Rockne led the football game out of the "Stone Age" with innovations such as forward and offensive formation shifts. But he is probably best known for his motivational cupboards. Along the way, he brought fame and honor to a small, small, unknown Catholic school in Indiana. Pat O'Brien is incomparable in his role as rock. Terrific cast that includes Ronald Reagan, which gives a fantastic performance like Notre Dame's first true superstar, George Gipp. For football aficionados, this is the greatest football movie ever made. Do yourself a favor and rent the black and white version. (Some versions have deleted scenes for some reason) If you have the good version, look for a short como of the immortal Jim Thorpe as he holds the head in the closet that tells Rockne and the team they only have minutes left before the second half begins.
