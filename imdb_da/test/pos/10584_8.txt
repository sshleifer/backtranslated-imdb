I bought this movie just to see Bam because I really loved him, but after seeing this, I don't like him much. I mean, his plays were good and all I guess, but when it showed the totally unnecessary skate scenes, I just said to myself: "Okay, we know you're a professional skateboarder, now we can come back to Ryan Dunn? " Dunn, Rake and Brandon really made the film in my perspective. I noticed that Jenn Rivell (of course) and Missy Rothstein were both in Haggard, but who Bam was there at the time? Anyways, I actually enjoyed Haggard, and I think it's really like no other movie I've ever seen. It's kind of in its own category.
