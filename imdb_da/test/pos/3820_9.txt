I caught this show a couple of times when I was young and the played tilt, my parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and the twilight zone (new and old) could not do. This show used some old ideas and some really original ideas. <br /> <br /> I still can't believe Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright did this. These guys were manufacturers of stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience rooted in history and set a really scary atmosphere. This was what was not there in the new twilight zone. Rod serling comes in added to the scariness, forest comes in brighter mood. <br /> <br /> The end of whether it's good or badly made for a daunting time. You could never predict what would happen. I'm still trying to find the seasons on DVD.
