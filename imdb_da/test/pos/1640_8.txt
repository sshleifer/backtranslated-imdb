FBI Agents Mulder and Scully are awarded the mystery of what happened to an Arctic drilling team, in this early 'X-Files' episode, that David Duchovny himself considers one of their first rockin episodes. It pays to pay tribute to the much welcomed John Carpenter 1982 theater function "The Thing", and one can see the similarities. Visually combines colors and lighting schemes to give story a hell of quality. The production design / art direction is particularly impressive; The shots from the Arctic tenant's exterior are reminiscent of the previous film so they automatically create feelings of deja vu for some viewers. Of course, our heroes are threatened by the weather, so the sound design that involves the wind evokes memories of "The Thing". The blame is an old worm that had been exposed to the team; Once within a host, it stimulates aggressive behavior. This allows the paranoia aspect to take full hold and the way the script is created, we can not be too sure about who is infected and who is not. This gives rise to the inevitable test site. This episode certainly works out the way that tensions can cause collapse in groups. It even allows Mulder and Scully to have moments where they are not sure whether they can trust each other. <br /> <br /> Guest stars are a good small group of actors: Xander Berkeley, Felicity Huffman and Steve Hytner as the researchers committed to accompany Mulder and Scully on the mission, and Jeff Kober as a pilot leading them to the camp. You can also see Jason Voorhees portrait Ken Kirzinger once as one of the fake original team members. <br /> <br /> There is also a direct connection between 'Ice' and 'The Thing': art director Graeme Murray, who worked on both projects. <br /> <br /> 8/10
