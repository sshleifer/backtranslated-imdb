After watching this movie years ago, it never became scared of my memory. I always thought this was Michelle Pfeiffer's finest performance I've seen. But I'm surprised by the number of negative reviews this movie has received. Having seen it yet again today, I still think it is powerful, moving and cannot fit less if it is "solved on King Lear". I am now aware that this is the greatest achievement by Jessica Lange I have ever seen - and she has been congratulated on much lower efforts. A thousand acres are complex, human, vivid and immensely moving, but do not give any of the primary female leads with any touch of glamor or "sexiness". I don't think it's well received in these times. One of the reasons for this film's devastating reaction lies in the fact that the author (Jane Smiley (acting (Laura Jones) and director (Jocelhyn Moorehouse) are all women. I know that in my younger days I would not have read a book written by a Woman, I didn't focus on this fact until years later. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie or given it a chance in the past, try to see it again, maybe you're ready for it.
