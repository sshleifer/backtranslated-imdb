Don't know what movie or version Jeff saw, but this whole movie was great, not just Poitier and Going. The story was nit, exciting and engaging. And for the guy who complains about historical accuracy, becomes real. Yes, there were some black substitutes in the Indian area, but they had no authority to arrest white outside Indian territory. As a rule, they did not "patrol", but exercised only warrants on criminals. I found it strange that Corby didn't seem to have any Indian friends. I know their numbers were smaller, but it still seems strange to me. Even when Corby returned to his people, his Indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless.
