Digging robber sitting in his cell pending execution is visited by a monk who wants to lay down his last words for posterity and as a warning to others about the terrible life he is leading. First, reluctantly, but with the tongue loosened by drink, the young grave lover soon tells his story, which is full of the dead, undead, and things that break in the night. <br /> <br /> New York-lined horror movies (which are partly recorded on Staten Island, which undoubtedly brought Andy Milligan's spirit and wonder) are one of the better horror commands to come around for a while. This is an often very fun movie that just spins its story out in every way. The cast is first rate. Dominic Monaghan plays Arthur Blake, the tomb robber who tells his story. Ron perlman is father duffy monk taking the statement and perhaps becoming too involved in the story. Both men clearly have a great old age, and it shows. The rest of the casting is just as good. The music of Jeff Grace is excellent. The effects are perfect for this kind of ghoulish silliness. The movie is a lot of fun. If there are any problems with the movie, it may be that it throws its net a bit wide so the result has far too much to anticipate. I don't want to give too much away, but I don't think we needed the foreign body in the mix. Still, it's very fun, and I'm absolutely sure I will visit the IFC in theaters where I saw it for the first time, and later I'm sure I'll download the DVD. <Br /> <br /> Worth to see.
