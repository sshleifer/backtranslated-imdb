I recently submitted IMDb to this series, and gave a snail mail address to the commercial arm of BBD, where you would write for appeal. I wrote to that address and mentioned Sam Waterson and his popularity prominently. I just received the following answer: <br /> <br /> From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14, 2006 13:44:00 PMT To: kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br /> Dear Kate, <br /> <br /> I work for BBFC, the British are similar to MPAA, and we classify DVDs and videos as well as movies in this country. Anyway, I'm currently giving a 1980 miniseries certificate "Oppenheimer." During the study of the work on IMDb I noticed your post and thought you might want to know that the work is being released (hence the need for a certificate). <br /> <br /> I don't know which company distributes it but keep your eyes peeled! <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Emily +++++++++++++++++ <br /> <br /> HÃ¸ray! <br /> <br /> I will also contact Netflix re to purchase this. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew <br /> <br /> kk2840@earthlink.net I recently emailed the BBC about whether their amazing series Oppenheimer had ever been released on video or DVD. I couldn't find it. I received the following answer. If you write the BBC, make sure to mention that Sam Waterston is very popular in the United States. You can also enter "Oppenheimer (1980)" on amazon.com and find a box to check to request the release of the owner (BBC) and be notified when it is released. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br /> Here's the answer from the BBC: <br /> <br /> Dear Kate <br /> <br /> Thank you e-mail regarding 'Oppenheimer'. <br /> <br /> I was interested in reading that you would like a copy of this program that you have had. I've checked the BBC Shop and online stores and can't find a record of it's availability. We are unaware of plans for the moment to release this program on DVD. But if you'd like to make a suggestion, I suggest you put it in writing to the BBC Trade Arm: <br /> <br /> Editor-in-Office BBC Worldwide Ltd Woodlands 80 Wood Lane London W12 0TT <br /> <br /> May I thank you again for taking the time to contact the BBC. Greeting <br /> <br /> BBC Information ______________________________________ <br /> - ---- Original Message ----- <br /> <br /> {Comments:} I'm trying to find a copy of the amazing BBC production "Oppenheimer", a six-part series made in 1980 with Sam Waterston from a book / script by Peter Prince. I saw parts of it at PBS American Playhouse, but can't find it on video anywhere. <br /> <br /> http://www.bbc.co.uk/
