Tia Carrere was the reason why I decided to watch this movie because neither the title nor the front page would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this movie ?? which shows that I and everyone that a DVD should not be judged by that coverage. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** The movie felt it was trundling together, not really going anywhere at the moment ?? Paul Faber's plague (Zak Orth) that girls are almost too embarrassing to look at, and the fringes of the otherwise attractive Kirsten Beck (like Alexondra Lee) are for school-happy to see. Where they really fashionable in 1995? The relationship between Vicky Mueller (Tia Carrere) and Todd Boomer (Jason London) was exciting from the start! The first meeting across the lake ?? magical. What a beautiful coincidence they have to meet again, just as he behaved like a complete moron ("Boomer, with two O's as in Moron ??") in front of Alexondra. It was a shame that we, as the audience, knew who Vicky Mueller really was. (Well? The title gave it away, wouldn't you think?) What really surprised me was the actor. Especially in the scene where Vicky gives Todd a metal version of his alter-ego (the dog character), in the little white jewelry box. The actors really managed to recreate the tingling sensation of a first kiss? Point of no return for Todd and Vicky. It's a shame that the film ends up focusing on (after getting over Todd's father's Harvard drive) his reunion with his friends. I could imagine a whole new movie ?? follows Vicky to New York ?? There must be a good art university where Todd could participate?! <br /> <br /> Nonetheless, a movie that does what we want Hollywood is: entertaining us in the movie's duration. Have others noticed how none of the love is in this movie? Todd's mother is a little crazy (on phone 24/7), his father does not find her attractive (more?) Todd's teacher is, of course, dissatisfied with his wife and vice versa ?? Todd himself goes into a wonderfully erotic and bold relationship, which, however, can very well be very difficult to maintain (age difference, maturity difference, etc.), and Alexondra & Zak do not gather because Alexondra is not mature enough to handle a relationship (- > Her reactions to condom, cheating, Zak's progress, etc. are all very immature and often involve running away, and Zak himself the poor guy ?? is too much of a best friend / as a brother-guy to even draw Alexondra. <br /> <br /> Remember yourself, good movie! I gave it an 8/10. Brilliant performance by the actors - bringing the manuscript to life.
