Simply put, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable. The film is less about the raw science of Darwin's faith and focuses heavily on his relationship with his family, primarily his wife Emma and daughter Annie. <br /> <br /> Toby Jones gives a wonderful trip like Thomas Huxley, the great defender of Darwin's beliefs, and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with Bettany and Connelly. <br /> <br /> But these are the two who carry the movie. Their real chemistry is evident from the beginning to the end, but develops transcendence as Darwin grapples with his demons. The scene where Darwin relates to the end of the story of Jenny, the orangutan, to his dying daughter, Annie, is utterly poignant. The world premiere audience at TIFF was spellbound. Bettany's performance will be recognized as one of the best in the year in short order. Just as magnificent is Connelly's work playing a religious wife to a man who, in Huxley's words, "killed God". <br /> <br /> The movie moves slowly throughout the spectrum of Darwin's grief and recreates every detail of Bettany and Connelly's plays. <br /> <br /> Brilliant.
