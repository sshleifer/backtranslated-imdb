I can't see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor. You have to get your head out of your tight ass if you don't find this movie fun! If this is not your "cup of tea," so to speak, look at it for what it really is - a marvelous fun movie. Maybe they set out to make another medicine / T&A film, but in this case they really hit the spot. It is especially fun for Ali G fans because he delivers everything we will love and expect from him. Then I say BIG UPS to Ali G, and if it's not your thing, don't whine-BATTY BOY!
