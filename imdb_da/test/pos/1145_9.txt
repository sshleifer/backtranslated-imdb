The wind and the lion are a fantastic sweeping film. It is a monument to what filmmaking was once, but is no longer. Connery, despite the thick Scottish brogue, plays Raisulu very well. He inspires the viewer in a way that many leading characters cannot. <br /> <br /> In one of her early roles, Candice Bergen is wonderful as the kidnapped socialite Mrs. Pedacaris, showing courage in adversity (and plenty of humor too). A great movie, rent or buy it, and you won't be disappointed.
