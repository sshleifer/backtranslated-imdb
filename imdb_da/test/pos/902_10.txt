I have a vacation in Hong Kong now and I've just seen geny cops in the cinema .... what can I say ... it was so cool! <br /> <br /> Everything you could want was in it! Basically ... just see it if you can ... I'll get my friend to send me vcd when it comes out .... Only bad was the dodgy American style spokesman employed by some of the hl actors .. Like Edison ... "What's my husband?" but it added even more humor to you ... hehe <br /> <br /> See it ... especially if you like any of the following genes: hd movies, action, comedy, sci fi! SEEITMAN !! Edison made a good song for that too ... so download it ... Edison Tse - Heroes
