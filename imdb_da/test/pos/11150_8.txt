I am really surprised that this movie only has a rating of 6.4 from the time I made this review. Though it is not a great movie, I think it is one of the best films that Dietrich did, and it is a shame it is not considered highly. I think many of the reasons I liked the movie so much are that the usual stupid Dietrich persona like "über-vamp" is not present and her role required her to actually act. I just hate to watch movies by movie after movie in the early days of her career, where she seemed more like a caricature or cliché than a real woman. I don't necessarily blame Dietrich for the silly vampire films she made in the 1930s - the audience loved them and they made her famous. But here she showed that she really could act. Just think of her in movies like MOROCCO, BLONDE VENUS, and BLUE ANGEL who would have guessed she was thrown to play a gypsy! I was quite ready to hate the movie because of this cast decision but it worked - she was pretty trustworthy and also very fun to watch! The film is essentially a vehicle just like Ray Milland and Marlene Dietrich - the other supporting characters are very secondary to the movie. Milland is a sought-after spy in pre-WWII Germany and, in his efforts to escape, he stumbles on a rather mad lone gypsy (Dietrich) who immediately takes him to be a fulfillment of prophecy - in other words, her new lover! Milland is quite stuffy, but reluctantly accepts to travel in his cart - even put on body paint and pierce his ears to make him look like a gypsy (hence the title of the movie). Gradually, he slowly begins to realize that under her very invisible exterior, a woman and romance are slowly blooming. <br /> <br /> The movie in a word is "charming". A lovely romance with a good dose of comedy and fun - just the kind of picture you want Hollywood to still do. Also pay attention to Murvyn Vye's performance as "Zoltan". He was very magnetic in the short time he was filming, and I just loved his deep and beautiful voice. Finally, a sad note to consider. While the film is set in Germany, there is no mention of the upcoming gypsy Holocaust. During the war, throughout the German territory, the Nazis exterminated a large percentage of gypsies and then the final lovely end to the film is a bit colored.
