Obviously, the value of the film far exceeds the price that the format (mini-dv) implies. In fact, the filmmaker includes the format and incorporates it so beautifully into the story that I forgot that I did not see the typical 35 millimeter film. It has the core appeal of indie films such as Clerks & Robert Rodriguez's work combined with a fantastic "new take" on the romantic comedy genre. "This is not a movie" is an honest movie with honest portrayals, and it's a great pace story. There is no point in this movie where I felt that a scene could have (or should have) been omitted. On the contrary, the director draws amazing performances from truly gifted actors and does so under extremely restrictive circumstances. From film to side, this film is a worthy and relevant story that hits so many levels (creatively, technically or otherwise). I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys cinema or those looking for a little charm in an otherwise devoid of charm medium.
