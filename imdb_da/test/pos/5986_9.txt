I would not compare it to Le Placard, which IMHO had several comic moments, but Romuald & Juliette was also a slow starter and it was definitely your attention throughout the movie, nicely paced and reached a warm warming conclusion :) There were many amazing comic moments, some brilliant pathos and realistic situation that works by all actors. <br /> <br /> It was a typical French movie confronting prejudices and phobias, which in turn made the viewer his own shortcomings! I am happy to have this in my library and will no doubt see it again and again, which to me is a sign of a great movie.
