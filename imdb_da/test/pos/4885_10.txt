Now I myself had previously seen a few episodes of Gentleman's Leauge, which I found hilarious. When I brought the movie I wasn't sure if I knew enough about the series to get it, boy was I wrong. This is one of the best comedy movies I've ever seen, and the wise act of Leauge makes the movie. It has a very good and fun plot as well as spending only a few signs at a time helps because it doesn't make it too confusing that would have destroyed the movie. Even if you've never seen The Leauge of Gentleman get this movie, it will make you laugh and it's a movie that can be seen more than once and is a great movie to watch with your friends. It really deserves to go through a certain 10 out of 10.
