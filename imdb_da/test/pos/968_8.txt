Big Fat Liar is a good look at children of all ages, even adults. I had a good time watching this movie and recommending it to children aged 10 and under. It never laughs and the adventurous plot is good too! Frankie Muniz is fun and Marty Wolfe is fun! All in all, a nicely made movie for kids to enjoy and just have a good time.
