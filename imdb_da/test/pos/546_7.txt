This movie is about a single mother who is happy, lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible, and her sensible teenage daughter who is under adolescent turmoil. <br /> <br /> "Anywhere But Here" is an exciting movie from beginning to end. Both Ann and Adele are well described from the start, so we learn to know how different their personalities are. Clashes inevitably happen and they are presented engagingly. I find myself so drawn to their state of mind and their circumstances. It is as if I live their lives and feel what they feel. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon gives another great achievement in "Anywhere But Here". She is charismatic, happy, fortunate, hedonistic, warm and loving at once. I've always wanted Susan Sarandon, and I think she's grossly undervalued. <br /> <br /> "Anywhere But Here" is a captivating emotional journey.
