I personally have a soft spot for horror movies set in hospitals and asylum so I had a good sense of seeing this "Don't look in the basement" even though its reputation is doubtful. Now I was right! This is great, spooky entertainment with a couple of effective shocks and wonderfully absurd characters. Of course, you have to look beyond the poor production values ​​and the completely illogical plot, but if you do it (and if you're a fan of this type of scare, it's a crucial quality), you're rewarded with a monstrous "video-uncomfortable "where blood and insanity are the main elements. The young and sweet nurse Charlotte arrives at a remote sanitarium where she should start her new job. She finds out that the doctor who hired her was killed by a patient and the replacement doctors-in-charge Masters seem reluctant to accept the new arrival. Life inside the sanitary is quite peculiar, with the patients running free and each door being unlocked. After a whole series of bizarre events, Charlotte discovers the horrible secrets hidden by the institution .... The opening 10 minutes (pre-credits) is great, and that's the awful climax. Everything in between is largely without surprise or excitement, but you are patiently waiting because you just feel that the final will be wildly fun. Asylum patients are textbook tax, but I love them anyway. Some of my favorites include the former judge (who still speaks solely in legal terms), the suspicious army of Sargeant and the crazy old lady. "Don't look in the basement" is great low-qualified fun, especially recommended for fans of 70's trash, sick puppies and other types of foam. Lunatics have taken over asylum, yes !!
