I LOVED this movie. You can't buy it, rent it or find it ... but it's a keeper. Great chemistry between Braccho and Walken ... and Ferrar .... <br /> <br /> Fantastic non stop action and reactions .... loved it. <br /> <br /> I've seen my piracy maybe 6 times in the last decade ... every time it shows to someone who has never heard of it. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and watch it. <br /> <br /> So many movies are on television over and over again - without the style and style of this little movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't know it was made for television. .. my copy is an 8 track I pirated years ago ... I hope it lasts.
