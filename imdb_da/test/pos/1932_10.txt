This is an account of events that have been covered several times and I had read two books - 'A Voyage for Madmen' and 'The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst' - before we watched the film in Sheffield just before Christmas. I must say it exceeded all expectations in its 1968 Sunday Times Golden Globe yacht race. These men set out to do something that was never done before without support vessels, wooden boats, no satellite phones, no GPS and just their wits and skills to get them around the globe in one piece. Not to mention the one-sided months, the thundering southern sea, some sleep and boats that often literally fall apart around them. <br /> <br /> This documentary is perfectly composed in my opinion, closely edited, well-paced with great narration. Films and interviews are fascinating and bring the story to life. Clare Crowhurst's interview film is especially revealing and moving as she relates the events that led to her husband, Donald Crowhurst's departure from Teignmouth, doubts and fears in his mind and her reaction as subsequent events unfolded. <br /> <br /> I was moved and even ran a tear or two when the credits began rolling and overheard other people expressing similar feelings. The two books I mentioned above are useful for more detail and back story that could not have been mounted in the 90 minutes and I would also recommend them. <br /> <br /> This is ultimately a true story of human courage and human fragility. One must look for anyone interested in sailing, adventure, human efforts and real heroes.
