Many consider BEAST STABLE to be the last of the "true" FEMALE PRISON films, as it is the last of the series directed by Shunya Ito, and is followed by another movie (GRUDGE SONG) by another director. I haven't seen GRUDGE SONG yet (but soon ...) so I don't know how it stacks up to the previous FP movies - but it will be interesting to see. The way BEAST STABLE ended did not leave much room for another predecessor - but I think I find out ... <br /> <br /> This post has Scorpion on the run from the police, where she hooks up with a street hooker who ends up getting pregnant with her late-born brothers (oh yes - it's no lie ... should love these shabby story lines). Scorpion ends up being kidnapped by an old rival, but (as she's so good at ...) end up fleeing and avenging some people who polluted some of her girlfriends ... <br /> <br /> I Agree with some other reviewers that this is a bit slower in points and more "serious" than the two previous posts. The story is somewhat confusing and overdue at times, but many of these 70's era-pinky movies are - and I still love them. BEAST STABLE is badly lacking in the nudity area, which was rather disappointing - but I believed it strongly in other areas - history, filmography, something good sleaze etc ... It is definitely worth fans of this kind of thing or who have enjoyed the others FEMALE PRISON films ... 8/10
