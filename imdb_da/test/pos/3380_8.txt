I just watched this movie on the leading night out of curiosity and pure nostalgia. I liked (not loved) "Mork & Mindy" as a child, mostly for Robin Williams zany's energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show good? Not really, but Robin was determined. Which brings me to this movie. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by the number chronological representation of the show (which in a way it was). But of course, the right focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robin's journey from fighting for thrill to national tv star and how such a drastic difference struck him and his long-suffering wife. And my hat is off to star Chris Diamantopoulos when he portrayed Mr. Williams with integrity, sensitivity and heart; not just a sweet impression, even if it was even dead. (On an independent note, I noticed that Robin's battles in some way resembled Andy Kaufman, who was underwritten by the network TV and kept creative back, but it is "Taxi" behind the scene biopic.) <br /> <All in all, this was a very pleasant flick, where I felt that I was told a little more of the man behind the hurricane. The play was solid yet melodramatic as I suspected - and the story went well together. Performances that were particularly good were those that played Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene where Belushi heckles Robin was a hoot!). Not a great masterpiece in any way (I'd like to have seen a bit more about Pam Dawber), but certainly tough, especially for the Robin Williams and "Mork & Mindy" fans out there. Nanoo, nanoo!
