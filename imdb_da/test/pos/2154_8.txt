I saw this amazing documentary at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. It is extremely absorbent and very well designed and draws you into Harry Nilsson's life and career, one of the most overlooked musical talents from the 1960s and 70s. While I was familiar with his better known compositions ("One is the loneliest number", "Without You"), I learned about this man's brilliant writing and beautiful song. If you love music, you'll find plenty to pull yourself into his world, which unfortunately sprouted out of control as his success grew and his past haunted him. But sad, he was still devoted to his family anyway, and you will find yourself so happy to have met this man. The profile is effectively told through Nilsson's own words and those of his friends and colleagues (a virtual Who's Who of Rock) who loved and respected him. Don't miss this!
