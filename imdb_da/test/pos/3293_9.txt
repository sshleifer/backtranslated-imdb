This story has had a special place in my heart for the past 31 years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and desert. Books like "Call of the Wild", "White Fang", "The Frontiersman" and "My Side of the Mountain" have affected me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountaineer, but nothing inspired me more to do it than when I watched this movie on TV in 1975. I would be like "Stairs". But when I got older I found that I was just too domesticated to live that way. Nevertheless, I still romanticize living that kind of life. I agree with some other reviews of this movie that the story has the simplicity that is quite widespread in "Disneyisque" -type movies, but if you can see past the mechanics where it was made and see the heart of history, the true themes are Then I think you will find yourself pleasantly touched. I make it a point to watch this movie once a year. After thirty-three years, I still get a chill running through me when I see the thrill of the snow rushing down the hillside and hear the tragic echo, scary laughter. <br /> <br /> PS-> <br /> PS To read more about the true story, I found this link on Mad Trapper of Rat River: <br /> <br /> http : //www.mysteriesofcanada .com / NWT / madtrapper.htm
