In a previous comment, I mentioned how much I enjoyed this movie - better the second time. I do not resell this opinion. Strangely, I can't find anyone else who liked it. <br /> <br /> My mother should see it, but several friends told her "No Way". My sister and her family saw it and half of the theater went out of the way. <br /> <br /> My wife's suggestion is that Australians see the signs as just normal, everyday Americans, and that's why it's not fun. But hey, most Americans think all Australians are like Crocodile Dundee, so it's nice to have the boot on the other foot for a change.
