Farscape - is the only Sci-Fi Show that restarted the interest in science fiction in me. <br /> <br /> But Farscape is so much more than plain and simple Sci-Fi. Comedy, Drama and much more :) The acting is very good. Fortunately, Farscape survived that it was canceled and showed with Peacekeeper Wars that it is not dead yet :) I hope there is a future for Farscape :) In my opinion, it is also not problematic that some of the characters in the Show are muppets. You have to look behind it and you will see what a beauty Farscape is. <br /> <br /> Farscape set a new standard in television, and I think it will be really hard for new shows to prove that they can be just or better than Farscape. I love this show :) <br /> <br /> SaphirJD
