Better than I expected from a movie sold out of nymphomania and inter racial bondage. The music is amazing, and cinematography is very much focused on turning Ricci into a trailer trash Betty Paige, and it works. Samuel L. gets to shout a lot as he is good at, and play lots of blues guitar, which he looks cool to do. Even Justin Timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed girlfriend. I get the feeling that this material underneath everyone else would have been complete s *% #, but instead only managed to build it out its own odd little transgressive pulp niche while still being an effective drama.
