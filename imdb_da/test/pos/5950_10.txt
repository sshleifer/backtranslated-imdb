This is the latest entry into the long series of films by the French agent, O.S.S. 117 (the French response to James Bond). The series was launched in the early 1950s and formed at least eight films (none of which were ever released in the United States). 'O.S.117: Cairo, Nest Of Spies' is a breezy little comedy that should not ... repeat NOT, be taken too seriously. Our protagonist finds himself in the midst of a spy hunt in Egypt (with Morroco making himself Egypt) to find out about a long lost friend. The following is the standard James Bond / Inspector Cloussou kind of antics. Although our husband is something of an overtly xenophobic, sexist, homophobe, it is treated as pure farce (as I said, don't take it too seriously). Although there is a little rough language and comic violence, it is pretty much okay for older children (age 12 and over). As mentioned earlier in the subject line, just sit back, send popcorn and just enjoy.
