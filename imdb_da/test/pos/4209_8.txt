A beautiful movie. John Garfield's character is a distant relationship with "Les Miserables" Jean Valjean, while Detective Rains recalls Victor Hugo's Javert, the ruthless law arm. <br /> <br /> As in many film noirs, the city embodies evil, while the land and nature represent sanctuary, redemption and another chance for those whose lives are long-judged. But even in the bright daylight, danger can suddenly occur, as the excellent scene at the reservoir shows. John Garfield an actor who, as Leonard Maltin points out, should be rediscovered: I have never been disappointed with any of his films except his supportive part in the "gentleman's agreement", but it was not his fault - giving a heartfelt sensitive performance and the audience's pages with him as soon as he is unfairly accused (the first sequence shows a rather eerie hypocrite person, but all his trials redeem him and how do we feel him during the last scenes of detective Rains.Colorful characters (grandmother and kids) add mass joie de vivre, which is necessary Humor is also present in strip poker games like Dead End brats fleece a rich kid. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
