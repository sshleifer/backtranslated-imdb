This was a really interesting Halloween movie. I wasn't thrilled with the whole Thorn theory, but it still makes a good movie. I liked coming back to see Tommy Doyle back, but unfortunately Donald Pleasance died just after the shot. The movie had a really really bad instructor who didn't give a flip about the series, from what I heard treated Donald badly, and wouldn't let Danielle Harris come back like Jamie. It was as if he was just trying to bring the movie down, but I liked it. There were many cuts and music changes, and if you're lucky, you can get Producers Cut, which includes over 40 mins. of never before scenes. With these scenes, it becomes a brand new movie. Check it out if you have the chance.
