I love love love this show. Whether you say it is because I am crazy in the brain or not. I think this show is very fun and entertaining, though sometimes Bam's uncle Vito scares me .. so all in all I give this show a perfect review. And then I really think if you're in the "omg .. what an idiot" kind of humor, this show is for you. It is great fun to see the look of the prank people's faces, and there are many musical guests coming to Bam's house. Buy this cause for that rock! You should buy it. Yes. And Bams brother is in the band CKY and they are really good and sometimes come on the show. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is .. Please see the show.
