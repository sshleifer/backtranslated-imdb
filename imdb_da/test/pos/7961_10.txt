The last time I checked in here, I think there was no more than one comment. I'm very happy that more people have caught on this flick now, and even more so about you all digging it too. I caught this Christmas Eve 2004, and I didn't find myself able to change the channel on my TV, even though it was an Asian girl - and unfortunately, but I'm really used to not giving any chance to any Off-Hollywood product. I did that night, and I thank God deeply for it. I have not been able to shake that movie out of my system since - not what I have tried or wanted - and it still surprises me - in an extremely grateful way - that such a great, beautiful experience came in such a way totally unexpected, like a Christmas miracle. If you have the chance, watch this movie, buy it or rent it from bootleg it or whatever, but watch it. I guarantee it will affect you. I'm out of time, but I'm far from finished my rating here, so I'm back as soon as I can.
