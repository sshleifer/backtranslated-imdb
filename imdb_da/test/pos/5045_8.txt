"Autumn Spring" tells of a brave, walrus's misadventures, 78 (about) year-old Czech man who is eerily befuddled and mocked everyone who knows him with his evil ways, while his wife carefully plans his funeral. Centerpiece Hana (Brodsk√Ω) shows us how to get babies to kiss you when your 78 and how to get a feel in a lift and are thanked for it as he pranks his way from day to day in this warm and glowing look on old age and a man's creative, fun, but socially unacceptable ways to enjoy life while refusing to be referred to the old people's home. "Autumn Spring" is a plodding, subtle comedy with messages for all ages that will have the greatest appeal with more mature foreign movie buffs. (B +)
