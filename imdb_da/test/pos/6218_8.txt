My favorite story from 'the crypt stories'. Brion Jones was born to play the part of maniac lumberjack, ax swinging madman Steve Dixon.Having seen him before in Tango & Cash I can state that this actor never got the right credit he deserved. A jealous man takes insult in his wife, showing interest in a young young worker, he is just employed. And you know when Dixon finds out, hell is going to pay! The young worker Ted (Billy Wirth) receives an all-powerful blow from Dixon leaving him blind. How should a blind lumberjack work? A tribute to black humor if ever there was one! The co-stars are doing a good job of supporting Ted when Dixon has his original suspicions of his wife who wants another man. Dixon's behavior makes the bond stronger closer to the colleges. Only one declared that he was a changed man when he married. Though Ted should have made it wise and left when he could!
