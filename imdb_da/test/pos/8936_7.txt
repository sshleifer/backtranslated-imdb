Looking at "Plots with a View" (called "Undertaking Betty" in the US), I got the feeling that more films are needed in Wales. This one depicts a woman (Brenda Blethyn) in a small Welsh town trying to get away from her cheating man. So, she and the funeral director (Alfred Molina) come up with a plan ... but there are probably some errors along the way. <br /> <br /> I would actually say that Christopher Walken's character is the cutest in the movie (how could he not be?). But overall, the whole idea is just a really nice, stacked with some "uh oh" moments ... especially the haunted house scene. It's the kind of movie I want me to come in just to experience it. <br /> <br /> Also with Lee Evans, Naomi Watts and Miriam Margoyles.
