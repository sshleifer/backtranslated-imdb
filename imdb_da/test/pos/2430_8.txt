It is no doubt that the real Anna Anderson was not Princess Anastasia. Apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance (Anderson's eyes are apparently bigger, lips thicker, nose larger and screwed up at the end .... etc), Anderson couldn't speak Russian was a ridiculous story ...... It is therefore I detest Anna Anderson and her allies so much. Not many scammers have responsiveness and perseverance to fraud for 60+ years with such a blatant unsustainable arrangement. <br /> <br /> But to some extent, I have sympathy for Anna Anderson. Life must have been difficult for a young Polish farmer these days. And to imitate another woman for 60+ years is a difficult task for anyone. She had to keep her fleshy lips all the time to imitate Anastasia's thin lips and occasionally had to go lunatic to make people believe in all her chaotic memory just as a result of mental problems. <br /> <br /> Anna Anderson was a wonderful woman on a wrong track. Had she put her good looks, learned elegance, perseverance, action skills for proper use, she could make a first-class actress. <br /> <br /> On a page note: Some key figures in this two-party appear to be loosely based on real numbers. Prince Erich could be a mixture of Gleb Botkin (believed by many the most possible brains behind the whole scheme), Duke George and Dmitri of Leuchtenberg and several other characters. And Darya Romanoff seems to be based on the beautiful princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova. But unlike the true Confederates, Prince Erich was motive in this show and Anna supported out of love and sincere faith in her who touched. On the whole, this is a good show. Fictitious little, but remains faithful to reality. Amy Irving's performance is that she successfully represented Anderson's self-confidence, the mix of publishing others and being herself is exciting. Like Princess Xenia said about Anderson: "She was at all times herself and never gave the slightest impression of acting a lot." Highly recommended.
