I enjoy the folk song. I enjoy the folk song, if nothing but just before Midnight News, I imagine I play the cymbals in the band. Not as easy as you might think! One two three four; One two three four; But what then? So I sympathize with the practicing bass drum player in Roy Andersson's wonderful movie and patiently waiting for him to listen to a 70's cassette player. The motif of the 70s seems to continue all the time, with some classic soulless furniture. In addition, each scene has a creepy jade wash that emphasizes the small nuances of the most entertaining act. <br /> <br /> It brings me to Jessika Lundberg's excellent purple boots. Boots that would otherwise have inspired a Silk Cult advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> But it looked a bit tricky. Someone asked me what it was about. Well there is a scene where the opening line as "I don't have the length in green" Brilliant. Straight out of a Gary Larson carton. <br /> <br /> I can't say what it's all about. See for yourself. <br /> <br /> Ron Plasma <br /> <br /> Hmm. Larson! Sounds Swedish <br /> <br /> (set 15Apr08)
