A pretty enjoyable kidnapping caper in New Orleans, but the biggest downfall in my opinion is that it packs too much political intrigue and double crossing, and not enough of the sexy young actors, live-color scenes, original cinematographic style and biting humor. These aspects combine to provide refreshingly daring cinema, making a whole lot of new things seem tirelessly boring. Let's hope that SÃ©bastian Gutierrez continues with such a flair - he looks like a talent to watch out for. The inconsistent bunch of small quakes in the movie is overshadowed by the investigative partnership of Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, where humor scenes are much needed to make the movie what it is. The couple draws their mandatory southern threads as well as Yanks, and it is a pleasure to hear these two stalwarts of British cinema yapping away to each other with floating deadly weapons ... just a shame that the only scenes they have the opportunity to steal are only theirs. Anyway, with a little less politics and authoritarianism (!), The movie would be almost perfect so I give it a healthy 8/10 and hope a few people remember it a little better than the cashier's office did.
