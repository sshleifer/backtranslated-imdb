I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I entered the theater, I wasn't really in the mood for it at that particular time. It's a bit like Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure what dampened my spirit. The trailers looked good, but the water theme gave me poor feedback on the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld. Plus, despite the promise made by Ashton Kutcher in Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him. Something about the guy just irritates me. It probably has to do with his simian features. <br /> <br /> It took about two minutes for my fear to decline and for my hesitation to escape. The movie immediately throws us into a tense rescue mission, and I was caught tighter than Kenny Rogers' orange face lift. My worries were short on Kutcher's original appearance because too much was done to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious. Sunglasses, a hard guy in the mouth and sports in a smirk that would make George Clooney proud? Yes, we get it. I was completely ready to hate him. <br /> <br /> But then he had to go and deliver a pretty strong performance and force me to soften my jabs. <br /> <br /> You, monkey man! Effective blend of excitement, exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor and solid acting, The Guardian is easily a movie that I dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy. You can quibble about its clich√©s, predictability and rare moments of overcooked sappiness, but none of it takes away from the entertainment value. <br /> <br /> I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow down too much when Costner started training the young guys, but on the contrary, training sessions could just be the most interesting aspect of the movie. Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen, so I feel the inside to look at what they are going through and how hard it is to do it is very informative and a great way to introduce the audience to under - devalued group. <br /> <br /> Do you have what it takes to be a lifeguard? Just think about it - you are going to go on dangerous missions in cold, dark, hard water, and then you must fight disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia and lack of oxygen while trying to help stranded, panicked people who depend on you for their survival. And if all that is not bad enough, sometimes you can't save everyone so you have to make the hard decision about who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> Man, who wants all that responsibility? Not me! I didn't know what it really was for those guys, and who would have thought I would have an Ashton Kutcher / Kevin Costner movie to thank for the training? <br /> <br /> Not only does The Guardian do a good job of paying tribute to this rare breed hero, but fortunately for us, it also helps to entertain your paying customers. <br /> <br /> The GIST <br /> <br /> Moviegoers wanting an inside look at how to launch a bold rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might give The Guardian a chance. I saw it for free, but if I had paid, I would have felt that I had made my money's worth.
