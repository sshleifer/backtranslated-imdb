This movie has to come out on DVD because it's the only way I want to buy it. I thought it was so funny because there was no real reason for it. It was not likely to be an Oscar-winning movie. I appreciate these movies. Cary Elwes was a very cute Robin Hood. I can't even think of my favorite part of the movie because they're all pretty good. Anyways peace out. !!!!
