This is my favorite horror movie, one near the 2nd to 'Poltergeist'. I saw "One Dark Night" when it first appeared in theaters in 1983 at the theater where I worked. <br /> <br /> I was born in 1963, so I have some love for the 80's horror movie, despite being slightly dated and the dialogue not well-written. What I thought was so original was that the phenomenon of "psychic vampyrism" has not been treated (at least to my knowledge at that time) and is a very real phenomenon. <br /> <br /> I didn't 'Beware if Adam West was in it (nothing against him, but his supportive role was not memorable) but thought Meg Tilly was good casting. The well-known Donald Hutton (from 'Brainstorm' and 'Invaders From Mars'), as an ambiguous scientist who monitors studies on Ramar's abilities, was unfortunately overlooked. As a gay guy, I was more aware of David Mason Daniels, Meg Tilly's unfortunate but beautiful girlfriend. He now sells real estate in Texas. <br /> <br /> I felt the movie 'realistic' in two ways: Raymar, discovered to have murdered 6 girls in his surrealistic occasion, had a funeral that was scarce in attendance, reflecting that it was not just where he is mysterious, a hermit, but a killer. As you know, these types are buried without fanfare. Secondly, if the bodies were to be telekinically mobile, they would hover and pull their feet. The filmmakers could have gone to get started, moaning, arms stretched zombies, but chose what would be credible. Kudos! The buzzing electric discharge from Ramar's eyes on his "trunk coffin" (which he monitors his mortal) threw an eerie magenta light into the mausoleum that will stay with you for years! If you have ever been to a mausoleum, even on a sunny day, you will notice that they have their own rosette lighting caused by glass mosaic. Don't let me get started on cavernous silence. Even Ramar looked like someone who could pass as an eccentric, perverted old man. The score was unique and memorable, and I continue to kick myself for not getting it on the cassette when it first came out. The track shooting was done wherever it should be. I especially liked the carefully planned characteristics of each corpse: The bride, the poorly decomposed child, still holding her teddy bear, grandmother, the tall thin black guy and the half-fed second-world veterinarian and the green slender eyes older gent, who was the first to greet the 'Sisters' clique initiators. Even corpses can be good actors, I suppose. The only thing I had to moan about was the arm that came out of one of the vaults and strangled Julie's boyfriend, couldn't be done unless a corpse was put in lay on the stomach and feet first, but why? It was also a little fresh. <br /> <br /> The movie starts scary with the fact that we never see Ramar's face (until the movie's last quarter, which is like repackaging a birthday present) when he picks up teen girl races in her daughter's psychic flash. We see that coroners are pulling their bodies away in their one-bedroom apartment, where we see that he has experimented with his telekinetic craft by phasing dishes in the wall. The rest draws like the Heathers-like 'Sisters' group enticing Julie into a final initiation by staying overnight in the mausoleum, but it is a well-placed structure for the detachable horror later. The movie is not bloody in any kind of word. The most scary part is when Ramar's daughter uses a compact mirror to give his power back to him, and he bubbles so melts. I have always felt that a power like Ramar could never die and a successor might be worth looking at. I can see it now: A dark night II: Turning in the grave. But let's look at it - the movie stands alone. I heard the movie had other titles, but the original fit. <br /> <br /> A remake would be meaningless. But if there was one, I would write better dialogue and extend some scenes, such as. View the studies on Ramar's abilities in the lab instead of hearing about it on a tape recorder. In this information age, something like that would be well documented on DVD. And more corpses! Why just raise them in the mausoleum, as Ramar's power could also spread to the cemetery? Let's just say I hate being one of those people who had to clean up the mess at the end of the climax; something that can also be displayed. I think having one of the consecrated sisters recognize one of the bodies as a relative would have added some good whose disturbing character. With CG effects, some amazing scenes with Ramar animated cremated remains will be out of the wall! <br /> <br /> Say what you want, "One Dark Night," but it has it all. Then see at least once in your life ... or death!
