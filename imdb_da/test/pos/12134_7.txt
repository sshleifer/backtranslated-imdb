Has anyone ever read or heard comments from Scorsese or David Chase (Sopran's Exec. Producer) about "Death Collector / Family Enforcer"? I bought the DVD after not having watched it for a while on cable (like 20 years), but have seen "Goodfellas" and the whole "Sopranos" running to date. Eventually, both guys must have seen Death Collector / Family Enforcer and absorbed the taste, perhaps inspirational tone of their masterpiece, of which the polar opposite of the romanticized Godfather trilogy. Being a Jersey guy, it is interesting to see how the Jersey Meadowlands has evolved since the mid-70s. It is not the swampy dump site it used to be, although occasionally a body will emerge in a local waterway. It is also a bit bittersweet to see a newly built World Trade Center across the river in the opening and closing scene. Who could have imagined?
