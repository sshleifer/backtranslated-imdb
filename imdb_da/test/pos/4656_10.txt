What can I say about this movie that has not been said hundreds of times before? It's an American classic. It has created dozens of imitators. Or none. Midnight Madness is one of a kind. From the ridiculous opening montage / music to Bonaventure HOtel I was hooked. Leon made us feel so young and carefree. One question, how did he have the two hot hookers with him all the time? And how did time / money have to arrange such an event? Casting is top notch. David Naughton is the best here. His tight yellow sweatshirt is disturbing. His little brother Michael J Fox (in his first role) is a really steep one. There is also Naughton's love interest and a dork and the obligatory black guy in a fisherman's hat on the yellow team. Michael J Fox does bad things like trying to steal cups of beer at the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery and runs away to Flounder's van. Flounder's team gives us the most comedy. What is so much about the blonde in the team? Is she dating Flounder? Or Melio? Or leaves? Yes, the Mexican gentleman is called leaf. The other guy at the Flounder team has the best lines in the movie, I don't want to pump them here. The Meat Machine team is a bunch of drunks. My personal favorite is the armpit. But the silent black man is also great. The other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians (two of whom are 450 lb twins). <br /> <br /> You at the end from the start. But it doesn't matter. This is the 80s me-genre at its best. Don't rent this one, buy it. and buy it now
