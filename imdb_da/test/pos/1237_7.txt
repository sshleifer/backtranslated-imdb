Adapted from Sam Shepard's game, this movie retains many play-like elements as a relatively fixed setting (a roadside 50's southwest motel) and extensive, exciting dialogues. A woman "May" is hounded by a man "Eddie" (played by Sam Shepard). She tries to hide from him in the outer motel, but he finds her. The film explores their relationship, mainly from their childhood, which has led them to this point. It is very easy to feel sympathy for the characters and understand that their dysfunctional current conditions are the result of past events beyond their control. We primarily see them on match, make up, fight, make up and so on. A picture that stands out in my mind is that Eddie howls May over his shoulder kicking and screaming, taking her somewhere she won't go. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also a perfect soulful country with vocals by a lesser-known artist "Sandy Rogers". She has this country doll voice that almost yodels on some points in the album! This is the kind of movie that will be filed in part of your brain / soul. In other words, see it!
