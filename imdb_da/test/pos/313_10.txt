Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" is not a Vietnam war film. Don't be confused with one. It is set for the relapse of the war, but it is a metaphorical exhibition of the detrimental effects of war on the human psyche. It is also one of the most obedient films ever made, produced or even perceived (other to the Ring of the Rings trilogy. Calling it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film's production levels. <br /> < br /> Opening Without Credits and after an unforgettable first scene playing in tandem with the doors "Enden" as Martin Sheen's captain Benjamin L. Willard hallucines for images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes Willard's mission is to "finish ... with extreme prejudices" Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has always gone AWOL in the utmost reach of the Cambodian jungle and, as said by his general, "out there, working without any decent restraint, Beyond the whiteness of any acceptable human behavior, and still in the field coming troops. "Kurtz is a misleading Colonel who now worships a large group of followers who have called him a God For Willard, this hidden operation seems somewhat more manageable than the actual battle, but the journey he is about to take will be a personal mission that will challenge the boundaries of his human behavior. <br /> <br /> Together with a small crew, they go down the river in a submarine boat. Along the way, Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz. During Sheen's raspy voice over, he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. Kurtz was a very decorated and respected green mountain. He was a normal man with a family until part of him bowed to the horrors of human brutality and he headed down the path that Willard led. The descent into the jungle is marked by a fascinating aura that echoes the fighting not far away. Ultimately, the power of experience attacks the group as drugs and a kind of solitary confinement their senses. But Willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. As he reads about this mythical figure, he is drawn to man's power and why he has become what he has become. We know that Willard's slow decay comes parallel to Kurtz's. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando has been honored for decades. His presence: unmatched. His genius: undeniable. But for those who are unfamiliar with his vigor and unfamiliar to his physical nuance, Brando may be perceived as a hack in the eyes of an uncompromising movie-goer. He is certainly not. Brando was hard to work with, hard to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for incomprehensible rants and unmatched monologues is undeniable. Of course, the man knew what he was doing, even though we didn't. His Colonel Kurtz is a creature of unlimited delusions and persistent depths. If the movie is an indication of the journey into hell, than Francis Ford Coppola's actual experience of making this masterpiece is a true life account of a man's fanatic struggle to produce a movie. It has been reported that Coppola considered suicide during the film's 200 plus-day principle shooting plan. The film was not just an undeniable struggle to make; It's a cruel movie to watch. Coppola's sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steaming locals and his dedication filters through the openings of Martin Sheen's haunted soldier Willard. <br /> <br /> I can't help feeling a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of movie. At the beginning of all the original and unseen, films challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace. Audacity aside, Apocalypse Now is pure film making. My respect and admiration for Mr Coppola are of the highest order. But I shudder back to what has become the norm for today's standards of film: lack of innovation. It is not just the unoriginality of the cinema world today; It is the fact that no one seems to like to tell a story more or to tell someone with the heart. But we still have the great ones as Coppola's masterpiece, a movie that bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than we could understand. This depth of Apocalypse Now is the step of madness. The killing can interfere. Lack of innocence can lose weight. But it is the damage from within; the countless barrels of images that worry us, remove us, and remove us from our everyday life and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts, which ultimately separate us from humanity and drive us into the instinctive, the wild and the precious. If the idea of ​​killing does not nourish, the act of killing gives man his basic catharsis.
