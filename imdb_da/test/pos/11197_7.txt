An examination of one of these universally well-known, physical and / or emotional states: isolation. I also think that the film also comments on cultural shift. <br /> <br /> The film presents the experiences of two Turkish men (cousins). You have money (and the comforts that come from having 'done it' with a steady income); the other has no one and is hunting for work. Neither is happy. Don't expect to celebrate life here - it's loneliness, warts and everything. The film succeeds in offering a vigorous gloomy passage through the 'low lands' of the human condition. Brave movie production. Well behaved and well shot in my opinion (outdoor shots at the harbor are my own favorites). A movie that should inspire gratitude in anyone who is not alien to happiness and fulfillment in life (not to mention employment); everyone else will find a companion in this movie. A film with all heat and pace in an ice floe. Expect a bitter pill, not a "happy pill."
