"Single among us" is definitely one of the best first season episodes. The story, though somewhat confusing, creates great excitement, supported by the sinister synthesizer-driven soundtrack. This is a typical "foreign body" scenario, but finally it does not go to any evil purpose (assistant engineer Singh's death for me was an accident). The two delegated species provide an entertaining framework (best makeup so far) to eventually add some black humor to the series (the last scene). Of course, Patrick Stewart enjoys extracting some of his Picard character and exploring some new terrain that makes Data as Sherlock Holmes (another all time classic). The special effects are also convincing and director Cliff Bole did his job well. He is the first to try to compensate Troi's inability to act by improving her appearance. She looks beautiful in some scenes, and the neck of her dress greatly enhances her appearance. Picard's "lightning strike" on the bridge gives him a little air of the Emperor of Star Wars "Return of the Jedi" (which is a personal impression but made me smile). <br /> <br /> There is also something to play with the illumination of the corridors (simulation of the night on board) and the first moving camera, pulling back from Picard as he enters the transport room to radiate into the cloud ... Nice work. The clever intersection that creates continuing dialogue through various scenes (Trois hypnosis report) rounds off the impression of a really well-designed TNG episode. The first, where even Wesley Crusher seemed almost acceptable ... However, the end is a little confusing, as if the producers ran out of time. "P for Picard" is a bit far fetched and his return is too easy, but it can be left with the many strong moments this episode has to offer ...
