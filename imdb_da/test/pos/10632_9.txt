After I saw "La Pianiste" several years ago, I told myself that I would never see it again, so powerful and disturbing it was. The time went by, but I couldn't get the film and the protagonist Erika Kahut out of it. The story of a respected piano teacher in the Vienna Conservatory, cool and collected on the surface, an expert in classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, self-sufficiency and self-destruction strong enough to destroy her demanded more than one view. I read the book "The Piano Teacher" by Elfriede Jelinek, the controversial Nobel Prize winner in the literature, that the film is based on and after reading it, I saw the film again. The second time all pieces of puzzle came to the right places. Not very often, an excellent harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such a brilliancy as "Le Pianiste". Three actors gave excellent performances. Franz Schubert's piano music, "soaked in morbid humanity", is another bright star of the film. <br /> <br /> I only have a problem with Haneke's vision. There is a scene in the film, where Haneke made some changes in Erika's character compared to the novel. In the book she went furthest to reveal herself to Walter, the young student in the conservatory who was attracted to her was in a letter. As soon as he understood what he was dealing with and showed her how much he was rejected, she had stopped communicating with him. Erika of the book would never hunt Walter to plead with him. She kept everything inside - she didn't like shopping, she wasn't a chaser - she loved to see. The big stage during the hockey game was not necessary. It tried to make Erika sympathetic (and of course was Huppert's heartbreaking), but it took the mystery that surrounded her - Jelinek did not write the scene it sounded and looked fake in otherwise excellent movies.
