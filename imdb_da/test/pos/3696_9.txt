Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have many friends, and she has a mumbling mother (Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself growing closer to her mother's boyfriend Billy (Rob Estes), perhaps she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't have to tell you what happens after that. <br /> <br /> This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is guilty. This movie also has the best acting I've seen in TV movies. Beverly D'Angelo does a really good job as a sweet and loving but negligent and blind mother. She couldn't see what was going on under her own roof. Rob Estes is here best here as sleazeball. Jenny Lewis is a standout. She seems to be exactly like her character. <br /> <br /> Everyone seems to love this movie!
