This delightful, well-written film is based on a New York Scene play of the same title, where Sir Aubrey (Knight Sir Charles Aubrey Smith in 1944) derives from the role he plays in the movie. Here in 1931 we see him in the early part of his acting renaissance in the early era of "talkies" and in the character role he would make until his death in 1948 after the end of his last performance in Little Women, which released in 1949. <br /> <br /> This engaging game is about an older British aristocrat who locates his illegitimate children and introduces them to them by bringing them to his mansion in England. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies plays her daughter-for-error and is a tour de force for her. She is at once engaging, impatient, shallow, enchanting, wise, and compassionate, while creating an indelible and insulting sign that remains well inscribed in memory. The 26-year-old Ray Milland appears here in a small but prominent role has already appeared in seven other pictures, so only in movies for just over two years. The film should be enjoyed as a representative of the 1931 Hollywood Factory Production of course and as such is not flawless. But it is a charming pleasure from the first scene at the end.
