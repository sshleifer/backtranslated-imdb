The subject of the film is exciting and very real. It happened. One can debate some artistic freedoms taken by the director and screenwriter. The subject is what makes the movie tick - nothing else. I watched the movie for the first time after the real Phoolan, was shot down in New Delhi and had earned several years as an elected member of parliament in India. By the way, she was not the first motionless elected to the House, as some reviewers stated. The so-called "untouchables" have been elected to the Indian Parliament for decades in reserved constituencies. <br /> <br /> While Shekhar Kapur as an instructor is a very many India because he made commercially accepted international films - "Bandit Queen" and "Elizabeth" (and a tolerable kiddie movie called "Mister India", was accepted by the average Indian audience) - and even got Oscar nominations for Elizabeth, I do not place him as a top notch film director from India. He fails in every department as director except perhaps he succeeds in getting some above-average performances from his actors. Subtlety, finesse, charm is not easy to find in his films - melodrama brims in them. <br /> <br /> His idea of ​​using Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's vocal reproduction of the song in the early part of the movie was perhaps his only great achievement on the inevitable soundtrack of "Bandit Queen". And then maybe the creaking doors in the gang group Otherwise, the movie looked like a spaghetti western with sex and violence minus the great music you associate with them. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good live Indian movie director who is making an international-quality realistic cinema - it's not the Shekhar Kapur's movie you should see; These are the later works of three Indian filmmakers Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mrinal Sen, and Girish Karnad and of course Muzaffar Ali's "Umrao Jaan". It is unfortunate that none of these directors had the financial support that Kapur had to give them and their films an international look. For example, Sen's "Oka oorie katha" made in Telugu or Satyajit Ray's "Sadgati" based on Munshi Prem Chand's "Kafan" is more complete as a movie for an intelligent viewer dealing with the state of the pristine in India. Then did not need to resort to graphic sex and violence, but only suggested them. Of course, Sen's nugget didn't make headlines, while Kapur's efforts hogged them. <br /> <br /> For Kapur's credit he formulated and used his limited talent and modest resources in the Mumbai movie industry to take his products beyond the home crowd. For that effort, I pay tribute to Kapur. But "Bandit Queen" will remain a good subject pending a skilled director to deal with it.
