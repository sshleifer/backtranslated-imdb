Most of the silent movies I've seen have been serious in nature, so it was fun to see one with a comic touch. The setting and some of the scenes for "The Beloved Rogue" are reminiscent of 1923's "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" in relation to Paris street scenes and the celebration of 'King of Fools'. John Barrymore portrays France's greatest poet Francois Villon in a characterization that extends quite broadly from virtual slapstick to romantic bid; that "water in the wine" a little early in the picture was pretty entertaining. <br /> <br /> It seems times are never changing and it is interesting to watch the movie make a compelling observation almost a century ago - Paris has been fooled to rule for one night while everywhere else has a whole the time. How true. The appearance of Conrad Veidt in the movie was a little surprising for this viewer. I've only seen him as Major Strasser in "Casablanca", strangely one of his very first films. Like King Louis XI, he is a monarch obsessed with astrology, but scornful but suspicious, and it was a little uncomfortable to see how he resembled Brad Dourif's Wormtounge character from the last chapter of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Doesn't exactly radiate the trust that a king in France is expected to bear. That is why the riot of Burgundy's Duke (Lawson Butt) seemed more credible until Villon rose to the occasion to put one on both rulers. I found it interesting that the use of inter-title cards was extremely spare, used only when absolutely necessary to advance the story. Without them, one would have missed a curious nugget. It looks like Villon has done his exile from Paris at Hostel of the Lame Flea! <br /> <br /> The print I watched was of extraordinary quality, the very first film featured in a hundred Action and Suspense movie DVD set from Mill Creek Entertainment that says something to a movie that now is 80 years old. It's good that movies from the quiet era now find a wider distribution in this kind of commercial format, making them accessible to a whole new generation of movie lovers. One question - did it seem like Conrad Veidt's King Louis picked his nose intentionally or as an unintentional gesture that simply remained safe from the cutroom?
