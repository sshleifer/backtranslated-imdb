Imaginary Heroes, the remarkable work of the then 24-year-old Dan Harris, is labeled "People are never as they seem to be". Perhaps this wisely is chosen as a stratagem for marketing; but I rented this movie despite the roof line, rather than because of it. And I'm glad I did. I found the movement an in-depth study of the tragedy. I personally found it to be a movie about managing dreams: especially those that are lost. In the case of a son, "loss" requires a deep examination of what he had and did not have in his life. Nevertheless, the film's central tragedy, while posing unrelenting issues in itself, is primarily a background for the relief of various coping styles. I think the film asks about an important question: how can we manage our dreams, especially where heroes become imaginary?
