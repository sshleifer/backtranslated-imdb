This movie is unusual when Marlene & Raymond present great performances. The action in this movie is the greatest strength of production, but the script, direction and editing deserve applause. There is an extraordinary chemistry that exsists between the two stars. If you like Marlene and you like Raymond, you'll love this movie ..... (It's a classic comparing to Casablanca.) <br /> <br />
