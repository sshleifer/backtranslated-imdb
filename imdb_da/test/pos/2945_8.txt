I watched this movie at the Philadelphia Film Festival today and enjoyed it overall. It is an interesting and skilful analysis of the all too common revelation that our parents' marriage was more erroneous and difficult than we had originally imagined. In addition, this film is an excellent example of the process of discovering truths about our parents' lives after their death and the problems associated with it. However, I found the sound quality (recording and editing) to be relatively poor and annoying. *** It may well have been related to the specific theater and projection conditions *** I am not a film producer / student or anything and claim no real understanding of the sound production process, but as a consumer I found the sound part of the film distracting. In particular, I heard very unpleasant play-through sounds (especially a long interview with the younger sister) the movie, and often the background noise level was higher in volume than people's voices (for example, the scene when a small group sorted through mothers papers). Have anyone else seen this movie, noticed something about the sound ... thank you
