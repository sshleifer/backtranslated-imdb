This film was really well written and was very entertaining. There was also a big role in it. Luke Perry did a very convincing job. (as he always does) If you are looking for an eventful movie to see this, you must be at the top of your list. There is a mix of comedy, drama and action. You can literally feel what the actors feel about points. I was very impressed with this movie. The special effects were very well done. The whole movie was very convincing. This movie is one of my favorites. What happens, North America can be torn apart, and Jack and his team must try to stop an outbreak by destroying North America. It was a very cool and creative idea. I loved this movie and I know you will too.
