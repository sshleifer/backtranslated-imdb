Famous Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský, who is mostly known in North America for his leading role as Jacob in the original Estonian-Czech production by Jacob the Liar (Jakob, who Lügner 1974) gives us a last brilliant performance as an 80-year-old prankster who refuses to admit he is dying. <br /> <br /> Jirí Hubac's manuscript is exquisite. Fun, mobile and well developed. It explores both the topic of advanced old age and the motivation of characters who are uncertainly strong and fragile, happy and undisturbed. <br /> <br /> Frantisek (Vlastimil Brodský) and his best friend Eda (Stanislav Zindulka) are up to all types of shenanigans and take care of the best of their dying days. Meanwhile, Frantisek's wife prepares herself for their death, saves on burial money and chases Frantisek for his endless childhood and irresponsible attitude. Their son is about to take their apartment over and put them in a guest house, but Frantisek won't hear any of it. He wants to enjoy life and make people around him laugh. He will help and love and give ... but at what price? <br /> <br /> Certainly capturing adults of all ages, this fine piece of film by talented director Vladimír Michálek is both touching and fun. It makes you think about how we live our lives and why we live our lives. It brings the simple story of a charming, stubborn old man in the lead and allows us to reflect and feel what life is all about. <br /> <br /> After an active career for more than 40 years, it is somewhat worse than that Vlastimil Brodsk died in April 2002, no longer squeezed into terminal cancer. However, it is encouraging to think that he had the chance to be part of such a moving script and to be a catalyst for this ode to a happy old age that did not even begin to create the waves that it is about to create. the North American repertoire cinema. Following the international success of Jan Hrebejk's "Divided We Fall (2000)", it has begun to be clear that Czech cinema actually has something to offer to the world. This movie is certainly a must see.
