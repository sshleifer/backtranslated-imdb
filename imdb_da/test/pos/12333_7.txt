As part of an initial prank Julie (Meg Tilly of Psycho 2) has to stay overnight in a mausoleum, but Karl Rhamarevich, a telecoms master, has recently died and been put in there. When Julie's sister sisters were dismissed where he is at home, real terror begins. <br /> <br /> This little flick had a good mood and I enjoyed the build plus the last twenty minutes is simply great. Anyone looking for a lost gem of an 80's horror movie does not have to look any further. Very underrated. Plus Elizabeth Daily is sweet. <br /> <br /> My character: B <br /> <br /> Media Blaster DVD Extra: Disc 1) Comment with director Tom McLoughlin and co-author Michael Hawes; and trailers for "The Being", "Frankestien's Bloody Terror", "Just Before Dawn", & "Devil Dog" Disc 2) Alternative Director's Cutting (it is hardly available due to a bad print) & Bag-the-scenes featurette
