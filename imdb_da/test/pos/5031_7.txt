Although this movie does not stand out especially from the movie crowd, it is still a very nice movie to sit down and watch with your feet up! There are perhaps the odd one or two flaws you catch and the movie theater is a small slide, the movie itself is very entertaining and has a nice atmosphere. The music contributes a lot to the mood of the film. <br /> <br /> The play is nevertheless impressive (especially the dog he is!) with John Travolta the leader of the fun cumbersome loving Michael. Other figures are very genuine and work very well within the film. <br /> <br /> So after a long day at work, keep the "Michael" in the evening with a little ice cream and enjoy a very quality movie in his own right :)
