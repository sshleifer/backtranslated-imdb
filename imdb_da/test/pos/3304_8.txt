Fun bad movie that should entertain. One of Joan Crawford's last performances as the driven successful editor vs. all the young beautiful, avid beavers fresh out of the elite Seven Sister Colleges. Great 50's atmosphere in New York. Wonderful costumes and hairdressers. Great art direction. Trite story, but rousting tearjerker. Interesting cameo by Robert Evans as a rich cad.
