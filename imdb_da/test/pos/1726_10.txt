Unlike most people who have commented, I was born after the last Sylvester Mccoy episode, and so could not have compared the two centuries doctor who initially. I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of TARDIS and the continuation of the series. I have since seen old episodes of Doctor Who and some how good, but like the doctor, the series looks to regenerate to continue. The 21st century doctor, who is great, I thought Martha was great, almost a match for the doctor, and if Jack's appearance is something to pass, she becomes brilliant as she came in series 4 or 5. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Jack, spin of, Torchwood is also brilliant and you should see both of these programs (although this is certainly more suitable for children). But if you insist that this is not the same and just isn't Doctor Who, please just stay in your basement. <br /> <br /> 10/10
