I see that many students are now signing up for student exchange to Barcelona and being disappointed when they do not have such an exciting time. <br /> <br /> The movie was fun. It is of course always a pleasure to see Audrey Tatou. <br /> <br /> But I have a very strong problem with part of the movie. The lesbian roommate tells Xavier that the women seem to be physically dominated (as I take the question with) and shows him a kind of bumper movement that is guaranteed to get a woman. Xavier then tries to equip plump on a shy married friend - who begins to say "no no" "I'm married, I'm married" but then somehow succumbs to butt grab ?? Suddenly she moans "yes yes" and they go on it on the bench in Parc Guell. I found this really offensive. Moreover, it is very stereotyped. How often have we seen scenes where the woman says "no" but of course that doesn't mean that? No means no. Grabbing butts / physical dominance is not going to do it right. It just supported the stereotypical rapes. <br /> <br /> I wasn't even sure how to read the next scene where he glowed at lesbians, how it worked, and how the next time he'd just "suck it, slam" (or something such a). Does he really think that forcing a woman without respect for her feelings was the way to go? <br /> <br /> This section really destroyed the movie for me.
