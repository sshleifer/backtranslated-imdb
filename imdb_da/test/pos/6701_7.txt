Okay, let's get it out of the way first: As a piece of cinema, Lifeforce is a nonsense. As a bit of cheesy entertainment for SF buffs, it has a lot of profit. If you enjoy watching the old black and white SF B movies - giant mutated spiders / ant or alien monsters wandering around in the desert - you'll really get a kick out of Lifeforce. <br /> <br /> Bad things: History makes little sense, and the play is pretty bad. Good things: The special effects are half decent; it has an inviting other British centered history (it is set in London) which gives different feelings to most SF movies; and it has the well-grounded Mathilda May (exciting billed as "Space Girl") that wanders around that is strong naked. <br /> In short: it's fun. <br /> <br /> I've seen it a half dozen times now, and every time it comes on TV, I take the time to watch it - it's partly related to the mere Madame May - but it's also to do with enjoying modest and silly SF.
