I'm from Texas and live very close to Plano, where the actual deaths occurred, so I can be a little bothered to say that "Wasted" is a movie you just can't get out of your head. <br /> Stahl, Phoenix and Paul all play their characters very realistically. You really think they are daily high school students who are just random heroin addicts. The drug content is also handled very graphically - though everything that happens in the film serves a purpose and every moment the signs spiral further down are heartbreaking. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. When you see it, it sticks to you!
