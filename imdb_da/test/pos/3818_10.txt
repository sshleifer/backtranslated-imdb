There is no point in comparing this with the original series. Although different in appearance and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, an SF / Horror Anthology series. Due to indifferent planning in Australia, I have only managed to capture a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The very first episode really gave me the creeps (nightmare of my age ...!) But a number of others fell flat; generally since the stories moved into the horror-rich and away from SF. I only hope the DVDs reach us eventually.
