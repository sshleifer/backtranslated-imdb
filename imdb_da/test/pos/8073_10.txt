For those who appreciate the intersection of silent cinema and social commentary, this is a unique movie. Part tribute to German expressionism, part allegory, the film is filled with visual symbolism and an artistic style that rivals something seen since the 1920s. In addition, attention to period details and the visual composition of the scenes as an instrument to promote history is stunning. Apart from this, the plot gives an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its impact on social voice, perception and meaning. In truth, it is not so much the silence that permeates the film, as it is the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and express thought that inevitably follows. Overall, this movie is not often seen, and as the film producer said in the subsequent Q&A, you will let yourself think of its meaning well into the next day.
