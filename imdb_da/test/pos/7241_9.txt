Although it is not as good as a murder is announced, which was not only nice but almost surpassed the book, this is an excellent adaptation. And you know what, it's a huge improvement on the Geraldine McEwan version. Now I'm not proud of losing the Geraldine McEwan adaptations, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others started well but destroyed by either a bad script, a confusing final solution or both. The Geraldine McEwan version was hit by an increasing pace and both of the above-mentioned issues, and I would consider the second best of the ITV adaptations, the worst Sittaford Mystery, which even on its own merits proved blunt and confusing. This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a great improvement, it not only respects the book, in spite of a few freedoms, but it justifies the problems the ITV version had. Despite Lionel's added character, which comes across as rather annoying, more about how he was written than how he was acted, and one or two moments of sluggish pacing, this is solid as an adaptation of a decent one. book. It is beautifully recorded, with beautiful photography and periods of detail, and the music is always excellent. The performances are wonderful this time and make the most of a generally well-executed script, with Joan Hickson brilliant as always as Miss Marple, and solid swings from Liz Fraser, Helen Cherry, Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack is excellent, but in a chilling and moving performance like Clothilde. Overall worth seeing, better than the latest version in virtually all departments. 9/10 Bethany Cox
