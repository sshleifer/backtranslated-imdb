Many of us who went through high school probably did it okay, without having to take a physics course - I don't know. But after seeing this program, I would certainly wish I had. <br /> <br /> This documentary is a guide to the "Holy Grail of Physics" endeavor to unite all the basic forces of the universe into a "masterful equation" that escaped Einstein in the last years of his life. In this respect, Brian Green, professor at Columbia University, introduces us blast theory in a wonderfully simple way, leaving us an even greater understanding of the universe we live in. We begin with the tantalizing opportunity of a "master equation" that could unite and explain everything ... * everything! * in this universe, including the four basic forces we know exist: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear power, the weak nuclear power and gravity. Green takes us on a tour of how our understanding of the universe appeared with Newton's work, as Einstein, and then later on the quantum plan of physics. <br /> <br /> But it is at this time that we run into a problem that has plagued physicists for years and one that no one has been able to solve yet. How can we unite all these forces that we know together? We find, as Green constantly points through the whole problem, that the answer to this confusing problem could be in the strings theory. But if we are to describe the universe with regard to string theory, there is a very great price to pay. It turns out that it is out of the mind numbering mathematical equations of string theory, as a consequence we find that we could possibly live in a full universe, not just 3 dimensions, which you and I see every day plus 1 (on time ), but rather that we can actually live in a universe of * 11 * dimensions. But the mathematics that arises from that theory does not stop there - the possibility is that there can actually be parallel universes; some of them right next to you and me! Could we possibly take such a theory that leads to such consequences seriously? As Green points out; we have not yet fully discovered, but we know that the mathematics arising from these equations already show us that the universe still has much to show us. <br /> <br /> For those of you who fear that you will not understand the concepts in this program - do not fear. Professor Green does a wonderful job of abolishing the physical and harder concepts of physics and instead focuses more on the * concept * - which, when you remove all the math from it, transforms from a monstrous animal to an incredibly simple and, as Green constant points to, 'elegant' concept. Viewers of this program need no prior background in science; The terms are so simple, even though a child could understand them. When you finish this program, you will really understand what a wonderful and mysterious universe we are living in.
