I see this movie with horror in my heart because my mother was also a crackhead like Michelle. I'm thinking where Michelle is now. There have been times when I had to find my mother in places I was afraid to be but more afraid to leave her there! to see Michelle act like that made me wonder where she slept all that time ?? I was hoping it was never so bad for my mother! and what I want to know is ... where does Matt and Tracy "tear it there"? the worst scene for me was watching Tracy shoot up in an old navy room !!!! you never try clothes for you and it looks like all of them except Michelle has aids !!!! where do they know 2008? can we get an update ??????????
