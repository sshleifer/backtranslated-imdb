Should we take the opening shot as a weird frame ??? I think we should. Anyway, two women are behind a closed umbrella, they go on top of the talent entrepreneur, and we go with them ... and then they are never seen again. Okay, how does it get into the place, on the piano or even outside with the sound of the piano, then track in and over, a la Hitchcock ??? So I assume that Clouzot already tells us in a not very subliminal way that we follow a segment of post-war society: especially how he then uses a Citizen Kane = similar song cut into about five pieces to show the lady singing to travel from The talent agency all the way to her first roses and applause from her Vaudeville debut. Then we are relentless observers of more or less small obnoxious details of a defeated country coming out of its war-torn crushed knees. And no one has ever handled little disgust better than Clouzot. In fact, he has never tried Sartre's Nausea. Almost everything we look for the first few minutes, ever makes us so queasy. .... okay, okay, I'm violently overstating it, let's just settle for a general sense of a lot of the movie. Look carefully in reality and you will even see one of the police pick his nose. And in how many movies has anyone ever made it. Then there is a very high nose blower in front of the photographer's lesbian of the main police and notes that she does not literally flash an eye or raise an eyebrow. <br /> <br /> The point of all this is an almost feverish immersion in context, apparently until you can smell almost all the scenes as well as see and feel it. <br /> <br /> As for the other aspects of the movie, others here have covered them in more detail than I do. But forget about all the mystery here: This is the ultimate McGuffin. The Clouzot is just as interested in the real murderer as the two women come into the rain for the first few seconds of the movie and is never seen again. From the beginning to the end, everything he wanted to do was follow a bunch of people around, not even very interesting on it, and say, look here at this woman's trait, the man's hitching of his pants in all their insignificance year and year before Tina Turner singing, we don't need another hero. Although the forced levitation of the end is bleakly done in a falsified part of Paris, and rather cool, just bricked apartment. With only the couples love each other to see them through, as saying that there should be two or three million like you in the whole city, your fingers of the day work for little love at night. <br /> <br /> From this it was only a short step to pay for fear and the ultimate in despair. <br /> <br /> They don't even know how to make movies anymore in the US. So far they didn't even know much in France so much now. The relentless details in gesture make even the neo-realists in Italy look like bad psychologists. As I think, Clouzot makes a kind of Rosselini at speed. <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable nonsense, this movie. The only mistake seems to me, and as another viewer pointed out, the leading woman is somehow not quite right. Everyone else in the movie is just about perfect cast.
