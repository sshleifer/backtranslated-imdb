Duckman was a show that used to be in the last hour or so before it was time to sleep ten or so years ago. It was a contrast to a lot of childrens animation I saw at the time; I was still a smaller junkie for Disney and Looney Tunes stuff, and most Saturday morning cartoons were still on top of the days of the Ninja Turtles and Batman. But also around this time, I began to realize that the more healthy, mature, surreal, indecent and (although I didn't know the word at that time) satirical cartoon exhibits were more creative than the things I was used to. Around Beavis and Butt-Head, Ren and Stimpy, and even The Maxx hit TVs via MTV, the US excelled two shows - one of them was Weird Science, and the other was Duckman. I have always remembered a few important bits from the show, and some of the lines are very quotable for those who have not forgotten it completely. Fortunately, I found a tape recently with about six episodes, I taped a long time ago, and the jokes were very fresh. And the delivery of jokes is fast fire much of the time in the better episodes. <br /> <br /> In the voice department, the choices in talent are at the top of the story, which is usually just an excuse for raw, fascinating parodies of pop culture, politics, movies and television shows, music, detective mysteries, and the dysfunctional family unit. Jason Alexander is a wonderful choice for Duckman, and his performance is a comedian 180 from his days at Seinfeld (though there may be some similar characteristics here and there). Also, the voices of Gregg Berger as the unmistakable monotonous and dead-bird Cornfed, Dweezil Zappa as the hilariously creepy Ajax and Nancy Travis as the sex-hungry, unpleasant sister-in-law Bernice, all contribute in full. Along with good writing - even when a joke is not sure of fire - the joke behind it - the animation style, while being far from any of the refurbished, computer-enhanced product today - is ingenious and often abstract. It has the homemade, gritty quality that Beavis and Butt-head or South Park would later have. And as they show, if you are a young child, I mean a bit like younger than I saw on the show, you may not understand most jokes (ie there are enough strippers and VD references to fill in two shows sometimes). But it is ingenious to catch if it is on television late at night and it seems pretty good in that time. One can only hope for a DVD box set. <br /> <br /> So to no one who has hardly been heard of this program, there is a general note: Think of this show as if Dashiell Hammett met with Walt Disney and decided to go to slum part of Vegas with a free minibar and collaboration in the way of Luis Bunuel and The Simpsons combined. Not to mention, it is the group that did the Rugrats. (Strong) A
