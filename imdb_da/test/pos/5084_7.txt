Just reading why this show was canceled makes me steam. This was a favorite of mine as a child, and I always looked at it when it happened, no matter how many times I saw the episode. Sure the effects weren't great, but they weren't terrible either. They did a pretty good job with the costume and it had the lovely 70's mood for what is always fun to see and hear, as the music was also very 70s. It didn't really have any bad guys from the comics, but then most cartoon live show adaptations had no to very few actual super villains from the comics. Spidey's powers were also slightly different here, he had his pointed sense, and he could climb the walls, but he was almost as strong as the Spider-Man comics. He was super strong, though I remember an episode where he broke into a room by breaking the door knob, he was just not the car's ship that it from the comic can be. The show was set in Los Angelos, so there weren't like men's buildings swinging off, but they did okay with the internet. It's nice that this show actually has web shooters and not organic shooters of the movie. I love the movies, but a part of me wants them to start again and make the more smarty pants Spidey that has the mechanical web players. This show had a good star like Peter Parker and he was okay as Spider-Man, it's nice to see a Spidey who doesn't really live in the slum as he does in the movies. However, neither this show nor the movie has a Spider man who is quick with the insult as that of the comic. Still, this show was fun without being as corny as the Batman show.
