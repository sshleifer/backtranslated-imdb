This was a television show I saw in the 1960s as a child and was fascinated by it. In the many years that have passed, I have often thought of this show and how good it would be to see it again, but be aware that the things of the past are not always as good as you remember them. This was a great show in the 1960s and has not lost anything, even now in 2007. Of course, there are a few odd production flaws that you see when you look at old shows and it takes a few episodes to get used to the Doubled voices, but after doing so, I was as imprisoned now as I was back in the 1960s. The samurai is played by Koichi Ose, who plays the role in a very humble way. I remember during the 60's, because of the popularity of the show here in Australia, he toured performing sword games, etc. And was overwhelmed by the interest in the show and in him. It was great that one of my favorite shows ever kept the magic as it did during my childhood. One must see series.
