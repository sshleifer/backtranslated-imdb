On June 22, 1941, the city of Przemysl, Poland, is divided between German and Russian. When the Germans invade the city, the Nazis send the Jews to a ghetto. The young Catholic Fusia Podgorska (Kellie Martin), alone with her young sister, lodges and conceals many Jews in the attic of her house two and a half years until the end of the war. "Hidden in silence" is another good story of human sympathy in World War II. This movie looks like "Rescuers: Stories of Courage" and is also based on a true story. Unfortunately, actor Kellie Martin performs a strong and powerful main character, but she is very weak for such a role. In many dramatic situations, the expression of her face is not convincing. I noticed that many IMDb users liked her performance, but I'm not sure if they like her wonderful character or her performance. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ocultos no Medo" ("Hidden in fear")
