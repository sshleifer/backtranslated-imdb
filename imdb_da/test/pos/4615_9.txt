I saw 2:37 at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and was blown away by it! A scene of panic opens this movie, at 14:37 in an adelaide high school. This scene is left undissolved as we return to the beginning of the day and are introduced to teens getting ready to go to school. The audience becomes intimate with each of the protagonists and explores the daily problems of teens - including drugs, promiscuity, gays, bullying and violence. Each scene is played over and over from different teenage perspectives and reminds of Gus Van Sants elephant. This is a remarkable film by first-time director Murali K. Thalluri. It was made with non-professional student actors and the work deal through an unprecedented 76 draft script. It features amazing performances by a number of student actors, especially Teresa Palmer in the role of Melody. This upcoming movie is both intimate and thoughtful with a surprising and disruptive ending.
