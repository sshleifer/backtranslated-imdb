A film that reveals the discomfort of modern men and women in life when confronted with death. We are beyond the simple religious belief in the afterlife and what is more in any kind of hell or heaven. Religion is declared dead. But people are more occupied than ever by death, especially as we can push it away for quite some time. The scientific and technological development of our society leads us to believe that we can explain everything, know everything, and do everything. It was quite typical of the late 20th century. Today, things change, especially when the president of the US itself, Barack Obama, in a public speech to journalists talk about their quest for truth and qualifies this truth as, of course, relative because it is more of a task than a final end, goal or achievement. The film shows the end of the good old metaphysical thinking that began to evolve into a true obedience session, an obsessive notion that truth was unique and irrevocably accessible. Postmodernism had not yet reached Hollywood, but today it seems to have reached the White House. So some young doctors and doctors decide to go into death and come back. Technically, this is possible, but the result is not surprising. It re-activates old guilty feelings and frustrations that were buried in the unconscious. One is dealing with a drug-abused father of a Vietnam veteran who commits suicide, another with a young boy who was stoned to death by some who included the death trimmer, another still with a young black girl who became the victim and bullied in the class school out of racism, sexism and hatred, if not fear in front of his shame. It is so naive that you can cry for these young adults who are highly qualified and behave like babies crying for their edulcorated fruit juice bottles. However, the film is interesting, but in something completely different. The setting and recording and every detail or treatment of detail is baroque, morbid, decadent, entirely in the style of "Death in Venice" or Greenaway or some other artwork dealing with making friends with the basic enemy of death. Of course it doesn't save the movie, but it makes it least worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID
