I really enjoyed this movie and I also think most of Lauren Ambrose's fans will. Her character is much softer than her role in the Six Feet Under and all performances are strong. I especially enjoyed the way Emily, a mentally challenged savant, was handled. Despite some misinformed user reviews, the role was performed precisely and without clich√© by actor Taylor Roberts. Also a standout was Fran Kranz, whose natural ease well complemented the more season veteran actors. Although the direction hit a snag here or there it seemed that the only problems were with an underdeveloped script. What might have worked well as a stage game was not as good on the screen. However, the lovely filmography of Paul Ryan certainly makes it, as well as the pace of the movie, which is surprisingly slow. I recommend this movie to fans of six feet below and also fans of regular good acting and movies.
