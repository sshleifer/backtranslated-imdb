Don't watch this movie while or soon after eating. <br /> <br /> That said, Begotten will hold onto you for the rest of your life, just like it or not. Based on the nihilistic philosophy that life is nothing but jumping over the earth (to rewrite the title's order / introduction), it will most likely include the most intense and pissy pictures you will ever see in a movie. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue, only image by image describing life cycle. The movie's combination of strong black and white photography, which is confused with some truly eerie background, sounds like driving the home maker's message. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with God (portrayed as a bandaged and of course insane man) torso with a straight razor and subsequently dying in his own filth. After his death, mother nature comes out of its body to impregnate itself with its blood and semen and give birth to man, represented by a mouthpiece of human cramps on the ground. The landscape is an infertile waste, populated by hollowed-in humanoids, which gradually occur on Mother Nature and Man. After a lot of violent scenes depicting the nature of the rape and the destruction of man, these humanoids continue to pound the remains of the bodies back into the earth, and the cycle of life begins again. <br /> <br /> I actually rented this from Blockbuster one night, based on cover art and hype content, but this is certainly not a Blockbuster type movie. Don't expect narration, dialogue, or any drawn stop. These are intense images based on a dark subject. <br /> <br /> I do give this movie some high marks for movies and sound, but I don't think I will see it too often if it is again. I like my movies dark and unique, but this one is exponentially more than expected.
