Two of Hollywood's great kids stars (Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney) are the perfect team to deliver one of the all-time family classics. The story of a particular 12-year-old girl whose worship of horses will not allow her to turn away from her goal of winning the British nationals. Mickey Rooney is the orphans who seem to bind themselves until he can follow his own dreams. A beautiful side plot shows that the girl's mother had her own ambitions as a young girl. Repeated overpowering of father's decisions in favor of their spiritual daughter, it is mother who seems to know the best. The scene where the exhausted Taylor rushes to school is invaluable: Father protests "Why did you let her go to school, she will fall out of exhaustion before noon!" - Don't worry, she'd be back in half an hour; it was Saturday! The brilliant Technicolor, the sumptuous music score and the beautiful faces all tell a bittersweet story. Here's a good reason for the old saying: They don't do that any more!
