This picture only follows as time passes. Better than any of the best picture candidates in 97, and it rewards repeated views. I've seen it three times now, so I know. Anderson was compared to some of the great US directors (Altman, Scorcese, Tarantino), and he may have these influences, but chances are that after a few movies he will be considered part of the short list himself. <br /> One final note: Julianne Moore's "Amber Waves" will resonate in memory long after other 90's film characters have faded. Best performance of the year - in one of the four categories.
