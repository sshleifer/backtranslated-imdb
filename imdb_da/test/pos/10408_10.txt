I've never written anything here before, but after seeing Noroi, I just felt that I had to write down my thoughts about it. <br /> <br /> First, don't compare this with Blair Witch, this movie deserves far better than that! Simply put, Noroi is (probably) one of the best horror movies I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot!). <br /> <br /> I really liked how the movie does not present itself as a standard horror flick, but as a documentary filmed by a reporter (I think?) named Kobayashi and his cameraman. Without pampering too much about the plot, I can say that it starts with Kobayashi researching a number of seemingly unrelated events that turn out to be associated with something far more darker and creepy. <br /> <br /> While history may not be the original in itself, what really hung me with Noroi was the incredibly eerie atmosphere. If you are looking for cheap scarecrows and seat jumping scenes, this movie may not be for you. This movie is about the mood it presents, with joking images and a general sense of preventive excitement. Documentary style film makes it just more legal to cultivate it. <br /> <br /> This has also helped much of the play, which is great but not perfect for the general part of the movie! Far better than most other movies in this type of genre. <br /> <br /> Well enough ranting from me, I highly recommend Noroi to everyone, it's exciting, scary, well-acted and the first movie that has scared me in ages.
