It must be said that the director of The Cell, Tarsem Singh, has easily established himself with his first function, which happens to be one of the most visually stunning films in contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> The Cell is more of a visceral experience than a movie. As a thriller, it rises over most of its peers with competent editing and a chilling score, providing an exceptionally exciting atmosphere. However, it is ultimately Tarsem's skill for elaborate and disturbing sets of designs and imagery that carry the film's appalling sense of terror. As with several recent films, I have been shocked by the alarming hypocrisy among those who have commented negatively on The Cell; In defense of the film, I will address some of these issues. The reason seems to be the main concern, and while it is not revolutionary and borrows heavily from the silence of the lamb, it was never meant to be the most important aspect of the film; The plot itself is a vehicle through which Tarsem's vision - at the same time frightening and wonderful - is presented to the public, much like the plot of the lamb's silence is secondary to the fascinating study of its two main characters, Lecter and Starling. While the silence of the lambs is clearly the superior film, it is irrational that one condemns the cell's plot, and in the same spirit praises the silence of the lamb. My final concern is the mention of "MTV style" directing. It makes me guilty of seeing the condemnation of directors using innovative camera and film techniques. A camera has the potential to be much more than just a tool for recording events; Angles, pans, color adjustments and so on are all used to their full extent in The Cell for the purpose of creating the feeling of a dreamlike state that could not otherwise be achieved. This is important for the film, since the whole premise behind it is visualization of a serial killer's subconscious. If you just want a series of static shots, stick to stage games and give up the cinema completely. <br /> <br /> Having said that, The Cell is thoroughly entertaining, scary and breathtaking in both pacing and design. Anyone who can see past - perhaps uninspired, but never boring - manuscript will find one of the best films in the year 2000.
