Gulliver's Travels is initially a satirical novel written by a great misanthropist called Jonathan Swift. So it is not recommended to judge by this movie alone. We must go deeper into human conscience to get to the point where Swift would have led us. Gulliver has lived a journey of truth, loneliness, for fear of what may be his true life. We can't just sit and watch the movie and say it's so cute or so boring. The case is far beyond that and I would like everyone to expect it. This is the greatest movie ever, as far as you can feel the truths that come from Ted Danson's character: the unforgettable Lemuel Gulliver.
