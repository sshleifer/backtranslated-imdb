The Duchess is a beautiful white cat who lives with her three kittens in her well-owned owner's house in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady leaves everything in her will to the cats first, the butler's anger is because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to bed and surrenders them from the roadside. When the cats wake up, they start a long trip home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets with them and offers to help them. When Edgar sees them coming home, he is furious and starts sending them to Timbucktu. But Thomas's friends will help save the day. The wealthy lady decides to leave her home for every spawning cat in Paris. <br /> <br /> This is a charming movie. The songs, including "Everybody Wants to be a Cat", are lively and optimal. Voting is excellent, with Eva Gabor (who would later play Miss Bianca in Disney's RESCUERS movie) as Duchess Phil Harris (Baloo in THE JUNGLE BOOK, Little John in ROBIN HOOD) as Thomas, who provides interesting personalities to their characters. Presumably, Walt Disney, before he died in 1966, gave way to this movie. Recommended for Disney fans or cat lovers everywhere! 10/10.
