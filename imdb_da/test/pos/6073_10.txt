From 1996, first I saw this movie, I never feel like reaching the end of my satisfaction, I feel like I will see more and more until now, my god I do not think it was ten years ago and I can believe it I remember almost every word in the dialogues. I love this movie and I love this novel, absolute perfection. I love Willem Defoe, he has a strange voice to spell the words "blackened" and I always say it too many times, never bored. I love Szararem's music, it's so much spiritualistic, made me get into another world deep in my heart. someone can feel what i feel and someone could make the movie like this? I do not believe that.
