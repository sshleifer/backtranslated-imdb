If you have enjoyed Butterfly Effect, Donnie Darko or The Machinist, you will also enjoy K-Pax. For me, this movie really felt uplifting and yet depressing in the end. Spacey delivers a fantastic performance as Prot. Let's not forget the look of Saul Williams in the movie, who I am a big fan of. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I recommended the movie to many of my friends and everyone was pretty much blown away. But it is still very underestimated, perhaps due to lack of action and explosions. I'm sorry it's not a movie about blowing things up, it's about how people behave and how people live in worlds that don't exist. Continue and enjoy.
