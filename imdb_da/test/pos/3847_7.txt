Walt Disney's 20th animated feature was the last to be the green light of the great man himself (he died in late 1966) and is generally not considered to be among their very best output. The main problem is that the movie seems to be the cat version of either LADY AND THE TRAMP (1955) or 101 DALMATIONS (1961), both of which are more loved by fans. Although it is both an animation and a cat lover, I dig this reasonable jumping competition where a spoiled female tax (pronounced by Eva Gabor) and her three little kittens are thrown out onto the streets of Paris by a wealthy lady (Hermione Baddeley )'s greedy butler. Fortunately, they meet a streetwise alley cat (Phil Harris) who heads them back on the journey and is further helped along the way by a cat jazz band (led by Scatman Crothers) and two helpful and amiably dopey dogs; Meanwhile, at home, Edgar Butler is celebrating his supposed legacy, and the mouse and horse do their bit to help their cats. The legendary entertainer Maurice Chevalier was whisked back from retirement to sing the title song (containing a verse in French) and Scatman's band pampering a breezy number "Ev'rybody will be a cat".
