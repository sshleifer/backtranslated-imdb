Shes man is great. It is fun, original and made me laugh so much that I almost wet my place. the day I went to see it in the cinema, I was not in the best mood (the man's problems) but left the film, I had a laugh plastered on my face. The story is a little out there, with no one noticing that she looks too much like a girl, but hey, who should I say what's credible, the jokes are good and some of the one lines in this 2006 hit could go down in history. Amanda B. did a great job as the lead, and Channing Tatum looks too good to be true as opposed to the beautiful Duke. So the girls go see this because it's a big laugh and there's a hot guy in it and boys you go see it because you might just learn something about girls! <br /> <br /> All in all, a brilliant, fantastic and fun movie that I want to buy on DVD when it comes out.
