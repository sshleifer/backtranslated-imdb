Rajkumar Santoshi tries his hands on comedy and succeeds. One of the few good films involving Salman Khan. A very fun movie from start to finish. All the characters contribute to the movie and believe in me, there are many of them. Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, Karishma Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Viju Khote, Jagdip, Deven Verma, Shakti Kapoor, Harish Patel, Tiku Talsania and more. The direction, editing, sound is not up to each other, but it still doesn't matter because the actors more than make up for that part.
