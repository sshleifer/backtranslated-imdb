"Subspecies," like many other horror films, get a raw deal on IMDb. The majority of film consultants have a heartfelt contempt for horror, and when they occasionally rent horror movies, they will either laugh at them or cringe for big horror scenes. Unfortunately, "Subspecies" are not very ridiculous, and not so bloody so it gets low. It's too bad. <br /> <br /> Of course there is enough to criticize here. The non-actors are flat, the subspecies are a bad special effect, and the night scenes are too brightly illuminated. But what do you expect? For a straight-to-video horror movie, "Subspecies" boasts decent production values ​​and more integrity than you might expect. The movie's Romanian setting is almost unique (I think it was the first American movie made in the country, post-communism), and the locations, both inside and out, are beautiful. The script has instant intelligence, especially when it comes to local folklore (all false, I'm sure). Somehow, place films and smart script work well together - "Subspecies" have their own very distinctive world. To risk condemning with weak praise ... it can be much more stupid. Fans of the more cruel aspects of horror will undoubtedly get a kick out of the bloodthirsty vampire cork, Radu. He is pretty efficient in this movie - powerful, with a memorable raspy voice - but I like him better in the sequels when actor Anders Hove gives a more self-parodying, campy performance. A completely sincere Radu is something stupid. Other stupid aspects include the free nudity and subspecies themselves, which are only evident in the film, because the producer Charles Band has a fetish for evil little creatures (see also puppet theater and demonic toys). <br /> <br /> But I also like the film's mistakes. For what it is - straight-to-video vampire horror - "Subspecies" is just fine. The successors boast of better production values, more violence and slightly more thoughtful story lines, so I recommend them even more highly. Yet this is not a bad start for the series.
