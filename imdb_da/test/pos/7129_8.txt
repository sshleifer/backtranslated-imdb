Better than the original, "Gamers: Dorkness Rising" manages to avert a fun comedy with great actors, fine special effects and comedies that exceed the "gamer" knowledge base and do it on a low budget. I have seen many low budget films that have been terrible and almost none that have been as good as their high budget counterparts. This movie blows away most common movies! Parts are a little weak (bit with pirates and ninjas - while it's fun - go a little long without explanation and take you out of the movie a bit), but generally it's a very strong movie. <br /> <br /> I'm very happy to say I bought this movie as soon as I saw it and brought it home. <br /> <br /> Any chance we can look forward to another feature of Gamers movies from these guys? :)
