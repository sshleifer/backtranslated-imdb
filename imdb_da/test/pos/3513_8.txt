I have been waiting nearly 25 years to find it hard to find horror thriller and I finally did, as it is the correct rebirth on DVD. Of course it has not had the same effect on me as it would have if I had seen it in the 80s, but director Lieberman (his movie "Squirm" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely Oregon location and takes the time to Develop the characters, not just to get them sent in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really scary and adds the desolate action that makes this fun for genres. One must see if you like underrated horror movies. Describing it would be an intelligent "Friday the 13th" sprinkled with some tasty bits of "release." With one side there are some really cool and original moments like my favorite when a couple swims in a lake and the guy disappears underwater to play a trick on his gal - just when you think it's the usual scare, she suddenly sees out to land and ... I honestly can't spoil it - you just have to see it yourself. The end is also just one of those that you just have to see to believe ?? It came out of nowhere and it is strange and wild! The DVD contains comments from Lieberman.
