One of my wishes is to be the filmmaker, and I just have to say that I can't compete with the powerful drama The War at Home. The reason is because the play is perfect, and when you see the movie, you will know what I'm talking about. All I can suggest is seeing it, I got so involved in it and was extremely impressed. Estevez and Sheen's relationship on the screen was absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> And that was his relationship with his mother (Kathy Bates). Some of the best scenes include those 2. <br /> <br /> as well as the relationship between Sheen and his daughter, Estevez's sister in the movie. <br /> <br /> 10/10, and certainly in my top 10. I want the DVD!
