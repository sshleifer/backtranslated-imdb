"The Cell" is an exotic masterpiece, a staggering trip to not only the great mind of a serial killer but also to one of a very talented director. This is vital evidence of what can be achieved if people release their unrestrained beliefs. This is boldness in the workplace that pushes thoughts to fall into formulas and clich√©s and create something truly magnificent. This is the best movie this year to date. <br /> <br /> I've read many complaints about this movie, anywhere from all styles and no stuff to badly throwing characters and bad plays. To negatively criticize this movie is to miss that point. This movie can be a landmark, a tradition where future films will hopefully follow. "The Cell" has just opened the door to another world of fantasy. Then we can slam the door in the face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh, whom we don't want anymore? Personally, I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem, and would love to see someone try to challenge him. <br /> <br /> We've all heard talk of entering a serial killer's mind, and yes, I agree that the "genre" is a little overtime. The 90s were full of movies trying to portray what makes serial killers some of them worked, but most failed. But "The Cell" is not blowing down the same track, we are getting a new twist, we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject ever explored. <br /> <br /> I like how the movie doesn't hit us with too much scientific jargon and try to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets into another. Instead, she lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really tall Twizzlers and is hunted in another unit. "The Cell" will let you "see" what it's all about and not "how" it's about and I think that's what some people don't like. It is true that I like explanations with my movies, but when a movie wakes up on new ground, let it do what it wants and just take it in. <br /> <br /> I noticed how the film was very dark as it showed reality, perhaps to contrast the bright images when they are inside another brain. Nevertheless, the set design was simply amazing. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie took home a couple of Oscars in movies, best costumes, best director and the like. If it were up to me, it would at least be nominated for the best picture. <br /> <br /> I have noticed that I have the form to repeat myself. Not because there is nothing else to say, but because I can't stress how amazing I thought "The Cell" was. If you go into the movie with a very open mind and have it taken over by wonders and an eye-catching party, then you are sure of a good time. I suppose this movie was a little too much for some people, writing it out as "strange" or "crazy". I am very much into the psychology and imagination of the human mind, so it was just down my alley. After leaving the theater, I heard an audience say: "The one who made that movie did a lot of good stuff." If yes, I want what he smoked. <br /> <br /> **** (out of 4)
