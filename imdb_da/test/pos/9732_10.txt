It's the kind of movie you're renting when you're incredibly tired or degraded in another way ... The action in this movie is so bad it works intentionally, and to tell you how bad the special effects are, is there a scene when the dolls come to life, where you can see most of a hand holding the doll, moving it over. The movie looked like it was filmed with a video camera. When I watched this movie for the first time, a fistfight almost erupted when my friends and I called each other names from this flick, it was so terrible it was. If you enjoy getting angry with movies, I recommend it to you, otherwise flee as if your life was dependent on it.
