This movie is fun in more ways than one. It has action. It has humor. It has an attitude. It has Dolemite's whole girl army of kung-fu at! And that's just what the movie offers as a movie. It's also badly listed by some, the microphone makes more than a cameo look, and some "beats" miss at the feet. But when you make a movie, so cool, who has time to pay attention to these "details"? This movie clips. Rent it tonight if you can find it ... I had to buy it to see it, but I don't regret it!
