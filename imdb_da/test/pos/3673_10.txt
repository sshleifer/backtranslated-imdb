I absolutely love this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it in the video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in it, so I figured it should be worth it, do you know? I saw it for the first time just by shaking my head. . . what? Then it was the last scene, and I thought I was hurt by smiling so hard. I clicked "play movie" and saw it all over again. It is undoubtedly the shameful movie I've ever seen. But the more I see it, the more I love it. It's absurd and crazy and sweet and dear. Kathy Bates is impeccable, but the rest of the molding is also fabulous. What odd signs are they all! The midget is just too fun for words. And Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow are hysterical. It's just a fun, fabulous movie. I want to see it again. The one who sees it for the first time, keep it out to the end. It is worth it!
