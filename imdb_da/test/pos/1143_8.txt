I agree with msinabottle; This is a great movie. Here are some dialogue packages: <br /> <br /> Raisuli (Sean Connery) to Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen): "You see the man in the well, how he draws the water? When a bucket empties, the other fills it At the moment you are full of power, but you are wasting it, wasted, and Islam is putting up the drops as they leap from your bucket. "<br /> <br /> Raisuli: The English has paid very well earlier. Pedecaris: Well, you don't have your way with the Americans. President Roosevelt wants your head. Raisuli: Roosevelt. This President Roosevelt - he would try to take it himself? Pedecaris: He certainly wanted! He is a man of grist and strong moral fiber. He does not kidnap women and children! Raisuli: What kind of riff does he use? Pedicure: And Winchester! Raisuli: Winchester. Winchester. I have no knowledge of this rifle. Pedecaris: You want to. <br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt (Brian Keith): The American Grizzly Bear is a symbol of the American character: strength, intelligence, wildness. A small blind and ruthless at times, but brave over any doubt. Oh, and another move goes along with everyone before. Newspaper reporter: And that, Mr President? Teddy Roosevelt: Loneliness. The bear lives alone in his life. Irrepressible. Undefeated. But always alone. He has no real allies, only enemies - but none of them is as big as he is. Newspaper reporter: Do you feel this can be an American move? Teddy Roosevelt: Determined. The world will never love us. It can respect us. It can even grow to fear us. But it will never love us. Because we have too much cheek. And we are also a bit blind and ruthless at times too.
