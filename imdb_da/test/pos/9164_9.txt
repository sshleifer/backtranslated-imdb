I would recommend this as the most successful attempt so far to make a movie about Soviet Afghan war. And it is very honest and responsible image from small details of uniforms and weapons up to human relations, war routine and Central Asian landscapes. It has been shot in Tajikistan right after the troop shooting, which occurred in 1989 not in 1985. The Italian star Mr. Placido was just perfect in the role of Major Bandura. Other figures also looked very natural, especially always the dunk club's managing officer :-). The scenario seems a bit stuck at the end, but it can be an influence of the civil war in Tajikistan, which started right during the film's recording. All movie teams had to escape sometimes, even under fire. The last scene is purely "harakiri" type of behavior and reminded me of the final sentence of a famous samurai movie - "We've won all the battles but lost the war". It could also be a metaphor for the collapse of the Soviet Union - the great country makes it possible to shoot itself to the back of the little offended child.
