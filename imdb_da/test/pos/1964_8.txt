This movie is one of the best in 1986 with scary but exciting performances from Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper! The Reagan years were pretty bleak for many people, not just teenagers, but this flick really caught desperation and despair. Well controlled with a large script (apparently based on a true story) I do not see any weaknesses in this. The opening shot was brilliant. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves was decent for a change and Miss Skye was right on the money. Hopper had three other fantastic performances that year (Blue Velvet, Texas Chainsaw II and Hoosiers). I imagine this has a cult following, and I wonder how that image would fare if it was reissued. Super thing!
