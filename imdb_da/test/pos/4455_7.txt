Seen in and near a poor working class town in the mountains of rural Italy it is a story of madness. The landscape can be quite picturesque, but there is madness in it, hidden behind the mask of a person who seems outwardly normal. This person kills young children. In style and tone, this movie resembles Dario Argento's famous Italian giallo, the fascinating whodunit horror movie, except that Argento's movie looks much better. However, the pictures in Fulci's "Do not Torture A Duckling" are competent, with some interesting compositions and lighting. Lightning and thunder on a rainy night improves the excitement in an order where one of the "ducklings" is vulnerable alone. In a number, do a little overdone. But there is no slasher movie. A legitimate theme undergoes history. And the theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms, not just the obvious delusions of people who practice voodoo or black magic. <br /> <br /> Lots of red herring makes the puzzle solution difficult if the viewer does not base on the agenda of the director. Don't dismiss anyone who may not seem to be a suspect. The twist near the end gives good misdirection. In a scene in between, however, a line of dialogue could be added to clarify the relationship between two characters, one of which is the killer. The film's final takes place on a beautiful mountain top with the wind flute in the background. We see flashbacks on track and gain insight into the murderer's thinking. <br /> <br /> I don't care about the movie's widescreen projection. But background music is effective and ranges from crunching scary at the beginning to low-key jazz to native Italian songs. Action is generally average, but in some cases it is a bit overdone. Although not as visually brilliant as Argento's giallos, "Do not Torture A Duckling" is nevertheless a great movie, one that contains a thematic story and plenty of a whodunit puzzle to interest most viewers who like thrillers. and murder mysteries.
