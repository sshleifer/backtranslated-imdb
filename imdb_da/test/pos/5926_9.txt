The word impossible has caused many to choose a particular view regarding an incredible task. In 1927, it was assumed that no one could fly the Atlantic Ocean. Many had tried, but failed, and some even gave their lives to the effort. Nevertheless, it had to be done because every challenge must be met with equal determination. Such is the heart of this movie called "St. Louis Spirit". The actor selected for this historic movie is none other than America's own James Stewart, who convincingly plays Charles Lindbergh. Although there are many aspects of Lindbergh's life, this is the segment that strives to be the first man to fly across the Atlantic. The story is an interesting and for Stewards' fans compelling to say the least. Seeking money to build a special aircraft for the fateful decision to start the journey on a gloomy day in May 1927, was "Luck Lindy" as he was baptized, enduring huge risks found in this amazing movie. Other remarks that helped make this movie credible are Murray Hamilton, who plays Bud Gurney, Bartlett Robinson as Ben Mahoney, Arthur Space, and Charles Watts as O.W. Schultz. The sum of this now famous movie is that, despite bad endorsements on its debut, it has become classic in its own right. Well done! ****
