Wow.this is a moving story! First I saw 'Rescue Dawn'. I didn't like it. And now I've seen the person, Dieter Dengler, about who this story is told by Herzog. Very impressive. Dieter is a driven man who encountered the opposite feelings in his life on this earth. What an extraordinary life this person has suffered. His tale of Patet Lao / Vietcong's capture and hence his suffering is horrible, but the most impressive is his incredible will to survive. How could he find the strength? In a joking way, Dieter tells us in complete sentences about his terrible trial during his captivity ... he is a great narrator and Herzog makes him the justice this brave man deserves. <br /> <br /> In my opinion. 'Little Diets Must Fly' tells everything! that leaves nothing to the imagination, making 'rescue dawn' an excess film. The fear is no more real than in Dieter Dengler's words. He totally succeeds in painting the picture.
