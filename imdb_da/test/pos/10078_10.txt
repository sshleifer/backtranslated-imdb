It is strange how the least known movies sometimes end up with the best you have seen. This movie has all the elements of a standard modern thriller, pistols, techno, evil, money, etc. And yet your average Hollywood stands out as well. I would credit this for two very charismatic people. Christopher Walken has a cold confidence, and Lorraine Bracco is one of the hottest and sexiest women I've ever seen on the screen. Another important reason why this movie stands out is that the setting switches to Jamaica after the start. The Jamaican resort is so beautiful you will wish you were there by the pool at night, with a Run'n'Coke. . . I know I did. I am very glad I saw this movie - it was just too good to miss!
