An unfortunate reality in post-Soviet Russia was that people's welfare did not change much from Soviet times. As we see in the "Window of Paris", most are still as depressed as ever while encouraged to go for money. <br /> <br /> So everything changes to music teacher Nikolai Chizhov (Sergei Dontsov) after finding a window leading to Paris. He and his friends are, of course, quite amazed at what they find. This movie has one of the funniest discussions by Elvis Presley and Edith Piaf I've ever heard. Then watch this movie. You're sure to love it. It's a kind of precursor to being John Malkovich.
