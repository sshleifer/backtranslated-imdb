In America, Jewish Jonathan Safran Foer (Elijah Wood) brings personal belongings from his family to memory. A few moments before he dies, his grandmother gives an old photograph of his grandfather with a woman named Augustine in Ukraine. Jonathan contacts Odessa Heritage Tours, a family agency in Ukraine, to lead him to the place where the picture was taken to find Augustine, and together with interpreter Alex (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather and a strange dog, they travel in An Old car looking for the missing past of Jonatson's family. "Everything is enlightened" is a strange movie about a strange young man with the compulsive behavior of collecting souvenirs from his family not to forget those who are seeking past of his grandfather to understand how could be his life if his grandfather had not moved to the United States. This bizarre vegetarian character encounters a dysfunctional Ukrainian family who owns an amateur travel agency specialized in helping Jews find missing relatives, and together they have an almost surreal journey through Ukraine. The film begins as a comedy, with a sarcastic black humor, ending in a touching and tragic drama recommended for particular audiences.
