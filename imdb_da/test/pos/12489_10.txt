The director loves the actress and it shows. The actor is in the character we love at first sight and sound. The character loves his monstrous unprepossessing husband and he loves her. His childhood friends secretly love his wife and the fact that his friend is a beautiful woman makes love tragic and ironic. His wife is jealous of her childhood wife and thinks her attention is out of secret love to her husband. <br /> <br /> Then there is a murder and the investigating police lieutenant who only loves his bi-racial son and rejects his company of the above-mentioned signs who have had an unpleasant contact with the deceased and all lie in Somehow, the unravels mystery with some of the most accurate and authentic procedural details ever captured on film. /> And then there is the atmosphere of a post-war Austria in Paris, where coal is scarce, music is full of erotic longing and wistful memory, and innocence has long been washed away by the rain. /> <br /> All this in an environment of magicians whose tricks do not always work, dogs walking on their hind legs and expressing music criticism, hungry news reporters and exhausted police. And then there are many of the finest actors in their generation who have gone through some very bad scars led by coming in full circle, a man who is in love with his leading actress and who with full justice was a respected friend by Picasso. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie often and I love them all and that.
