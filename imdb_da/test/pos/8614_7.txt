As selected under Quinzaine des Réalisateurs, in 2002, Catherine Breillat is masterfully divided halfway through her autobiographical film, with her lead, Anne Parillaud (La Femme NIKITA, Luc Besson) admiring admirably the film director of "Intime Scenes". <br /> <br /> This is a comedy of the actors' manners. The preparation of ? Movie genre? Pornography or Exhibitionism? Sex is Comedy is a postmodern movie with its script based on a movie in the movie. As an implosive story of a minimalist love scene, the film is built with constant solidarity between the forms and the spirit, where Breillat continues to break and analyze the taboos. Using visual codes and certain form of the formula, Catherine Breillat implements her clinical analysis of sexuality as an isolated problem outside of society communicated by the heart's door. Therefore, Grégoire Colin (Good Work, Nénette et Boni, Claire Denis, The Dreamlife of Angels, Eric Zonca) in the actor and Roxanne Mesquida (Fat Girl, Catherine Breillat, Marie from Angels Bay, Manuel Prada), the actor, are actors like her finds out she clarifies in an interview. Imagine observing the man in front of himself, a throwing man. Then, Breillat films the shame and sexual mutilation, but also a great hope, a disturbing dimension of the ecstasy, a sober of the emotions, the halves of the exhibits, and plays to be one to be one. Finally, the director is expected to lead the actors to give their feelings, their body and their soul. So arranged, facing the problem of the order of "who I am", Breillat's actors took an inorganic vitality to merge into his ongoing work. But for what is a form of incredible exorcism, for Breillat puts Breillat many questions of an actor. Persistent at the same time a great deal of suffering, the actors seem to be the ones who are looking for this loving transport, to be part of the eternity of their work. <br /> <br /> The Art of Breillat is a researcher, knowing how to conduct a dialogue aimed at pushing the boundaries of intimate scenes. Participating in make-up, prosthesis in erection and syndicates is not without reminding which images and scenes Jan Steens and Rembrandt could be in anecdotal and daily signs of a shooting game. While the moral categories disappear from the Sex Is Comedy, Breillat succeeds in revealing the actors' loving imitation force in a landscape of formidable and dramatic humanity.
