The video opens with a scene from a horror movie where a man suggests his girlfriend. He begins to tell her that he is "different". As the full moon rises, he becomes a werewolf. He pursues her through the forest, and just before he attacks, we are taken into the cinema. Inside the theater is Michael and his girlfriend. She is too scared to look further so they leave. When they leave the theater, he begins to justify her. ("It is close to midnight, something evil lurks in the dark ...") Michael sings and dances his way down the street with his girlfriend. This scene shows Michael's skill with the camera. He never even works "consciously" of his presence, as many other artists do. As they get there past the cemetery, the grave begins to open ... When they arrive at an alley, they are confronted with a horde of undead. So we see Michael's girl's scared face. Who wouldn't have a horror beaten look if their date morphed into a zombie? Yes, he becomes one of the undead. (A very bright and shiny.) He and his fellow zombians then begin what may be the most well-known dance choreography of any music video. Telling you more would give the end away. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite music video all the time! You won't miss it! I give it a 10/10. (Yes, I know you can see the curtains at the back of the sound stage, and the werewolf looks a bit cheesy from today's standards.)
