What some Hollywood movies try and hardly ever do, somehow creates metaphysical connections between people (without becoming unrealistic), this beautiful movie manages very well (similar to the wonderful 'La Double Vie de Veronique' by the same director and with the same beautiful actress). This is a REAL movie that slightly changes the perspective of life - intelligent and beautiful story, masterfully directed, excellent main actors, masterful filmography. I just watched the movie the third or fourth time, and I still think it's one of the best I've ever seen. And if you were to be dissatisfied with the end of 'White' - 'Red' puts a happy end to the whole trilogy.
