... just as valuable as King Tut's tomb! (OK, maybe not so valuable, but worth chasing if you can). I note that no one has commented on this movie for some years and I hope a new post will rub some new comments. This is a movie I only remembered and I only saw recently when I was tired of waiting for Fox to honor his own past and chased the Korean DVD (in English but with unremovable Korean subtitles). I will not go through another long plot description - enough to say that seeing it for the first time in its actual widescreen format left me agape on the prospect and reach of the movie. The math paintings still hold up and the palace is truly breathtaking. But it's the smaller-scale details that lend this film its depth and wealth, and give a glimpse of the lifestyles of Egypt's poor as well as its elite. The bazaars, paddles, docks, embalming houses and tavernas are as fascinating as Pharaoh's throne room. While there are many large-scale errors (especially the dynasty succession), the details are more carefully examined than the vast majority of Hollywood films. Visually, it is not without its faults - the interior is often too light and colorful to blend seamlessly with the outside. Nevertheless, it is a movie to be credited for being so bold in the little one it is in the big one. Boring? In parts, absolutely. Overacted? Underacted? Yes, both - although "discreet" may be a more appropriate description. Too far? Absolutely not. I wanted them to spend more time with Sinuhe's experiences in the Death House, and among the Hittite, and less with his 'romance' with Nefer. Historically incorrect? Yes, that too, but it was also Shakespeare. Nobody chastises him for that. I appreciate historical accuracy as much as the next guy, but in the end it should be remembered that the cinema is theater, not a history lesson.
