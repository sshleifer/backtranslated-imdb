Wallace & Gromit have been around for some time, but it was their first foray on the silver screen. Fans of the British television series, like myself, were eager to watch them, and the movie did quite well in the theaters. Much of the reason is that the film is fun and completely original. In the world of CG movies such as SHREK and TOY STORY, this stop-motion movie is a great alternative to the development of children's films and being completely unlike a cartoon. Plus, compared to much earlier stop-motion movies (such as KING KONG and Ray Harryhausen movies like SINBAD), the character and movement of the characters is bright years better - looks very fluid, natural and more alive. <Br /> <br /> Apart from the quality of animation, this movie also deserves kudos at all other levels. First of all, the voters do a good job. Secondly, the manuscript is very simple, but also very sweet and comfortable - with a couple of double-pointers who are likely to go far beyond the children's heads. Third, they manage to make this not just a movie for children, but people of all ages like the movie are neither saccharin nor exclusively aimed at the younger audience. Especially, I was captivated by the incredibly sweet movie was - and especially the adorable rabbits. I especially liked them in the final credits - which made me very happy that I kept watching the whole movie. The bottom line is that unless you are a real cloth in mud, will enjoy this movie. It's fresh, fun and incredibly wise. I hope we see a sequel - and that says something that I usually hate followers.
