I don't understand why critics would bash this movie. It's a teenage movie that is actually serious, which is a rarity. I admit there are moments that are very juicy, but let's talk about young love, it must be juicy to be valid. My biggest complaint is Chris Klein. While he was fun in American Pie, he is apparently not ready to switch to a more dramatic ticket yet, he is very uncomfortable in some of his "mama stuff". Hartnett and Sobieski, on the other hand, show a remarkable amount of depth and credibility, just like the parents'. Although the manuscript is heavily clipped with the lovers who play poetry, the actor makes it work. The management sports some powerful images on the screen. Beautiful filmography, great music, great young actors, I was impressed, and I'm a shocked critic when it comes to teen movies.
