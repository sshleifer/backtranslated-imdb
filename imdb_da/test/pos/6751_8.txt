I found this little gem as an extra feature on my DVD by Vampyr-Der Traum Des Allen Gray, and didn't expect so much from it. It looked like it could be an interesting little card, though, so I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I did. It was truly incredible! In spite of being made over 70 years ago, the animation was, in my opinion, better than anything that was done today with all the computer effects and experiences now available. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple-a newly assembled toy dog ​​hears its owner's honors not to afford an orange and goes on the quest to find her. In the process, it runs into a toy's underworld with all kinds of scary creatures and toys watched by none other than the devil himself, who all want the dog's orange to themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie is happening but reminds me of a lot of Mad Monster Party? (1969, Jules Bass) - a film I've always had, and to a lesser extent, some of Tim Burton's animated works-The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993, Henry Selick) and Corpse Bride (2005, Tim Burton). Fans of any of these movies I will surely also love The Mascot. All in all, a great piece of short animation worth seeing.
