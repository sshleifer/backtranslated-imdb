Here is one of the more comfortable scuzzy 70's blaxploitation grindhouse elements; It is a pervasively low purity pimp opus that comes across as a sleazier version of "The Mack." John Daniels, the studly womanizing hairdresser hero Mr. Jonathan in the immortal "Black Shampoo" provides an excellent Steely depiction of Baron, a ruthless, business savvy, forever making peddle of almighty how much to the dismay of his bitter, brutal Italian rivals rule at the top of the Sunset Strip . When he does not lock horns with his friends who do not count criminals or do their best to avoid being busted by the local vice police, Daniels leads a sweet average existence as your standard garden-black suburbanite guy (complete with caring wife and loving children !) in some typical humdrum California small town. The ugly absurd performance alone promises the highest trashy grandeur of a particular Grade B schlock image variety (George Theakos deserves kudos for his hilariously ludicrous script). Matt Cimbers imposing tactile and tasteful direction delivers the unwanted items of the slimy bucketful, making this film an extremely comfortable serving of celluloid dirt. Among the various crisp delights to taste here are ample free feminine nudity, rough dialogue, beautifully beautiful ten year olds (lame peaks, felt hats, glittering Day-Glo jewelry, high seersucker suits), an intense funky R&B score by Smoke, some hopelessly pathetic plays (the little old lady living next to Daniels, is terribly sharp), Patrick Wright as a sadistic goon, a couple of cool action pieces (the climatic slow motion barroom massacre boils seriously ), more lurid travelogue footage of Sunset Strip than you can shake a feather boa on (said footage supposedly includes "the actual hookers and leaves of the Sunset Strip in Hollywood"), effectively dark'n'dingy filmography by Ken Gibb, a couple sicko sexual fetish tableaux, some raw explicit violence (a prostitute has one of his breasts cut off!), and entertaining support performances by well-known schlock feature perennials Richard Kennedy and George "Buck" Flower as a pair of racist, k inexperienced browbeating police detectives. Sure, this movie is not art, but it is certainly unclear enough to qualify as a delicious grungy chunk of entertaining sordid cinematic swim.
