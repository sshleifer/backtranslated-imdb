Aaah ... Thing. <br /> <br /> To watch a horror movie where every single character over the age of 30, but apparently not appealing, makes a refreshing change and reminds me of the distant times when actors were selected for their talent and their the ability to play realistic characters, rather than because of their teenager complaint on a magazine cover. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and a film photographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over-shaped parodies. And there is no gimmicky 'twist' ending, or cameo celebrity look, or lame pseudo-romantic subplot. <br /> <br /> And I really miss out on physical effects; with all the 20 year old children trying to make crazy new ideas with blood and latex and early animatronics. In the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, an American werewolf in London, The Thing, Wolves Company, a nightmare on Elm Street ... what an era of horror effects! And don't let me get started because of the death of the food painting. The math work in this movie is beautiful and smooth. <br /> <br /> What do we have now? Third rate CGI, former music video directors and professional stylists that make even "gritty" horror movies look like glossy MTV videos. <br /> <br /> Now I have to go Netflix 'The Howling'.
