I saw this on DVD with subtitles, which made it a bit frustrating to get through because of the movie's length. But I was ridden all over. The fact that I was fascinated by the characters and always engrossed in history, despite the subtitles, is a testament to the power of the film. It's a great job. I have it on my list of ten favorite movies all the time. It's easily the best foreign movie I've seen in the last twenty years or so. I would like to know the full story behind the production of this movie. It must have taken a very long time and required the use of hundreds of sites. Its use of some hardcore scenes (on TV in the motel room) can unfortunately cause some people not to see it, but if you don't mind them, you will be deeply moved by all the stories in this one!
