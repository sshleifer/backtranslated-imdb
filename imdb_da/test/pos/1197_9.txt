Hair is one of my favorite films of all time. Even not being part of my generation, I have already seen this movie 9 times, and I can't get enough with the beautiful message of understanding, passion, beauty and love. This film is against the Vietnam War and shows how people should unite independently of color, origin, religions and classes. I love the characters Berger and Woof, and I think Central Park in the 70s is one of the most beautiful places I have already seen in my life. <br /> <br /> By the way, I still have this music in my heart: <When the moon is in the seventh house and jupiter targets Mars, peace will guide the planets and love will control the stars. <br /> <br /> This is the dawning of the Aquarius age The age of Aquarius Aquarius! Aquarius! <br /> <br /> Harmony and Understanding Sympathy and Confidence in Abundance No More Lies or Decisions Valid Living Dreams of Visions Mysterious Crystal Revelation And the True Liberation of the Mind Aquarius! Aquarius! <br /> <br /> ps: I'm surprised to see that the director of this movie is the same director of AMADEUS. I just love both movies!
