Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art house, live-action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus movies are always a problem, but I have always had a great interest in them. I now evaluate the segments individually. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Roeg - "Un ballo in maschera" - This segment may well ruin the movie for some people, because it is definitely the worst of the whole group. It's hard to follow, mostly because it tries to stick to a clear plot (a hackneyed one). The photograph is unfulfilled. The best thing about it is the bit of lesbian homoerotica that it never does enough with. This segment made me very nervous about continuing. 10.2. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - "La virgine degli angeli" - an unclear segment, but it hardly means anything. The film has the best film art at the bottom, primarily because it is in a fantastic black and white. The segment is dreamy and beautiful. 10.7. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - "Armide" - I chose to brave this very malignant movie for the Godard and Altman segments. With Godard I was much more impressed than I thought I would be. I can't claim to have seen all those many of his films since he made so many that almost no one has seen, but judging by what I've seen, this can be his best work since the 60s. It is the funniest segment of this movie, and the most artistic one. Bravo, Jean-Luc! 10.9. <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - "Rigoletto" - a very fun segment, it's also quite predictable. Still, this story of a man and wife cheating each other in the same resort is wonderfully preoccupied with long, complex tracking images that depend on just-timed choreography from the actors. It also has a great self-referring joke about the omnibus movie itself. The final scene is very weak. 10.7. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - "Die tote Stadt" - this short segment involves for lovers in (I think) Venice. It's beautiful, with some beautiful shots of pigeons flying around the city. It's small but good. 10.7. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - "Les Bor√©ades" - not one of the better segments, unfortunately, is more of a music video than a concept movie. It involves residents of an insane asylum participating in a theater performance. The music and the pictures work well together, so I can at least give it credit for being a good music video. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Franc Roddam - "Liebestod" - somewhat unfortunate for Beresford's segment, this segment is very similar. As you might assume from my wording, this hit me much more. It's about a young man and his girl going to Las Vegas on a fatalistic journey. 8.10. Ken Russell - "Nessun dorma" - perhaps the most visually striking segment, plays it in a fantasy world more than in reality. It's a beautiful tale of a fallen angel. 8.10. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - "Depuis le jour" - I've heard a lot about Jarman and this is the first piece of film I've seen from him. Hopefully I will see more in the future. This is also music-video-like, but it's better than Altman's segment. It's mainly about an old woman who remembers her younger days. The editing and use of different movie stores to represent both time and emotion is very beautiful. 8.10. Bill Bryden - "In pagliacci" - the sad clown, possibly one of the most famous arias (especially memorable from an episode of Seinfeld), serves this as the material that separates each segment and final. It's simple and efficient. 10.7. Overall, I give it a solid 7/10. It's not nearly as bad as you've heard.
