I enjoyed this movie and after it's finished it still makes you think about it. I think Jeremy Brett is brilliant in this role, though his "dead" is a little over the top, but like his Jeremy Brett, I didn't mind. <br /> <br /> This is a good piece of drama and closely follows Oscar Wildes novel. If you enjoy this movie, I also recommend watching "An Ideal Man" with Jeremy Brett as Lord Goring. <br /> <br /> This film gives a good insight into Oscar Wildes' way of thinking. And while you see it, the viewer recalls how Dorian Gray is Lord Alfred's bosie Douglas and Basil Halward's Oscar Wilde.
