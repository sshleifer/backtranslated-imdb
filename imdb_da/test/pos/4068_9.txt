Despite all the negative criticism, I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not saying that easily. I love movies and are pretty picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9000 movies - some are good, others are ok, some I don't like). And to everyone with criticism: this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It's easy, fun and very relaxing. I'm aware of all (or most) shortcomings, but I love it. The comic talents of Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro are dropped (fully - for this type of movie). Don't compare it to other movies with these star players, just enjoy it. Cast is great and I think the purpose of this movie was fully achieved. If you want a really "light" and very relaxed night - watch this movie. DeNiro and Murphy simply had fun making this movie, so we should (see it). And please, don't be so negative. Don't expect godfather performance or meet the parents of DeNiro, don't expect comedy blockbuster performance from Murphy ... It's a completely different genre and it made me relax after a hard day's work. Your pages should not be divided from laughter, but it is still very fun.
