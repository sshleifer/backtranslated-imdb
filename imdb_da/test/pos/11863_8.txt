Each guy Liv Tyler meets her head over her, not of course without any slight encouragement from Liv. Life is on her beautiful best, with Matt Dillon tops among the paramours. Interesting preliminary premise, telling the story from the perspective of each pigeon, degenerates into the sitcom-style finale (not unlike the Blame It On Rio as it has more than a few similarities). Worth looking at.
