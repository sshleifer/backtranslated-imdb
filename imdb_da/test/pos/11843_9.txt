Joe (Wes) & Jim (Adam) recognize us with beauty, isolation (psychological as well as physical) and complete terror of "murdering most birds" in Navaho Southwest. Characterizations, settings and plot are continually being built ... although at times, the personal asides leave us wanting "more" ... with some interesting alternative choices to "who did it?" Flashbacks (eg Peter Fonda ... good to see him) give a trace, but they don't go where you might think. Comic asides (eg the priest) are mild and appropriate. Where "Skinwalkers" and "Coyote Waits" begin to pull ... "Thief" engages the clutch and the four-wheelers around the next corner, never quite sure what's there. Disagree with Joe Leaphorn's manic comment on Jim Chee to "slow down" the slag. Wrong ... there are no potholes in the plot, just traces to follow. Continue to the next episode! Fantastic photography (as always), appealing characters and more to explore!
