Spoiler Alert I worked as an extra on this Lifetime TV movie (filmed in Seattle). It's really interesting when you take part in the production of a movie because they are usually still writing parts (as was the case here) or editing cuts and big changes from the last parts. <Br /> <br /> My husband and I both worked as extras in this movie and I remember them discussing on the set how it was not yet decided whether the little girl would eventually die. Frankly, I never thought Margaret Colin's character really got enough punishment for her crime of stroke and race, lying to the police, covering up, etc. Can you imagine how the ending would have had to change if she ended up with To kill here and run victim instead of ending up coming out of her coma, okay? Just something to think about. <br /> <br /> By the way, I play a police detective that you can see for a second, and my husband plays another detective, you can see quite often (we've talked four times). Margaret Colin was great to work with and much down to earth, even though Lisa Vidal (now a Lifetime Regular) was set aside. Overall, the movie turned out to be about a 7/10, but as another poster commented, is still a real tear-jerk and makes a good Saturday afternoon cable flick.
