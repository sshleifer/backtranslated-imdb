Surprisingly, witty, fun and completely engaging, the film takes a little known reality: the student studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is good when the story starts, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story sometimes goes away from the protagonist, but the viewer doesn't like it - the film is young, fresh and light even though I don't agree with the idea that when You do Erasmus and you come back, you are no longer part of this universe. But it's just me. The film is deep and at the same time very light. Cool and advisable.
