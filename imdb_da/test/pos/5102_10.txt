I saw this movie when it first came out and didn't know what to expect exactly. What followed Overture was one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've ever had. A lush score of songs and music by Britisher Leslie Bricusse (by Doctor Doolittle & Wilie Wonka and Chocolate Factory fame as well as putting his mark on the Broadway musical scene) and scored by the incomparable John Williams. There is not a bad song in the whole movie. Plus some of the most exquisite movie, costume designs and movie sites I've ever seen in a movie. Not to mention Oscar-nominated performances by Peter O'Toole, and the equally strong performance, in my opinion, by the wonderful Petula Clark. Now that Peter is not the same caliber, a singer, Petula, is still able to sell her songs to the audience, and after all it is. This is a faithful adaptation of the excellent book by James Hilton, and deserves to be appreciated in future generations. I recommend this movie for family viewing, although most men will consider this a "chick" flick. But if you like a really good movie musical, then this movie is for you. But be warned that a Kleenex standby box is as important as popcorn for your viewing experience.
