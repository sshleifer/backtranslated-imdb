This is one of the best non-English shows I've seen. It weaves interesting, simple and double episodes of crime solution along with a personal aspect that you just don't get in CSI. The individual characters all have personal lives that combine well with their daily jobs and meanwhile disturb. In addition, all the signs manage to develop naturally through the episodes. <br /> <br /> Casting is great and it was lost all over the country, giving a good example of the highlights that majestic countries have to offer. Unfortunately, only 32 episodes were made, but they are in top class television. Here they hope to consider making several episodes of the same caliber.
