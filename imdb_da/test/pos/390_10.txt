Cam Archer's lyrical Bobby crush boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope that is a youngster's desire for a lush reproduction (beautifully photographed by Aaron Platt), which is more vibe than narrative. Captured somewhere between documentary and dream, Bobbycrush reminds of the ingenuity of early Todd Haynes and the living hyperrealism of Gus van Sant. With grin, glamor and heartbreak, it's a bit like the movie equivalent of Sonic Youth playing bubblegum pop.
