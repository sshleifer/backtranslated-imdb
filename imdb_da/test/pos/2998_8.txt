I don't go for so many "heist" comedies, and I can't take care of this if it wasn't for the actors when it was made and then I first SAW it (just a few years later). It's almost too similar to "The Happening" (although of course it's a much less serious comedy than the one). Mafia figure takes over its own kidnapping, or rather than in a completely different direction. Of course, Raquel Welch did not play the kind of sharp character Faye Dunaway did in The Happening, but it also does not make sexist films - she played almost a character, almost the HER version of a "minor"! But I'm totally pre-tensioned - it's among the first movies I've ever seen with her, and when I saw it, you couldn't turn around without seeing a poster of her (luckily). I think Robert Wagner really was just like the not thoroughly sympathetic or rude leader of the group, like Edward G. Robinson (of course) and Vittoria De Sica. And Godfrey Cambridge, an actor who always managed to be fun.
