Alice enters a world of wonder ... but not the kind of wonder that you remember as a child. The food hats, the white rabbit, the queen and others (even Tweedledee and Tweedledum) show Alice some things about her body - and others' bodies - that can be absolutely wonderful. A story of love and desire that you have never seen. Kristine DeBell appears as Alice. I must say that by the 1970's, this may be the most attractive adult actress in her day. I think it's her only movie before I move on to ordinary work, but it was pretty much the best she could have chosen (my love for all things, Alice is no secret). Even better than "Fairy Tales" (there is not really pornography, so much). The songs are cheesy but fit the theme of the movie. A song, "What is a girl like you do on a knight like this?" was pretty funny and the others had similar themes. The attempt at the end was well scripted and fit very well into Alice's world. Logic and humor were clearly drawn. <br /> <br /> What more can you say about a movie like this? All I know is that people who are accustomed to adult movies where it is only a 30-second entry to sex will overload you with plot and music. But I personally think that there is something very special about this movie, and I hope it will be a good DVD release with things that are touched and special features (if even possible). I can see that this is a cult movie.
