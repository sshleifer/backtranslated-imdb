There aren't many movies that I would describe as perfect, but Rififi certainly fits the bill. No other lift film has come close to it before or after. The reason is simple, but gives you an impression. It never ceases to amaze me how to completely grasp the movie is every time you see it. You care about all the characters, even if they are bank robbers, because they are presented as humans with all their problems and mistakes. It's hard to imagine any other actor besides Jean Servais in the role of Tony le St√©phanois. When the crew members talk about what to do with their money and finally come to Tony, his answer and the expression on his face say everything. While the 30-minute heist sequence is the most famous part of the movie (and rightly so), the movie actually gets better afterwards. Director Jules Dassin knew what he was doing when he decided not to have any music under the hoist scene or the final shootout, but instead set a great climactic score during Tony's last trip against his fate. Believing that if Dassin, an American director, had not been blacklisted in Hollywood and forced to work in France, this cinema masterpiece would never have been done as it was. It would certainly not have been so good if it was made as an American movie in that time. It was absolutely horrible what Dassin had to go through, but he did his greatest job because of it for the benefit of all of us. I'm just thinking about the thought of the upcoming Al Pacino remake. Most hoist films since Rififi have already borrowed from it somehow. There is no need to reuse this masterpiece than money. Let the classics be alone!
