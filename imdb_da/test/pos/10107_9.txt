I love horror movies, but I think they work much better when they save a dramatic impact (The Devil's Backbone, The Exorcist, for example). It's that kind of movie, and it's not just scary and scary when it comes to it, it's also really beautiful. A talk about two sisters begins really slowly, so if you are busy seeing ghosts in the first 20 minutes, you will be disappointed. In fact, it's not a ghost story, though there are some. It's somewhat more complex, and it's done in such a way that it beats Ringu and The Grudge out of the ring, no sweat. A speech ?? is a way more clever movie than the great cultural hits, because it really cares about its characters and the direction is flawless. Every detail of this movie will leave you breathless if you are the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie. The action is fantastic, especially from the founder and the maid. These two are worth the price of the ticket alone. Do yourself a favor and watch this amazing movie.
