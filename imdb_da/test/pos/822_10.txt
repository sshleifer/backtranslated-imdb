This movie was made on a relatively small budget ($ 10-20 million?) With almost no promotion whatsoever from its distributors. I only knew this because I am a long time Jean-Claude Van Damme fan, and I always check his latest movies in the hope that they will at least be seen and apart from some real turkeys (Derailed, Second Command), they are . This movie has an easy enough plot to follow, and Van Damme gives a good and humorous performance, but the film owes all its credit to the battle scenes involving Van Damme, Scott Adkins and the final of them together. Editing and camera work for most of the movie is quite awful, but Isaac Florentine can certainly film a good fight scene. I am also pleased that Van Damme has worked better lately (in hell, deaths until death), but with the good acting less martial arts came. In shepherd Van Damme proves that he still has it.
