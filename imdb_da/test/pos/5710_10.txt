"The Student Nurses" is an outstanding film dealing with four women bound by friendship and career. For the first time, one can see a realistic depiction of relationships in the workplace, outside the workplace, the risk of these relationships and the consequences. This movie also gives a rare chance to see the veteran scene and television actress Katherine "Scottie" MacGregor as the nurse's instructor, "Miss Boswell." Ms. MacGregor is best known for her performance as "Mrs. Oleson" on the television series "Little House on the Prairie". The direction, music and inks are very good as well as the opening theme performed by Clancy B. Grass, III. This film provides a rare opportunity for those who enjoy themes centered around the late 1960s and early 1970s, giving a "softer life to life" while appreciating the beautiful woman's beauty.
