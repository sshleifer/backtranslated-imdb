Okay, Anatomy is not a reinvention of the Horrormovie genre, but it is well done. Good actors (Potente and FÃ¼hrmann at the beginning) and some good ideas made me happy. Maybe I wouldn't have been so positive if it wasn't a German movie, but who cares. It is good to see familiar faces in a good and exciting story with some gore and some good jokes in it. All of you complain about the duplication: I didn't see a dubbed version (of course), but I think it's not easy for you to watch dubbed movies. We (Germans) are used to watching movies that way, so it's not a big problem. But try to look at German with subtitles. The actors are really good!
