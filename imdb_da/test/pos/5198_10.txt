Stalingrad is a great movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in the approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and that is politics. This, together with "Das Boot", is one of the best war films (along with the Finnish "Winter War", I think in English)). It depicts trials of some of the German soldiers who fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War II. No big-time heroics, no indulgent emotional turmoil, only fear of everyday death in war. The mood of the movie is similar to the one in "Das Boot" and it should give you some tips on what to expect, I think. So if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywood war movies: Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it! Finally, a movie buffs note: For some of the previous reviewers information, I would only add that "Stalingrad" is not directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made "Das Boot")!
