I've seen this story before, but my kids don't. Boy with troubled past associates military, faces his past, falls in love and becomes a man. The Mentor this time played perfectly by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with common everyday problems living an extraordinary conviction to save lives. After losing his team, he takes a teaching position, training next-generation heroes. The young troubled recruitment is played by Kutcher. While his local love scenes are a bit stiff and do not generate enough heat to melt butter, he complements Costner well. I never understood the Sela Ward as the neglected wife and felt she should have liked Costner to stop worrying about her security as opposed to her selfish needs. But her presence on the screen is a pleasure. The two unredited stars in this movie are the Coast Guard and the Sea. Both strong forces that should not be taken for granted in real life or in this movie. The film has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the character ratio. But it still works. The rescue scenes are intense and well-filmed and edited to give maximum effect. This movie serves the audience's applause. And my two son's applause.
