This is a television movie based on the murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich in the mid-1970s. based on how much it is hard to say. It's very safe. It is based on the book written by Mark Fuhrman. On the other hand, the film plays the crime of flashbacks and its succession, including arrest of a suspect, about 25 years later, which was never considered a suspect at that time. in the film, of course, Fuhram is largely responsible for arresting and ending the case for Martha's surviving family, especially her mother. The story of the movie is by Martha Moxley's ghost who speaks in the first person. It is a very effective device in this movie. To me, it adds more influence to the movie and puts a human face on the murder victim (if only one actress plays the part) Maggie Grace plays Martha and I was really impressed with her. There is no way to safely know Mark Fuhrman's motive by examining the crime. It could have been out of a sense of justice and maybe he really cared.or maybe he just s aw dollar sign from a future bestselling book. It makes it an interesting movie. It is well acted and paced fairly quickly. I don't think there were a lot of extra unnecessary things in the movie, just what was needed to tell the story. One could argue that they omit things that would have run a little more light on the case and one would be right. Also one can claim that the end was abrupt and again one would be right. But as I said to myself, I think they told the story at least most of the essentials. Everything else would probably require a miniseries.as a page there is a miniseries titled "A Season in Purgatory" which came out 6 years ealier (1996), which this film has some parallels to, though only weak. But if you like this movie, "Then you might be interested in" A season in the box office. "It is my opinion that" a season in purgatory "is actually a fictitious account of the same crime. For me, Murder in Greenwich" is an 8/10
