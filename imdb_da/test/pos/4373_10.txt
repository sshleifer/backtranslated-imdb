My brother got me hooked on Carlin back in the 70s. I always loved his observational humor. It is to look at everyday things and find humor in it, like asking the question: "Have you ever tried to throw an old garbage basket? You can't do it! They keep coming back to you!" And ask questions like why is the word killing more acceptable, then the "F" word while making prefect meaning to the discussion. <br /> <br /> But in the 90s his stuff was less fun and more angry. What he seemed to do was hold a mirror to the face of society and say 'take a look!' At this time, his shows were less of a comedy show, and more of a seizure session. But in all fairness he always made a lot of sense. He really made you think. <br /> <br /> Here, Carlin was old and new. He begins with the fun you could get by getting old, and later slamming the state of the world. Again makes perfect sense. <br /> <br /> This was his best page "Jammin" in New York "and as it turns out his last. I think what 'The Shootist' was for John Wayne, or 'Prairie Home Companion' to Robert Altman, 'It's Bad For Ya' is that George Carlin. A good farewell to a really good icon. Love him or hate him, I think he's remembered.
