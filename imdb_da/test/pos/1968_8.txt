Fair and nifty little science fiction / horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whose latest game - "eXistenZ" not only draws attention to people who voluntarily try the game, but one who almost kills her (and her game too). When forced to be out of sight, Allegra sits with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a marketing educator ("PR nerd") to be her bodyguard, even though he only has a gun made of meat and bone and the balls are teeth. Director David Cronenberg has used some of his earlier films ("Videodrome", "Scanners", "The Fly", etc.) and put it in some parts of the story with a good time. Law and Leigh are fine here, and there are also some of the eligible (Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccelston, etc.) who have an international twist. Dafoe is anything but devil like Gas, a fraudulent garage mechanic. One of the movie's best scenes is witness to Ted eat (fish and frogs) and construct a gun and admit to Allegra - "I can't help myself." "eXistenZ" manages to show that he (Cronenberg) is up to his old tricks and it still seems like a charm.
