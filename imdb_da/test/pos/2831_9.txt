"Only the Valiant" qualifies as a brave good Western. This Gregory Peck cavalry versus Indians oater is a solemn suicide task without a trace of humor. Veteran director Gordon Douglas has hell a turbid, harrowing outdoor epic with an ideal throw of hard guys under great pressure; Even Lon Chaney, Jr., records excellently as a strong Arab trooper. Actor Harry Brown's scenicist Edmund H. North and the "A Place in the Sun" writer Harry Brown drew their plays from Western filmmaker Charles Marquis Warren's tight novel about a group of deadly cavalry cut off from any escape route that must prevent murderous reddish from launch a devastating attack on helpless white settlers. North and Brown adhere to Warren's novel for the most part and last-minute revelation - when it seems that there is no way our heroes can survive another attack by Indians? is a corks! This century story develops an effective claustrophobic feeling in the second half of the action. Douglas and company take study-related sets and make them convince at night. The sharp black-and-white photography of "Going My Way" film photographer Lionel Linden imbues this western a ugly look that highlights its excitement and atmosphere. The actor Michael Ansara, who later played the top villain in the "Guns of the Magnificent Seven", is extremely effective in a small role as the hated Indian leader Tucsos. <br /> <br /> "Only the Valiant" opens with over- voice telling by Army Scout Joe Harmony. "This is my stamps, I am a scout for the army. Has my work cut for me for a long time. Behind that pass is the whole Pache nation. (There is a graphic across the territory with Flinthead Mountains stretching across the screen with They came to swim out of the pass and killed everything in the sights, then we built a fort Fort Invincible, it plugged the pass, like a cork in a bottle. Paches are smart. One day, the bottle ripped off the cork plum. "We are shown the burning remains of Fort Invincible with a dead man attached to a stocked wall and a lance sticking out of his stomach. Captain Richard Lance (Gregory Peck of "12 O'Clock High") and his men boast in horseback riding and catching Tucsos (Michael Ansara), and Joe Harmony (Jeff Corey of "True Grit") will shoot him on the spot. Harmony points out that Tucsos is "the trap that started this whole business." Captain Lance intervenes: "The army does not shoot prisoners, Joe." Predictably, Harmony is appalled at this perspective. "He is not generally forbidden, he is as close to a god as a trap can get. If you shoot him now, talk quietly. Without Tucsos touching them up, the rest of Indians will be reasonable, as fast as They can take you alive, you have every pache in the area that comes after him. We've had three years here, you can stop it now. As predictably, Captain Lance refuses to kill Tucsos and Lances decision to take The Indian back gets things going. <br /> <br /> Colonel Drum (Herbert Heyes from "Union Station") surprises Lance when he tells him he should have shot Tucsos. to another post, all from the troops to Joe Harmony know that taking Tucsos to Fort Grant is asking to die, the Apaches are ready in the mountains and the fort is under strength, however, we are introduced to the daughter of Captain Eversham, Cathy Eversham (Barbara Payton from "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye"), and young Lieutenant William Holloway (Gig Young of "They Shoot Horses, Do Not They?") And they play a part in a major interpretation complication. You see, Lance and Holloway both want to marry Cathy. Clearly, Cathy wants Lance. Colonel Drum refuses to let Lance take Tucsos to Fort Grant because Drum cannot save Lance. Drum changes the orders, and Holloway is given the last minute mission and everyone is shocked. Lance never changed an order. In addition, Lance Cathy and Holloway publicly kissed, and everyone believes that Lance has redistributed Holloway out of jealousy. In fact, an officer notes that rewriting orders are about an opportunity to rewrite the Bible. Predictably, Tucsos escapes and the surviving troops and Harmony bring back a dead Holloway. <br /> <br /> Although Drum expects a 400-troop relief column to arrive one day, Harmony points out that Lance will attack Tucsos. Tucsos has seen the fort and knows their lack of strength. Lance requests to take 6 or 7 men of his election to Man Fort Invincible and prevent Tucsos from gathering a war party. The bottleneck in the mountains keeps the Indians from riding through in strength; instead, they must come through one-on-one time. Lance thinks his men can counter them until the relief column comes. Drum gives him permission, and Lance chooses the worst men. All of them hate him and would willingly kill him. <br /> <br /> "Only the Valiant" exemplifies the new race of military westerns after World War II. This is not a gung-ho John Ford cavalry western. In fact, Lance's own men will kill him, and this offends the troops' attitude during the Vietnam War when they beat their own officers. Lance carries onus of all but the few who know about the circumstances that led to the order shift, whereby Holloway was responsible for the details. The black and white photography enhances this western gloomy nature. "Only the Valiant" amounts to a last stand Western until last minute exclusion. Reported, Peck hated this movie, but then it's not a spit-and-polish western in Technicolor. If anything, "Only the Valiant" lives up to Warner Brothers origin. It is small but significant and it is undesirable with lots of drama and spooky characters, largely a "Dirty Dozen" western.
