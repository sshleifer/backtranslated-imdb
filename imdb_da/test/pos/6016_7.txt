Based on the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee, who painted a much more loving image of their mother than her sister, actress "Baby" June Havoc, in her autobiography, "Early Havoc", where "they shoot horses, don't they?" was loosely based. I saw Ethyl Merman in the original Broadway production of gypsy, and she was great as "Mama Rose" but certainly more "Merman" than Rose. I was disappointed with Rosalind Russell's 1962 film version. An otherwise excellent actress, Russell was a very timid change for Merman. Bette Midler, on the other hand, was better and more credible than Merman, and I would recommend her performance as the final.
