It is not always certain that mixing comedians together will produce laughter. The comics involved must actually like or admire each other, or be willing to put up with each other's agility. GO WEST with Marx Brothers, Buster Keaton had to write the script as a gag man. Groucho did not think too much about Keaton's ideas and arguing at a script meeting. And even though some of Keatson's pearls still appear in the finished film (such as a gun that turns into a brush that turns into a gun), the movie was one of the weakest ones Marx Brothers ever made . <br /> <br /> A better movie, but also influenced by dual comic egos, was the Toilet Fields and Mae West in MY LITTLE CHICKADEE, which jettisoned the script for a series of duels of a liners between the leaders. But one line was just as fun, so the movie is still a success. <br /> <br /> But the SIX OF A KIND is an example of six movie comics that worked well together. The reason is simple: there are really three comics that work together: Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, George Burns and Gracie Allan and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth. Ruggles and Boland were paired for about half a dozen comedies during the 1930s, usually with Boland as a bit bossy wife and Ruggles as a nerve-wreck of a man. Fields (usually a single action) were paired three times with Skipworth (TILLY AND GUS, and if I had one million they were two other times). Skippy has always figured out how to control or counteract her husband's heavy activities - the current film she's acting in her own hands with the stolen money being sought (she knows that the local sheriff, Fields, is not the one to trust this). As for Burns and Allan, they easily manage to engage with Ruggles and Boland on their cross-country car journey. <br /> <br /> Ruggles quickly becomes aware of what a mistake it was to accept traveling with Gracie - at one point she managed to drop him from a rock and dangle from a branch. He is relatively helpless when she insists on 1) photographing him on his perch, and 2) corrects his grammar. The presence of George and Gracie's humongous dog ("Ran Tang Tang" is that name) does not make it easier for Charlie and Mary. <br /> <br /> Fields have some options. When he insists on shouting at the quartet, he says he's allowed to do it - he's the sheriff! He also explains under a pool game the unlikely story of how he got his undeserved moniker "Honest John". You have to listen carefully to the story as it is interrupted with his attempt to play pool a couple of times (when you accidentally get bent by a billiard ball), but it shows that there were things that even Fields would have had some reason to steal. <br /> <br /> Oh in the "Summary Line" I mentioned a forgotten actor called Bradley Page - he was the man responsible for the problem Charley Ruggles suspects. Bradley has a reason to leave town to catch up with the careless Ruggles and Boland, so he phones his girlfriend. He tells her to call her work and say he has to leave town because somebody is dead. There is a break when he apparently hears a question shot back by his girlfriend. "ANYBODY!", He says - clearly annoyed. Although the majority of humor in the film is worn by the artist's sex, Mr.Page happened to have the most entertaining unexpected line in the movie.
