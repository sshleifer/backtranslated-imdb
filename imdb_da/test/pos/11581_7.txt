I suppose it is quite an achievement to be able to present a true tail to an audience of a fragile man; a tail, where the protagonist will use the majority of the film on the back, in a bed and completely unable to move. And yet the performance in the film's effectiveness is like a dramatic piece; as a reminder of a true story, and I think as an argument why people should have the right to die if they wish. But the film is not a political statement and perhaps fortunately it is away from too many scenes in the debate, although it also includes one for the sake of argument anyway. Incidentally, this is one of those foreign language films that presents its main character as a cripple that cannot do anything but talk to the people around him and yet can cross as engaging and convincing anyway. <br /> <br /> So rather than being an out-and-out argument, the movie is more a sweet but early-dramatic piece about another person who wants something or in search of something; The only difference is that by reaching this 'goal' it would mean the termination of another's life and it would be achieved by not physically going anywhere. Javier Bardem plays real life Galician Ramón Sampedro, a person who at a much earlier age dived to a clearing of water that was too low for such activity. This made him deceived for the rest of his life, and his desire to die is the focus of Chilean director Alejandro Amenábar's film. We've seen so many movies in our lives where characters have certain "goals" or goals one needs to meet before the movie is finished to give a satisfying audience experience, but the pace of The Sea Inside is mild; It does not involve young, energetic, attractive heroes who go out to fight far from places, but a real person for something that matters so much to them. Even if you have a strong policy, either pro or anti-euthanasia, you can find yourself hoping Ramón gets what he wants at the end of it anyway. The film sets its tone very early with Ramón, giving a speech on why he wants to die to see family members, instantly introduce the situation and subject it to the audience who may not know what the movie is about. Interestingly, some of the family members are "anti" what he wants, which can place any audience who feels strongly about the subject in their respective shoes. But the purpose of this set-up is to tell the audience: No, it's not a man after something that, incidentally, has his whole family supporting him to the end. Quite simply, the film could have gone down on a route where it is the Sampedro family vs. everyone else, but some are anti-Ramón's idea; Some are too young to recognize what is really going on, and others are apparently too distraught to even have an opinion, except that they just want Ramón to stay a little longer, they love him. <br /> <br /> The Sea Inside is a sequel to a story about a kind of victim. Ramón is a quadriplegic, and that is his perspective, we see things from. This is something that can be dissimilar viewers or get the film across, which is quite strange as we are presented with a movie from a victim's point of view rather than an instigation or protagonist of a movie that always causes the cause in cause and effect drives. But it is no criticism and it is a credit to the director to provide such an approach in the effective way it is. The film asks questions; It gives a scenario to its audience. If you were in Ramón: What would you do or think about or dream about or talk about? Therefore, dreams of lawyer Juila (Rueda) are not so much shot at the audience's enjoyment, as much as they are an equally small window in a man's escapist fantasies from his difficulties. Julia's study intensifies a little later when she begins to share some similarities with Ramón, and that is when she begins to have strokes that result from her own illness. This feature occurs in a timely manner in the relationship between their relationship and adds an additional ingredient in conjunction with an already engaging friendship. This is because Julia feels the physical pain and limitation, not in a way that she is unable to get up and go, but I think she understands the value of life given how emotionally bad she felt in advance. While the film is based on a true story and covers the subject of euthanasia, it feels more like a drama of the earth in a situation where he is willing to fight for what he wants, but must do it orally. It is refreshing to watch movies like The Sea Inside as it not only refers to history and gives us an insight into it, but as an independent film, delivers on an emotional and engaging level.
