"One Crazy Summer" is the funniest, craziest (not necessarily the best) movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Just when a crazy scene is finished, another comes forward. It never lets you rest. Only one thing after another. The soundtrack is fantastic. The songs are the right ones for the scenes. <br /> <br /> It's also a clean movie. Small that is dirty in it. Of course, the story of the boys you didn't want to trust with your lunch money, has a challenge and wins over people with more resources. Who wants to see it if they fail? There is a serious side because parents and children do not live up to each other's dreams. One should always have an open mind and weigh all the possibilities. This applies to both parents and children. In "One Crazy Summer" the parents are wrong. This is not always the case.
