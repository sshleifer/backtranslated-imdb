This is probably one of the best French movies I have seen for a very long time! This "pastiche" or parody of spy films is very well made and will make you laugh from the beginning to the end. Some references to today's world are very subtle. The whole Moroccan context of the film must be understood in the light of today's French culture / environment. That said, all jokes and - seemingly shocking remarks that might have been understood as such because of this context are allowed and accepted because this is a parody. <br /> <br /> I was told by my sisters who had already seen this movie that I should go too and assured me that I should have a good time and I actually had! If you liked the old 007 movies with Sean Connery and also like movies like Airplane or Hot Shots, you'll be happy. I just hope this movie is released on DVD in the United States ... Wait and see.
