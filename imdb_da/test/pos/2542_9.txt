Gray can make the English language jump through hoops like no other. He tells a number of events tied together by his writing of a manuscript (the title "Monster"), some sad, some incredibly funny, all in his characteristic, sarcastic way. If you liked "swimming to Cambodia" you will love this one. In fact, I thought this was a little more interesting and better-told than "swimming to Cambodia". A real masterpiece.
