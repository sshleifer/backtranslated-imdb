I own this video as well as the concert version of the music with Patti Lupone and George Hearn with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. George Hearn is amazing in my book, like Angela Lansbury and composer Stephen Sondheim. This musical is operative in scope and shows a lot of ingenuity in composition. I certainly hope this VHS will be available on DVD !! Hearn is extremely sympathetic. One annoying performance is the young woman who sings Joanna's role. I think this performance was at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, rather than at a Broadway stage, and I'm not sure the minimalist set was used in New York as it was in this production. But I found the scaffolding to be pulled over the stage to be quite effective at "depicting" London's streets. I highly recommend this movie.
