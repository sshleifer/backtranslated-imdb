The sparse grace of this movie is its humor. Warner Brothers played their version of General Custer as a cocky, dashing, irreverent prankster with a romantic stripe and an unexpected tribe of idealism; it was Robin Hood again and Flynn flourished in the role. All his best action pictures exploited his talent for evil and comic timing, and this was no exception. It is also the benefits of the return of former co-star Olivia de Havilland, despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership The part of strong Libby Custer is a better role than the sweet love sports she had tired of playing for the studio in Flyn's later film, and after seeing the script, he had specifically requested that the Havilland be thrown so that she could do justice to that part. In the final collaboration, she gathers all her significant acting skills into what is really a scary adventure movie, and the screen chemistry resumes - for once, she and Flynn have the chance to develop their characters beyond the original romance of an old married couple to equally effective. <br /> <br /> Flynn / de Havilland mating and comedy is what has given the film's durability, as most of Flynn's other westerns - held such a love of contemporary American public, although apparently not of their star - has long been forgotten. The action scenes are rather superficial (despite the irony of killing an extra in a fall under one of the filmed charges) and the bad guys on the play turn out to be the fashion of the school, to be the same people who were horrible about for Our Hero on his very first day at West Point, thus continuing to disturb him throughout his career. It cuts down on the cast list, but it is also a bit too moral. <br /> <br /> But it's quibbles that are highly irrelevant to a movie that has never been more than an exciting piece of entertainment. Erly Flynn galloped and supported by a sterling group of supportive players (memorably including Anthony Quinn in an all-but-wordless role as the Sioux leader). He rolls through the plot with his usual arsenal: charming sheep-like appearance, unexpected sweetness, eerie twinkles, flash point indignation, cheerful communion and pure high octane charisma. He is a ruthless blow, but you can do nothing but like him. And it's hard to walk away without the sound of the "Garryowen" that penetrates its ears for many days thereafter. <br /> <br /> This is one of Flynn's lasting hits; It also contains a surprising amount of good actors among fun, and is a movie worthy of being remembered.
