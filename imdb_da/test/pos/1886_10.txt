This is scary fun (well, except when Bruce is in the hospital scene which is a little sad). <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Keach are both excellent and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not a big budget suit-controlled blockbuster, but that's all it promises to be and more - and BTW women are wonderful in their parts, even though I don't know them from others movie, I would like to welcome them again. <br /> <br /> The two-hearted gait scene is inspired and certainly a showcase for Bruce's excellent physical comedy - he's a great guy! <br /> <br /> Thanks Bruce, for your brain, it's your baby!
