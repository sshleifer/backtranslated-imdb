This is a simple episode ad so far after seeing all the episodes in season 11 (with the exception of the Imagination country trilogy), it's the one who made the most of it, is definitely my favorite until season 11. Then Cartman basically looks at a toy store one children who have Tourette's syndrome and a new idea come to Cartman. You can imagine now that Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great since Kyle when he knows this is like "he falls". Cartman is certainly on fire and says what he wants for the teachers, for the principal, for someone. On the other hand, we have Kyle, who is now the intolerant, who basically says Cartman was faking he was taken to meet children with Tourette's syndrome just to let him see that Tourette's syndrome is too real and is great when Kyle is like "well maybe someone fails to make Tourette fun", in short, Kyle couldn't explain that Cartman was faking. Probably my favorite scene in this episode is when Cartman is with Kyle's family, but right after this scene another child finds that Cartman simply falls, the child with Tourette's at the toy store, Cartman basically said to that child: "isn" t have Tourette's awesome ". But to say what he wants and be for everyone a brave boy, it's just the start of Cartman, his main plan: go on National TV to say something he wants (" people will call it brilliant television, they will probably give me an Emmy "- amazing, in this episode the word" s *** "is used 26 times, and not all. South Park won an Emmy as a month before this episode was sent). But here's a twist, Cartman basically removed all the bricks, he says now everything without thinking, so we hear from Cartman that he's wet his bed last night, now it's not fun for Cartman, and he's like " I can't control what I'm saying "and certainly the person who was with him is like" obviously ig you can't control what you say you have Tourettes "so Cartman is like" my Tourette's got worse before I just blurted out cool things about Jews being lambs and things, but now it's got very bad ". There are also things about Chris Hansen and catching a Predator, actually what happened to a pervert, happens with much more perverts, Kyle and Thomas were behind it to stop Cartman, Kyle stops being Cartman's savior! Fantastic! TSA VOICES CONCERN About "South Park" October 3 episode <br /> <br /> On Wednesday, October 3, the Comedy Central cable network will fly an episode of the animated series "South Park" in which one of the young characters Cartman, "gets" Tourette's syndrome. Due to the nature of this program, we fully expect it to be offensive and insensitive to people with TS and garner many calls and emails from our members and the TS community. We have already taken some preventive strikes, such as to request Comedy Central air our Public Service Announcement (with comedian Richard Lewis) during or after the show. In addition, when the episode airs and we are able to see exactly how the TS is portrayed, we will be able to respond with specific problems and problems we have with the show to the authors. <br /> <br /> "We are actually surprised it took the creators to use TS as a comedy feed for so long as no program, no disability, illness or controversy is beyond their control," said Judit Ungar, chairman of the TSA. "<br />" We always see pictures of TS (good and bad) as an opportunity for awareness and education, and a show of this size and popularity is certainly no exception and allows TSA to spread actual information about the disorder, "said Tracy Collett-Flynn, Head of Public Relations and Communications, TSA. <br /> <br /> We will send an official statement on this site with TSA's response to the program after show airs. <br /> < br /> TSA RESPONDS for "South Park" Episode <br /> Unfortunately, as has been the case with too many media portraits of peop le with Tourette Syndrome (TS), the seasonal opener of South Park ("Le Petit Tourette, 10-3-07, served to continue the myth that most of those affected by TS have u voluntary outbreak of spooky language. In fact, 85-90% of people with TS never experience this tragic social stigma (medically termed coprolalia). For viewers less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder, the misleading removal message could not have been clearer ?? unless you curse, you do not have TS. <br /> <br /> Despite our pre-aerial booms, we admit that the episode was surprisingly well-researched. The very exaggerated emphasis on coprolalia despite the attentive viewer was a surprising amount of accurate information that was transmitted. The script input from parents, a neurologist, peers and therapy sessions with "TS Children's Support Group" all served as a smart device to give these facts to the public. "Undoubtedly, this South Park episode increased national awareness of TS. Nevertheless, we are very worried that schoolchildren with TS will be fooled and even bullied by insensitive peers who may have seen the program," Judit Ungar, TSA said. President. "We realize that for more than a decade, the author's satirical parodies have spared no group, they are celebrities, disabled or political figures. That TS was the subject of a popular television show testifies to the public being so much more aware of the disruption Of course, this increased awareness we've worked too hard to achieve has sometimes turned out to be a double-edged host. "<br /> <br /> TSA contacted program managers before venting, and we'll get in touch with them again. Perhaps this can make this an opportunity for positive TS awareness.
