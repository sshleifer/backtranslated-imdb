I have waited years for DE DEAD to come out on video, as I have mostly used my VHS copy for strips. This is one of the most beautiful movies ever made for the holidays. It takes place at the festival (twelfth night) and is a simple, sharp vignette of characters attending a dinner prepared by three Dublin women. Central to history is a rather lovable couple, a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife but feels incapable. All the performances are amazing, and the manuscript weaves beautifully among the various signs of the dinner. Of course, its source material is James Joyce's short story of the same title and much of his narrative structure is kept intact. John Houston's long career as one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting final with this film, written by his son Tony Huston; stars his daughter, Anjelica Huston; and is dedicated to his wife, Maricella. Thanks to Lions Gate for downloading the rights to this movie and releasing it on DVD. For lovers of all things Irish or for people looking for a literary, subtle but incredibly fluid holiday movie, this is a real gem.
