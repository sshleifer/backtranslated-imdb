Cactus Flower is what I call a "pizza movie" -A personal favorite that never fails to satisfy. Perfect for an evening at home with a pizza. Knowing all the lines (and which lines!) Alone improves enjoyment. As many others here have recalled the plot, I just want to add the correction that Bergman's character, Miss Dickinson, was a nurse receptionist, meaning she was a skilled nurse - and therefore a trained person - not just a receptionist. " Bergman's performance in this film - and the film itself - was largely rejected at that time, but today's audience will marvel at her reach; not just the impeccable cartoon, but the ability to make us believe in her character is unaware of her own feelings, while revealing them so clearly to Toni and to us. While the overall plot extends credibility, Bergman's performance is convincing: honest and completely credible. <br /> <br /> Also a standout is Jack Weston's performance as Matthaus's old friend and collaborator, Harvey. No one could deliver a zinger like Weston, and I.A.L. Diamond's script gives him lots. For example: "It's such a big, dirty, rotten lie it has class." Weston exacerbated some weak signs because he radiated a warmth that allowed you to forgive his characters' mistakes. <br /> <br /> The movie is a fairly straightforward adaptation of the Abe Burrows game (which itself was adapted from a French game by Barillet and Gredy). On Broadway, Matthaus's role was played by Barry Nelson. Bergmans by Lauren Bacall and Hawn's by Brenda Vaccaro. It ran for 1,234 performances (three years) and was nominated for two Tony Awards (Vaccaro and Burt Brinckerhoff who played Igor). For me, the film's score is written and adapted by the legendary Quincy Jones is another highlight. The main theme (A Time for Love is Anytime) is performed by Sarah Vaughn on opening and closing credits. It is also insinuated in various events throughout the film, especially as the romantic piano music emphasizes Berman's speech to Hawn in the record company. Jones also created covers of popular songs from the period (for Sir with love, I am a believer) for nightclub scenes. As with all the film's elements, there is an enormous amount of talent, taste and professionalism evident. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, getting modern romantic comedies can keep a light on this classic. It's great to finally get it available on DVD. Time to call a pizza ...
