This image is an interesting saga of the pioneers' struggle led by Daniel Boone in the desert of Cumberland Gap while being threatened by hostile Indians. A treacherous Frenchman is the cause of all the hassle between the settlers and the red men, while Boone tries to convince the Indians that the pioneers will only build homes and live in peace. The film has some appeal because it is not a polished production, but there are good action scenes, although it is something violent for its time. The cast is made up of B players, but they are all good, especially Lon Chaney as the Indian boss. Bruce Bennett is okay as Boone, but is a bit off-the-shrub and soft-spoken to being credible as a border man. The dialogue is rather tired, but the landscape is turning to the realism of Kentucky backwoods.
