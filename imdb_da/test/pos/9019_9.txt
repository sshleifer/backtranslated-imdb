Well, I usually watch movies for one of three reasons. Unfortunately, there are no Transformers in this movie, so I can only recommend it on comedy value and beautiful women (read girls). Yes, it's funny, I know because of the number of people in the cinema who laugh regularly throughout. Personally, however, I loved Laura Fraser, who IMHO is FIT!
