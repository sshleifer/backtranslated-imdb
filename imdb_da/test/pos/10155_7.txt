This is not among my favorite Hitchcock movies, although I have to admit it is still pretty good. Among the things I really liked were the presence of Jimmy Stewart (he always improves even the most mediocre material) and the incredibly scary assassin (resembling a skeleton with just a thin layer of skin stretched over him). Although it cost the studio a lot of money, I wasn't particularly aware of Doris Day in the movie - she seemed to cry a lot and belts out "Que Sera" as a fullback. Yes, I know she should sing that way, but this one made me hate this song. Sorry. <br /> <br /> The other complaint, although less I had about the movie, was that it was a little "polished" and "Hollywood esque". The original version (also made by Hitchcock) just seemed very grittier and seedier - and it was added to the frightening atmosphere.
