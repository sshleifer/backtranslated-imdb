So Udo Kier served as nine bucks and free food for this, so it's a victory in itself. <br /> <br /> Even more importantly, this film tells a very interesting tale of a group of life-threatening fires coming across Demeter. I had to warn you, I'm gunna bounce around this review really fast so buckle up. First thing first. Coolio plays a guy named 187. 187 likes drugs. 187 finds a lot of coffins on board and ... now I don't know anything about the future, but maybe they smuggle drugs into suitcases. Don't gunna say it was the craziest thing in this movie. Later, the vampire comes out of his full coffin and then begins the real hilarity. Firstly, even though this film has the word Dracula in it, he is actually not in this movie. However, I have a theory. Out of the blue one can see the salvage crew's shipload without them. My theory is that Dracula was on board with his late brother Orlock. Dracula told Orlock he was coming back immediately. Dracula got fucked out of this movie before he could be seen from Orlock to play the vampire in the six minutes he's in the movie. The best part of this movie, and for those of you who have seen this, you know what I am gunna says is after 187 been fired, embraced anything. He has this huge monologue on ejaculation on various parts of erika elaniak's body and ... other super cool things. Coolio, seriously you are the best thing ever. <br /> <br /> Some other things also happen in this movie. As Casper Van Dean gets some work. Orlock screams a lot and loses his arm and then we let go of him for the rest of the movie. And thank goodness really. We find out that Erika's character is a police bot. When the movie comes to an end, we find out that the ship is on a course to hit the sun. The police's bot and another surviving character are doomed. Instead of avoiding a particular death, Erika's police bot shows that she is also a whore and decides to screw each other and die. Before they die in the sun they die for no reason, it is true ... their ship is blowing up without any real reason. <br /> <br /> This movie got the amazing rating of a reason Coolio. My God, if they gave academic awards to black rappers, then he was the first to get one. The only reason this didn't get a perfect ten is because there wasn't a drop of nudity. Now I know what your thinking, how can you judge a movie, whether ladies show their goods or not. Well easy. A movie like this requires just about that. Its part of the process. Gore, gore, monsters, nudity, gore, the end of the movie's final shock at the end. That's the formula. This had some fun, the monster was great because he sucked so hard he actually made us benefit to stay away from the camera. It was considerate of him and I respect it. Necessity, not a drop, though there was a length of conversation about ... well see the above statement and for the shock / twist ... I certainly didn't end up coming. It counts. <br /> <br /> I hope Hollywood doesn't think Coolio gave this movie his whole and has nothing left. He deserves more work. Well, until Dracula 4000 I'm out.
