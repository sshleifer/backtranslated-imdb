Sean Astin draws another great performance in "Toy Soldiers". He plays the very intelligent prankster, Billy Carpets with Wil Wheaton and Keith Coogan, who play his best friends, Joey Trotta and Jonathan "Snuffy" Bradberry. During a regular day at Saint Anselm's school for boys, a group of dangerous terrorists host all the boys and teachers and threaten to blow up the school if the leader, Luis Cali (Andrew Divoff), father is not released from the US prison, but are not just ordinary boys being held hostage. Most of these children are sons of very powerful people in America, and half of them were expelled from other schools before coming to Saint Anselms. They are mouth and actions can only have them killed. When the government desperately tries to find a way to help, Billy, Joey, Snuffy and some more boys choose to take matters into their own hands.
