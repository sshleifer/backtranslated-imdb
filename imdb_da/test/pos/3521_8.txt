Ignore the bad reviews on here, this movie is amazing! "Just before Dawn" is a good example of what can be done in a movie with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script and a cool idea for a movie. It's a whole lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it much more than most other 80's slashers, because the killer is so unique. "Wrong Turn" tore this movie out of something fierce! There are lots of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she looks almost everything with me and doesn't flinch. It's so scary about it. <br /> <br /> I would say "Just before Dawn" is the best early 80's slasher out there. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 children.
