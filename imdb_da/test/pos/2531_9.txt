This was really a "nightmare" of a movie; I saw it nine years ago on cable TV and haven't forgotten it since. Pixote is a 10 year old boy living in Sao Paulo (Brazil) streets and leading a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends Lilica, Dito and Chico; They steal, pimp, sell drugs and murders to survive every day ... In the first half of the film, Pixote is captured by the police and sent to a sadistic nursing home where he testifies to any kind of abuse by the elderly inmates and guards to the rest of the children; One night, Lilica's boyfriend is killed after a battle, so Pixote and his friends decide to flee during an uprising. The rest of the film shows Pixote's descent into a criminal life; he shows no emotion or remorse after killing someone, perhaps because he knows good feelings are not useful in the world where he lives ... But there is a gentle scene in the middle of the film; Pixote and his friends are on the beach, missing (and wanting) one of his friends from the Reformation was there. I thought it was a poetic and melancholy scene in the midst of all those horrible events ... the boys, of course, not only long for their friend but for a better life. Director Hector Babenco's "Pixote" is a brave and depressing film that doesn't shy away from showing the toughest reality many people - including myself - tend to ignore or misunderstand. This movie will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person.
