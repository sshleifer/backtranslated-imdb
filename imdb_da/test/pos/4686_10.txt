The greatest compliments to the second commentator here at IMDb who asked himself why this series did not "get stuck" in its time to last much longer as many other series in the 80s did. <br /> <br /> It's not true that the series would get worse if it continued. <br /> <br /> At the end of this comment, I would like to comment on some thoughts about the other movie realizations, rather: attempts at Robin Hood legend. <br /> <br /> First of all, Robert Addie (Gisburne), you are among us all you live forever. Nothing is as fun as two, if you want, three seasons of this unique series. And at the same time, it fully agrees with the most innovative and revolutionary findings of Terry Jones' history documents on Egypt, Greece, Rome, Constantinople, the Goths and the Barbarians and the Middle Ages and the Crusades (... yes, the monthly python-Terry Jones): /> <br /> If you've seen these brilliant and fun Jones-Docs, you'd better understand all the historical backgrounds, Carpenter, the author of the Robin of Sherwood series (which happens to be John Carpenter's brother, who made "The Thing", their third brother produces music) that is supposed to tell us. <br /> <br /> The author of "Dick Turpin", "Catweazle" and the first two seasons of "Robin of Sherwood", called "Kip" Carpenter, is my film overlord. He is better than all the others who criticize his "sword and sorcery" element or "defect" (taken from Robin of Sherwood Webring) in this series (which I cannot see) or have other unfounded criticism existed much back then and still now. <br /> <br /> Therefore, as you learn to know this "Robin of Sherwood" better, you will be difficult. You will first wonder the third season. Not only that: I've gone through this myself, and on top of that I've only picked up the first two seasons in my deepest heart - DESPITE the fact that Praed, the actor of Robin, left this series because After the series had great success, he was offered a probably better-paid role in an absolutely ridiculous Canadian series called "The New Adeventures of Jules Verne" - already the title reveals the emptiness of the entire project. Praed went for money, and not for fame, he didn't keep his gang and family, I mean: as actors. <br /> <br /> Actors who personally represent the subsequent "real", in our present-day, famous and legendary Robin-Legend faces and characters. The potential of this series could and should have been allowed to flourish much more without any degrading content level and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issues. The lead role was forced by Praed's stupid decision to leave Robin of Sherwood into a silly remake series of Verne's and brilliant woven into the film of history. Nevertheless, in some cases it is a disaster. <br /> <br /> Anyway: If you are informed about this and that Connery may have been announced by his father, but that young Connery is not "chase Praed away" at all, how I thought harmful in the first place Then you can definitely enjoy the 3rd season. Sadly, the script was no longer written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we no longer have the critical and free-thinking historical background as in "The Witch of Elsdon" or in "The King's Fool", two episodes of the first series that are A) fun, B) Historical education and C) brilliant acted. === <br /> "Don't believe in the lion!" Unlike many other characters who wanted him dead for their own power consumption, Richard Lionheart, as shown in RoS and as in real-life, was a greater authority than John or others, but used it only for his evil idea of ​​the crusade and the war against Normandy in France. He slaughtered and had slaughtered much more than tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in the "wholy" crusades, and his soldiers even ate the children they beat out of hunger or poverty. In addition, after his capture of the Saracens (Muslims) in the Crusades, he was pushed out for his ransom, 100,000 characters (at that time, the 12th century, equivalent to about 30 billion - 30,000,000,000 dollars of present value), to get him back safely, then he just visited England for a month to return to Normandy (in France, where the Norman Invaders went first) to the Crusades (one learns in the episode "The King's Fool"). For this new crusade, possibly a kind of revenge for his catch, Richard Lionheart clears the money back "(quoted by Clive Mantle's mouth as he refines Robin to be critical of the King himself). Robin criticizes this war issue, which is not socially critical for Richard's, he addresses Richard himself and tells him: "The poor gave everything to free you, how can you ask them more?" - Richard: "... give me your courage and strength, not your words!" .. Later, privately, Richard orders Robin's assassination ... <br /> <br /> Then the Crusaders were the right "barbarians". <br /> <br /> PS: Already when I looked at Kostner in 91, I was sorry because I later found out about the history of the school that Richard was not the good man Sean Connery showed in his appearance at the end of "The Prince of the Thief." Well, as Terry Jones would say it: is a lie, a treacherous lie! "Sean plays humorously and charismatically, and his son does a better job than expected in the third season of "Robin of Sherwood". <br /> <Again: Praed is, according to my info so far, the one who left Sherwood for a stupid Verne series, no one with brains, will never remember or will remember.
