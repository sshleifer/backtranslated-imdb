I went to see this movie not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the team of Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. It was a fast paced movie, and an hour and a half went fast. This will certainly not win any Academy Awards, but it was a change in pace for Mr. De Niro. He's good in comedy. Overall, I enjoyed it.
