It's a bad, raunchy, predictable, sticky, salacious soap opera? "Best of all" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something like the "Dollar Valley". I mean, "Best" has everything. Someone gets pregnant outside of marriage (when is the last time you've heard this sentence?), There are affairs everywhere, drinking, retreating, jealousy and even a tragic, but not totally unexpected death. <br /> <br /> Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the main points of the goings-on. Their chemistry is instantaneous and is the glue that keeps this film from becoming too fragmented. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker, the ex-fashionable ex-fashion model, appears as Gregg Adams, an aspiring stage actress, a role that, according to any biography I've ever read about her, seems was not much of a stretch. But Parker does a surprisingly credible job here, more than keeping himself in a few scenes against Louis Jourdan, who plays David Savage. Jourdan probably took this role for the money and the special screen credit because he was clearly going down the aging star / has-been road. <br /> <br /> Diane Baker is fine as a naive, credible April Morrison, Martha Hyer as Barbara Lemont has a particularly juicy story, and film legend Joan Crawford tickles his usual decor of scenery like Amanda Farrow, another role as Jourdan's Savage that Crawford probably took the salary. There are some, of course, dated dialogue and plot units (this is 1959), and the predictability of the soap opera genre. But if you like a good soap like I do, "Best of all" will more than satisfy you.
