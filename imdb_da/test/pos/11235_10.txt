Don't forget what this socially retarded person above says, this show is fun. It shows how many single men are in bar-atmosphere, and also shows that women are not as credible as men think they are. <br /> <br /> The competition aspect of how is really cool and original. It is not the standard reality reality show that we are all used to today. <br /> <br /> Give it a chance for everyone, we are just an episode, we finally have some Canadian programs that are not absolute crap. Like the Canadians, what do we usually get, Bon Cop, Bad Cop or Corner Gas. Come on, people show that we are not all as sensible as the previous reviewer. <br /> <br /> Way to go on Comedy Network, giving a new show a chance. The panel is fun and the participants so far are quite good.
