This should be one of the most beautiful morbid films I've ever seen. Merhige has created a vibrant painting that unfolds with terrible violence, sex and a minimalist tale of the life of Jesus Christ. The high contrast and thick layers of grain question you what you really see at times, but the use of texture combined with the extreme contrast creates an incredible experience. This movie is not for everyone. I think you should keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this movie for its content, as if it is extremely rough, but make a rather important statement of creation, god and humanity. Whether this film is a work of art or shock value is the subject of discussion that can be discussed.
