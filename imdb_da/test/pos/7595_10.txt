I think Never Been Kissed was an amazing movie. The castings were really good and they acted very well. I really like Drew Barrymore and of course it was excellent. I was afraid for the first time because it said it didn't come out on video. Boy, I'm glad it's because it's a scary movie. Go see it if you don't have it!
