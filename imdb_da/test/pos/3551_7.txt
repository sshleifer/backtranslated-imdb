John Barrymore plays a gentleman who is also the thief, Arsene Lupine. While no one knows for sure, the case is that the inspector (Lionel Barrymore) is sure of it, but cannot prove it. So, Lionel uses a lot of the movie after John - hoping to catch this brilliant and smooth thief. <br /> <br /> Although I liked the movie, I really think I had higher expectations for it and thought it could be better than just a very good time pass. This is because it mated John and Lionel Barrymore in the movie, and as these brothers were such dynamic actors, I think I was expecting sparks and magic, but instead only got a glimpse of this and there. Now it is not to say that this is a bad movie - it certainly is not. It just wasn't up to the level of being unforgettable or a movie I highly recommend you see. Thanks to an appropriate script, the movie is pretty good, but I was surprised to hear no French accents at all in the movie, although it seemed to be French! Also, there was just not much life in the movie before it was almost complete. The end was actually excellent and entertaining - so good that it elevated the film from a 6 to a 7. It's great to see it ending on a high note.
