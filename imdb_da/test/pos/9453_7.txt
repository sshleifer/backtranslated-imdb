The movie was big and everything, but there were many flaws in "football scenes" I wonder if any of the men who worked on the movie ever saw a football game before ..? First of all, I don't understand how she would try for the boys' team? in football players and girls can not play in the same team and that is the FIFA rules. And let me not start with who when they found out she was actually a girl, they let her continue playing ... !! Second, players cannot paint their faces with colors and play like that, again FIFA rules not mine. <br /> <br /> Not getting me started the way they scored goals, it was ridiculously completely unrealistic. And all the players thought they didn't know Jack about football. <br /> <br /> And when the Duke trained Viola why they only focused on shooting what happened to pass and dribble. or shot her only problem?! and why in hell were all posters on the wall in their room for players from Chelse ?! Can't they like other players from other teams? it was like this was the only team they know ...! but apart from the fact that the film was good and I enjoyed the rest of it, the training and stage scenes were unrealistic to me. they should really have consulted one and the other about them ...!
