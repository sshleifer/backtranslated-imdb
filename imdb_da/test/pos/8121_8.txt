After a long wait, "Bedrooms and Hallways" made it to the Perth cinemas - not a commercial one to imagine - and I thought it was fun, honest and took a hint of the "tribal scream" groups running around and tried to find meaning in rocks and 'what is behind my eyes'. It plays in full houses here because it tells a story, has great action and says something about the human condition.
