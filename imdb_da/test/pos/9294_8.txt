The hilarious team that brought you 'CNNNN' and 'The Chaser Decides' has returned to ABC with their new series 'The Chaser's War on Everything'. The film in front of a live audience makes the Chaser team once again what makes it the best - lampooning key political figures, international celebrities and media perspective. The satire is simply invaluable, and nothing is sacred. In recent weeks, the Chaser Team has been chasing the Queen (during her visit to Australia) to try to get John Howard rejected and threatened to break Kim Beazley (Aust Opposition Leader). <br /> <br /> A particularly fun segment is "Mr. Ten Questions", which shows a far too enthusiastic journalist approaching celebrities (recently Charlize Theron and The Backstreet Boys) and asks them ten such questions as "what is your optimum length of rice grain?" Just for the record, Theron ignored him and walked away, and one of the Backstreet Boys became angry and "refused to dignify it with an answer." One segment that had recently stitched me was when one of the teams decided to become a statue shrubbery to score some extra money. When he realized how hopeless he was, he put a real statue in his place. THE PERFECT SCAM! He got thirty dollars in twenty minutes! <br /> <br /> A brilliant satire of everything in Australian society. Two thumbs up! <br /> <br /> (By this way, the show will not appear in the three weeks after Easter, because "even though the team is all atheists, they are also hypocrites.")
