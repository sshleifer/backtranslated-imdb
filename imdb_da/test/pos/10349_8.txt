Recovery is a well-founded and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that does not sentimentalize the protagonists. David Tennant and Sarah Parish highlight the complex and contradictory feelings of a couple deeply in love with struggling to express themselves with the personality changes they both endure and must do to survive a tragic accident. <br /> <br /> Tennant, like Alan, brings humor as well as a dangerous lecherousness that an engineer recovers from a memory loss caused by a traffic accident. Alan is not a portrait simply as a victim, but as a person with emotions, he does the best he can to sense his new life. Sarah Parish's Tricia is not a klich√©d wife-housewife who will do anything to support her husband. She struggles to fall out of love with Alan, as the man she is once new and loved is now a completely different person - a stranger to her. Contrary to one's opinion, this means - in my opinion - perfect Sunday evening viewing. Too often, soft family dramas or detective series, such as Heartbeat, appear, which rotate and putrefy the brain. The program commissioners seem to think that the traditional rest day is also a day when our mind goes to bed. More challenging and thought-provoking drama like Recovery will seriously change the situation.
