Eichard Gere & Diane Lane back in another romantic love story. They are an excellent team, but somehow this movie won't be the best, <br /> <br /> Director George Wolfe uses a manuscript by Ann Peacock & John Romanao for Nicholas Sparks novel. This is yet another tale of 2 strangers who meet and fall in love, so they go there, so when they are meeting again and starting a life together. <br /> <br /> SPOILER, but not really. The tragedy happens, one of them dies. How many times have we seen it already. <br /> <br /> Hopefully those who never saw the towers like this would like it more than I did. This story has about every clich√© there is. <br /> <br /> The only reason this has the reviews I will give it. is because of the fine acting and excellent production. Cast alongside our 2 stars include Christopher Meloni, Viola Davis and Scott Glenn. they give all the right good performances and do the very best with the material they got. <br /> <br /> There is a good but not over finished storm sequence. Gender scenes are well done, no nudity and next to no error language, <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 out of 10)
