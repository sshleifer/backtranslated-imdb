It is so refreshing to watch a movie like this with real mood and personality instead of just a bunch of CGI cartoon gimmicks. This is a great horror spoof that has real chills along side some really good sets and performances. Its laughter is subtle but plentiful. Because there is very little if there is any CGI, there is no need to shake the camera violently to hide the crappy effects. This makes the film very visible compared to the other camera-man-must-be-sh% -in-his-pants films of this genre that have come out in the last decade or so. <br /> <br /> It's much more enjoyable than the big budget recovered waste released by Hollywood today. <br /> <br /> See it.
