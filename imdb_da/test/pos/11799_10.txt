So glad I have HBO right now. I didn't plan to watch a movie today, but when I got home and saw that the next movie on HBO was this, I decided (based on the description) to at least give it a shot. I am so glad I decided to watch this movie! Perhaps this movie just caught me in a vulnerable moment (I'm a little stressed out, got a great test to study for), but it certainly gave me the perspective of friendship, not to mention taught me a valuable lesson on empathy. I am currently a year away from the Pharmacy School and the whole scene involved the doctor, and the nurse was definitely a learning point for me! <br /> In any case, I just wanted to write up to let the world know this is a great movie and not to be missed. There is absolutely something for everyone in this movie!
