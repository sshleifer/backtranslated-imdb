My dad's hero is sweet, funny and sweet. Gerard Depardiu is great as Andre, a divorced father who takes his fourteen-year-old daughter Nicole (Kathrine Heigl) to the Caribbean for vacation. While his daughter meets a man named Ben (Dalton James) to impress him, she tells him Andre is her boyfriend and that her father is in prison for armed robbery and her mother is a prostitute and that she ran with her pimp . Everyone on the island is soon under the impression that Andre is a child molester. Others are between two relationships. One with Isabelle (Emma Thompson who makes a como at the end of the movie) and Diana (Faith Prince from Spin City). My father Hero has many fun moments. Like when he is on a talent show, and everyone tells him to play some French. So he plays "Take Heaven for Little Girls" from Gigi. Everyone gets angry and goes. My Father Deer does not deserve a 5.1. I think it deserves a 9.0.
