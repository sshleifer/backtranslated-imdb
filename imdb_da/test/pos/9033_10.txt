I'm not a Faulkner fan (who is considered to be a sanctuary, especially since I grew up near the author's hometown); But I think it's an excellent movie. Equal to the quality of the movie "To Kill a Mocking Bird". If you haven't seen it, buy it anyway. It's worth having in your regular collection. TCM recently played the movie as part of the Race on Film series. I wish they would play it more often. Very moving. <br /> <br /> On a side note, people from Oxford, Mississippi, will also enjoy seeing the habitation of the square as it was in the 1940s. Courthouse, City Hall, etc.: They are all on display. I never knew the movie was filmed there until I made the knowledge of the buildings. When I saw the arch in front of City Hall, I began to become suspicious. Look closely at pennants at Chick's wall: You will see two to Ole Miss!
