An interesting comedy that takes place on a train from Stockholm to Berlin, December 1945. One cannot excuse the poor writer / critic who finishes his job and jumps on the train to Berlin. His ambition is to make a difference and to participate in the construction of the new united Europe after the war has ended. <br /> <br /> I like the movie's black and white format as well as the closed landscape of a moving trainer. <br /> <br /> Robert Gustafsson makes a classic "Gustafsson role" in this movie. If you're a fan of him, the movie is for you! The philosopher Wittgenstein, through his saying "You can never assume that everything is what it seems to be", is referred to several times in the film.
