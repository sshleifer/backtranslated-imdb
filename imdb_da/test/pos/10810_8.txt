Danton was one of the founders of the French Revolution in 1789. This film is set five years later, and the revolution has morphed into something ugly. While the revolution initially promised freedom, the small committee running the country at this point is extremely repressive and is a dictatorship. Danton and his friends were angry at how the country was no better in 1794 than it was before they left their king to begin criticizing the government. The movie begins as the printer that makes critical brochures about the government is beaten and his business is destroyed. So much for "freedom, equality and fraternity"! So, as a result of being silent in this way, Danton et al begins to publicly criticize the government. Eventually, Robespierre (the leader of the committee) and his cronies trumpet up charges, have a show trial and get rid of the disagreement. Some have mentioned that the Polish director, Wajda, also intended to be a criticism of his own nation - which at that time was Soviet dominated and very repressive as well. It makes sense when you see the film unfold - especially when the government destroys all the difference "in people's name." <br /> <br /> The action is fine, the story is convincing, and I have no major criticism of the movie. But I really want the ending to have been treated differently. Especially because other than history lovers and French people probably have no idea that this execution helped to end the government. After this cleansing of Danton in April 1794, Robespierre himself was executed in July 1794 because the country had just had enough - plus the surviving French also knew that they would also face the guillotine sooner or later if this sick system was in place. A sort of epilogue would have been nice - like showing the soldiers coming to Robespierre. He responded by trying to kill himself first, but he only managed to blow a part of his face - still alive, he became guillotined shortly afterwards. This would have been a dandy little epilogue and could have been done in about five minutes. But there is no connection between the death of Danton and the fall of the government, it is a strange thing to omit.
