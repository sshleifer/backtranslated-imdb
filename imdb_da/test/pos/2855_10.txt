Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse who is vain in a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear) and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he is brutally murdered in the blood instead while Betty is looking. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear really is the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell and she are his RN fianc√©. She leads to LA to find her lost love, without knowing that the stolen drugs are in her suitcase. Following her is Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock respectively), the hit men who unfortunately killed Del before finding out where the drugs were hidden. They pursue her across the country, while Charlie gradually falls in love with her image of her. <br /> <br /> And in LA things get bizarre as no one understands that Betty is deceptive. Alternatively, fun and touching, this movie is almost perfect. Stop reading comments and see it.
