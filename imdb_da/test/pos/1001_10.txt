Despite the title and unlike some other stories of love and war, this movie is not too sticky and pink, because love is like a rose: With thorns it is. The four leading actors put their characters realistically and with good sense and balance between the tragic and the earthly. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics of the cabaret / chanson-esquire songs (song b Keira Knightley himself) draw the viewer deeper and deeper into the movie from one place to another between the brutal war and among the peaceful love. Some people may find it too much biopsy, but it is mostly a romantic story, although it follows Dylan Thomas's life and the triangular relationship steeped in joy and jealousy. <br /> <br /> London is visualized from a different angle to once, Dylan's bohemian life during the bombings of the Germans is set in a fluid atmosphere of small bedrooms, pubs and bars. The independent women, the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the end is for the twist and hangs loosely for the rest of the movie, but overall it is a great romantic story.
