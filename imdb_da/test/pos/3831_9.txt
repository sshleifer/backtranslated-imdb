I agree that this is one of the very best episodes of the entire series - my only detraction would be Mark Lenard's striking appearance as Romulan Commander. My reason is this - if you weren't out for the first time in this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker - your preference) it takes you first out of the stage. Still, he is an excellent commander as well as the opposite of our captain, and this episode is highly written and well-run by all. There are good points from both sides about the cost of war vs. the price of peace and reminiscent of one of the best of World War II and later era films. It is not my favorite genre, but I would definitely recommend a fan of that to see this episode through that filter. You get to see it stop. I never understand why Sci-Fi gets so little respect - the best drama comes from placing ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.
