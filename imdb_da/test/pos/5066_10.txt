This was an excellent movie with good acting, and it keeps your attention through to the end. Maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable with the subject, and that's why it wastes so much. It can also be too deep for many of the viewers out there who give movies like the American Pie series higher ratings. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is a CIA analyst, not an agent to observe an interrogation by an Egyptian man of Moroccans, not Egyptians. He is not supposed to be a hardened agent and then comes out as naive of the studied techniques used. This is more credible than if he were to come across as an "old hat" on it. The story jumps around a bit and can be confusing, but it also makes you aware of what's going on to the end when everything comes together when the puzzle falls into place. The entertainment actors did a good job of helping to carry the movie. I found the movie to be strong and thoughtful.
