I've seen this movie about 4 times, and every time I'm impressed with the other camera assistant's work. Seems trivial, but there is something very professional, knowledgeable and talented there. The movie as a whole suffers from other problems, as evidenced by other comments. The significance so that the problems approaching are just as relevant today as 40 years ago. The action is a little strained, but the other camera assistant's work is star! This person needs to get back into business - maybe to steer? What is this person waiting for? I want to see and wait and cheer from the sidelines! - Bob
