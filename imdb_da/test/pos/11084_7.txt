I'm not a fan of Sean Penn, but unlike my German colleague whose review appears here, I think he was perfectly cast as the neurotic, druggy character in this movie. He has every nuance perfected and reminded me of several acquaintances who had similar tastes in "recreational chemistry". I watched this movie once, 10-15 years ago, and it's the only part of the movie that was etched indelibly on my mind. I'm not saying that often, but in this case I want to: Bravo, Sean Penn! As for the narrative line, it is based on facts, and as such, it is a tragedy that people will sell their country's secrets to the then enemy. Again, Penn has shown what you can do if you disagree with the administration. Use the freedoms you have paid in blood; Don't break the law.
