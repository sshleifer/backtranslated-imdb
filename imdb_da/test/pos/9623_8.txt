"Five Fingers of Death" is a classic of the 70's Kung Fu cinema. As the movie that "broke out" the HK cinema to the west, this is a must for any serious fan of the genre. It's also a wonderfully entertaining movie with tough hitting, non-stop action, solid and most trustworthy choreography and great over-the-top 70-era doubling ("Oh I see ... so you want it the HARD WEIGHT! "HWAA !!") "Five Fingers" is an eye-greeting story ... and I literally mean the eye to the eye! It is great to see Lo Lieh portray a hero. He played so many great villains later in his career - including Pai Mei in the classic FIST OF THE WHITE LOTUS, which was one of the characters Tarantino used to create Pai Mei or Kill Bill. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that I wish there was a better quality DVD - it looks like it was a VHS transfer. All in all, it's a great movie - don't miss it! <br /> <br /> Bart Blackstone Film Club - Hollywood, CA
