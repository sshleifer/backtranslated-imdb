This film was clearly an early attempt by a new director, but still managed to be original and entertaining as well as in some moments thought-provoking. However, I must say that the story would not have come across without Paul St Anthony's excellent performance as Pip. He made the well-written parts very credible and influenced, and the more weakly written parts are much more tolerable. I must also mention Alan Cumming's performance. It was refreshing to see him in such a way. He emphasized his role, which gave a very basic element to the film. As for Paul Anthony: Who is this guy? Why haven't I seen more of him? Someone gives him more roles, thank you!
