This movie is my family's favorite Christmas movie because it is a beautiful picture of what Christmas is really about. These days live in a big city that I hate, I love watching movies about the life I've always dreamed of having. The city where this movie is set is my dream come true for the life I have always wanted and the true sense of society lost in today's society. I don't really feel the true spirit of Christmas anymore, but seeing this movie helps find that feeling again. My family taped this movie a long time ago on TV and now our copy has been worn so I really want to buy a few copies on DVD for my family and me if anyone can tell me where to buy some copies , please enter the information here and i will keep control. Thanks.
