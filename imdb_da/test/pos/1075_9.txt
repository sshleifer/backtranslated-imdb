Just like this movie 2 days ago. A very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine. I have no particular interest in wine, and yet I found it very informative. The director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people the way they are. While exposing many things beneath the surface, he is unable to take a stand and leave it for the viewer. He shows a lot of compassion for people (and dogs) and sympathy and lets people tell their story and at the same time postpones what they don't want to tell. <br /> <br /> The film shows us where our world comes, what are the benefits and what is the great price we pay. It is a movie about love of wine and love to make it great, personal and global, character and formula. The real stars of the people to me are the older wine producers with their disillusioned appearance in the world and themselves. <br /> <br /> It takes some time to get the hectic camera moving and editing, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
