"The Beguiled" is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies and a departure from his typical early roles. Directed by Don Siegel, with whom Eastwood collaborated on several films, it was made a year before Eastwood's direct debut with "Play Misty For Me". An alternative title is considered the movie "Pussy-Footing Down At The Old Plantation", which fortunately was not used, otherwise I am sure that healthy jokes that it is going on a girl's school would be difficult to avoid. I first saw this movie in one of my college movie classes in the mid-1970s, and was immediately taken with it. I only had an old broken VHS tape of it until I recently purchased the widescreen DVD, which also contains the hilarious, horrible trailer that makes the movie come across as a "Peyton Place" soap opera and produces no movie's fragility. <br /> <br /> Interesting notes: Eastwood and Siegel had to fight with Universal Pictures to keep the original end and they won out; and the movie was billed as a standard eastwood western, which it certainly isn't. It is a gothic tale of deception and fears that lie in the civil war, with an underlying tone of erotic and sexual excitement running through. <br /> <br /> I do not put any spoilers in this review and if you want to watch the movie as it should be, be sure to look it up on the internet as spoiler reviews of it are abundant. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood portrays John McBurney, an EU soldier shot at the Confederate Ground and discovered by a young girl from a nearby girls school. She rescues him and takes him back to school, but instead of notifying the local patrol about his presence so he is taken to prison, the advocate, Miss Martha (Geraldine Page), his assistant Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), their blacks Serves Hallie (Mae Mercer), and the mostly teenage girls take him in, heal him and fall under his spelling. The film puts its sharpness and gothic fate right from the titles as it shows real battles from the war, while Eastwood's voice is silent and sings a funeral song of the time. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of her meeting with the little girl who rescues him sets the tone of her character and tone throughout the film. To say more than that would ruin the surprises in the first scene. To say much more about the movie itself can ruin it for anyone who has not seen it ... if you are in creepy gothic stories, find it and rent it. Eastwood is excellent in the movie and it is interesting to see him in an early role or role in depicting a character that is mostly very unsympathetic. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page played a role in the film as headmistress, and I can't imagine another actress from the time being so good at the role; A long shot could have been Piper Laurie, but I don't think Laurie could have embodied the role like Geraldine Page. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Hartman (whose amazing performance in the movie "A Patch of Blue" as a blind girl falling in love with Sidney Poiter's character is another highlight of her short career) is on her prime here, delicate and masterfully at the same time. Unfortunately, her delicacy on film was also part of her real life; She committed suicide for 45 years. <br /> <br /> I conclude this review with this note: a manipulative lying yankee man is not a match for a houseful of deceptive and libido southern callers.
