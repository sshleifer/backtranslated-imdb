I first saw this movie in the mid 80's and thought it was a funny movie. As I am older, I see this movie for various reasons. I like to see it when I feel sad / nostalgic for my "lost youth". I was a teenager (14) at the time of the release of this movie so I can identify with many of the same issues / dilemmas that the campers / CITs in this movie have. I enjoy watching the clothes used at this time and hearing the same old urban legends that told at night on the canoe trip. The movie is also full of fun and liners. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who was a teenager in the late 70s to the early 80s.
