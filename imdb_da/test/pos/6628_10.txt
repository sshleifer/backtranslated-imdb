Bergman's story of how the hell of the war can lead a sensible couple of musicians to the barbarity. With many memorable scenes throughout the film, I found it very remarkable that close to the end, where Ullmann and Von Sydow go in a boat completely surrounded by corpses of soldiers floating on the sea. A fascinating masterpiece!
