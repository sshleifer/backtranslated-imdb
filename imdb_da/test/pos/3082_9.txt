Like many children born in the 1980s, I grew up on the Mel Brooks movies, which were not necessarily 'racier' ones like Blazing Saddles and History of the World Part 1 (I saw them of course, but not as often as now), but they meant for "the whole family", Spaceballs and this movie. I knew at the time that I wasn't so much art, but just a campy, goofy, but always ridiculously worth taking on Robin Hood and / or adventure movies. But calling it a family movie with quotes means that a) adults can really enjoy it as much as children, if not more because of the small jokes and stupid vulgarities, and b) when a young person sees it when he takes it back, As I have a couple of times, it is still so fresh, but with some things it didn't quite understand the first time. It's a comedy not only filled with jokes on Robin Hood movies and other movies (Godfather of course as well as small mentions for other movies in modern times), but one that also refers to Brook's own films; This is a movie maker who doesn't overtake fun on even his own style. <br /> <br /> Basic story - Robin Hood (Cary Elwes in one of his best turns) returns from crusades to see things are in danger with King Richard gone and then goes out to regain his country and, of course, rob the rich to feed the poor. Along the way, he meets Achoo (Dave Chappelle), shrinks his head with Prince John (Richard Lewis) and the Sheriff, and of course Maine Marian's love is still tormented. Of course, it is the usual line of clothing for Brooks to let the comedy run into the scenes, and while sometimes a joke may not work or may become obsolete on a repetitive display, so much of it is that it is difficult not to cluster. It also helps that a few are some of the best in any Brooks film, such as. The Godfather piece (Dom DeLouise at its very best), Brook's own cameo as Rabbi, Lewis and Chappelle's play, and an endless kill of quotes lines and a few tongue-in-cheek songs. Some of it is obvious, yes, some of it just goes from the pages of Blazing Saddles, but it's a good time for the right crowd? Absolutely - and for parents who grew up in the 70's Brooks work, it's a great way to introduce the young people to their work through this (even the suggested sex jokes and such are not R-rated, all in good fun).
