Now it's classic. One of my friends told me about this flick and said it is incredibly limp, stupid, retarded and moronic. He also said I would love it. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I found it available from netflix and rented it at once. I'm just shocked that I had never heard of it before. If I could give it an eleven, I would. <br /> <br />
