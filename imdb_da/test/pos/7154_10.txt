Wow, just caught this movie from Blockbuster and I love to find gems like this. While it certainly was shot on a budget and misses a bit in clumsy editing (ie, accident, hospital scenes, second to final scenes), I give myself a 10-star! I absolutely loved the thoughtful concepts generated and if you are a free thinker and open to ideas outside the box, I highly recommend strongly this movie. I think the director and author, Jay Floyd, need some attention and more opportunities in the film industry. Based on his credits, he may be another Quentin Tarantino.
