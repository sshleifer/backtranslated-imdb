This movie works on many different levels. It is a profile of a very nice couple, a social commentary on aging and nursing homes, a love story, a musical one. I've seen Uncle Frank a couple of times, and every time I see it, I'm not sure who to call first - my parents, my wife, a friend I lost contact with. . But it has a way of making you remember the most important issues in your life - and would like to confirm those who continue. Expect a lot of laughs, and probably some tears, if any of the living characters hit a chord here. I'm pretty sure they will.
