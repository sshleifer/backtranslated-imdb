I really enjoyed this movie. It challenged my feelings and beliefs, making it a true piece of art in my book. The action was unsurpassed. I would never see this movie with anyone I couldn't cry around, I don't think I'm crying harder on any movie, maybe because it makes me look at myself, I'm not. It's a must see.
