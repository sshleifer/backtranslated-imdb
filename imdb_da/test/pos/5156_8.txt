You can't really call Roy Andersson prolific, (6 films in 37 years). You also cannot accuse him of being conventional; He does not 'straight-forward', at least when it comes to storytelling. "You, the living", his first seven-year film, is like a surrealistic documentary where a large number of characters are observed, do nothing much, and if it sounds dismissive, let me assure you that it is not. This is a fun, accessible and surprisingly warm-hearted movie, a piece of life far removed from what we normally see on the screen. Of course, 'slice-of-life' is hardly the right moniker to search this movie since most people's lives are unlikely to be like this. The events on the screen lead the gamut from the almost frightening ordinary to the right villains, and while the characters may fail, sometimes never be seen again, others come back as if they are eager for approval, Andersson gives them all some kind of benign love. It, and a bit of rolling music, ensures that the time we spend with them is time spent.
