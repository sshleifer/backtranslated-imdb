At many levels, it is very good. Considering that this was a low-budget UK indie of a first-time feature director with a largely neophyte cast, it's a great achievement. I don't know how much it costs. The £ 8,000 figure was bandied about in advertising, but you never know how reliable such a figure is. The point is that this movie looks like it costs a few million quid, and it definitely costs a small fraction of the great special effects, great production design, efficient props and costumes, excellent photography, great acting and direction, an impressive score and a fantastic sound mix. That said, much of the script was fantastic. The signs were clearly identified and everyone had something to do. It is about a movie of ten men, all dressed in pretty much the same place, and it would be easy for them to be nameless, faceless subjects, but it was ten characters - most of it was done through dialogue and the way , they responded to things. Through the intermediate action when the plot developed, the manuscript told the story well and showed how it affects the characters. If the whole movie was like the other act, it would be great. <br /> <br /> Before the ship blows up, twelve people make it to individual airbags or "e-bellows" jumping off the ship. They are not much more than automatic metal chests, and the poor pacifiers are trapped, cramped and have no real idea of ​​where to go - but that makes sense. I like e-pods - they are an excellent idea that is done very well and makes more sense than a nice, spacious air capsule. I also like the way we specifically tell that they are designed for ship to flight, but can almost only make planet falls in an emergency - let's see, these guys were bloody lucky that their ship was blown up so close to a planet. That said, it does not seem that there are 116 unused e-pods still on the freight ship, and you have to wonder how the prisoner is able to get into an e-pod - but he gets it. (And it just happened to me: shouldn't the captain have gone down with his ship instead of being the first guy out there?) In any case, e-pods land on a barren planet with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation - or at least on a sandy, sparsely vegetated part of the planet, which may have icy waste and lush jungles elsewhere. Nah, it's a planet in a sci-fi movie - it'll be exactly the same everywhere. We have to accept that all the e-pods come down within a few miles of each other so that the ten survivors are able to meet and shoot flares into the sky to find each other. <br /> <br /> The captain, a muscular mountain of a man who could have a great career in action flicks, if he gets the right agent, decides they should try to contact 'Captain Behan' with whom they belonged intention to rendezvous. But they can't do this from the planet they need to orbit. Engineer says that if they combine the power units from two e-pods, they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift itself to grave diggers that are sufficient to burst the atmosphere. It can all be done automatically, but it will need a "pilot" to send the signal. The captain volunteers for this, but in a sensible sense, the engineer points out that the heaviest man in the somewhat dodgily repaired e-pod is ridiculous and must be the easiest member of the team. It's Kid. I really liked the way he now points out that his name is David, and the captain begins to use it and treat him with dignity and respect. It was good storytelling and good characterization.
