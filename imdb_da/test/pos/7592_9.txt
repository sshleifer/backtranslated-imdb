Although a little more than a pleasant 11 minute musical diversion (rightly considered a "Tabloid Musical") EVERY SUNDAY is one of the most famous and precious documents in movie history, as it provides an invaluable look at the growing talents of two of the screen's most talented and beloved musical performers: Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland. <br /> <br /> Although often cited as a screen test of varieties produced by the MGM to test the young appeal of the Durbin and Garland study contracts, whose options were allegedly renewable, this claim is not entirely correct. When every Sunday was produced in July 1936, Deanna Durbin's contract with MGM had already lapsed and she was immediately signed by Universal a month earlier in June 1936. A provision of Durban's MGM contract allowed the studio to exploit an opportunity for her services for up to sixty days when she had not yet started working on a picture of her new study. As Durban's debut vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, was still not ready to start recording, MGM chose to exercise its option and, although officially contracted to Universal at that time, Durbin found himself back on the MGM party that filmed this Pleasant Short Topic With Along with Garland's much more extensive prior professional executive experience / training (which included appearance in several previous movie shorts), it may explain why every Sunday often seems to favor Judy Garland over Deanna Durbin, giving Garland several lines to speech and an original song ("Americana") to sing, while Durbin offers the popular classic art song, "Il Bacio" by Luigi Ardiiti. It would certainly be perfect that MGM would want to favor one of its own contract players over another from a rival study. Ironically, although Garland's character is the more obviously proactive one of the two girls in this brief, it would be Durbin's sheer and impulsive "Little Miss Fixit" screen person at Universal, who would drive her to instant worldwide superstars as the world's first "Teen Idol" with her debut vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, while Garland's more passive "wistful wallflower" youth image would see her generally cast in supporting roles opposite frequent screen partner Mickey Rooney and (in ZIEGFELD GIRL) the up-and-coming Lana Turner. Only until her fifteenth MGM function, 1942 'FOR ME AND MY GAL (which was also her first fully "adult" role), Garland would gain the solo over the title billing and "solo attraction" status of a true superstar that Durbin had instantly reached six years earlier. It is therefore quite incorrect to claim that Garland was the only "superstar" attraction of the two girls when Durbin achieved this status with the press publicly, almost a decade before her MGM rival. Literally foreclosure at the time of signing, the evidence on the screen shows strongly that Universal was much quicker to realize Deanna's full superstar potential than MGM was with Judy, and it is worth noting that almost all the remarkable results Garland achieved at MGM from superstar billing, having main car specially written to showcase her talents and appeal, to be invited to plant her footsteps in the forefront of Graumann's Chinese theater to receive an "honorary" Oscar for her talent, Deanna Durbin received well before her gifted MGM modern, anyway, every Sunday is a nice, completely unpretentious musical card, its plot line (Durbin and Garland using their song campaigns to save Durban's grandfather from being forced to resign from the city council from performing his Sunday concerts in the park) , the plot lines run in both Garlands "Let's Put On A Show" mice cats with Mickey Rooney and Durbins 100 PEOPLE D A MEN. In contrast to Garland's later BABES film, the short never seriously deals with the insignificant story, and therefore the eleven minute running time runs. <br /> <br /> Of course, the true magic of every Sunday is to observe the already remarkable performing talents / screen preferences of Durbin and Garland at the beginning of their legendary career. Both girls, even at this early stage, possessed remarkable screen preferences and are completely natural and unaffected by their presentation as both singers and actresses. Garland explodes out of the screen with vitality, as she literally knocks out the lyrics of the creepy "Americana". As she socks across the figure with appropriate hand gestures, Judy literally seems to chew on the words of the song as she turns her mouth up and bends her eyes into her intense zeal to show what she can do. <br /> <br /> By contrast, Durbin's presentation of "Il Bacio" is far more bad and subdued. Although it is perfectly appropriate for her "classic" selection, Durbin's delivery of Arditis is much more of the traditional "stand-n-sing" variety than Garland's physical emotional turn. Nevertheless, even though "miniature diva", Deanna does nothing to draw attention to herself, with her sincere eyes, dazzling smile and artificial delivery, she easily holds the screen with "jazz baby" Judy and their lovely duet of "Americana "In the final of the card, it is regrettable that producer Joe Pasternak could never realize his dream of mating Durbin and Garland in a musical feature film (because Universal refused to borrow" Number One Asset "Durbin). <br /> <br /> An invaluable document of the prevailing talents of two remarkable and truly unique talents. See this if you get a chance!
