Hong Kong, 1920s. A young man from poor beginnings dreams of being a hero and spending most of his time training and learning about kung fu and bodybuilding, much against his father's will. He helps a maid to escape a ruthless businessman whose goons then come after them and terrorize the young's uncle's noodle restaurant. Uncle turns out to be an old, reformed triad assassin who now helps the young guy become skilled in martial arts. It's all-out karate kid style with "wash wok" instead of "wax on, wax away". Kung fu villain is the ruthless businessman son who has a trademark scorpion style that looks cool even though it's pretty stupid and totally unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But the history, which evolves over time, has an epic feel, good characterization, great kung fu and is generally very entertaining. The young hero is very sympathetic and gives a good protagonist to fight for. The romance dimension, however, is undeveloped, which is a little disappointing. Otherwise a great movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 out of 10.
