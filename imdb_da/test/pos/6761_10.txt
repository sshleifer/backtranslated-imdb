This movie is the funniest Danish movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The reason is fun, surprising and exceptional. Danish humor is unlike others, and it gets you every time. The whole crowd laughed 90% of the time .... it was incredible. The characters are so well played, and the two actors Mads Mikkelsen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas play their best ever! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this movie, you won't regret it, believe me: -)
