This was a romantic, simple fun movie. I really enjoyed it and would definitely say watching it and enjoying it, Will Smith was fun, fumbly, nervous, sweet and just a simple guy who was hit by Love. It was nice to see him fall for someone and be so nervous and lost what to do or say. It was good. He was great, fun as usual. Eva Mendes was better than I expected her to be so good, I thought there were moments in the movie where Will got the shaft, he did everything he could to be a good guy and still being treated badly. The finish was romantic and happy and it was fantastic. I've seen it several times and would see it again. A fun movie, something you don't see much more. It had the old time with a new new look.
