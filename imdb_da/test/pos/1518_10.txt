Simply beautiful. One of the best mind ... screws --- exists. Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles in this story of a children's book author, who - perhaps? - has written a subversive channel. Moscow could learn a few things from the torture techniques in this movie. They could also do worse than hiring Alan Rickman. Five out of five stars and currently (1-20-2000) # 2 on my top 100 movies in all time lists.
