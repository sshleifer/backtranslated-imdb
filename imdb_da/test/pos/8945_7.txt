A humorous journey to the usually gloomy funeral service. It's easy to see and even offers Blethyn & Molina stealing a scene from an old Fred & Ginger movie. Walken is over the top as an avid competitor to Molina in the business sector and is trying to bring a new style to an old Welsh city. We see a couple of very funny examples of "the new style". The plot immerses that Pugh has an affair with Watts and her, suggesting that they do Blethyn. Meanwhile, Molina has revived her long suffering romantic feelings for Blethyn and convinces her to fake her death so they can run away to South Sea, and dance their days together. During the "false" funeral, Blethyn learns about her husband's adultery and plotted her revenge. See it for a show of what funerals probably should be - a celebration of life!
