Hilarious from start to finish there must be a great courage to deal with the theme of death with a smile, especially when two burial agencies are fighting for market control: a classic living room and a revolutionary where every funeral is a show, led by Christopher Walken, a therapist in the role of the visionary American mortitist. But the rest of the casting is also great, and this is another success that only the UK is able to do. Surprisingly among the ensemble cast is Naomi Watts, which hits another metamorphosis (accent included). Always sporting a smile on the face, it looks like a paradox that there might be so much comedy being taken from a movie that could be called "Four funerals and a wedding", but you understand when you see it.
