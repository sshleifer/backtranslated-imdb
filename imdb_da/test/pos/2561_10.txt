I chose to watch this movie for a reason and reason alone ... Samuel L. Jackson. I like him a lot. I hadn't seen any previews or trailers for this overlooked movie, so it went into it without real expectations. Jackson did not disappoint as Lazarus, a blues man in Deep South, perhaps delivering his most powerful performance ever, including playing and singing a number of excellent blues tunes. But the real surprise here was Christina Ricci, at best a crooked flighthead in real life who took the role of the sexually abused city ramp Rae and made her a credible, almost as good character. Seeing the related non-sexual relationship developing between Lazarus and Rae was simply amazing. Justin Timberlake, pop star turned to act, had to go back to causing "wardrobe failures" and prancing around a pop phase. His most forced performance was very distracting from the real story here. <br /> <br /> This movie is raw, gritty and sometimes "right in your face". Not everyone will like it. Those who do, however, will quickly move it to the top of their favorite list.
