No it's not an Ed Wood movie. "Angora Love" is Stan Laurel's and Oliver Hardy's latest silent movie. End of an era! In the 20s, Laurel & Hardy makes a genuine mark on the silent movie genre with films that are still popular and seen and aired regularly, this contemporary day. It's a shame that this movie is not among their best. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for the movie sounds good and is good. The boys join forces with a goat this time, which of course leads them to trouble and for us some fun situations to see. However, at the same time it is extremely stupid and just amazing to see the boys make comedy things with a goat. Most of the jokes in the film still work well, but the film never becomes quite fun or memorable. The comedy and the story really feel lacking at times and are mostly too simple and predictable. <br /> <br /> Still, good and fun enough to look after the fans, but still a slightly disappointing last silent Laurel & Hardy entry. <br /> <br /> 7/10
