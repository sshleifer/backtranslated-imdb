When I looked again at this movie, I think it belongs to Hitchcock's greatest movie. The first time I saw it, I was just blown away by the excitement, action and imagery. It has the gripping end, the horrible murderer, the innocent man framed or the victim of circumstances, some great on-location shots, eg. Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York. It also has big supporting actors with Hitch's daughter Patricia in the role of younger sister of Ruth Roman and stalwart Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock films. The joyous round episode near the end is one of the most nerve-wracking in Hitchcock's body. <br /> <br /> Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony (his last full movie) gives a great performance as the horrible stranger on the train, who is worried by the unsuspecting tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger). Granger plays the nice guy caught in a messy divorce. The movie opens with the camera showing two separate men's shoes as they leave their taxis on board the train. Eventually they meet and the story takes over. The stranger takes an unusual interest in the tennis star, and as the film continues, the stranger becomes a stalker. The action changes from place to place, including Washington, the fictional little town of Metcalf, the Forest Hills tennis championship, and a passenger train taking the two leading men back and forth on separate missions. Towards the end, the pace of a tennis game is woven into the plot as they run towards the time. The camera cuts off to the athletes' faces as they volley and serve in a remarkable series of shots. When the close battle is over, it finds the climax hunt place. Hitchcock has a love of trains and it's great to see Penn Station, far away. The trains are available in 39 steps, Lady Vanishes, Shadow of Doubt, Spellbound, North by Northwest and this movie. <br /> <br /> This classic Hitchcock thriller took place at the start of a period of great creativity for the thrill of the 1950s, and I am convinced that it will once be blamed on Hitchcock Hall of Fame.
