This movie grabbed me right from the start, when a cute teenage girl appears on a grave alone, then Elton John's powerful song "Friends" begins to play while she turns out to walk alone through the streets of Paris carrying a suitcase, naively ignorant of car theft and prostitution takes place around her. The whole movie is a beautiful, dreamy, romantic collection of scenes of young love, holding hands, living in the countryside, wild horses running freely, wildernesses, sunsets, roses of wine, evenings at the firewood, having fun, and ordinary innocence, all set to romantic music by Elton John. It's magical. <br /> <br /> Somehow I missed seeing this movie when I grew up. I'm sure it would have left a strong impression on me if I had seen it then. I remember the radio ad for the movie in 1971 and talked about how it was a special movie with music by Elton John, and with the chorus of the theme song "Friends" that played in the ad ("Makin 'friends for the world to see ...), but I've never heard anything else about it these days, and I never saw it until I rented it 35 years later from a video store, then it was edited, censored, and all sorts of unhappy people with angry political agendas used all sorts of things ugly words to describe the movie, what can i say? The world has gone crazy since then. The story is that a 14-year-old girl is forced to move in with her cousin in Paris after both her parents die. One day, while visiting the zoo alone, she meets a 15-year-old boy, knocks it off and agrees to meet the next day, the next day as he drives together the boy accidentally his car in a lake in a freakish solo car accident. It was his father's car, he can't bear to go home to face his father's anger, so the two teenagers start living in the French countryside together, they both hated their lives at home. They settle in an uninhabited cottage, the boy takes odd jobs to support himself, their supposed friendship turns into romance, the girl becomes pregnant, and they have a baby at home successfully. Still, the boy's father police tried to find his missing son. On 1 year anniversary of the couple's plane together, the police finally find the boy's employer at an individual examination and are told that they can see the boy the next morning when he comes to work. The next morning, the boy leaving his cabin to go to work, says a sweet goodbye to his boyfriend / wife, and happily does cartwheels as the stage freezes on his girlfriend waving goodbye. At least that's how the video version I saw ends. It is an unexpected but well-defined ending that probably depicts the last moments of bliss before the boy is taken back to his parents' home, and his happy life with his wife and baby is broken. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as the story and the images, the plot is terribly unrealistic and highly constructed. I think it's better just to enjoy the movie as a youth's dream-based fantasy and no longer analyze, because all logic and credibility quickly fall apart when the story is explored in depth. Why would a fully furnished and warehouse be left unattended by the door unlocked and unvisited for a whole year? What did they plan to do when the owners returned? Why would a girl trust a thief enough to get pregnant from him? Didn't they think it was unethical to use someone else's home and food? How could they ever hope for dental care or other emergency medical care while living outside the community? How could the boy have a car accident on a road without a collision and no other cars around? Where are places anywhere near civilization where wild horses run free? How is it that a teenage man would not have sex as the primary in his thoughts when he picks up a girl in a zoo? (The Elton John lyrics just don't fit in.) Why should they take clothes when they are sleeping at night when it is getting cold? Etc. Vildhestees scenes are designed to appeal to girls, just like the unrealistic theme of "friendship before romance" and all the backwashing and tingling scenes with their predictable results, running through the flower fields against each other, the hare filters, the scenes shot through wildflowers in the foreground, the baby's ducks etc. It works, but it's certainly designed. <br /> <br /> Still, it's a film about youth and freedom, and the idea hasn't changed since the 1970s. Young people today are still treated as possessions or as lost pets to be recovered by the police instead of being treated as mature people who have the same need for romantic love and freedom as the adult world and the ability to be responsible when they get it freedom. Therefore, the message is universal. It is clear why a successor would not work: This story is about a magical, annual exposure from the real world. Such a situation could never have been prolonged indefinitely, provided that it could even happen initially, and a story of real life afterwards would lack the magic appeal of such an unreal state of existence. I really hope that no teenager took the film seriously enough to try such a stupid stunt. But I just as well hope that teens who were impressed with this movie in the 70's learned something from it and since then have tried to make such a magical world a more achievable reality for others, rather than continuing society various hate and repressions, especially on their own children.
