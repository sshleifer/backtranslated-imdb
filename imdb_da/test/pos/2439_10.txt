this is one of my favorite movies ever! along with casablanca and cannibal holocaust it is near perfect cinema. rex allen tells this wonderful story of a cougar that just needs a little loving. contains action, adventure, excitement, comedy and riverbed chaos! SEE THIS MOVIE TO DO DEATH TO DO IT !!! You will not find a better cat image anywhere where "cat from outer space" comes in as a not so close second. Charles's performance is magnificent. itself includes animals cruelty and intense logging! must love Disney, for all moral errors!
