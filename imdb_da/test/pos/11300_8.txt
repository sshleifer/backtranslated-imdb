Heard about this movie a long time ago and finally found it on ebay for five bucks. I didn't expect much, but wow, I was ever surprised. It's a story of a boy and a girl in love with trying to escape an evil king who wants the girl to herself and takes place in a big castle, reminds me of ICO for PS2 because some shots gave you a feeling of dizziness . this movie is crazy! It is hard to believe that such an original animated feature was made in 1952. The king was probably one of the most embarrassing characters I have seen in a long time with a feminine walk, nice eyes (usually crossed) and a soft but frightening vote. The only problem I had with the movie was that the boy and the girl had no personality and hardly even any lines except to call Mr Wonderbird (A great talking green bird) to save them. The animation was amazing in most areas, but some cells were missing from some scenes that sucked. It's incredibly original with flying police and gigantic mechs and even laughing loudly fun at times, it's a shame it's such a fuzzy title because it's really a good movie. Check it out sometime.
