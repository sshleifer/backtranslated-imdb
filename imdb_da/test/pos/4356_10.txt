What attracts a man to military service? What is preparing a man to survive brutal torture as prisoners of war? What desperation leads to the planning and execution of an escape in the jungles of Southeast Asia? How does he handle the ghosts and memories he returns with? Herzog tries to answer these questions in his documentary by Dieter Dengler, the German emigre and the US Navy pilot shot down over Laos in 1966, which was captured, tortured and starved, but eventually escaped to be haunted by the experience of the rest of his life. A strong and personal first-hand account of the man, his life and experience is told through the apparent integration of interviews, archive films and new recordings. You will never forget this story - or this man.
