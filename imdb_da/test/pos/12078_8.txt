This should be the ultimate chick flick ever. We lost it from T.V. years ago, and I've seen it about 30 times over the years. I hadn't seen it for about 12 years and so recently on this movie. I don't lie, I shouted from opening points to the final credits. This movie really tears your heart out even if you don't have children.
