I saw this at the BendFilm Festival Friday in the middle of an indefinite crowd, not helped by a bad decision from the event planners who chose an entirely inappropriate short film before the movie. And it really threw the audience as the modern love came up for a bright, moody card (name I forget). <br /> <br /> People !!! It was really silly to mix this card with Modern Love - a serious drama movie. A movie. <br /> <br /> So the audience gets teaser that is a comedy and so ... Modern Love. Hmmmm. Modern Love, in spite of my reservations (strange ending, a little too tangential) needed a short film that was in keeping with the difference odd, so my advice to programmers for next year is to take more care of planning the show . <br /> <People who look at modern love just didn't know what had hit them - they were led up the path, and that's not their fault. Modern love has some amazing performances that play well against the movie's tangential meanings - a movie that its maker seems to have 'wondered aloud' rather than executed in the normal way a movie is written and shot. <br /> <br /> Too bad the audience was misinformed. Wrong session placement, wrong short film, wrong approach from the well-employed programmers, who despite a good effort must see much more movies and travel to some other festivals.
