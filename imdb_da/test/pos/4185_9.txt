Sorry Monkees. People always accused them of being portrayed (as they were) or being more than an American pioneer of the Beatles (again as they were), but for the children of the time they were right they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who was better Monkeys or The Beatles were common at school yards, but the critics, yes they never bought them right. Despite recording some very captivating, classic pop songs, Monk's did not receive much respect for their album. Unfortunately, a similar fate was fulfilled by their one movie vehicle despite being the best band movie ever. Beatle fans can claim that "Hard Days Night" was better, and I am sure many of the kids are thinking "8 Mile" was superior, but none of those films were so bold and inventive as "Head," and That is probably why we succeeded. <br /> <br /> If Head had told a direct A to B type story, it might have appealed to the band young fans, but by pushing the envelope and using the movie option to spot their own image, they truly sabotaged the movie with their fans. Can you imagine Eminem turning to the camera and actually talking about how sad it is that he is the best-selling guy in a genre where only 5% (and I am generous) of the actions are white. If you can see it than you have an idea of ​​how daring it was for Monkess to sing "Hey, Hey, we're Monkees. You know we like to please. A depicted image without philosophy". When you have a movie where Frank Zappa tells Davy that he should focus less on the dance, and more on the music, it is clear that there is much more to you that you expected. <br /> <br /> The story, What is, is about the boys trying to escape their leader, who at one time forces them to play dandruff in a commercial, but every time they run away, they end up in a box . I don't think you should be Fellini to find out the symbolism on that bit. Some nice little comedy bits come with Davy as a boxer who has to give up playing the violin to take a dive in the big game and Peter refuses to throw an ice cream cone that he doesn't want because there are starving children so it's wrong Wasting food, but the right selling point for this movie is the music and it is some of the best band ever recorded. Even if you are beaten by history, you can sit back and enjoy great music. <br /> <br /> Any movie that begins and ends with Mickey tries suicide by jumping out of a bridge (in the end, following the band he) will never be a mainstream classic, but if you are a fan of either The band or experimental cinema in the era than you will enjoy this movie.
