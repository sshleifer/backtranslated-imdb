This is speculation. This movie could inspire Paramount Pictures to film the movie The Core. Both films have something in common nature. The only improvement for Inferno is a better cast. However, Inferno's throw is still good. Excellent movie 8 out of 10. This is worth seeing. This movie has truth to it, heat waves are real. Another piece of truth is heat related power outages. In fact, where I live, I have heard transformers blow. Impulses from heat are possible because people who seek to cool can get rowdy. There is a significant amount of teamwork in this movie. Again this a movie worth seeing. The movie has a good cast. The film has no slow spots.
