While friendly and entertaining for gay audiences, Frank Oz's movie "In and Out" of a closeted gay teacher who has been on national television by a former student has been sanitized and deodorized to appeal to the bigger and more profitable ones viewers patronized "The Bird Cage." Although the audience is likely to clap at the back to be tolerant and liberal enough to watch the movie, the movie revolves around Kevin Klines Howard Brackett, who is a grossly stereotypical gay man. The film claims that a tendency to dance to disco music, experience Barbra Streisand movies and dress well into one's sexual orientation. Like the "Queer Eye", the film actually takes a backhanded pat on straight men and stereotypes those who are lethargic, dim witted and lacking in taste and culture. OK, so "In and Out" is just a comedy, but even comedies send messages that can hurt. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in the middle of the film's humor is a somewhat pathetic character. Howard is the Middle Ages, deeply dressed or self-denied, and has apparently never had sex life. A three-year commitment to a female teacher in school, where he works, is described as a series of sunsets, long conversations, and looks at "Funny Lady". Fortunately, Joan Cusack plays Howard's intention, Emily Montgomery, and she steals the show all the way. Most of the movie's funniest moments belong to her, although Kline's attempt to resist dance during a macho tape instruction tape is fun. He is a gifted physical performer, but the film only gives him a few moments to shine. Matt Dillon also stands out when the student became an actor, and the clip from his Oscar nominated films about a gay soldier is hysterical. In spite of the film's gay theme, however, there is no boy-meeting-drummer's romance, and only one man-to-man kiss, and the smooch is as erotic as one between Michael and Fredo Corleone in "Godfather II". <br /> <br /> Though appropriate, "In and Out" fails to solve the injustices and prejudices that it illustrates. Howard is fired from his teaching work despite his outstanding achievements and credentials, however, there is little violence expressed. Most of the characters are more upset about the annulled wedding than about Howard's self-realization, which seems to happen overnight, and his sudden and unfair dismissal. It is not surprising that Howard's parents, led by Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley, and his students rise to support him. However, the sugary finale is so embarrassing for the audience that it was obvious to Howard Brackett in the film. The movie would have been more refreshing if it had turned around a gay man dressed as a slob, was a rabid fan of football, drove a station wagon, listened to country music and lived on fast food. In spite of some good performances and fun situations, "In and Out" stereotypes continue, and whether positive or negative, stereotypes must be sent to sleep in social history.
