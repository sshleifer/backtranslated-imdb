I finally got hold of Lifeforce on DVD with widescreen format intact and rowing Henry Mancini score to max. Having seen Lifeforce for fifteen years on tape, I have to say that the 'uncomplicated' DVD version was both great and disappointing. The American version is so * much * better than the DVD (European?) Version. The American version of the life force moves much faster (editing on the DVD version is horrible. Feels like an unfinished piece). And the many scenes not seen in the American version add little or nothing to the final problem. In fact, one "new" moment destroys the whole movie when Caine (Peter Firth) meets male stranger in the cathedral. I love this scene, though in the American version. On the DVD, the male alien speaks to Caine, and what he says is soooooo fun. It's the top of hilarity: <br /> <br /> "It'll be much less scary if you just come to me!" The male alien says in a deep 1950s style voice. I was the floor when I saw this. It just doesn't belong in the movie. That scene is pure camp in an otherwise super serious flick. I love Hooper (or who) cut that scene when the movie was released in North America. There are several changes that were made to the American version that makes Lifeforce so much better and I wanted the DVD to have the American version. The editing is sharp and frenzied without being annoying, and some sites that were already boring in the American version are even more boring on the DVD version due to added scenes. And the opening credits on the DVD are terrible. Much better in the American version. More subtle. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. It is basically aliens who make a pit stop over the ground and suck up as much Lifeforce as possible. The movie has too many flat, uninspiring sequences (speech, speech, speech), but when the action goes to London, it's fun. The film really shines in these scenes. You can see Hooper finally doing what he is good at: chaos, wildness, scare! Lifeforce should have had several of these chaos scenes. They are the best apocalyptic scenes ever put on film. It is also the best zombie film ever. The zombies are hungry (for life force, not meat) and they are crazy and agile and scary. Not the slow movements of other zombie films. Many have also criticized the end, but I love it. It leaves you high and dry as one of the life-killed victims. <br /> <br /> And to believe that this movie came under the sweet and cozy 80s when people flocked to E.T. or Cocoon or something sweet and boring, feel good sci-fi movies. No wonder it was bombed because it was far ahead of its time with its supernihilistic point of view! <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, that's not good. The picture is muddy and grainy, and there is no extras at all. But it's great to watch the movie in its widescreen format. I just hope they will release a clean, crisp American version on a DVD and with comments from Hooper and Dykstra.
