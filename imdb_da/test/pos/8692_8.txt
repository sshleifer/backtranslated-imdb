Despite its age, this film retains its incredible charm and appeal, and is a fine surviving example of the early British cinema. It has an underlying air of creepy, mingled with humorous shafts that are not out of place, and serves to demonstrate the security directions and production values ​​involved. So many episodic movie types are uneven and sloppy, but it's not one of them. The action standard helps a great deal, and the various different characters come across equally interesting and credible. All in all, this long forgotten little gem is worthy of everyone's attention, despite the sharp note in the film, which surprisingly escaped the censorship's attention!
