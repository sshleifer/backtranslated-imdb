Can a movie be too faithful to the book on which it is based? Judging by the time-consuming 2007 adaptation of Khaled Hossei's big 2003 salesman, the answer is quite ironically "yes". Like many, I became excited about the book, an impressive first effort by the Afghan-American author / doctor. Clearly, director Marc Forster ("Stranger Than Fiction") and screenwriter David Benioff ("Troy") paid careful attention to the most significant details of the story within the film's 127 minute playtime. Yet, the seamless loss of cordial events in Hosseini's novel is often cross-episodic and truncated because Forster and Benioff sincerely try hard to remain true to the full extent of history within the time constraints. Part of the challenge is how Hosseini has carefully used symbolic actions to give literary, then-and-now symmetry to what is essentially a three-story storyline, a cross-sectional technique . <br /> <br /> The film authorities, however, do the most important things right, and specifically give the viewer an intimate look at a hidden culture that was so far made through CNN news reports, and ensures authenticity by having characters spoken in the Afghan Linguistic dialect and captures the emotional confusion of the complex narrative. The first part of the film was set in 1978 Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion and possible takeover of the Taliban. The focus is on the relationship between Amir, the son of a wealthy businessman named Baba, and the devoted Hassan, the son of his father's servant. Connected by their common love of kite surfing, they are two thick as twenty until a tragic event separates them irreparably. Amir is unable to find the courage that comes so naturally to her father that Amir is paralyzed for failing to save Hassan from an indescribable act by a trio of local bullies. Forster makes especially the palpable ethnic tensions between Hazara and Pashtun in Afghanistan. <br/> At the 1979 invasion of Soviet troops, Amir and Baba fly to the United States, where history captures their history nine years later in Fremont, California, a suburban enclave of Afghan emigrants. Baba is reduced to work in a gas station and operates a flea market kiosk. Amir meets a local Afghan girl and marries. This is the film's least interesting passage, as Benioff's treatment gives concise signs to Amir's wife Soraya, and Amir is most critically depicted by necessity as a reticent young man with a downward throw at his self-esteem. The last paragraph flashes for twelve years, when Amir, when publishing his first book, is summoned back to the Taliban-dictated Afghanistan to save Hassan's son from the Taliban as a means of zone for his feud years earlier. There is true excitement and fear generated in this part of the story as shocking revelations, and old acquaintances come back to haunt Amir during his journey. A British actor of Egyptian heritage, Khalid Abdalla (driver of "United 93"), has the central role of Amir as an adult, a challenging role, as he has to convey a constant sense of shame and diminished self-esteem to the end. The other professional players go better - Shaun Toub (Tony Starks saves the Yins in the current "Iron Man") as Baba's business partner Rahim Khan, who holds the key to the truth; Atossa Leoni affects quietly like Soraya; And best of all, the Iranian actor Homayoun Ershadi, who brings pride and dignity to Baba. Three young non-professionals were recruited from Kabul's school system to play the main roles of children, and all are quite good. Zekeria Ebrahimi is up to the toughest challenge as young Amir, and Ali Danish Bakhtyari is exciting as Hassan's almost cathatonic son Sohrab. But it is the carefree eyes, the moon's face Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada, who will break your heart like the young Hassan, especially in the devastating pomegranate throwing scene. It is fair to say that his performance is on par with the young Enzo Staiola in Vittorio de Sica's classic "Bicycle Thieves". The technical aspects are well done, especially Roberto Schaefer's pure filmography (Western China convincing replacements for Afghanistan), Alberto Iglesias' evocative score and even the CGI effects show kites in turbulent flight. The 2008 DVD has a solid set of extras that begin with an insightful comment from Forster, Hosseini and Benioff, although some of their dialogue seems quite compulsory. There are two featurettes included - the first being the 14-minute "Words of the Kite Runner" that focuses on Hosseini's connection to the story and the novel's development, and the other is the 25-minute "Kite Runner Pictures", sees a more standard bag the stage of production. Complementing extras is the original theater supporter, a couple of previews and a PSA from Hosseini on how to help the Afghans in their present needs.
