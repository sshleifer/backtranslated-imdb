A ham actor without a crown. Who better than Michael Caine to play such a character? He is complete and completely fun, but as in most of Caine's performances, he goes for it right. The movie seems to be a showcase of Dylan Moran, and he's fine in his dual action with Caine. However, this is where the script falls. Moran's imitations should have been incorporated in a more organic way. They are too much of an action on their own and make the potential plausibility of the plot fly out of the window. Forget it. Get it if you can find it. There is plenty in it to make it a pleasant trip.
