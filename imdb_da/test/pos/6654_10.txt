"How can a name, not even a real name, break your heart?" That's the way it is. There have been few movie versions of a famous novel that have made better justice to their source material than Anthony Minghella's film by Charles Fraziers Cold Mountain. If you have read the book, you will be able to feel most of the big scenes that the soul shakes. I shouted personally many times while reading the novel and spent much of the evening watching the movie through tears. <br /> <br /> Terrible scope, beautiful words, great plays and good music. In the interview on DVD included with the film, Minghella discusses the several layers of the story. Everyone works. One of the best movies I've seen and an invitation to one of the greatest novels in the last ten years.
