I had seen this movie as a child and loved it. I loved how spunky and full of energy Nikki is and how she mostly destroys Louden's perfect yuppie life and destroys him and makes him his crazy ways. As a child in the 80s, I saw New York exactly as it was portrayed in this movie, the domain of Madonna's character, with wild animals running hideous and hideous bald men chasing people around and causing chaos. Now as an adult, I find that I love the movie for the same reasons, and even more so because the love story woven into the crazy engagement of Mrs. Nikki Finn. Although I would still love to go everywhere and find an indoor atrium as in this movie. Pure beauty and genius.
