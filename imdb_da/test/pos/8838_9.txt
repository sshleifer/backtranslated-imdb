Ironically, what makes John Carpenter's "The Thing" such an entertaining sci-fi movie is its genre-defying elements of mystery, excitement and tight plot structure. It is ashamed of such films as "Aliens" or "Armageddon", who are content to flood the viewer with special effects, while their plot is about stunts that beat the laws of physics, testosterone-loaded enliners, heroes equipped with enough artillery to conquer Iraq and pathetic attempts to inject "meaning" into barrage on the screen with "emotional sequences" that only serve to further offend the public's intelligence. Of course, the highest tragedy is that these types of lobotomized films are also the most popular. I think there is a reason for this, though it is not very comforting. There is a growing tendency in our culture to passively "surrender" to the media - immerse themselves in the images we see without dedicating a single brain cell to understanding the statement the work is trying to make. This thinking is becoming more and more dominant in all arenas; even the once-sacred print medium is thinned thanks to the abominable "reader response" theory that permeates our schools and the "tabloid brigade" which lines our magazine holders whose mentality apparently infiltrates the once-worthy mainstream press. Today we just flip the contact and put our minds on "pause". Is "The Thing" a "good" movie? For the rare person who still appreciates his reason, a more appropriate term would be "entertaining". Its plot holds a guess, its ending is uncompromising, and it has some redeeming statements about human paranoia. At subsequent views, one begins to notice a conspicuous lack of depth in the play, but the tight history is still convincing. Of course, "Citizen Kane" it is not, but again sci-fi was never a thinking human's genre ...
