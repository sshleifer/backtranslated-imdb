Like in Rififi, the most compelling scene in the movie is the perfect silence in the jewel. The scene is masterful in its performance, each of the robbers having their own specialized job to perform, each successfully combining their own unique talent against the target, each up to a month before completing strangers. <br /> <br /> Many of the scenes play very slowly. In fact, the opening scene is an introduction to long character for both Corey and Vogel, as we see that Corey is released from prison, and Vogel escapes catches to prison. The two characters are so methodically brought together through fate on a roadside when Vogel hides in the trunk of Corey's car. From this unlikely break-in, the two strangers agree to become partners to commit a perfect and precise jewel hoist. But to pull off this hoist, they must include help from a third man named Jansen. Jansen is employed as a safe shot gun man. His admission to the mix was an interesting and desperate choice. At the time of his rental, Jansen is in full battle with DT and spent most of his day in his cot hallucinating over lizards, snakes and spiders. His transition from the confused and hallucinating world of a William S. Burrough's dream into the ever-handy and naked sharp shooter is a very fast and perhaps the only real fake moment in the movie, but it's just me who is extremely fussy . <Br /> <br /> Another mildly false note was the police inspector Mattei. At times, he seemed to be brilliant in the form of strong arming of the right people or gathering information and awaiting his escaped prisoner to make his move. Other times, he seemed to be 10 years before retirement, especially at the beginning of Vogel's escape through the forest. <br /> <br /> I wonder if I got too much hidden meaning from the start of the movie. At the start of the movie, which the police car accelerates through the city, the first picture we see is a red stoplight. My first thought was that this could be the 'red circle' and that if I were to find a deeper meaning in the movie, maybe this car, or rather the people's inside goes through the red light, will be the ones who want to "stop" the jewel. Hmmmm? <br /> <br /> The red circle might refer to the triumvirate thief ring? Maybe it was the burning sledge? No matter. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but it doesn't feel that way. The end is a little disappointed. It also seemed to hurry on a movie that felt such a delicious slow burn. 9/10 <br /> <br /> Clark Richards
