Sweet, entertaining tale of a young 17 1/2 year old boy, ruled by a indulgent religious mother and drawn father, and how he finds himself through his work with a retired, eccentric and tragic actress. Very well acted, especially by Julie Walters. Rupert Grint plays the role of teenage boy well, showing his talent will last longer than the Harry Potter series of movies. Laura Linney plays her ruthless strict mother with no impression of redemption, so there is no room to like her. But the film is a very entertaining film, made well by the British in the style of likes like Keeping Mum and Calendar Girls.
