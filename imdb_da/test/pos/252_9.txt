It took a lending movie to Columbia for Gene Kelly's home study MGM to realize his creative talent and give him control over what he did in his own films. Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworth's signature film for the GIs and their pinup fantasies during World War II. <br /> <br /> Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn, where Rita is a featured dancer and Phil Silvers cartoon. Of course, Kelly calves a little there. <br /> <br /> Hayworth becomes aware of the millionaire Otto Kruger when it appears that Kruger had loved and lost Hayworth's grandmother. In some flashback sequences from the gas lysera, Hayworth also plays his own grandmother with Jess Barker, who plays the young Kruger. You can remember that Jess Barker was the husband of the second legendary screen redhead Susan Hayward. <br /> <br /> Broadway producer Lee Bowman is also attracted to Hayward, but he is not interested in nostalgia. He wants her for his Ziegfeld Follies revue and actually is the largest number of Cover Girl movie title song. It is nicely made in Follie's style. Hayworth also gets to sing a safe thing in a gas light era number and in the only song in the show not written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, Hayworth also makes an old English music song number Poor John. When I say sing as everyone knows Rita's mouth words. Song here is made by Nan Wynn. <br /> <br /> The biggest hit on the show is Long Ago and Far Away, introduced by Gene Kelly. It was one of the greatest hits of the Second World War, and one of the greatest sellers Jerome Kern ever wrote. It actually happens to be a favorite of my aunt who, with my uncle, celebrates 60 years of marriage in September. Long Ago and Far Away were nominated for Best Song, but lost to Swinging on a Star. What really puts Cover Girl apart and what makes it a milestone movie for Gene Kelly, the two numbers put me to the Test and Alter Ego number. Harry Cohn decided to do what Louis B. Mayer had refused at MGM to give Kelly creative control over his own material. Kelly later said that the alter-ego number was one of the hardest things he ever tried in his career. There he dances with a light reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate. <br /> <br /> In fact, after an additional lending movie, Christmas vacation at Universal, Louis B. Mayer, never borrowed Gene Kelly for the rest of the time he was at MGM. And then he got creative control from then on. <br /> <br /> With the dazzling technicolor filmography and Rita's red hair and Gene Kelly's boundless creativity, Cover Girl is a classic and will always be.
