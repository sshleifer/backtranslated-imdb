I watched this expect to see the usual British rigid upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humor. It was more like Eastenders Goes to Sea than what we serve. The scenes during the rapprochement and the attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a naval ship and the peaks and bumps of the ship's firm (well at least based on my service in the 1970s). Some of the throwaway lines are very witty ("I'm not in the Band of Hope just to please some oily fish fryer!). My only complaint is that they didn't show what happened to the Irish coxswain and his bride to be , or the tattooed PO and his "I Love Arabella" tattoo!
