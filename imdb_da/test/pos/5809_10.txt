Many years ago, with "Ray of Light", Madonna broke through to a truly amazing level of musical art, and since then she has even surpassed even her own standards. This concert production, with its hypnotic editing, amazing dances, hallucinatory light effects and trance-inducing events, blows all previous efforts. Madonna's apparent ambition - dealing with world peace through music and dance - may seem hubby or absurd to some. But hell, somebody has to do it! Thanks to her collection of the remarkable talent of everyone involved in this production, "Confessions Tour Live from London" again among the top ten artists working anywhere in the world on any medium.
