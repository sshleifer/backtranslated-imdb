This movie is one of the best memories I have from childhood. Having always loved tigers, my mother took me to see it. <br /> <br /> It's amazing. Its one of the movies that leaves a lasting impression on you. The image of tigers running through the snow with it all, spraying around, is still in my head about 25 years, not many movies have managed it. As other comments have said, the photography is amazing. One should see. I have also been looking for the movie for some time without any luck. :-(. Controlling Amazon occasionally reveals nothing, not even listed. If anyone knows about a source, contact me or send here. Tim
