Although it is not the masterpiece that "Le Samourai" was (I have now accepted that Jean-Pierre Melville could never top that classic), I find "Le Cercle Rouge" to be much better than "Bob le flambeur". I felt that "Bob le flambeur" was an above average and influential b movie, but still a b movie. "Le Cercle Rouge" proves that Melville has improved as a filmmaker as he continued. John Woo is a massive fan of Melville, although their film-making style differs. While Woo uses fast motion for shootouts and an operational sense of violence, Melville has a minimalist style that suits him very well. He was not interested in creating fast action movies, but more meditative criminal thrillers. In that department he was one of the best. "Le Samourai" is still its best work, primarily because it has more character development than this, but on a technical level they are probably the same. Moreover, while "Le Samourai" had a great leading performance, this has four. Alain Delon is once again an ultralight gangster on prowl - this man's silence is fascinating. Bourvil is great as a police inspector on the case of heist and escaped con. He steals every scene he is in and shows that he was a skilled dramatic actor (in France he is best known as a slapstick comedian in fashion Buster Keaton). Yves Montand is also great as the shaken and paranoid pistol expert. Gian Maria Volont√® (a regular in spaghetti westerns) is overshadowed by his three co-stars, but still does an appropriate job. Melville's direction is once again amazing. With the same influence from both US detectives and the French New Wave, the man always seems to know the best shots and angles to choose. This is slower than most racing games, but it really pays off at the end. "Le Cercle Rouge" is a bit smaller than being an absolute classic, but is still one of the best whistles ever made. Tarantino must have seen this before making "Reservoir Dogs". (8/10)
