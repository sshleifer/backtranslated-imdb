I loved this movie !!! It was so easy to become part of the characters life and really feel the feelings they went through. <br /> <br /> A movie full of laughs, sarcasm, shock and just disturbs a fantastic romantic drama really! /> <br /> The only part I didn't enjoy was in the special features. The background scenes commentary was a little off putting. Because I watched the movie before the extras, I prefer to think of the actors as the characters (stupidly I know), but the actors' personality is very different from the characters they play. But nevertheless, it is a fantastic, spectacular, brilliant movie, I recommend that anyone who watched this movie and thought hmmmmmmm, should I buy it? the answer must be a clear yes!
