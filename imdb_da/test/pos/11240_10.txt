There are too many people in this forum who of course have missed the subtle humor in this series. <br /> <br /> This show is great because it is a hilarious parody of itself. Guys who are self-tested bounce get a good chance to convince us of their seduction skills until they "hit the field" just to reveal their complete lack of "games" on national television? it is absolutely fun and the guys who are really talented are very convincing to see as they unnecessarily seduce the pretentious women who frequent these trendy nightclubs! <br /> <br /> It celebrates unique charisma when deserving and mocks wild-colored douchebags when deserved. Whatever it is, it is always entertaining because, unlike other dating, it shows up to the authentic creepy and excitement of a "pickup". I highly recommend this show to anyone with a sense of humor.
