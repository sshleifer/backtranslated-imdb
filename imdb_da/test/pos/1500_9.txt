The three shorts included in this edition issued in 1959 are timeless Chaplin classics, nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either. Chaplin's score for these films and the frames added as embroidery between the shorts is also well done. The problem with this compilation is a minor, yet annoying one. The shorts have been stretch printed to fit the 24 frame p.s. the speed of modern films while the shorts even where shot at 20 frames p.s. This result is jerky motion that doesn't seem to be very attractive, and yet it was an excusable solution that was justified by optical printing technology at the time, it's just not excusable that the current DVD version is unmoved, the movies looks dirty as they did in 1959 and is still stretchy. There are separate restored versions of these classics available, even on DVD, and it would not be a problem to restore the image, but unfortunately it has not been done. <br /> <br /> My article lacks clarity, but again I say a slight blur, it should not detract from the experience, even if it detracted from one point of my judgment. The shorts are still worth '10 '.
