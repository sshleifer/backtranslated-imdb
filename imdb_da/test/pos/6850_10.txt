Carla Gugino literally melts the screen in this crime cap. Her sex appeal, abundant assets and sexy southern accent more than make this movie rewatchable. But the film has so many "other" things to make it almost a modern classic. Simon Baker's performance for one thing. Really there for a great actor. To Schweiger is so perfectly thrown it makes me wonder why he is not a great "crossover" star. Gil Bellows rounds out this motely crew and literally steals this show. The second Gugino split is easily the best performance in the movie. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are so brilliant ... I can't even describe it. Great chemistry. <br /> <br /> The music is so highly eclectic that it was a sign in itself. Wonderful to see. <br /> <br /> People can say Tarantino is affected ... I disagree. It is completely unique and wise in itself. Sebastian Gutierrez does a wonderful job of controlling this closely-woven film and underplaying many scenes that have left me awake. The end is scary and you never see it. All in all, a nice movie that for me is the very definition of what a good movie should be.
