Captured this 1969 movie on cable TCM one night. I remember when I first saw the film in Hong Kong, I really enjoyed the songs and performances of Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. I love Clark most in Francis Ford Coppola's "Finian's Rainbow" (1968) opposite Fred Astaire, Don Francks and Tommy Steele. Simply ecstatic to learn finally, this lovely Irish tasteful pot of gold music is released on DVD! Oh, "it's the old devil's moon (in your eyes)." <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as Mr. Chips - yes, he sang - quite deliverance. He can't be a musician veteran like Rex Harrison, but he inhabited the role wonderfully. The scene of him running across the lawn of his cape a-flying reminds me of the PBS series, "Serving them all my days" - a lovable school leader and loving man, he is "Mr. Chipey." Clark and O'Toole just gave us the right mix of spunk and circumstance.The songs and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse are captivating as usual.The course of "you and me" and "go through the world (with me)" remained with me most of And there are "What many flowers" "And the sky smiled", "Fill the world with love" - ​​not syrup at all. Sometimes I think, if the world is immersed in Bricusse's songs and words, we would overcome all strife on earth and "lovely" will be all our days! Yes, "Talk to the Animals" too. ("Doctor Doolittle" 1967) <br /> <br /> Musicals are a blessing to the movie world, they are somehow bigger than life and music by the Sherman Brothers (Richard M. and Robert B.) who gave us "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" (1968) and "Mary Poppins" (1964) - who would not feel quite happy just to pronunciation "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"? I was even source of even a selected song and dance song in the Spanish film "Km .0 - Kilometer Zero "(2000). My favorite is French film maker Jacques Demy's "Young Girls of Rochefort" (1967) with colorful cast of Catherine Deneuve and (later sister) Francoise Dorléac, Jacques Perrin, Michel Piccoli, Danielle Darrieux, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris singing, dancing to Michel Legrands music. Long live musicals.
