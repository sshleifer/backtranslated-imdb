It is not necessary for me to repeat Glenn's synopsis. The black and white tradition is even more powerful in portraying the gloom of rural life at that time. The deep measurement of friendship Babette shows against the two older sisters touches the heartbeat. The support supports are excellent and their performances are amazing, it would not be reasonable to designate any character, as the whole story depends on the casting as a whole. I can't put my finger exactly on why I rate this movie so highly, since I'm not a professional critic; Individual viewers may or may not agree with my judgment, as enjoyment of this type of film is always in the eyes of the guards.
