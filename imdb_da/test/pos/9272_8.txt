Remember Greg the Bunny? It was this show that started on the Independent Film Channel, but turned into a full blown sitcom on Fox. My cousin and I thought it was pretty fun, besides the upscale idea of ​​dolls taking on TV-PG material. The dolls that kill occur in a similar universe where dolls live in the same world as humans, and like us, go to work and life themselves. Let's just say if you couldn't do it, don't like to see the PWK, as this show is a profile of 4 dolls that fell out of society's good grace through drug abuse, hedonism and violent crimes only for half. house house. There is plenty of violence, sex and bad language (so it would never come to US Network TV). As if sociopathic dolls were not enough, the fact that this is happening in Canada makes it even more disturbing (btw, the government pays for this), and I think an American television viewer would require more demented cable TV -feed like this. I do not know where to get it in the US, in addition to additional satellite TV, but I would advise you to try it. Really fun stuff. (It flies on Comedy Network in Canada)
