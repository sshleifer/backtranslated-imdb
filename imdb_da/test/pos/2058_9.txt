I enjoyed this movie tremendously. I'm really into movies where females kick lots of ass, so this movie already had my hope of decent entertainment. My hopes were met and exceeded less than 20 minutes in the movie. The action, humor and humor this movie contained easily made it one of my favorite movies all the time. It had Sam Jackson and his undeniable display presence, Geena Davis, whom I have never seen before, demanding your respect and flat-out take it yourself if you do not want to give it. <br /> <br /> Geena plays Samantha Caine, a memory sickness desperate to remember something about her past but quickly realize, the more she finds out more of what she wants to forget and eventually gets consumed until finally Samantha is So more and Charly is all that's left. But now, Charly and Sam, two completely different women, may possibly exist in the same body? We have characters coming in and out of the movie that cares for each side of Sam / Charly, like Sam Jackson and Craig Bierko. Craig is also irresistible as Timothy, the sexy bad guy with no conscience. <br /> <br /> This movie was perfectly cast and perfectly acted over the top and wonderfully entertaining. You see the impossible happen and applaud when it does. So worth your time. Look, you won't be sad.
