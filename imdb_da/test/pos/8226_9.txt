This movie, directed by George Fitzmaurice, who made so many good films, is well suited to his excellent standard. It's crisp, witty, with some amazing lines, and has the infinite Ronald Colman in the romantic leadership. Colman plays the irresistibly charming younger son of a wealthy English educator. He is financially irresponsible (for example, £ 15 of his last £ 20 in the world on a cute little terrier, as he is called George), but open, wildly generous, despicable of lucre, irreverent in the politically possible way and hopelessly sentimental. He is so exciting that all women fall in love with him. His girlfriend is a star in the music hall, and thus in 1930 a demining of demi-monde, played with his typical svelte, narrow narrow silk of the youthful Myrna Loy. Fitzmaurice was not a big user of close-ups, and gals of that day had their faces half hidden with the horrible hanging hats anyway, so we didn't get as good a glimpse of the faces of the two heroines as we would like. Nevertheless, the director seems more interested in the charming Colman. The romantic woman leader is the youthful and fresh face of Loretta Young, who had not yet become proto-Julie Andrews, we know her generally, but was still a red girl radiating a rose garden sweetness and laughing joyfully and cordially all the time. It is obvious that a character with her fantastic humor is needed to appreciate the snobbusting social anarchism of Colman's refreshing aristocratic character. The reason is barely acting, as is so often the case with these light and entertaining films. This is just so much fun.
