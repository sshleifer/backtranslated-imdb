Was in the mood for a French movie and saw this at Blockbuster. What a little gem it turned out to be! Not sure how I missed Gregori Derangere all these years, but he's great. Such innocence and grace! I love his face and the way he moves. Isabelle Adjani was fun - reminded me of Nicole Kidman's over-the-top performance in the Moulin Rouge. She looks the same as 20 years ago ... really remarkable. Gerard Depardieu has not quit almost as well, but his action continues to amaze. He's perfect in this movie. Will probably buy this, I enjoyed it so much. If you want to see another great French movie, rent Joyeux Noel. Breathtaking.
