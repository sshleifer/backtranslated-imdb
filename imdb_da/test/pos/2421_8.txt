One of the trilogies I will not soon forget is to grow up as the child of the karate kid. You can shut down Ralph / Daniel whatever you want, but that's the message behind the movies that are important so it's important to be respectful of all creatures, big and small, but stand up for yourself when time demands. Getting back to the movie at hand, it's pretty funny because I saw Boys Do not Cry and was really impressed with Hillary Swank's performance, and in the flipper through the channels in the second night I came across the show of this movie and I had not realized at the time of my first viewing of this movie that she was in it. The story lies around Julie, like Daniel, without knowing where to look in, or if she herself wants to fit in and the master teacher is brought in to help straighten her out and lead her. I really liked this addition to the series as it gave a good feminine side to the story, and yes, even some outfits that Hillary was holding in, we must say stimulated. <br /> <br /> Overall 3.5 out of 5
