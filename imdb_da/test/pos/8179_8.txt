This movie is not for those who expect a martial arts extravaganza. With regard to historical accuracy, I will leave this question to those who are better informed about this subject. I thought the performance was wonderful. Gong Li never disappoints as the resourceful and (originally) loyal consort of King of Qin. Fengyi Zhang showed a lot of flexibility, which constituted a ruler that fell into madness. He chose the "Hannibal Lector" route, rather than resorting to ranting. For me, the best performance from Zhiwen Wang was the super-slim Marquis. The character came across as very oily, but in a subtle "Sir Humphrey Appleby" - yes minister kind of way. <br /> <br /> The cinema is the standout feature of this movie. The scene where the awnings and his men stormed the castle was breathtaking. There are also a number of fantastic combat scenes. Therefore, this film is highly recommended on the big screen.
