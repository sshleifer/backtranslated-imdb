This movie is too good for words. It is so incredibly big and fun and true in life. You just know by looking at this that the person who wrote this has felt DEFIANTLY the way Jip and his friends do through the movie. It was my life at some point and I would trust coming home to see human traffic ever before I even wanted to go to bed. I think you just get so loved by the characters and their lifestyle. Of course, this movie wouldn't be for old people more about 16 to 22 years, I think. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie and it will get you all the way through. It doesn't have a special story line to it. The general idea is a weekend in older teens life in London and what they get up to. The places they go, the people they meet, the drugs they take, and the experiences they have. You have to get this movie on DVD and you just have to see what you need it !!!
