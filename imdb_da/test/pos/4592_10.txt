This movie is "the stupid comedy of the year and possibly the best thing from Mike Judge since" Office Space. "If you are a Mike Judge fan, or enjoy showing like Futurama, then you make yourself a serious disservice by skipping This little, known, limited release, although the DVD offers very few "bonus features", this movie is definitely fun enough to make up for the perceived "lack of value". <br /> <br /> This movie is acting about a ridge named Joe Bowers (played by Luke Wilson), part of a top secret army experiment designed to preserve army personnel in peacetime so that they can be defeated in wartime to fight for our country. turn, when the manager in charge of the operation is busted in a prostitution ring and the experiment is anything but forgotten, Bowers and his sidekick Rita (played by Maya Rudolph) both find themselves awake in the year 2505, where through the people's natural choices are the people in America has become more and more stupid, now Joe and Rita have to find their way to a time machine to return to 2005 with Frito (played by Dax Shepard). <br /> <br /> What I really enjoyed about this movie was Mike Judge's comedic satire on American history over the last 50 years and how humanity progresses over the next 500 years. This is most evident from the commercial in the film, which has become a staple to the American culture. With shows like South Park in the regular media, it is easy to see how conclusions can be drawn that the future has become a marketing tool in the future. This is depicted in the film humorous with subtle things like "Fudd-Ruckers" that change their name to "Butt-F ### ers" and a promotional table showing the ad "If you don't smoke Tarryltons ... F ## # You! ". Nor can I stop laughing at Carls Jr.'s role in the future with their slogan "F ### you ... I eat" and their automated kiosks even advertise their "Extra Big-A ## Tacos". (with multiple molecules)! This movie contained everything I go to at the cinema. Excellent, sharp, witty comedy, as well as an exciting plot make this DVD an age. Be warned though. If you're not a fan of Mike Judge, don't care about "Beavis and Butthead" or don't have a sense of humor then this movie is probably not a good match for you. Otherwise, I would say that this is probably the funniest movie coming out of 2506 ... I mean 2006.
