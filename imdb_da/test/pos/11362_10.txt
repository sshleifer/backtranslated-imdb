Anyone who enjoyed this series at first broadcast (I hurried home from school to see it) now has a certain age so I can only add my comments to those asking for a DVD release to revive the memories About the first transmission before it becomes a piece of unremembered television archive history. If so many old television series from the sixties and seventies can be released, why not this? Security rights cannot be so difficult. Most Shakespeare lines I can quote come from this iconic series, and I remember swapping them with my school chum when we tried to overcome each other's memories of the text. Peter Dew's rightly deserved the credit for having the foresight to bring it to the screen. This was definitely the public broadcasting at its best. Robert Hardy and Sean Connery are fighting for death - these are exact things and from the beginning of BBC Television's golden age. Come on the BBC. Clear it and license it. March 2009 So finally the DVD is here and congratulations to those who have made it happen. The picture quality is remarkably good and the performances are as good as the memory thought. Now all those who cling to it must buy it and relive the magic moments. <br /> <br /> UK viewers. Considering the series was made in the UK by the BBC by British actors, it is strange that the DVD release is not available there on Region 2 (Europe) DVD and can only be imported from the United States and played on modified players. It seems hardly likely that there are big rights issues, perhaps the market was felt to be too small, so why on earth was it not released 'region for free?' so everyone could enjoy it?
