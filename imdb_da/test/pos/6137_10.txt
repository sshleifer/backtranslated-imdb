I agree with so many of the other reviewers here. This was a fantastic movie and an even better novel by Robert Fish. Unfortunately, I think the author died before he could see this movie made. The performances are all the best rate, with the three principles (John Glover, Ben Cross and Veronica Hamel) apparently made for their roles. The exteriors, both in Europe and Israel, seem very authentic, and the length of the 4-hour miniseries was just right for the story of this story. Fortunately, I have lost this since it was on TV and have enjoyed watching it ever since. I can say inappropriate that it stops today. I gave it a rating of 10. If you haven't read the book, you really need to find a copy. This would be an excellent DVD release movie with extras that could easily include casts interviews.
