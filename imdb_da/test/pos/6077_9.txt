There have been several comments already on the site focusing on the film's "prestige" phenomenon - and there is plenty of heavy talent on the show: from Fiennes and Scott-Thomas to the wonderfully executed design and scoring for the masterful direction. No wonder Andrew Lloyd Webber's acceptance for "Evita" at this year's Oscars began "Well, thank God," the English patient "didn't have any songs in it." Writing Oscar winners takes me to Juliette Binoche, who in a star play gives a beautiful performance. It is encouraging to see that the dynamics that seem to affect the price of best actor (which often goes to a flashy pyrotechnic screen) are not at work in female categories. Just as Emma Thompson's very well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel in "Howard's End" showed that one of the most difficult things an actor can do is make the notion of "goodness" involved so that Binoche's winner showed that Could be it - and seriously sexy. Her performance in this amazing movie is a beauty issue.
