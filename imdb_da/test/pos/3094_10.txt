Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It is Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we get a collection of pictures, words and music that work so wonderfully together. Nor is it a documentary. Some of the people in this movie are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting pictures. Herzog shoots real mirages, and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert that are not actually there, but hundreds of miles are reflected as in a mirror. The use of music in this movie is so brilliant - from Leonard Cohen, Mozart and the third ear band. Imagine Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey in the Desert; That's what this movie is like. This film is so hypnotic that it has the ability to make you feel as though your spirit has left your body. One should see. It will change the way you watch movies. Rating: 10 out of 10.
