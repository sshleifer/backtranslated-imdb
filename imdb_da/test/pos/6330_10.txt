Bergman is a sublime comedy director and author. This fact becomes evident in "A Lesson In Love", where the comic elements range from pure slapstick to deep, but very emotional scenes. This film paves the way for Bergman's later comedies "The Summer Night's Smile" and "Woman's Dream", all with starring Gunnar Bj√∂rnstrand and Eva Dahlbeck. This is an excellent movie where you can start your Bergman experience and depict emotional problems in both young and old. The kinematics of Martin Bodin is amazing, for example in the picnic scene. In short, the film is a perfect example of a successful comedy with clear depth even surpassed some of Bergman's own comedies.
