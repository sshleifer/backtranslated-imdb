Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers is probably the best sequel of all Halloween flicks. Jamie, serial killer Michael Myers nicht, carries a baby who is then taken by the man in black from the end of Halloween 5. A friendly nurse helps Jamie escape, but Myers quickly traces her and kills her. Jamie's baby is found and rescued by Tommy Doyle, one of the children Jamie Lee babysitting in the original movie, and Myers arrives at Haddonfield and begins killing the Strode clan living in his old house. The film concludes with scenes that reveal traces of Michael's evil, the identity of Man In Black, and one close to the entire Dr. The story of Loomis / Michael Myers. I highly recommend this brilliant horror masterpiece. Halloween: The stifle of Michael Myers is rated R for strong graphic violence, extreme gore, short sexuality, language and short nudity.
