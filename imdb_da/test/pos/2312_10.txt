I've lost the number of times I've seen this movie, but I love it and find it very fun every time I see it. Facial expressions, slapstick humor and the timing of the jokes do well. The characters, especially "Nitro", "Sonar" and "Stepanik" are fun. I thought Kelsey Grammar, Rip Torn and Bruce Dern did a good job. In fact, I think this movie was the perfect cast. I think it should be released in DVD before I release my VHS version.
