I found this movie to be quite entertaining and pretty entertaining. Good characters, good actors and enough excitement to keep your interest throughout. The plot twists could have been a bit much, but generally a decent thriller. If you liked this movie, I would recommend The Spanish Prisoner, The House of Games and No Way Out.
