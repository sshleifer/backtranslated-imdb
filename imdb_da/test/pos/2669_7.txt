Frank Sinatra starred in this strange little RKO card, now in the public domain. The movie came out at about the same time, the war ended and is a good plea for religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Sinatra on stage singing. After leaving the scene, he goes out into the alley and finds a group of children who choose on another because of their religion. Instead of shouting at the boys (or helping them with that case), Sinatra lives a good social doctrine on religious tolerance and equals prejudice with fascism. The kids seem to get the lesson, but then out of the blue, Sinatra begins singing a song that honestly (get it?), Kids would have hated. He had a nice voice, but unfortunately I think this detracted from the excellent message he gave to the children about tolerance. It's a case of a good message with too much song - even though the guy is singing Frank Sinatra. It's also an interesting curio - a good historical piece that is often overlooked ... plus it's quite touching, even though it seems a bit schmaltzy.
