This film is sporadically sporadic, and I have never seen it right and thinking that it looks like Bruce Willi's movie "In America", with the usual trite story of American freedom, etc. But it wasn't; it was so much more! <br /> <br /> Of course, Martin Sheen is excellent; (I've never seen him in a movie I haven't loved even though the script is bad because he's so talented). Kathy Bates is the indulgent mother and does a good job. The real surprise is Emilio Estevez, who has not always been in the biggest movies, but also directed this film. You must not stereotype him from the "Breakfast Club" movie; He is so much better at this, and I wish he would make more non-commercial, atypical Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is realistic as we see Emilio home from Vietnam during Thanksgiving. Kimberly Williams is acceptable as the sister who feels she is "disgusted and embarrassed" by the returning soldier, her brother; He is quite alienated from the family, and especially at this time in American history, this story is very relevant. <br /> <br /> I learned a lot about post-traumatic stress and you really want empathy with this character; This is not a violent journalistic depiction, such as. "Plato", it is more a character study that leaves us even more fascinated and worried about the war effects, especially when looking at the young soldiers of the young soldiers. With today's violence, it is rare for a movie to really make you feel sad and scour a tear; It does and deserves recognition.
