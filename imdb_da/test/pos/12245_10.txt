A truly amazing touching film. Woman melodrama at her best, with a lot of comedy: great dialogue, characters and writing. Every woman can relate to the story because it is a classic: you fall in love with "Mr. Right" but he has no interest in you until a guy who works completely wrong comes together and you fall in love with your head . But of course it is not so simplified. The characters are genuine and all performances are perfect. The movie is also fun, every scene spits society. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a well-written play of humor and melodrama. You can relate to each character and the plot moves in unexpected directions. A great, undervalued movie.
