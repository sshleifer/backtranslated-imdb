It's probably a year since I saw Uzak, but it has left strong memories of the two main characters, the shabby photographer Mahmut and his naive cousin from the village of Yusuf. It is a long film with very little dialogue and a rather limited plot. This has apparently annoyed quite a few viewers. But the film builds such a painfully credible portrait of Mahmut and Yusuf that there is as much emotional excitement as in the paciest thriller. Just to be clear, there is no padding in this movie - in the long breaks where nobody speaks as much as in the characters' emotions (and in yours, sees them) that you could carry. Go to watch it awake and wake up and you will be caught rather than stunned. <br /> <br /> Uzak calls true in so many ways, and this sincerity is probably the greatest achievement. People do not deal with events and problems as much as with each other. In fact, throughout the film there is probably not a point where the protagonists (Mahmut, Yusuf and Mahmut's ex-wife Nazan) are not against. <br /> <br /> Much of it is true all over the world: country perhaps Yusuf's deliberately naive expectation that a job on a ship will fall into his lap; Mahmut's urbanized cynicism and unwillingness to sympathize with Yusuf. Other truths are more specific to Turkey: Yusuf's misconception that Mahmut can tolerate his stay with grilled teeth; Yusuf moves between the macho ambition and the broad eye when trying to get to know a woman. <br /> <br /> Uzak is undoubtedly a rather bleak movie, and a Ceylan doesn't force us to head over with themes he is exploring. In any case, I completely believed in the behavior of his character. All the small unsuccessful attempts to connect and petty atrocities call so true. And yet I did not leave with a message that "The world is such", but instead I got "How do we sometimes treat each other."
