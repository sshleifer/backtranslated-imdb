GoldenEye is a masterpiece. The story is incredibly depicted, the characters are beautifully animated and weapons are clueless. The story is so interesting even when you complete each mission to get more levels, you have to turn them into a higher problem. And multiplayer mode is so clear. You choose the weapons you want to play with, then play. Me and my three friends, along with my brother, always play Goldeneye. If you do not have this game, I suggest you buy it.
