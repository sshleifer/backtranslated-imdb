"Beyond Rangoon" is simply amazing. From the traumatic opening to the uplifting end you will be surprised at how well composed this film is. Patricia Arquette unusually portrays Laura Bowman who we meet as a shutdown and finishes despondent young doctor who is unable to handle her grief over the loss of her husband and son. During the film, as she is trapped in Burma, witnessing the democratic uprising and massacres in the capital of Rangoon, floating for her life and saving her tour guide (U Aung Ko) life, she regains her will to live. This can be seen constructed or heavily handed out: it is not. John Boorman, a master of spiritual and emotional conflict, paints the film with broad lines and often uses symbolism to capture Laura's emotional state and physical difficulties. Patricia Arquette, as usual, provides a stunningly compelling and credible performance as the emotionally injured Laura. What makes Arquette incredible, in every role she plays, gives us a window into her character's heart without words. Every time she gets a close-up in the movie, the audience gets insight into her character. She does not have to speak to convey emotions or be over the top. Some critics were hard at Arquette's performance in the film when it was opened on August 25, 1995, considering she was "flat" or "boring" in the role. I found her characterization dead, well away from the melodrama, which is typically part of an actor's performance when having a personal tragedy. She is shocked and reserved for her feelings: it is as normal as screaming lashing out on those around you. I hope Warner Brothers will release this title on DVD very soon. With Arquette's hugely successful NBC drama "Medium" bringing her to household status, not to mention an Emmy winner and now 2007 nomination, it would be in the interest of the study to do so. Hopefully there will be extras, with the alternative end. Don't pass this movie. It is one that you will certainly not forget after seeing.
