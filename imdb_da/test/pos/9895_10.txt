A wonderful story that should be seen by all families. The story, the play and the production values ​​are all first rate. I highly recommend "Checking Out!" Peter Falk is marvelous as an aging actor who will decide when he will die so he can continue to know how things will end and not be a "member of the audience." His three children rush to New York to confront him and try to change. There are, of course, unresolved family issues that need to be addressed, and the script and actors handle them well and with great humor. <br /> <br /> The story is about a Jewish family, but it can easily be about any other family. Well, maybe not a WASP family. Siblings have problems with each other and also with their father. I loved writing and instruction as well as the actor. All in all, a humorous and touching film.
