This documentary focuses on the events in Gothenburg in 2001. On Swedish media, the demonstrators demonstrated the image as criminals who were responsible for anarchy and violence. This film shows that it is not, in fact, they are intelligent, formulate people who have something to say - and say it by the power of bricks. They believe in a better world, a world where people can think and say what they want - without being targeted. But is their conviction of having the opportunity to change society realistically? I do not think. <br /> <br /> This documentary tells us about the problems of greed, capitalism, and the future. It is a great documentary that is not propaganda because it does not appear as what they say is right. All it shows is what some people believe and it is up to the viewer to decide whether what they do and stand for is right or wrong. <br /> <br /> I have heard many people who feel this propaganda and therefore choose not to see it, I think they make a bad decision because even if you sympathize with the police or the protesters' beliefs, everything is What you get, more facts to trust, for example, was the child who got the shot that he thinks it is good to throw a brick through a McDonald's window because it is the step between thinking and acting as you think. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie struck me out because you can't really dismiss the fact that the few police officers who were fighting violence with violence were not convicted or even detained in custody even though the evidence that they threw bricks at the demonstration march (and in some cases, people truncheon, even if they lie on the street without resisting), where as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10 - Very good but not the best!
