I have to say that I didn't expect much to sit down to see "Pitch Black", but I got a lot back in excitement and pure fun. It's the kind of flick where you can just sit back, relax and have fun being entertained. This is not a deep movie in any way. All that is offered is either reused or ripped off by other films such as "Alien", "Predator" or such. But when I see a rip-off, I want it and this rip-off is great. <br /> <br /> It opens with a galaxy of stars. Some of the greatest films of all time open with this type of scene - "2001", "Star Wars", "Alien", "Predator". A ship crosses through the room when awakened throughout the cryogenic frozen crew. The ship has been hit by something. They control the earth on a creepy little planet with three suns. All flock out of the ship when they find out that their capture transport, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), has escaped confinement. They scan the desert planet in search of him and eventually find him, but they have no way to get their ship to fly again. They search the planet for water and civilization, but it seems that everyone suddenly disappeared from the planet long ago. <br /> <br /> Then they find out that every 22 years the planets reach out to a solar eclipse and the whole planet becomes white. There are also coincidences with foreigners who thrive in the dark who live on the planet - what are the chances? They happen to be on the planet just as the eclipse happens - what are the chances? And Riddick has a rare talent - he can see in the dark - again, what are the chances? <br /> <br /> There seems to be a lot of coincedence in this movie, but a movie like this isn't out to get Oscars for originality or credibility. It's there to entertain the audience - it does it with ease. Vin Diesel is a great gorilla of a man without any talent. But I have to say if anyone can fit the part of a trashy, homicidal felon, that's Diesel. Listen to him murmuring: "He didn't know who he was with." Great things. Foreigners in this movie are a mix between hammerhead sharks, those from "Alien" and Predators. They have long, horizontal heads like a hammerhead, the agility of the alien movement, and a predator. I suppose David Twohy (the director and author of the movie) had not expected the audience to believe that his creatures were really something that had never been seen before. At least I hope not. <br /> <br /> "Aliens Redux" can be a better name for this movie, but again it is better than both the second and third "Alien" movies put together. At a time when it apparently ended, series were revived - "Terminator 3", "Alien 5", "Predator 3," "Alien vs Predator" - "Pitch Black" stands out as a new series entirely. Two plans are planned. Let's just hope they won't be carried away. I can only see the twenty-five years from now: "Aliens vs Predator vs Pitch Black Aliens: * This year's game." <br /> <br /> * This year's game title can be shared with upcoming movies "Freddy vs Jason vs Michael vs Leatherface vs Norman Bates vs Alien vs Predator vs Terminator vs James Cameron vs Barny the Dinosaur." <br /> <br /> 4/5.
