An unusual, revisionist western, worth seeing. Despite a slow start, the film builds ?? with hardly any dialogue and no subtitles ?? an increasingly involved and intensely almost existential portrait of life in the harsh environment of the western desert. Growth of the protagonists is worth waiting for, and the strong central throw gives a true sense of desperation to the struggle for ownership of the all-important horse. How interesting this was made by a British director. I hope he smiles now: I get the impression that the film was largely ignored by contemporaries; But time is working its usual alchemy, and hidden gold shines as it must inevitably. A note came to me: revisionism is only carried on so far. Sam Waterston as Indian? - Given he plays his role with true emotion and intensity, but really could an American Indian actor not be found doing the job? But his scenes with Caroline Langrishe have an intimacy that contrasts nicely with the vast landscape around them. Forget big, bankrupt Hollywood versions of the past, men with big heads and swirling music; It is about a primary struggle between protagonists who, removed by all the prisoners of the 'ordinary' life, come to understand what is worth fighting for. Impressive.
