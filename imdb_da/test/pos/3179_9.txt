This was a great show ... I can't remember much about it, but remember to watch it and love it. I can remember the mother and the father. I like grandmother. She was like a grandmother you really couldn't understand before you grew up. She was very knowledgeable and no nonsense. My favorite song on the show was sardines in the morning. (It can't be the title) I remember having seen it and heard the song that I went to Cleveland Ohio to visit my cousins, and I and my sister sang so much song that when we left all my little cousins ​​were sing it too. I would also love to find this on DVD.
