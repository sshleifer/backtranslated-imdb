The stuff has to be one of the amazing movies. Of course, it was groundbreaking special effects at the time it was released, which impressed me so much, back in 1982 I just blew I had never seen anything like that! But even though the effects themselves made the movie more horrible, it was the story itself, the music score, the claustrophobic atmosphere in the Anarctic, as well as the interaction and excitement between the members of the doomed research station that make it a classic. <br /> <br /> Movies don't get any better than this! In the opening scene with chopper chasing this husky you just assume it was some bored scientists from some station hiring some steam. But when you see them continue their chase on the American base, you think the Norwegians are suffering from some sort of advanced or extreme load of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the threatening opening music score that sets the pace! You just know that something is not right! At this point, it is a mystery until "things" reveal themselves. <br /> <br /> But the mystery returns because it becomes a kind of Agatha Christie "as dunnit" (ie, ten small Native American movies) sci-fi style, as members do not know which of their teams really is an alien. Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by one, they are eventually knocked off or revealed as strangers. Mistrust between the station's crew is absorbed when the film progresses to the final showdown. After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and filmmaking, the special effects of "Thing" do not carry the same weight as it did in 1982, but except that it holds very well with some good performances of the cast.
