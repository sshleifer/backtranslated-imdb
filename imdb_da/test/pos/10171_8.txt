Alfred Hitchcock's more secure story of a movie he made twenty-one years earlier is infinitely superior to the original. Hitchcock himself said that his first version was an amateur's work, and although it certainly isn't a bad movie, he seems to be right. That said, this remake, though definitely better, is still not among Hitchcock's best work. It is certainly not to say that it is not good, it is just over a little overindulgent and it pulls it down. Hitchcock seems too eager to pull out certain elements, and it is parts of the movie that are not entirely relevant to the plot, which can be annoying. Some of these dragged sequences, like the one that sees James Stewart and Doris Day eating at a Moroccan restaurant, are good because it helps establish the diverse culture our American protagonists have found themselves in, but for each restaurant scene is there is an opera sequence, and the latter makes the film worse. The plot follows a middle-aged doctor and his wife who goes to Morocco for a holiday with their young son. While meeting a French man on the bus and another middle-aged couple in a restaurant. But things go wrong when the French man dies from a knife in the back, soon after something whispers to the doctor. The holiday then becomes a full blown nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped, causing them to cut it short and go to London to try to find him. The film has a very powerful paranoia about it, and it manages to keep it all the way through. In fact, I would even go so far as to say that this is the most paranoid movie that Hitchcock has ever made. Like most of Hitchcock's movies, this is very exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration, with only the aforementioned opera sequence standing out as a moment when the voltage is diffused. There is also more than a little humor in the film, which gives a moody relief to the morbid puzzles, and actually works quite well. <br /> <br /> The original version of this story was lent excellent support by the amazing Peter Lorre. This movie does not benefit his presence, unfortunately, but it is made up of performances by the amazing James Stewart and Doris Day. James Stewart is a man who will always be a champion of the "greatest actor of all time" crown. His collaborations with Hitchcock all have fascinating ideas from him and this one is no different. (Although his best performance remains one in Mr Smith Goes to Washington). Stewart generates all the courage, beliefs, and heartache of a man who has lost his child and would do anything to get him back brilliant. In fact, this is one of the best things about this movie; You are truly able to feel the couple's loss all the time, and it serves to make it more exciting. Doris Day, by contrast, is a rather strange casting choice for this movie. She's definitely a good actress, but she's more connected with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is pretty strange (though she doesn't bend her vocal chords a bit). As I have mentioned; this is not Hitchcock's best movie, but there is a lot to enjoy about it and although I would recommend many Hitchcock movies before recommending this, I will certainly give it two thumbs up.
