* Could contain spoilers, read only after watching last episode season 2 * Think about it. The boys at the North Pole? Earth center? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: "Did we miss it again?" Then there was another abnormality? It was of course when the plain fell down! I think the whole island is a setup. Set by his father. She found out and was looking for her Desmond. Where else can she know what to look for. <br /> <br /> So basically it's an island in a magnetic shield. Everything is false. All the characters are there. False beard, false doors, false medicine, false observation stations, with false air shafts that lead to nothing. It's actually a project, and because of the last scene in the season 2 final, I know it's going to do something with Desmond, his chick and her father (and probably Libby, she's strange, maybe she has something to do with Also, in this episode, Henry Gail tells Michael to go to some coordinates and he will find their rescue. This is probably a kind of door in magnetic shield. "When you're gone, there's no way back." <br /> <br /> I think it's pretty obvious, despite the many questions I still have, and hope to get answers next season. If you think back to what we learned in Season 1 and 2, I'm sure we'll get plenty of answers in season 3. <br /> <br /> Can't wait. <br /> <br /> Can anyone agree on this theory? Hope to hear from you...
