As much as I like Walter Matthau, I felt that most of his roles were tailored to his personality. This role is one of the exceptions. He plays a dentist who is both charming and dishonest. This role requires much more action than in most of his other roles. I liked that the film was honest about how a professional can be dishonest to avoid engaging in a relationship. His whole goal was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman, but not to be committed in any way. Alibi - using his secretary (Ingrid Bergman) to pretend to be his wife. At some point in the film, they are as if it is about Mr. And wife actually gets deceived into believing that they were actually really married. The end was good because a middle-aged man found out to pursue a person in his own age group was worth more. The movie was fun, entertaining and didn't sell by being a preacher.
