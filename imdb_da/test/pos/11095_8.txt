This movie is based on the true story of Christopher Boyce and his friend Daunton Lee. This fascinating story takes place around the Whitlam rejection, where in his time as clerk of TRW, he held classified correspondence, which allowed the CIA's engagement in Australian political and professional circles. The movie shows several scenes involving Gough Whitlam (broadcast over US TV), where events take place confirming the classified documents that Christopher had previously read. The removal of Gough Whitlam was an organized CIA coup. Second in the film, it was mentioned that most people have no idea of ​​the amount of deception that is going on, ultimately to ensure that the United States is used as a means of promoting certain policies on behalf of everyone else. In the present age, nothing has changed. Christopher's life was deeply influenced and read shocked by his knowledge of what and how the CIA forms foreign democracies, including the Allies nation's democracies to the United States. Christopher responded, probably not in the best way at that time, by selling top secret information to the Soviet Union with Daunton Lee, who served as his exchange. Finally, Christopher and Daunton were captured and convicted of treason. On May 23, 1982, Christopher Boyce made a one-and-a-half interview with Ray Martin for 60 minutes in Australia, because it was the Australian connection that hit him deeply. It caused a furore in the Australian media for about a week, so it was pushed. <br /> <br /> I liked the film's symbolism on the falcon, and in it Chris was called Falcon and Daunton the Snowman (drug compound), but in fact the title "Falcon" was not something used by Chris. <br /> <br /> Christopher Boyce: Criminal or Conscientious?
