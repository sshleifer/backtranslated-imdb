The children's actor certainly deserves a lot of credit. It was a rather weak field for best picture that year. I think "Apocalypse Now" should have taken it, but the Academy probably had it too violent and strange, plus Vietnam was still recently. Meryl Streep was huge as always, playing a very unlikeable character. I don't usually compliment the executives, but I really liked it with the elevator doors. Degree: B
