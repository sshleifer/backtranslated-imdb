Although it has been a failure in cinemas, because mostly Mylene Farmer, one of the 3 best stars in France was not the first role. Fans had changed after that and waited for it on DVD. Once released on DVD this year, it has a huge success! The other fails were the slow pace and the incredible length (3 hours) at the time (1994) that has annoyed critics. But the melancholy history makes it mandatory, that slow pace and long time. The film's morality is that you cannot escape from the death you are destined to. It is the same theme as in the movie "Final Destination" and makes it a gothic tale. The atmosphere is very melancholy.
