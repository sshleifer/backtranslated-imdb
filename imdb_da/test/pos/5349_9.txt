My only problem with the curse of the war rabbit is that the film doesn't take the time to properly introduce Wallace and Gromit to those who aren't familiar with Park's short film. Strangely, "A close shave" manages to do this with much less time to save. Still, I loved watching the boys back in action and loved all the new characters, man and others. I especially loved Ralph Fienne's voice as Scheming Victor Quartermaine. It is also interesting to see the series on the big screen. The performance with the clay characters really stands out. It's a hoot, and great for the whole family! I buy very few DVDs, but I each have Wallace and Gromit and would like to add this.
