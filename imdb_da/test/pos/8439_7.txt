This is a pretty good thriller at a nuclear power plant in Southern California, run by James Bridges and stars Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas. Fonda plays a television rep that wants to be an investigative journalist, but may only be a television reporter. Douglas is an independent cameraman and Lemmon is a nuclear power plant supervisor. Fonda and Douglas are sent on a routine job at a nuclear power plant, and an accident almost occurs and they get it all on film. Everyone tries to cover it with the exception of Fonda and Douglas, so Douglas steals the movie. Lemmon is starting to investigate and find out that the company cares more about profits, as security at the factory. It is a good movie with a really good ending.
