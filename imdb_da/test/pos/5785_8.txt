A really scary movie. Event over curmudgeon James Kunstler's rants led me to newly formed weblogs such as Life After the Oil Crash (LATOC), Energy Bulletin and The Oil Drum and the data behind the theory of Hubbert's Peak. Like this movie, LATOC and Kunstler paint a muddy picture of die-off or die-back. I hope they are too early, but in mid-2005, petrol prices, rising oil prices, Chevron's Will You Join Us campaign, BP will be Beyond Petroleum and even T Boone Pickens will increase credibility to the idea that we are at or near Oil Production. After ample investigation of limited data, oil investment banker Matt Simmons has suggested that the Saudis can no longer increase production in their vast but aging fields. In view of increased demand (primarily from the US and China), the Saudis have not reacted with higher production despite previous assurances. The stated world production from 2000 and 2004 indicates that light, sweet crude has actually reached the peak. which means refining becomes more expensive. The film is aimed at baby boomers, but younger people, our children, must also understand the consequences of an energy-depleted future.
