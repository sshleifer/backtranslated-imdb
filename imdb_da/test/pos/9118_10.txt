I watched The D's new movie tonight on a special pre-screening, and I was then blown away with its great grandeur that I felt I had to get on IMDb and get the word out. Admittedly, I was already a big fan of D's work - I loved the HBO series and listening to their music every week (there's nothing better to sing with), but this appreciation actually made me more concerned about tonight's screening (for We've all been disappointed sometime by something we love when it tried to make the jump to the big screen. This is not the case with Tenacious D's "The Pick of Destiny". <br /> <br /> It's simply said that this movie is harder than anything I've seen, and is more fun and majestic than anything Peter Jackson, Pixar, and Will Ferrell could produce together. It tells the story of D before we came to know them, set up exciting stories about Cake and Jable's upbringing, their arrivals together, and how they were inspired to write songs about things like Lee, Sasquatch and Dio. Most importantly, they reveal the true inspiration for the greatest song in the world, "Tribute" and how it came out (which is different from the HBO series). Once you've seen it, you probably won't be able to remember it (thus Tribute), but your mind will forever be changed by its genius. I don't go to movies very often anymore because of the high fare and the hassle of getting parking, paying outrageous concession rates, etc. but I usually make exceptions when it is the main role of someone I really love or about something of the same kind. "The Pick of Destiny" was so good that I have no trouble coming back to see it again when it is published nationwide, and I plan to convince all my friends to go too. Last week we saw "Borat" and loved it, but it is honest for the goodness TEN TIMES BETTER. For anyone who really loves rock music and comic brilliance, you can watch this movie. These guys talent is so great that you don't hesitate to support their cause. You will not be disappointed and Rock Lords will smile you positively.
