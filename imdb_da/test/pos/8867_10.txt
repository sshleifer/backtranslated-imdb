Throw Momma is not dated at all, it is just as fun as it was released. A really eccentric comedy that doesn't try to be too hard to suffer and is better for it, full of memorable laughs aloud. Even small characters are well-written and beautifully played as Billy Crystal's best friend's boyfriend and a lovely cameo from Rob Reiner as Krystal's agent. A little crazy and a lot of fun.
