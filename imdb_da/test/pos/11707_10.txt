FOR IT: If not for Mick Molloy's work, then for Judith Lucy. She brings her usual stylish style with creepy foul-mouthery to the role and steals the show in parts. <br /> <br /> IMHO: I'm not much of an autograph hunter, but I've gathered 3. The first is Samuel L. Jackson, the other two are in this movie: Tony Martin and Mick Molloy. Altho Martin only performs a cameo appearance, Molloy not only stars, but co-wrote and co-produced this flick. I've been a fan of their for years (apparently I was the only one who laughed at the required urination in the first episode of the short-lived The Mick Molloy Show), so I went into this with high expectations. I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed. With Mick doing a lot of work on this thing, there are plenty of his usual brands. Phrases like "blowing it out of your ass" and "these bowls are s *** house" are everywhere as well as lots of Winnie Blues being sucked down. It is also the kind of stupid, original story you would expect from someone like him. This is like one of the cliqued, American, sports comedies where they make a baseball team out of prisoners or something. But instead of trying to make a boring American sport like baseball or gridiron interesting, this movie focuses on a sport that usually returns to the gray army: Lawn Bowls. But the biggest difference between this and other sporting types of comedies is that this is actually very, very fun. What is even better is that, although the subject of this film is a young lout that enters an ancient gambling game, it is never insulting to the elderly, and it never becomes morbidly soppy or something. It's just good laughs at real 1972 prices. Mick is great in the first real acting role I have ever seen him in, such as Judith Lucy and the rest of the cast, but then most of them have had a lot of exercises ... This is the best Australian comedy I 'I have seen for a long time. Go and see it and learn the joy of Lawn Bowls! It's a bit like: Major League? SCORE: 8/10
