His music, especially what we hear about here, is very slow. From around the time of Bach's death, composers had worked on ways to make music progress at a slower and slower pace: over a century later, Wagner and then Mahler wrote pieces that are as slow as possible for music to get. - Of course you can cheat by writing a 4/4 march and then enter a tempo of say semiquaver = 1, but that tempo would not be the right pace. Wagner and Mahler wrote music that is actually played at the snail's pace. As slowness in no way sounds too slow, the "snail's pace" is the wrong expression. A critic wrote about a famous Wagner conductor, "he doesn't beat time, he beats eternity." For all I know, this was termed a compliment. I get the feeling that around the early 1970s, the directors directed how to make the slowest movies: There is "Death in Venice" and there is "Solyaris". I prefer the first one first. For one thing, "Solyaris" goes over the line, or a line, and becomes soporific; "Death in Venice" is moving from the beginning to the end. Not much happens, but it all happens in the right order, at the right pace, with photography you can lose in <br /> <br /> Another way to cheat music is to write something that Don't do I really have a pace at all. Such music sounds slow, but is really just unmusical, just as many movies feel slow because they lack rhythm and form. "Death in Venice" is not one of them. Beautiful in every respect it will remind you of timelessness and quality of context. You need no theoretical knowledge to respond to Visconti's mastery that you do to respond to a minor director's incompetence. It's a good job.
