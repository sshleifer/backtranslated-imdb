As a former admirer of the 2001 film "Moulin Rouge" and a recent admirer of Jean Renoir's film production, I knew that I would inevitably see his "French Cancan" sooner or later. The film tells a fictitious story about the opening of the Moulin Rouge nightclub. Impresario Danglard (Jean Gabin) tries to transform the Montmartre laundress Nini (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) into a cancant star without awakening the wrath of his stormy lover, the belly dancing Lola (Maria Felix). This is just one of several love triangles in "French Cancan" - true to stereotype. These French showbiz people are always in love. <br /> <br /> Renoir, with its typical gentle humor and attention to supporting characters, also wrote the lyrics of a beautiful ballot box highlighted in the film. Gabin perfectly incorporates the aging French playboy hero. Arnoul is a cute redhead who keeps his own in the dance numbers, except for a few trick shots, where a double is obviously used. "French Cancan" is billed as a musical comedy, and while there are many music tracks taking place at the nightclub, etc. only one character, Casimir, always breaks into song in the middle of conversation. The actor who plays him, Philippe Clay, is fun to watch - a really tall, shiny young man singing, dancing and disturbing. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with a long cancan sequence, which all characters learn to overcome their problems and create art together. The dance is much brighter and coherent edited than in the "Moulin Rouge"; In fact, if I have a complaint about "French Cancan," it's all a bit for Technicolor. Even when Nini experiences heartache or someone sings a melancholy song, the lighting is light and flat, no shadows penetrate. Yes, the result is a cheerful and warm-hearted musical comedy; It's just that I can't help thinking that things were never this colorful and innocent in real life.
