Entertaining movies that give you romance, woman-on-the-guard psychodrama, workplace sexual harassment, adultery and fashion. That's all there. Typical characters are found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long-term employee bitch executive who feels the need to be so because she is with the big boys. Hope Lange is the ambitious employee who is determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal life is the subplot. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe for the movie is great, but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairdresser that "a little bit will do you!" The amount of Brylcream in Stephen Boyd's hair is often distracting. His character compared to Lange's character was never fully developed, which I found disappointing. Overall, the movie is fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
