I haven't read the Anne Rice novel that this movie was based on, but who knows, maybe reading the book cheaper than hiring QUEEN OF THE DAMNED and is probably better for your health. It's not that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and surely exercise the active part of your brain more than this movie. You can count the number of pages of Anne Rice that I have read on one side, but after watching this movie and Interview with a vampire, I get the feeling that she writes really good novels. The drawings for both movie tips on a whole sea of ​​deep and interwoven vampire stories. Still, Stuart Town's voice-over story gets a heck of much more annoying than Brad Pitts vampire story ever, and you can tell that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED's limited production resources hardly provide enough meat for the Anne Rice story. While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance, QUEEN builds on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously. One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie, and that the production team focused its attention on the wrong places. Costumes and the rock & roll scene could have been replaced by more blood and a scary soundtrack. But I give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Grains and Disturbed had me down with the disease, which bobbed me just like Butthead. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a very cool Goth-rock zoom and splice assembly, but after the first ten minutes or so, the wire directs degenerate quickly. It's as if the film was so long that the director realized that there was not enough time and money to make an Anne Rice novel justice. Which results are some mediocre vampire scenes and lots of cheesy special effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do the genre justice, just as its John Carpenter colleagues fail to impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where is the light blue makeup? Scene after scene I shook my head and reminisced about Salem's Lot and Fright Night when low budget was done right. <br /> <br /> There are redeeming qualities but it saves this movie from being garbage. Props to Aaliyah, and can rest her soul forever in peace. She may have become a famous actress if her life had not been taken away from us so early, for she gave this movie a decent performance with lots of lovely belly dancing. Did I say the soundtrack was good? Let's see what more can I say? It wasn't too long. The Anne Rice short story could easily have been a three-hour movie if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got his hands on it. There are a couple of terms here and there in the plot. But all in all, it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the many other vampire films out there. The director of this movie continued to lead a new Battlestar Galactica mini-series if it tells you anything. <br /> <br /> Jimboduck-dot-com
