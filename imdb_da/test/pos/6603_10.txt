My son, an avid skateboarder, sat me down and made me see this with him. Since I love documentaries, it didn't take much of his side. The whole amazing story of it all - a bunch of dirt-poor children flocked together and ended up creating something revolutionary out of thin air - well out of any wood, wheels and missing waves to surf - it just floored me. It still does. I didn't think I'd enjoy it as I did, nor did I think I would tear up seeing Stacey Peralta tear up Jay Adam's fate. And just look at Jay Adams himself ... the sharp genius of the child who rolls skating and the shoulder of the adult who remembers. I saw it again last night for what should be the tenth time, and I still get goose bumps that see him fly down the hill with Jimi Hendrix's "Freedom" in the background. And I tore up again. Not too many movies have the same effect with me after several views. Brilliant.
