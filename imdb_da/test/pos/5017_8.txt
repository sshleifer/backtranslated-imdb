What about certain films that generate such polar reactions? <br /> <br /> Some people here have called High Roller "disgusting." Some have called it "extraordinary" (as I really do). Why Why? I think it's because movies like this don't make heroes out of jerks or glamor out of degeneration, and some people just can't handle it emotionally. They need a hero. And I would also add that if they are players or poker players, they may feel personally betrayed when their existence is not justified. High Roller in NOT a poker movie. It's a folk movie. It's not perfect, but it looks good, well written and wonderfully acted. And best of all, it creates an emotional response and inspires reflection. <br /> <br /> And maybe that's what makes some people so damn crazy.
