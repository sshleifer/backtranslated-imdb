I watched this movie on a screener and it's the best movie I've seen in a loooong time. I loved it !!!! James Franco is sooo hot and he and Sienna Miller make the perfect couple. I do not want to give away what is happening, but they play a couple of newlyweds going on their honeymoon to Niagara Falls, and some beautiful game is happening along the way .... The movie is really really fun and sad and original. I can't even say what it reminded me of but watch it! I cried so hard but really loved it and will see it again as soon as it comes out! My friends also cried. I hope it will come out soon - does anyone know when? I really wanted to see it if I were you
