Billy Crystal is Larry, a writer who has not written and suspected of killing in "Throw Momma from the Train", costarring Danny Devito and Anne Ramsey. The term "black comedy" was invented for this insanity, which is a start to Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train". In fact, Owen (Devito) gets the idea of ​​having Larry kill his mother in exchange for Owen killing Larry's ex from watching the famous movie. "I saw the movie. Criss-cross," says Owen Larry. Not that Larry knows what he's talking about until it looks like it's too late - like "Strangers". Larry, a scribe, claims that his former wife, played by Kate Mulgrew, stole his book and names her. She has become a great celebrity appearing on "Oprah", where she refers to Larry as "an animal". Owen is in Larry's class. He lives with a battered Neanderthal mother (Ramsey) and has visions of poisoning her and sticking a scissors to her head - it's called. It's not long after seeing "Strangers on a Train" that he is in Honolulu, stalking Larry's wife. As she leans over a boat rail, trying to get an earring, Owen stands behind her and crawls up ... Soon the police are looking for Larry to ask him questions, but he is with Owen, where he is called to live up to his end of a bargain he had no idea he was doing. You know, "criss-cross." There are several scenes copied from "Strangers" which are fun. I especially loved Larry's confession to the sleeping Lady Lift, Owen's mother, who looks like Guy thinks he's talking to Bruno's founder. <br /> <br /> Crystal and DeVito are complete masters of comic dialogue and timing and will let you laugh, often loud. Ramsey is abominable fun - a completely "out there" performance. Kim Griest and Rob Reiner also have roles - Griest is Crystal's girlfriend, and Reiner has what corresponds to a cameo. The end is very smart and the whole movie will let you laugh.
