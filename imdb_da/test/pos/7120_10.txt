There are few films that deal with things that I would consider myself an expert on. This successor. After some years of fantasy role play, we split up without leaving me without feeling what I had become: a dork. <br /> <br /> You see, these things are really canonical, it happens to everyone. First, you create a character fairly, and it dies after the first attack. <br /> <br /> So, do you help with the Constitution, and while you know, why not help with strength, intelligence, intuition, charisma and dexterity as well? This again frustrates the game manager, who does not know how to handle this insurmountable gang. And after a while it also drills the players so they start creating increasingly exotic race-profession combinations, no matter how ridiculous it is. <br /> <br /> I created a Druedain warrior monk, yes, not so far from the movie. <br /> <br /> And that's not all about the destruction of the intrinsic dynamics of this devilish game (think the pursuit of adventure points), but just watch the movie, it shows it all - and of course the stupidity of its most basic prerequisites. <br /> <br /> To this end, there is no better occupation than the table. I do not understand exactly why bard became a character in the first place, the blacksmith is none. But when it became one, it had to be mapped in the game flow, that is: it had to be done mortally, at least indirectly. The fun of this never comes to an end and rightly so. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not exactly a professional production, but I haven't seen a better satire in times.
