What can I say this movie is amazing. It has its faults that any movie, for example, wobbly gravestone in a cemetery, a clearly visible sliding table during the death of the penguins, and Max Shreck loses his heavy coat in a split second between shots during the image consulting scene, Batman loses his black eye makeup suddenly between shots so he can reveal Bruce Wayne to Catwoman, the dialogue is being recorded but played and spoken differently than when it was spoken in the first place and finally Catwoman knows immediately how to use a bullshit without any training whatsoever. These bugs are small compared to some you would see in for example Batman forever where riddles can of course be seen, waiting for his cue or choice Kilmer hair to switch between shots. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so deserves an 8/10 is the great play because the performances are absolutely amazing. Michael Keaton represents his role as Batman and has much more to do in this movie. He looks more comfortable in the role the second time and is on par with the villains' performance. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I really like the conversion of the penguin to the grotesque penguin man instead of the non-threatening sign of the comics or TV show, because now the character has more depth and has a much more interesting story that generates from the basics need for family and to feel accepted and wanted. This gives us an evil character that we feel sympathetic to because he was rejected for being what he is, who is not his fault. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman. She is blurry and sexy, and she is also a villain we can be sorry for because of the way she is sacrificed. Christopher Walken is a great secondary villain and is so interesting a character, even though he is not even in the batman universe. The soundtrack is far better than first and Danny Elfman gets more chance of showing off his musical talents this time. The sets are amazing. They are detailed, eye-catching, eerie, gothic, unique, dark and so many other adjectives can describe how amazing they look. Costumes and makeup are great and of course, much work was done to make them and all the work pays off because Batsuit is better, the cat's suit is great to look at and the penguin and the effects are so convincing. The animatronic penguins look really realistic and play to good effect. Scripture is really good and Storyline, in my opinion, is a plausible one. Overall, because of all these factors, this movie deserves an 8/10 and is my favorite of all batman movies
