This is one of those movies when you see what you wonder if it is documentary or fiction. After the film Ramin Bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the film has a script. Bahrani camera is silent; he is not judgmental; he almost erases the director from the movie for the purpose; the background is not organized to make the picture beautiful but does not make me wrong; there is much preparation for this movie. Starting at personal level, being the part of the environment to be ignored when filming. The protagonist is a "real" actor in every sense. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank all the crews for this movie and show us another country in NYC. I strongly suggest it if you like stories from others. <br /> <br /> Bora Kizilirmak
