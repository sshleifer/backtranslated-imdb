This film was groundbreaking in the former Soviet Union because it was the first film to be released that featured a genuine sex scene. However, the film can be considered great for many reasons, not least where it is the true gritty depiction of disillusionment and pain in the family of a Soviet family of the working class. I would definitely recommend it.
