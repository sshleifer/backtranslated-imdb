(This review includes a great spoiler, but I don't know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away) I saw "pinoccio's Revenge" a while ago. <br /> <br /> Now you think it's just a rip-off of children's play. In fact, there are similarities. <br /> <br /> But Chucky was an obsessed doll working independently of the child. It is possible that Pinoccio is obsessed with a demon or cursed or something. But the puppet itself is actually completely lifeless. KID is crazy and KID is the only killing people! Everyone, including the audience, the survivors and the Kid himself believe that it is the doll. But it's KID. The necessity is almost a shame, otherwise I could tell everyone to see it, because it is really an interesting horror movie.
