'Identity?? . . . . I am part of my environment and I was separated from them and it is able to make these differentiations clear that we get an identity and what is inside our identity is all that ever happened to us "(Ntozake Shange qtd in" Fire in the Mirror "). <br /> <br /> Pieces like Decalogue V used to scare me, I felt if I accepted them than I would compromise on anything. I thought before, is really not worth getting into. I understand what naturalism is trying to say. I experienced a tangible catharsis, and one who was present in pieces and one still living that I still have to count on. still working inside me. <br /> <br /> The film was not sympathetic in itself, it does not have to say that the death penalty is an evil thing, there are certainly evil people, whether they die or not, to another movie What decalogue shows is that there are good, beautiful people who kill other people when their samfu nd and primary encourage them to look them up. <br /> <br /> Naturism 'science' is what helped me to appreciate Decalogue V. It's not worth the writing room why I wouldn't leave myself before, but now I see the value by making art such as 'making' people, or perhaps to get people to do something. <br /> <br /> There is a method for Lazar's compromise of his. . . light. Much of that importance only makes sense in thought. This should not be too strange of an idea: however much of respectable science does not get in retrospect. I get lost when I say it, but Naturalism seems so much more productive and so much less nihilistic when I have the power to say to myself: 'This ruin, this process, this natural process, makes me bow the system. ' <br /> <br /> I don't think naturalism paint a doomsday portrait of humanity and tell us to give up our powdery wigs and go to the woods. Instead, I believe that it is cataloging evidence and experiments that we can of course freely ignore. We can ignore everything we want if we want to give the naturalists more bodies to bury. <br /> <br /> In spite of their aesthetics, they are especially designed without sympathy for their characters' likely and disastrous fate of passionate passive action and authoritative snobbies. I see the lovely risk in the hope that the audience will understand what to do with what they see. As mentioned, there is danger in the hopeless as their fate is immortalized in stone. There is danger in the hopeful deterioration of the natural because it does not match their world view. <br /> <br /> And I don't think the "hopeful" should be either wealthy or lucky. I have not seen it, but it seems that the film American Beauty shows that circumstances are insufficient as a provider of vision or comfort. There are ascetics as well as gluttons as well as beggars who are wondering where in themselves their humanity is, making sure they cannot find anything that separates them from their landscape. <br /> <br /> Landscapes can be powerful and beautifully portrayed, but in reality landscapes do not create. They change safely and dramatically, but only by a large set of laws of nature that no one really possesses. But it cannot be changed by itself.
