I didn't expect much from this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it and found it most remarkable. That's remarkable due mainly to the talent and appeal of it's star John Garfield. <br /> <br /> Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star framed for murder. He has to get started, and ends in sticks with Gloria Dickson and Dead End Kids. Here is a chance of redemption, but will the past catch up with him? Garfield was an actor in front of his peers. Before the term 'Method' even the coin and before Brando ever screamed 'Stella!' he brings 'natural' to the screen. His earthly quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production. Also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of the 'Golden Boy' role he so desperately wanted to desire on the screen. Garfield sees the type and goes the distance as a boxer proving its worth. <br /> <br /> Ann Sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as Jack's trampy girl Goldie. I've never thought much about Sheridan, but I liked her here. She plays well off Garfield. Dickson's performance is a bit tired and she doesn't share good chemistry with Garfield. The Dead End Kids are here, and Garfield thinks their natural idol (even more so than Cagney). Claude Rains is overlooked and he looks uncomfortable in many stages. Strange as he was always such a reliable actor. <br /> <br /> Also interesting to note is the director-Busby Berkeley, best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images, leading another genre here with remarkable ease. He maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout the admiration. <br /> <br /> A very good movie that deserves more attention 8/10.
