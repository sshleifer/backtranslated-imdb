Victor Sjostrom, the best Swedish cinema's grandfather, instructed this sharp, existentialist film about reconciliation, treason, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption and the gloomiest moments in the human condition. He comes as David Holm, a non-goddamn, who responds to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunk ways, only to be able to commit to his soul with the phantom carriage driver: death. <br /> <br /> Unlike many silent movies in the period, the film is almost absent-minded with over-arching scenes. Pacing becomes boring with his overly familiar Dickensian story. However, the film examines in thought and in relation to others in its time, it is a very bold and unique film. The audience of the time was not exposed to such issues, and the filmmaker is huge, symbolic and accompanied by double exposure effects and multi-page flashbacks. It is really a scary and scary movie for young people. <br /> <br /> When you watch the movie, it is easy to see the later influences that this film had in Swedish champion Ingmar Bergman. Most Bergman themes are here on full screen. Of course, Sjostrom later appeared in Bergman's masterpiece on alienation and loneliness: Wild Strawberries. This would be Sjostrom's final performance as an actor. Sjostrom based the script on a novel by Swedish author Selma Lagerlof. *** of 4 stars.
