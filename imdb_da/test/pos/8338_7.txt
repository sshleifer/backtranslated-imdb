Charles "Chic" Sales is absolutely fantastic as the only member of the Leeds family who is willing to testify against a gangster saw them murder a policeman and an informant. He fought the Bull Run in the Civil War, and his patriotism runs high even after his son-in-law is beaten and one of his grandchildren is kidnapped by the gang and scares all the other members. Fear of his grandson's death is no excuse, he says. He didn't want his grandson living in a country run by gangsters anyway. The conflict between bourgeois duties and personal security is vigorously driven in this Oscar-nominated story. Walter Huston is also a standout as the hard-driving district lawyer threatens the family with perjury if they do not back up their identification of the killer in court. The rest of the casting, including the shabby killer, Ralph Ince, is all excellent and the movie is sneakily directed by William A. Wellman. There is also good excitement as the sale disappears, just as the experiment must begin.
