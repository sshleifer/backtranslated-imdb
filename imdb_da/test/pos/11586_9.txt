This film talks about the real life story of Ramon Sampedro, who for 27 years has been lying in bed after breaking his neck and struggling to be allowed to get someone to help with his death. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem is one of the best actors of his generation. Consider this: he must wear this movie with only his face! Amazingly, he didn't even get an Oscar nomination. Now we can all see that the academy is a joke! The molding was amazing! The optimistic Rosa, his lawyer Julia, the rest of the family ... Everyone has their own opinion that Ramon wants to die. <br /> <br /> Whether your for or against euthanasia are your opinions aside, this movie deserves to be seen by people all over the world! Halfway through the movie I started crying and it didn't stop until the credits rolled. This movie is so heartbreaking but also lovely to watch and I can't wait to see it again. I give it a 9/10, and in my opinion this is by far the best movie this year so far.
