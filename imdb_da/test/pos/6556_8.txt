Uzumaki is a visually stunning movie, but I felt that part of the story could have been sacrificed. There is hardly any character development that has made me feel personally detached from the movie, which is ironic because all the puns aside, this movie really draws you with its many small spiral effects and amazing scene transitions. Initially, the overall cinematography threw me out, but when you turn to the overall look, you begin to see the beauty of this twisted movie. This is a great movie if you are looking for a looker with too much substance or deeper meaning. It's a big horror movie that isn't actually scary or exciting, but somehow ... creepy.
