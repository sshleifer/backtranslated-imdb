Hooray for Korean Cinema! Last year, I saw "Chungyang" and "No place to hide", now I catch Hur Jin at direct debut "Christmas in August". Different themes and levels of achievement speak highly of a national cinema ripe for discovery. The main themes of the film are death and love. The graceful and thought-provoking way Jung Won (Han Suk-kyu) copes with his impending death and the sublimation of his desires toward Darim (Shim Eun-Ha) out of true love for her. I was deeply moved by his careful management of behavior and emotions, protecting Darim from unnecessary pain without rejecting her. <br /> <br /> The success of this type of movie is based on the actors skill. He and Shim excel as they are both quite expressive and naturalistic. A number of secondary characters, Jung Won's family, friends and clients, are quickly delimited to enrich the story without detracting from the main focus. Living is to love, but all things must pass. Pain lowers. Life goes on.
