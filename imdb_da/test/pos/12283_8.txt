This is a pleasant project, it's not a movie that the title suggests. Well imminent of Nadia Dajani, who reintroduces Grace's role. I follow the re-enactment of what happens to Mike and Grace in New York City. She leaves, but he wants to get in touch with her. This project is his way of trying to get in touch with her. <br /> <br /> I saw it at IFC. I have heard that it will be released on DVD as well. I like this trend with several independent projects. This is an example of a good project. <br /> <br /> I hope he finds her. <br /> <br /> Take a look and be entertained. <br /> <br /> KirbyEF
