This has one of the more unusual plots I've seen in a horror movie, but it is based on good solid Universal Studios fare: Lots of monsters, beautiful heroines, torch-bearing villagers. But my favorite part is Larry Talbot (The Wolf Man) searching for cure for his lycantropy. Having died in the original "Wolf Man", he re-emerges and walks through the "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man" and "House of Frankenstein" who are looking for a way to end their suffering. I think first-time viewers will find their search in this movie very interesting. <br /> <br />
