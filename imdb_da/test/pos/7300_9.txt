I watched this movie, never read the book and took the signs of face value, but have already been introduced to them, saw it again recently. I have a completely different point of view out of the movie. <br /> <br /> Without the burden of having to focus attentively on each character, learned their quirks and foibles, I allowed to focus on the cultural issues that were put into the movie. The Farm's families in Iowa are as closely interconnected as they are in Indiana, where I grew up in the 40s and 50s that I immediately recognized the back stories and motives behind the characters. Perhaps Jane Smiley could mean for us to look beyond the superficial in the world that these people might live, but viewers are so absorbed in the "Hollywood" aura of the individual actors that they lack a rich layout of a lesser lifestyle and less as every decade passes. Another movie with these features is "Bridges of Madison County". Try to see both of these movies again with an eye for the whole picture.
