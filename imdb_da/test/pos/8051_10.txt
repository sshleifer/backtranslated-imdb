The movie is a starter for what really happened in Phenix City. I am a grandson of the people who really lived the story. The truth has never come to my knowledge. I've tried to find out the whole story, but the people who lived it are still afraid to tell it. Phenix City is still run by crooked people. Albert Patterson wasn't quite the weekend the story wants you to believe. The story was filmed in Phenix City. It still has some of the famous places in it that you see in the movie. The colonial funeral home still looks exactly like it. But if you want Sin City's real story, visit us and find people who are willing to tell you about Ma Beachie's and her kindness. She didn't get the name ma for nothing.
