I had the opportunity to see this last night at a local film festival. Herzog introduced the film and took an hour long Q&A afterwards. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent finished "documentary"; Herzog subsequently explained that he does not consider his films to be true documentaries, as facts sometimes camouflage the truth. Instead, he scripts some scenes and ad libs to introduce a new element that may have been missed if he followed the original storyline. <br /> <br /> Unlike Timothy Treadwell, Little Dieter is a true person you fall in love with; You rejoice for him, you feel the anxiety that he feels. You admire the sense of humor and joy of life that he exhibited here 30 years after being captured by Viet Cong. You are disappointed to hear afterwards, as Dieter went on for not long ago. <br /> <br /> As in most Herzog films, imagery is breathtakingly beautiful with a wonderful selection of background music. Especially a fighting situation taken from the Vietnam War Archives, but suited to Dieter's history. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the movie, Dieter returns to the hell jungle, where he was a POW, and he determines his journey with some locals. Harrowing for us to see, I can't imagine what he felt when he was tied up again. <br /> <br /> One of the better films to portray and discuss the march of Viet Nam War. It should serve as a lesson for all of us.
