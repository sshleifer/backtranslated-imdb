Oz is in the Oswald State Correctional Facility. It tells the story of confrontation, cruelty, violence, hatred and survival at all costs. In a place like Oz, you must have eyes on the back of your head. <br /> <br /> This truly original, intelligent and convincing drama tells how distorted life becomes as soon as you walk through the gates of Emerald City. <br /> <br /> What must be a modern forensic facility is actually far from being such. The show highlights some of the many flaws in the prison system, the underestimation of humanity that cold-haired players can still maintain, and the only true fact: the prisoners are the ones who control the prison. <br /> <br /> This magnificent and somewhat surrealistic show teaches about the importance of every life and helps understand the understanding that most prisoners are there. This show may seem shocking at first, but to really tell it as it is such a thing is needed. Oz is a great portrayal of hell on earth, and how such a place teaches you some of the most important lessons you will ever learn.
