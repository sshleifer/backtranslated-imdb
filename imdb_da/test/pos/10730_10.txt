Certainly when I watched this movie on HBO, I was a little irregular in following the plot, but it catches my attention when I see Dustin Hoffman in it. Actually, I'm not excited about watching old movies, but in the long run I change my point of view. When I saw this stirring movie made me feel like I was sitting on my seat again, I didn't see my tears suddenly roll down on my cheek, and then I let a heavy sigh to realize the effect of it I've just seen. Kramer vs Kramer was actually one of the best classic drama movies I've seen for a long time that even I couldn't imagine how it touched me. The story was very emotional, but not saturated with it. The characters were not unrealistic for their roles; they have qualities that make viewers like them, no matter what position they have in the movie, like the role of Meryl Streep, she was a mother who honestly admits her mistakes in the past, but then she is sure to stand up for her emotional motives to get what she wants in a fair and square battle. Dustin Hoffman was too excellent, I can't even understand how this guy could play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role that is completely different, so did it well. Although I have seen the movies many times, when I sit back and watch the lounge in my home scan worth movies for peers and buy a time for it, I get a glimpse of Kramer vs Kramer, which makes my experience another worthy moment.
