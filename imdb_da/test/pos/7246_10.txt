I give this a 10 out of 10, not because the plot was hard to uncover because it was not ... but because it leaves a care for the characters. The action, of all the cast, is excellent, especially Joan Hickson, and it's a great episode because of the heart. <br /> <br /> Miss Marple is invoked by Jason Rafil's death request to investigate and resolve a murder that occurred about seven or eight years earlier, and she must discover who, why, and when she goes together. Sir. Rafiel is the same Rafiel as it was in a Caribbean mystery and then there is a sense of a connection here. <br /> <br /> Nemesis is definitely one of the amateur psychologists among us, and if you are one of those who are only happy with lots of blood, gut and rip-roaring action sequences, then you won't like it. But if you're like me, someone who loves to know about people and discovers what makes them cross, then Nemesis is the only one for you.
