The legendary hammy and the arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff (beautiful game with the evil sardonic aplomb of Ferdy Mayne) dies of a heart attack. A bunch of drama school students steal Radzoff's body from the crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can stick with it. Radzoff returns to life and chooses the rude youngsters to desecrate his grave. Writer / Instructor Norman Thaddeus Vane evokes a new, original, and even beautifully-styled spin on the usual body condition, giving a nice broadcast of the glittering Hollywood environment, and doing a solid job of maintaining a pleasantly foggy and creepy oog-bow atmosphere. The killed set of pieces delivers the pork goods, with a gal being fired, a juicy decapitation (the cut head rolls straight down the stairs and on the lawn so a raven can point it away!), And another bad lass gets shattered with a levitating coffin rating as the definite cruel highlights. Kudos is also in order for stellar casts of well-known B-flick faces: Mayne has a delicious eye-rolling ball with its flashy role, Leon Askin contributes a fun como that bitterly washed director Wolfgang, Nita Talbot adds a class as flaky mental medium, wife Rohmer, plus there are good fluctuations of Luca Bercovici as jerking drama study leader Saint, Jennifer Starrett as the sweet Meg, Jeffrey Combs as the geeky Stu and Scott Thomson as the geeky Bobo. Jumps in chilly pieces is Chuck "Porky" Mitchell as detective, Patrick Wright in one of his usual police parts and Tallie Cochrane as a corpse. Joel King's polished film gives the film an attractive glossy look. The moody score of Jerry Mosely also hits the appalling spot. A funny little scared flick.
