I really hate musicals because music tracks just start out of the sudden and usually destroying scenes, but this one is quite different - it's simply brilliant. Plot may not be a challenge for viewers, but individuals' life stories make this movie great. <br /> <br /> I've seen it at least a dozen times and still I'm not tired of the plot, character or music (I just love the soundtrack - that's the only soundtrack I really wanted to have and probably will stay it the only thing I owe). For me, it is a must-have kind of movie, beautiful characters compiled with entertaining songs and a lot of things to think about after the movie end.
