Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli shows his wonderful touch animation, infusing life, into every little action of the characters in Ponyo. When Sosuke puts his little boat so carefully to reach the red fish, you know you will have a very good time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are interesting and you are really interested in them. They visually remember other stories, Riisa seems like an adult Nausicaa with a son, an old lady in a wheelchair remembers the witch in Howl's Moving Castle. <br /> <br /> The presence of elements, wind, rain and the sea with its large, powerful waves is so strong that I never think it has been developed in such a way in any other movie. It's a simple story, loosely inspired by "the little mermaid" and it reaches the audience, just like Totoro, the other Miyazaki's true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> An instant classic with a good soundtrack and a captivating song under the final credits. Do not miss it.
