I've watched this movie at least 30 times, maybe more, and every time I see it, I'm in the movie and back in 1963! The Movie takes me on a nostalgic holiday every time I see it. I find it important to say here is that I was 15 in 1963 and I remember "before President Kennedy was shot and before the roots came." I can feel myself saying something like, "I wore a watermelon." and then realize just how stupid it was! Jennifer Gray plays Frances "Baby" Houseman in Dirty Dancing. Baby should start college in the fall. She goes to Kellerman for vacation with her family (mother, father and sister Lisa). One of the staff dancers, Penny (played by Cynthia Rhodes) gets pregnant by another employee (one of the college boys played by Max Cantor) and has a chance to get abortion, but it is on one night that her and Johnny (Patrick Swayze) is scheduled to dance at a nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> Thus, the need for a fill-in dancer to Penny. Johnny is persuaded by Penny and his cousin Billy (Neal Jones), whom he can teach Baby to make the dance in time for the show. Baby teacher dance cities with Penny and Johnny are wonderful scenes! The children's father (Doctor Jake Houseman played by Jerry Orbach) comes to Penny's rescue when abortion is done incorrectly. Dirty Dancing brought back to me this time in the story when the girls became pregnant and had abortions in the back room at the slaughterhouse. About this time (1963) many girls actually died of this type of abortion - but there were not many choices for a girl then. <br /> <br /> Lonnie Price plays a big astonished grandson (Neil Kellerman) to Jack Weston's Max Kellerman. Jane Brucker does a good job as Baby's annoying sister Lisa Houseman. <br /> <br /> The music is amazing and the dance is wonderful! The "dirty dancers" are absolutely wonderful and very sexy - I can feel the baby's astonishment when she first sees them dancing and says, "Where did they learn to do it?". <br /> <br /> Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are just perfect together in their respective roles. Patrick's song, "She's Like The Wind" brings tears to my eyes every time I hear / see it in this movie. The movie ends with a recipe, but lets you know what happens next time in baby's and johnny's life. Dirty Dancing gives something new every time it is seen - It fascinates the guard with nostalgia, a feeling that it will be 1963 again.
