Deep Water (2006) **** <br /> <br /> "It doesn't matter ... it's there waiting for you to make a slip up." These words (paraphrased) are perhaps the best summary of the ocean's nature I've ever heard murmured. Its furies are boundless, not least by her loneliness. These words come from the fascinating and heartbreaking documentary Deep Water. It's the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur sailor who participated in the 1969 Sunday Times Race around the world. If you do not know his story, it may be best to stop reading now. Do not read this or any other information about Crowhurst or the race. Find the movie and just watch it. After the first solar migration of the sea in 1967, adventurers and viewers of adventurers began to seek the next one-up. This time, the journey must take place without making landfall or stopping along the way. After falling into hard times, Crowhurst ran as a great opportunity to get the family back on their feet. He had lived through financial difficulties as a child, and wanted some to go back to such a life. So he sat down to find sponsors, and soon he did Stanley Best and Rodney Hallworth. The two men spelled the potential cash cow and gave Crowhurst a boat, provided that if he were to withdraw from the race, he would be forced to pay the expenses. However, his boat was in serious need of repairs and he feared that it would not be ready in time for the last day of departure. However, he was informed by his sponsor that he should simply go ?? After all, they broke up the dough and expected it to return many times. <br /> <br /> The information in the story is notorious: Crowhurst's boat began to water and his progress slowed down to a crawl. Faced with the decision to try to round off the Horn of Africa (certain death in such a boat) or return (economic destruction and destruction), he sought a third option. He chose to hide alone on his yacht and waited for other competitors to round Cape Horn in South America. Then he would join the race. He reported false positions and recorded break rates. Then he stopped all communication for fear that his position would be given away. He also had to carefully construct false logbooks every day on a journey he did not take. Eventually, the loneliness, the blame and the realization that he would probably be caught were weighted too heavily on Crowhurst. His final logbook records make the muscles of a Kurtz completely healthy. Just a few weeks from home, he turned his boat away from home and was reported to have skipped overboard soon afterwards. Crowhurst's odyssey is a fascinating one and its end is heartbreaking but inevitable. Our dreams become so often fearful, and the consequences of our actions often give us so few opportunities for a good ending. It is a story of a descent into madness, teased by the infinite abyss of the evil sea. The filmmakers do a wonderful job of telling this story. It is paired with chilling audio and video recordings made by Crowhurst, and tales of his increasingly crazy logos. The story starts slowly and can distract some viewers, but the rewards of the story are totally worth it as it progresses. <br /> <br /> Also, some of the other competitors, such as Frenchman Bernard Moitessier, who were prepared to probably win the speed competition, are approaching just to pull out and start another trip around the world. Also in the movie is Robin Knox-Johnston, who was the winner of the competition. He donated his prize money to the Crowhurst family. <br /> <br /> To read briefly about the Crowhurst saga, it simply does not do justice. It is of course interesting, but a quick look through the raw feelings and odds presented here. The last moments in Deep Water are true heartbreak, hearing of his widow's thoughts, and the worship and understanding of his friends. This is a fascinating story, and that is what carries the documentary in such large channels.
