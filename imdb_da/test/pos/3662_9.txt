"Hari om" is an Indian greeting, and the movie's compelling title character bearing this same name (the game of the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India. There is no "bend it like Beckham" backgrounds and stereotypes, and only small salutes to Bollywood's music and dance (though the audio track is worth buying), but rather the feeling that you see the real India permeates the movie through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to increase the performance of the five professional players. Hari Om's companion is fortunately for us a young and beautiful French woman in search of a journey. With the overtures of a "Y Tu Mama Tambien" self-discovery trip (without sex and fatal disease), this beautiful film calms down and brings the philosophical mind. Unlike the first compilation of the protagonists, everyone identifies with traits of both, and the cultural division disappears as the steps of mankind. In short, the film's central theme is: "Everyone has a love story, don't let your passers-by" teach us a great deal about love at a number of levels. Don't let this movie pass you by!
