Feature-length CGI movies have just been released this year, but even though it will provide the kids with a lot of entertainment, for the hard-wearing Alvin fanatics and supporters who grew up with the 60s and 80s versions of the cartoon exhibitions, The Chipmunk Adventure probably the best Alvin and Chipmunks based animated movies ever. <br /> <br /> First of all, the animation is, as always, fantastic, the drawn designs are as they should be in the drawings - unlike the movie itself is just great fun to see. There are no celeb voices, no CGI generated effects, just pure quality 2-D, hand-drawn animation and the colors are amazing - bright, bold and beautiful. The wit and humor are typically chipmunk standard and the story is spot-on. In fact, The Chipmunk Adventure is all that the live action movie should have been, but it is not. Alvin, Simon and Theodore compete with Chipettes, Elenor, Jeanette and Britney in a hot air balloon competition and along the way, the children encounter all sorts of problems and dilemmas that they have to solve in their own way. And no chipmunk movies are finished without the odd releases of classic rock and pop songs. <br /> <br /> Chipmunk Adventure is for both children and adults - another benefit than the CGI movie - which in 2007 version will get a few new admirers, 1987 movies will appeal to both young and older Chipmunk fans . Bagdarasian and Karman give the helium-like voices in the movie's trio. Overall, this movie is a must for fans of the comic book that shows itself - you will not be disappointed. If you have seen the live action version then you will feel that this movie is a much better contrast in contrast. If you don't, go and still see it or still forget the Jason lee movie and as an alternative, stick to this
