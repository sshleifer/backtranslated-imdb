Batman Returns is more gothic and gloomy than its predecessor, and I like it a lot. The landscape is also darker, and the whole environment is sad, along with the soul-cooling music composed by the so talented Danny Elfman. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the idea of ​​making Penguin a monster, unlike the comic book where he's human. Although he resembles a monster, he shows well that he possesses human dignity, and I felt very sad when he saw the gravestones of his parents. But he was actually a dangerous villain and he had to be stopped. Michael Keaton made a "tour de force" with his return as Dark Knight, and this time he is strong as in the original Batman. It's not hard to understand why he is sometimes called Batman ... <br /> <br /> Also Michelle Pfeiffer is so sexy and well-equipped in her role and she gave a faithful performance as the female villain / criminal dressed like a cat. Really, the actors did all the masterful work with Batman Returns, which made it a successful movie. <br /> <br /> If you liked Batman, watch the amazing sequel because it's worth it to all Dark Knight's hard-core lovers. <br /> <br /> Steve Baillargeon
