Richard Condie's Credibility Disease Campaign 'The Big Snit' is a trip through qwerkyness, madness, hillarity, enjoyable backgrounds, melting signs and a conclusion that almost brings me to happy tears every time I see it. <br /> <br /> This short I have seen again and again AND OVER, and I never have any of it (fortunately it has on tape from a broadcast on TV) !! It never stops to make me break into laughter uncontrollably and reach down to the depth of my spirit and highlight the grandeur of human condition. <br /> <br /> Because when someone says, "Come on, let's finish the game" everything is okay in the world and the problems we face every day, we suddenly experience, every petty fleeting thing is not to fight or worry more. This movie initially seems like a simple exercise in cartoon slapstick humor, but it's far more than that. This movie hits a greater sense of spiritual significance with humanity in the wake, when everything seems to be so bad and trivial. <br /> <br /> It's flawless ... in every way. AND DAMN FUNNY TOO;) <br /> <br /> Rated 10 out of 10.
