As I said earlier this year, this is a good movie in my swordfish review (written by this author / director / producer Skip Woods). It is very high up there in my criminal girl list among Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, Pulp Fiction and Snatch. Basically, I think this movie is for me what Reservoir Dogs was for many people - a cult classic - though I prefer to compare it to Pulp Fiction. I think I had never seen Tarantino's first effort much, but I was sure it was as good as I liked Pulp Fiction, for it simply has everything a classic needs. A great story and good actors. OK the budget may not be as big as in eg. Godzilla, Mission of Avengers to Mars, but it is certain as hell beats the live crap out of these movies (and many others). <br /> <br /> The story of this movie is about a man named Casey (Thomas Jane) who has settled with his wife in Houston. Unexpectedly, an old friend of his comes by disturbing his life and revealing his secrets and today makes his living hell (and also a bloody). The film is very original and quite bloody / sexually toned. So based on the first and last quality I can assure you that if you like this movie, you would also like swordfish, which of course has a much larger budget and more famous faces than this one, but is as good (though not so bloody and not so sexually toned). I watched this movie for the second time last night and I really enjoyed it (again). I mean all the characters and actors are good, though I have to give very big credits to Thomas Jane and Paulina Porizkova, who were the best actors (and had the best characters) in the movie. I must also thank Skip Woods for being so imaginative and original. Brutal, sexual, offensive ??? Maybe, but definitely so fun and an exciting trip to the end. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
