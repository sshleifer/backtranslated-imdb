I watched this movie in a branch of the Duane Reed pharmacy in New York on vacation, and it seemed a bit silly fun. And of course, the whole premise is ridiculous beyond words - but it turned out to be a very fun action movie for kids and their parents. <br /> <br /> 10-year-old Ricky Bernard (Jordan Garrett) has the head in the clouds most of the time, much to his father's (Larry Miller) dismay. As a member of his school orchestra, Ricky and schoolmates fly for a concert performance ... and again Ricky's mind goes 'out' and suspects that some criminal plot is happening. <br /> <br /> Reluctantly helped by best friend Sashi, who is a fan of hot sauce (what a strange plot unit there was) and others they are trying to get to solve the mystery. Oh yes, and Ricky's skills of 1,000 hours of flight simulator experience turn out to be useful when he is encouraged to save the day in the movie's exciting climax! It was good to see Eric Roberts and Mark Dacosco playing parts in a family movie. And watching DVD interviews all seem to have had fun participating. <br /> <br /> I liked the Junior Pilot; charming and good-natured performances, fun plot line and a real; sense of pleasure and pure sadness. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an entertaining family movie, you can do much worse than buying it.
