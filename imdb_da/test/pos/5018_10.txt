It's a movie with a theatrical message mixed with some clever moments. Films like these are the lines of great actors, they enjoy throwing the ball into open pieces like these. The angel who was not what we see in old books and churches is a pretty good change. It's the echo of Kevin Smith's piece of Dogma, almost in the same slapstick friend. <br /> <br /> - = 0) Watch this movie for a good day after you have sucked it all in. Could it be so many movies trying to be complicated that we forget the simple movements of movies like this? Possibly one of the most fun pieces I've seen for a while, I ran into this on VHS in a trash can because a person's basement was flooded this summer, and I grabbed a handful of tapes. <br /> <br /> Whether in a trash can or on the silver screen are mild comedies like this fun, you just don't have to tell everyone at a hip night club that you like it or a faint political party. Just keep it to yourself and I'll bet lots of people will borrow it from time to time.
