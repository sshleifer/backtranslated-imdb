Has there ever been an angel of death as MIMSY FARMER in the heroinopus of Barbet Schroeders 1960s? Black by Jean Seberg with a hypodermic. Pink Floyd score. Despite some infinite weaknesses, a classic, shamelessly killed by Erich Segal / Noel Black for their inept JENNIFER ON MY MIND (1971), although Tippy Walker plays a similar character, is even very junky-appealing in the latter mess. MORE, however, is great, a great 60's drug film and simply an important document of its time. Very much a cult movie, so join the cult. <br /> <br /> No American movie, as far as I can remember, shows the same area. MIMSY is an amazing archetype that raises this to mythical realms. Not too weak hearted. Also great sex scenes.
