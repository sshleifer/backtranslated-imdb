Chan is in New York and he gets involved in an attempt to sabotage a new aircraft design. <br /> <br /> The war was over a year away from reaching America, but the Second World War was already raging all over the world and then stained it all after most people had realized there was war. The war is not mentioned here, but the fact that the film deals with the production of aircraft at least highlights it. The mystery itself is pretty good, it is the idea of ​​plane sabotage, which is well suited for a couple of rather exciting moments. To be sure we are talking about Charlie Chan, so we can be sure he would live to fight another day, but there was no guarantee what condition he would be in, no one around him would stay alive. <br /> <br /> I like this movie a lot. It's not one of the reasons, and far from the worst. It's one of the really rare things, a real fun. Definitely worth a look or six.
