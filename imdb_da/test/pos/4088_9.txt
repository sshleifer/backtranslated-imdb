As a few people I know, I arrived late at "Stingers"; Not before 2000. Three years later, there is no way I would miss an episode. The show is really good and for a better word it has maintained its integrity, unlike "Blue Heelers", for example. The crime is the case; Personal life is there but only wheel out when it affects a study! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he was really in good shape, which didn't surprise me. Gary could measure up to any British or American actor in a similar series. The cast changes occasionally, but each change brings something new and fresh. With the exception of Australia's finest crew behind the scenes, 'Stingers' will continue to be a groundbreaking drama series.
