not a Larry Mcmurty masterpiece, but it stands alone as a good western, one of the lonely pigeons does. Who ever takes the role of Woodrow calls, makes a great depiction of their own style. It is also easy to see that they sought to use this as a stepping stone for the V-series (both versions of it) and that the authors knew how to keep the taste alive William Peterson was amazing in this, the geeky CSI guy is not it characters he plays in this - this guy can do everything it looks <br /> <br /> it deserves to be enjoyed by those who enjoy westerns <br /> <br /> 4out5 stars
