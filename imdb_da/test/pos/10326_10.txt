The whole civilized world now knows that this is where Emil Sitka says his immortal "Keep hands, you lovebirds." But Shemp Howard, professor of music, steals the show. See him guide Dee Green as she breaks the "Voices of the Spring". See Shemp as he shaves at a mirror suspended from the ceiling with a string. Look at him as he walloped by Christine McIntyre. Look at him and you will laugh and learn. Moe is also not slim. Look at him as he tries to get a woman to sit on a rock trap. Larry is, as usual, the Zen reaction master. All in all, one of the very best Stooge shorts. You won't find a weak moment.
