I personally found the movie to be great. I had it in advance for a month and saw it twice the day I got it in the mail, and several times ago .. Yes, the time lapse can be a bit much, but the rest of the film clearly compensates for it. All the amature cast, but the play was right for each part. The plot itself is just ... haggard! There is no other way to describe it. Who makes a movie about someone getting f ** gered! ??? BAM, that's who. Geni. Simply genius. Two thumbs up. I would be honored to work with him every day, preferably on something.
