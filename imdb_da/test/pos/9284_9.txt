Chasers war on everything. 5 words that I love to see. Chaser's war on everything is an excellent Australian comedy. As the name suggests, they make war on everything. They seem to love beating police most of all. Chaser is one of the best comedies I've seen and is top of the line in Australia. It's on the Australian Broadcasting Corparation (ABC), which is where some of the best comedies are. <br /> <br /> It has won the Australian Film Industry (AFI) awards, but does not win the best comedy on the accommodations. <br /> <br /> Last year (2006), chaser was broadcast on ABC on Friday night when everyone was out, so no one could see it. Now they have been moved to Wednesday evening at. 21.00 (a heaps better time slot) and the best part is, if I miss an episode or even just want to see it again, I can download it from www.ABC.net.au/chaser.
