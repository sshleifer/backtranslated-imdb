This is a wonderful movie and I still love it! It's just so magical, and it's fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so right, you just want to love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life. <br /> <br /> I don't see how anyone would like the movie matched the book, I think the movie was amazing! I haven't even read the book and guess what? It doesn't matter. In fact, if the movie and the book are so different then you can just call them two separate stories and be happy with it. I thought the play was bloody brilliant! Bridget Fonda plays Snow Queen, so evil and so cold - you just have to hate her. Chelsea Hobbs plays Gerda, a beloved girl who is determined to find her love whatever it takes and goes on a wonderful adventure. And I just love all the snow queen sisters (spring witch, summer princess and fall man) they are so funny and different in many ways. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie for a while, so please forgive me if I make a minor mistake .... but there is no doubt I will always love this movie.
