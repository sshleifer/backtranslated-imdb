The movie is amazing, it has a soundtrack that sets the tone for the movie. The lines in the movie are great, like "Nothings to good for out friends" and "Its collection time Charlie collection time." I can watch the movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are unique. I feel that when I watch this movie, I will go out and shoot down bad guys if there is a movie that you do not want to miss is this. "They killed the Giggler man, they killed the giggler" "They had no right to do so if we were abusing our turf." The lines continue to come in the movie. Eff. go out and not rent but buy this movie is worth the money trust me.
