This is a wonderful old-fashioned Christmas shopping that I try to catch on television every year if I can. It's about a Martha Stewart journalist named Elizabeth Lane, depicted by Barbara Stanwyck. But unlike Martha, this lady is a fake without any domestic skills. The other cast members successfully complete the story and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan) and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley). <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane is a journalist writing food items, portraying herself as a happily married countryman with children. In fact, she is a single woman living in an apartment in New York City and cannot boil an egg. Her recipes are borrowed from her Hungarian chef friend, Felix. Elizabeth comes away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine, Alexander Yardley, decides he wants a nice old-fashioned Christmas Eve and invites him to visit her and bring him a recurring war hero, Jefferson Jones, a sailor who was shipwrecked . Yardley demands total honesty from his employees. To get out of her hassle and save her deception based on career, Elizabeth borrows the loan for the Connecticut home for her old architect, John Sloan, a boring, pushy guy who has long sought marriage. She also lends a neighbor's baby (actually several) to pass as her own and her "husband" Sloans. <br /> <br /> Of course, this scenario makes it very awful. It's a screw basketball comedy and a charming romance, with the added attraction of a Christmas mood. When I think of this movie, I depict the snowflakes, the tree beautifully decorated, the fire roaring in the fire, the turkey burning and Christmas cakes baking. Why was Hollywood forced to make a remake? I understand that there is a 1992 version, directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and with lead star Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson and Tony Curtis. I have not seen this modern adaptation nor do I want to. This old favorite is perfect as it is, and a holiday should look with It is a wonderful life, white Christmas, miracle on 34th Street, and of course all versions of A Christmas Carol.
