Clive Barker from Hellraiser fame has written and produced a fantasy horror movie that is fun and exciting. <br /> <br /> The make-up made by Bob Keen and Geoffrey Portass was amazing. It took quite a fantasy to come up with these mutants who lived underground. It was really a good experience to see the quality of the work. It wasn't very terrible, as the worst being was actually a human serial killer. I just saw Craig Sheffer in Shadow of Doubt the other day and he also did a good job in this movie. Nothing spectacular but fair. This was just Anne Bobby's third movie and she was also good. The end was spectacular, and the rednecks got their just desserts, like David Cronenberg. Ha!
