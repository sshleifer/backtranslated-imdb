River's Edge is an excellent movie, and it's a shame that it hasn't made more of a mark for itself in movie history. There were a number of ugly films based on schoolchildren made in the eighties, but by all those I've seen; This is certainly the most nihilistic and disruptive. The film takes a story that interferes with itself and adds the theme of teenage slackers and their eerie attitude to things that take the story to another level. The movie works because the central story is interesting and it plays with complex characters. The movie begins with a murder. We then follow the killer, the nickname John, when he goes back to school and tells all his friends what he has done. Instead of giving the expected response, most of them hardly react, and the strongest response the killer gets is coming from Layne; who makes it his first priority to help John clear the mess he is in and get him out of it. The other friends throw over the crime, and before long one of them goes to the police ... River's Edge has a whole host of fantastic performances from his young cast. Keanu Reeves has a reputation for woodworking and for good reason; but he fits very well with this early role, and this achievement is easily one of his best. Crispin Glover is the biggest standout as the slightly insane Layne. Glover always stands out in every movie he's in, and while he goes over the top a bit; he convinces well as the lead in this movie. Reeves and Glover receive good support from a talented young cast that includes Daniel Roebuck and Joshua John Miller, as well as the great Dennis Hopper in another wild role. The film has a very cave picture that fits well with its nihilistic tone. The key figures are all the 'slack / stoner' generation, and the way they really don't seem to care about the murder of their friend is more shocking than the actual murder; And the point the film is trying to make about modern society is both strong and well-defined. The movie is also quite fun because of some of the characters' lines; But humor is tone-white and clear that this movie was never meant to be a comedy. All in all, this is an excellent and memorable movie that is definitely worth seeing!
