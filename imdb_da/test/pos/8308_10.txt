Shame if you give this movie a low rating. How do you dislike a movie that has Doug McClure, Peter Cushing, stupid rubber monsters, battles (and for guys, the woman who was the baddie's henchwoman in The Spy Who Loved Me and one of the 70's Sinbad movies, not wearing much of who my mother said, "She was not picked for the color of the eye"), lava, silly wigs and a robust Victorian drill much like the one used in the old Thunderbirds series? The one who saw this movie and knocked it off for the wrong reasons. It can be shit, but it is definitely a good step. They don't make them as they used to sigh ......
