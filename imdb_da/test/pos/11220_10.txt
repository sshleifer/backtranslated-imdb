I loved the movie "Northfork". I didn't know anything about the movie until I saw it. Therefore, I had no disturbance or information to guide me in what I then unfold on the screen. Eventually, I would advise anyone interested in the movie to see it if it's nothing but the quality actors that appear in it. Do not read anything about the plot, the story or the evaluation of the movie. In fact, STOP reads something further in my comments, although I think they are general and will not spoil the movie for you, I will not reduce the value of the movie to you. Find your own way of understanding in this movie or it's diminished in its potential. In general, I found the 3 benign strangers in Northfolk puzzles. As the film unfolds, they could qualify as three entertaining escape from a mental hospital or dreams and hallucinations of a sick and feverish young boy or three angels "sent" to find the "lost angel". <br /> <br /> The sick and perhaps dying boy works to convince the three "strangers" to leave the search for the lost angel, become his guardian (mother and father), and safely take him away from Northfork ( not less than 1000 miles). He even declares that he is the lost angel to try to manipulate them all to be his guardian. Only one of the three responds positively to the boy. The other two have no real enthusiasm or passion for this inclusion. The priest who cares for the sick boy demonstrates a depth of care for people and a deep conviction against his faith. He transcends the desert and the emptiness of Northfork and its people; he is the light of goodness and hopes for both Northfork and the movie viewer. <br /> <br /> Near the film's climate course, the boy and the new guardian go overland to a field where an aircraft is waiting. They control to find the other two strangers also on the plane; In fact, it's a pilot. The engine starts and the plane starts. <br /> <br /> Who are the 3 strangers? If only one stranger was interested in helping the boy, why were all three on the plane? Where's the plane going? Find the other two "Lost Angel"? Is there a lost angel and if so, who is it? Who are the six men who are dressed as burial? If all this is just the sick boy's feverish dreams, how did one of the 3 strangers reach out to help one of the men dressed as a undertaker when he jumped and hit his head (neither the boy nor the stranger contacted these men )? One or two sentences written under the title tell people what this movie is about is a tragic mistake (this is not a spoiler, it's just advertising). So if you haven't seen the movie, Northfork, the above questions show only a few of the interesting and fun forks in the mindset when you see the film Northfork. If you read the ad chart of the movie's plot before you saw it before, you may have to look at some of the above questions and see it again ... I know I want to. <br /> <br /> Terry
