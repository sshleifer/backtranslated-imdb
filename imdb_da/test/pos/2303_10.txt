The Empire of Passion begins misleading - that is, if you immediately expect to be a horror movie. It's like a riff on James M. Cains Postman Always Calling Twice: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a mother of two and a dutiful, hard-working wife to rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when he is not nearby and she is at home with the child, the celebrating and speechless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) comes around to bring some treats to Seki ... and a little extra. They soon sleep together, but after he does something for her (let's just say a "shave"), he knows he'll find out and immediately suggests they kill Gisaburo. They drink him up, choke him, and then throw him into a well. This will, of course, come back to haunt them - but it is literally, at least to them (initially scared Seki and then later to skeptical Toyoji), which turns gear into "Kaidan", a Japanese ghost story. /> <br /> This is a movie where horror does not just come out of "oh, ghost, ah", but out of the total fear that builds on the characters. In a way, there is a mechanics for a film noir at work all the time, if it is only translated loosely through a Japanese village from the 19th century as opposed to an American city or a small town (ie, the snooping cop, "the proof ", possibly found by someone else, words come around, suspicions aroused, etc.). It's convincing because Seiko was actually against the plan from the start, manipulated by the lustful, but poorly prepared Toyoji, and her reactions to Gisaburo's resurrection are staggering for her. Take the one that comes closest to poetry: Gisaburo's ghost, bleb-blue face and mostly silent, chilling stare, movements for Seiko to get on the rickshaw. She reluctantly does, and he pushes her around on a road she doesn't know in the bad hours before dawn, surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghost stories want to be heavenly, they could get this harrowingly atmospheric. Although it starts to burst into hysteria towards the end, there is so much here that Director Oshima gets the right to make this a distinctive work. Having hit it tremendously in the international cinema world with the Kingdom of Sin (which ironically was banned in its own country), he did something that he claimed was even * more * bold to 'Senses'. Maybe he was right; The Empire of Passion has much more graphic sexual content than its predecessor (also starring in Tatsuya Fuji, a great physical actor with a great range), but it is bold in creating a world of fear. You can believe in ghosts in this story, but you must also believe how far down to their own personal hells these two would be love birds will go. Snooping detectives or gossip towns are the least of their worries: the fate of their very soul is at stake. <br /> <br /> And Oshima takes what in other hands could only be juicy pulp (unfortunately it wouldn't 'surprise me if an American remake was already in the works) and craft shot after a beautiful shot, with repetitive work get into the mis-one scene (ie shoots from Seiko and Toyoji go that way, the camera at a Dutch angle, the world is tilted and surround them in a gloomy blue hue) as well as some that affect movements that will stay with me , long after I finish writing this (ie Toyoji throws the leaves with one hand in the well in slow motion, or how Seiko is naked body revealed after she gets blind). It is bold lies to connect at a level of the spirit - not to confuse with the spiritual, although there may also be something about it - about life and death relations with each other, inextricably. It's a classic waiting to be discovered.
