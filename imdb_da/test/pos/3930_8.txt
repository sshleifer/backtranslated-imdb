I didn't expect much from this movie when I entered the theater, but I had been waiting for it for many years. To sum it up, it was pretty boring! Chad Michael Murray was pretty good, I thought he should be another Chris Flynn from Wrong Turn, but I was wrong. Elisha Cuthbert was also good, but the best performance should go to Brian Van Holt. He also played the evil guy, I think he was sick, sadistic and very cruel. The background between the brothers was good, and I liked how no killings took place before about 40 minutes in the movie. It gave you time to choose the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die. Jon Abrahams was pretty good as CMM's goofy best bet. I liked how Chad kind of cried when he found him dead, it was better so only he was like, "Whatever my friend's dead, who cares." It showed how he really cared. So in general it was a darn good slasher with some great effects. Bravo!
