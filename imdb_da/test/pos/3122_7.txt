In 1950, John Ford had already fully developed the ideas and motives that would form the core of his most successful Western. Always present, for example, is a strong sense of community that is most poignantly captured in Joacher's family by Steinbeck's 'The Wrath's Grapes (1940)'. Within these communities there is also room for the less human interactions, the smaller friendships and romances that make life worth living even within Ford's higher themes of racism and pioneer spirit. 'Wagon Master (1950)' came after Ford had released the first two films in his "cavalry" trilogy ?? 'Fort Apache (1948)' and 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)' ?? and it covers a similar area, only without the military perspective and more judgmental, John Wayne's strong leadership. Ben Johnson and Harry Cary, Jr. are fine actors, but they feel as if they are playing the other enemy to someone, and Ward Bond's curse of Mormon elderly while potentially a candidate for such a role is not given enough focus to satisfy the ticket. <br /> <br /> In the 'Wagon Master', Ford is so comfortable with its proven western formula that every character development is largely glossed over. Ben Johnson's romance with Joanne Dru is treated as a commitment more than anything else, and Harry Cary Jr's charm of a Mormon girl is so perfect to be almost non-existent in the final film, leaving to consider the survival of deleted scenes. Only in Charles Kemper's charismatic and shameless-evil Uncle Shiloh, Ford is trying something different, and it works, even though he is surrounded by a troop of scary hammy lax. Where Ford succeeds in orchestrating the conglomeration of three different breeds of Americans ?? the values ​​oriented grandmothers, the unpleasant horse dealers, the eccentric traveler showmen ?? into a cohesive community of pioneers towards a bright future. This apparent harmony is thrown into confusion upon the arrival of Uncle Shiloh's criminals, exploiting the western border's lawlessness, but ultimately losing the noble cowboys "only snakes". <br /> <br / Ford is considered the Wagon Master among his favorite films, and perhaps it has something to do with the absence of big names like John Wayne or Henry Fonda. Armed only with his stock pick of ordinary players, Ford is able to create a sense of community by avoiding focusing on any sign, although most of the Mormom travelers still remain completely anonymous. Despite the fact that I am undoubtedly well-off, I cannot help feeling that this movie works only well, what other Ford images did even better: the amazing border of the western border was beautifully presented in 'She had a yellow ribbon'; The romances and friendly struggles of community members played a more prominent role in 'Fort Apache'; The early relationships with Indians, which were only suggested here, were more thoroughly examined in 'The Searchers (1956)'; The daring pioneering spirit of the early settler was explored more slowly (albeit by Henry Hathaway and George Marshall) in 'How the West Won Won (1962)'. The 'Wagon Master' is pure John Ford, but it's not a landmark.
