I enjoyed so much of this little musical fantasy, I bought a copy to share with my friends. It's a pleasant and distracting change from our worldly life ..... I think we can all enjoy an active fantasy spirit, one of joy and indulgence, I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The show is excellent and the music uplifting!
