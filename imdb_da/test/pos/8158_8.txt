Last days is a very, very independent film. And compared to many of today's more modern films, it lacks in many parts. The shooting sometimes seems quite amateurish, the dialogues can be a little choppy and the characters are not impressive complex. So do not have too high hopes for this movie, because as I have said, it is very independent. But what it lacks in the concrete aspects of the movie can be overlooked due to the charm of history! I can't argue that the plot is untrustworthy original, but the story is still beautiful and heart-warming in many ways! It's not about being homosexual versus being equal, it's about faith, and how you decide to run your own life! It's a silly story that makes you both cry and smile at the same time! So to be honest last days are far from perfect, but I really loved the movie and I highly recommend it! It is very critical of the religious aspects of our society, and there is homosexuality - but approaching it with an open mind, and I am quite sure that most people will enjoy it as much as myself!
