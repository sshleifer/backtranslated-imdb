Based on the current IMDb assessment and several overview listings, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, you are deeply committed to a genre that has been unoriented for some time. Even with regard to mise-one scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film of great imagination. If you are looking for a movie that is not only entertaining but also provocative, compelling and truly extraordinary, make it the next movie you see. <br /> <br /> I hope that Heath Ledger's tragic death will have led more people to record this movie. He was an incredible talent and his performance in this is one that must not be missed. Don't make the mistake of judging and discarding this amazing movie before you have seen it.
