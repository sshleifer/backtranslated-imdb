First of all, I must say that I am a great Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento fan. Although I have not seen absolutely all their movies, I really enjoyed almost everyone I saw. I like giallos and I thought Argento was the master of this genre after watching movies like "Tenebre" and "Phenomena". But after I saw Fulci on the "New York Ripper", I found out that he could make quite good gialloes beyond his graphic zombie movie and even surrender Argento to a certain level. I love Fulci's style and yes I love doing, but I think this movie, although it has a more developed plot and character than his other movies, is not his best. What I don't like is that it can be confusing at times, especially at the end. And the fact that we go from one suspicion to another and then another, until we even suspect the retarded little girl for a moment, I think it goes too far. I know that giallos must keep you guessing at the end, and the killer must be very hard to find, but this movie plays a little too much with our minds. But I liked the scene when the witch was killed, I think it is very well done and gave me chills. The action is also pretty good, and the photography is good. Although this is not a bad movie, I think Lucio Fulci has made better movies than this, and I think his best is "The Beyond", a very different movie, but a more atmospheric and visual experience. <br /> <br /> I don't give "Torture a Duck" a 7 out of 10. <br /> <br />
