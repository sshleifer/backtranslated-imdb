There have been many people who have tried to make a movie that was identical to the story, Heart of Darkness. Some movies are based on Heart of Darkness, such as Apocalypse Now. In 1993, Nicholas Roeg directed a movie that was exactly like the book. The Heart of Darkness movie is almost exactly identical to the book. This movie is full of action and adventure. Heart of Darkness is about the journey to a sailor named Marlow, who sails along the Congo River to meet the superpowered eagle trader, Mr. Kurz. <br /> <br /> The darkness of the heart, the film, has the same exact beginning and setting as the book. It goes on a boat in the Thems River, and Marlow tells the story of four other men on a boat called Nellie. The whole movie is a flashback of Marlow's journey to see Mr. Kurtz on the Congo River. Marlow works for the Belgian company, which deals ivory along the Congo River. He tells about his account at the firm's office and about all the cards he saw in the office. <br /> <br /> Marlow sits on a steamer in Africa. He arrives at the central station where he receives orders from the general manager. General manager tells Marlow about Mr. Kurtz and Ivory Trade Marlow would do. Marlow quickly finds out that General Manager is not fond of Kurtz because he fears Kurtz will replace him. Marlow is waiting around for the central station for months because his ship has been destroyed and it is being repaired. Marlow sees the harsh treatment and slavery in Africa while in Central Station. When the ship was finally repaired, Marlow, another African character named Mfumu and other crew members sailed on Marlow's steamship to Mr. Kurtz. <br /> <br /> Along the Congo River, they are attacked by African natives in the desert. When Marlow's crew is attacked by the African natives, they will shoot and kill Mfumu. When Marlow finally comes to Kurtz station, he meets a Russian explaining Kurtz's power and glory. Marlow is then taken to Kurtz station home. There he sees many maps and pictures that Kurtz has painted. Finally, Kurtz enters the living room and begins to tell Marlow about everything he has done in Africa and talks about his mistress. Marlow quickly finds out that Kurtz is crazy with power because the Africans greet him as a god. Marlow gets angry with the hardness and slavery he sees in Africa. After Marlow finally meets Kurtz, Kurtz begins to die. While Kurtz was on his deathbed, he called Marlow into his room. Kurtz's life begins to flash for his eyes, and his last word was "horror, horror". When Marlow returns to Europe to see Kurtz's fiance, Marlow tells her that Kurtz's last words were her name to hide the darkness of Kurtz's life. <br /> <br /> Heart of Darkness was well crafted and formed into an adventurous movie. I recommend anyone to watch this movie because it is full of action and mystery. The movie is slow at times, but on the whole it's really interesting. Heart of Darkness will truly expand your mind and will teach you a lot about how to interpret different scenes.
