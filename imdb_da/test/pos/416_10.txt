"Ahh ... I didn't order a fantastic hit show" ..... "We'll get you a" Hack is simply the biggest TV show ever made. A little bit of me died when I was looking at t.v. a Friday night to catch a little Hack and it wasn't on. The show deeply into key societal issues in our culture. I found out that at the end of an episode I was watching; I walked away after being both entertained and informed. I'm actually stupid now that Hack is gone. I no longer want to help the needy and the less fortunate. Since Hack has gone, I see them as eyes and an unnecessary burden on taxpayers. So for God's love we must bring Hack back!
