There was a recent documentary about making movies that highlighted a long list of actors and directors talking about what it was like to make movies. One common theme was that you could get a good script, great cast, the best instructor and lots of money and still create a bad movie. Down Periscope is a proof of the consequence of that theory. Not an original or terribly well-written manuscript. A few solid actors, but mostly unknown, and this movie just makes you laugh! It would be easy to say that Kelsey Grammar brought this movie, but that's not really the case. Other character actors, such as Rob Schneider and the hilarious Harland Williams, added significantly to the movie's enjoyment. <br/> <br /> Cast dynamics or the mysterious "movie magic" is really what happened here, creating a movie that flows smoothly, has incredibly well executed transitions and line by line with well-written and well-executed dialogue. <br /> <br /> A distinguished premise, many and many technical inaccuracies, and just plan stupid things that couldn't happen in real world or the right fleet, but don't care. As a merchant myself, I found that the overall feeling of the film, even though it was not plausible, was not too far away from the mark as far as sea life goes. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny movie, a good family movie, and especially if you're a fan, lots of Kelsey grammar, sarcasm and just marvelous funniness.
