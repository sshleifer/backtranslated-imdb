I'm not sure which version of the movie I saw, but it was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> I didn't know who "Twins" was (Gillian Chung and Charlene Choi) before I watched this movie and I think the English translation of the title is somewhat misleading. <br /> <br /> Martial arts are very well done. I especially liked them because there was a lot of judo / grappling that was filmed very nicely. Donnie Yen (see him in Hero, good performance) as an instructor is amazing as he knows how to shoot these scenes. Everything seemed to flow to me unless there is a scene where the girls are on the roof fighting with bamboo coils. It really has nothing to do with the plot, but it is still entertaining. <br /> Overall, this is one of the better (modern) HK action flicks I've seen for a while. Although cheesy in some respects it still pulls it away. <br /> <br /> Definitely a 9/10
