See this on Comcast On Demand. <br /> <br /> Every time I see this musical, I'm amazed at the songs ... a show stop after another. <br /> <br /> For me, this interpretation is magical. The songs sparkle ... vocals, orchestrations and choreography are great for a "made-for-TV" movie ... better than many scene versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> The debate over Bette just doesn't make sense. She is a mother Her voice is brilliant and yet full of the pathologist from the scene mother who lives through her daughters. I still get tears at the end when she finally has her moment of glory no matter how faded the glory is. <br /> <br /> The Tulsa / Louise duet / dance is on now. Fabulous. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondheim is the king of musical theater. His lyrics just turn off the tongue like silk ... Stynes ​​music is perhaps the best ever written for the scene / screen. <br /> <br /> Thank God, we have this masterpiece of the American Musical Theater captured on DVD.
