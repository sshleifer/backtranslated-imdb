I usually give horror movies about 6/10, but one got to see me. House of Wax was by far the best horror movie I've seen ... Better than Amityville Horror. <br /> <br /> Paris Hilton was pretty good at this and I have to say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I just want to say how she dies ... <br /> <br /> She gets a giant straight between her eyes and they approach and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the murderers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair). Usually he plays an average policeman or soldier, but he did very well in this. <br /> <br /> Eliza Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray also performed very well as Carly and Nick Jones. Nick took the spotlight in the first half of the movie, so Eliza stole it back by keeping much pain in the other half as having the finger cut off and tearing her lips apart after they got glued together and got a straight forward punch in the face of Bo. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give this movie an 8/10. Fans of horror movies should see this.
