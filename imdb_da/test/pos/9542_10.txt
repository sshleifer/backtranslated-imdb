This wonderful movie never failed to move me. The color, convincing cast and stunning scenery make all the great contributions. This production, in contrast to Carlton's later remake, is more impressionist and presented more from the children's own perspective. It focuses on certain episodes from E. Nesbit's charming story rather than trying to make a somewhat more documentary "wart-and-all" style that Carlton adopts. Above all, the amazing musical score of the late Johnny Douglas supports the story all the time and adds extra emotional depth. The net result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively presents the exciting story of "The Railway Children". An unpleasant factor for the viewer to consider throughout this movie is how things have changed since the times - and in many ways to the worse! Yes, maybe many of us may no longer use outdoor toilets and travel in horse-drawn carriages, but what about the quality of life in general? Consider the creepy celebrities who now "grace" our TV screens. Their language is now apparently considered quite acceptable. Also consider the fragile "here today, tomorrow morning" aspects of so many of today's "partnerships" plus all of the single mothers - what happened to the institution called "marriage" when people accepted each other's mistakes but still remained together, love their children? These details add extra piquancy when you see this amazing movie. I hope that as generations survive, children will still be able to enjoy this movie. Not to mention some adults!
