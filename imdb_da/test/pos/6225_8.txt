I had actually seen the last parts of this movie when I was a kid. Thanks to the search feature in sites, I could find out the name of it. For years I didn't know the name, but the film is stuck in my mind. The end left the left hoping that the protagonist would come back to earth eventually. It was a shame, it didn't make it a series. This movie reminds me of traveling to the far side of the sun. Also known as Doppleganger. If you liked this feature, the other is worth watching. It was done before The Stranger, but shares a similar plot. Even different. I just downloaded The Stranger off of eBay on VHS. Hope they make a DVD, but it is doubtful unless it comes out on Dollar DVD. A few pilots do it on the budget DVDs, and maybe this will.
