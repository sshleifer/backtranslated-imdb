It started to be weird, the middle was weird, and the end was weird, but I really liked it. A modern version of Homer's Odyessy, but it's really irrelevant. Interesting story and casting. Clooney was great and I welcome him for taking such an advertising role - so unlike anything he has done or will ever do again. Lots of surprise stars - why not Holly Hunter for more. Do something different tonight and look at this completely different and unexpected flick.
