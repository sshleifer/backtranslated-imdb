Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, good lines ("Miss Bender, I don't care if you knock it on a built-in drum!", Says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange, when Lange incredibly asks how she is expected to read a summarizes a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you watched this movie done and scanned on TV and not in the pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) mailbox version, you haven't really seen it. Hopefully, this guilty enjoyment of a movie will be made available soon on DVD in a letterboxed version and with the original 4-track stereophonic soundtrack. Great opening title sequence that really captures the mood in 1959 New York, while Johnny Mathis sings the theme "Best of Everything" in an echo chamber surrounded by a violin choir and another choir of background warriors. Abortions! Insanity! Office romance! Bitchy cold-hearted bosses! Needed Love! It's all here to enjoy.
