If you're a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more can you ask for than Duke, Yak and Gabby. Lots of good ridin 'and shootin' !!! I found it amazing that Hertes singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is nothing but Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill could have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early Western movies don't miss this one. We do not have to wonder about hidden meanings or try to figure out underlying themes. Just sit back, relax and enjoy a Western movie from a simpler day and time. It's called entertainment people !!!
