The subject of this movie may be depressing: a man about thirty, no job, little education, three children from a failed relationship who lives in his parents' house, but with a dream of controlling feature films. But in half an hour in the film, you realize that Mark Borchardt has a bottomless supply of drive and ambition - it's just that it's all channeled into his need to control movies, and nothing else will make him happy. The movie skips the emotional spectrum, but ultimately you get away to feel happy because you just got to know some wonderful people. Go to see this - you will end up wishing it was longer.
