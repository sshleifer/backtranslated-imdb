My wife and children are a good and fun series that really shows the concerns and problems that happen most smoothly in the best families. Michael Kyle (father) is a man who always tries to stop his kids doing teenage things like partying, drinking, loving or loving. When they do something wrong, he is right there to correct them (by the way he loves to punish) Janet 'Jay' Kyle (mother) has a strong personality and rarely goes into her husband. She understands that their children are teens and like to do "wrong" things, unlike Michael, Michael Kyle 'Jr' does a stupid guy who believes in everything others say. At the start of the series he is such a cool guy and is trying to be like his father, but in the end I don't know why he becomes a very stupid guy and he is starting to be a problematic guy. At the end of the series he falls in love with Vanessa and becomes a father, or should I say, a stupid father who does nothing right <br /> <br /> Kady Kyle is a typical teenager who loves to party, kiss and drink. She has many problems with her parents because they invade her privacy too much. She has a girlfriend called Tony, who is Catholic and afraid of everything so we can't understand what makes her date him. I remember an episode that they are ready to have sex, but Michael Kyle scares Tony and claims that sex is very dangerous and deadly so he decides to stay until he's married. I resume this the best series of my life and I still see it every day after 3 years, so I recommend to all of you - mostly for teens.
