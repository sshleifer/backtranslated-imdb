The undoubted highlight of this movie is Peter O'Toole's performance. On the other hand, wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic. Does anyone do better than O'Toole? I do not think. The big face the man has! The story is a weird and rather disturbing and emotionally intense part (especially towards the end), but it is also strange to touch and succeed at many levels. However, I felt the movie basically revolved around Peter O'Toole's luminous performance, and I'm sure I wouldn't have had it half as much if he hadn't been in it.
