A fantastic comedy drama about the forces of friendship. Despite being a remake of a 1939 movie with the same title, it will probably be compared to Sex And The City. I didn't want to compare to that altogether. The story starts with Mary (Meg Ryan) who seems to be the life most women will envy, she is happily married, has a good daughter, good friends and a good home. But Mary's perfect life is not what it looks like when she discovers her husband, she cheats with Crystal (Eve Mendes) from Zachs. Mary is confused and doesn't know what to do. But her four good friends, Sylvia (Annette Bening), Edie (Debra Messing) and Alex (Jada Pickett Smith) are trying to be there for her, yet they can. I really don't want to give away. But I found this entertaining and I am a man. Meg Ryan is great, it's nice to see her back on the screen after a series of flops. And the rest of the casting is also great, including Eve Mendes as Crystal. Just an enjoyable, light-hearted comedy.
