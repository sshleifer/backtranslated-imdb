Spoiler begins The movie focuses on three friends, Samantha (Summer Phoenix), Chris (Nick Stahl) and Owen (Aaron Paul). The movie starts with Sam and Owen as drug addicts, and Chris, the track star, like the one who takes care of them. As things get worse at Chris's home, he asks Sam how the drug is. Sam is out of rehab and sober at this point and tells him it does better. Chris then catches up with Owen and they start using. It takes chris twice until he is a "full time" member. After some problems with a dealer and a confession to Sam, she comes in again. Then the downward spiral begins for them. Chris od is when he breaks a promise to Sam (I want some of the movie to be a surprise). He dies, Sam enters college to be an architect, and Owen is arrested. then the story ends <br /> <br /> Spoiler ends. smaller spoilers throughout <br /> <br /> Nick Stahl is amazing. He wants an Oscar one day. His portrayal of Chris was heartbreaking. He was the only one who felt right in the movie regarding drug use. Aaron Paul, who played Owen, appeared as though he were not speeding heroin. Summer Phoenix was fine, she is talented, but what can I say that Nick Stahl stole the movie. His drunk eyes, his slow movements, were all perfect. <br /> <br /> The authors needed to reveal retreats in the movie. It is a major reason why people will not stop. Other than that there are fun scenes (the mall scene and the Backstreet boy scene, nail the Stahl reactions right upside down.) Stir, sad scenes (Like the scene between Sam and Chris in her bedroom, after he gets up, I'm bawled, and park scene.). It was also realistic. As if I was using again when Chris would flush the drug down the toilet, and Chris was using again after going to Own, even though he had been clean for two weeks, the move was too strong. It's all realistic. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie for a fantastic cast, good music and a semi-truthful statement of drug abuse.
