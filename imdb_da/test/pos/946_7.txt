Tumbling Doll of Flesh (aka Niku Daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) This was on my wish list for a while, and then I finally scored a copy on Ebay a while back. It has never been on DVD, and what I got from Ebay was a very good quality DVD-R, which I am completely satisfied with. The movie is I think the most extreme example of torture porn with emphasis on porn. A woman reacts to an ad for a porn movie and joins the producer to a place where it is recorded. Porn is just right, with the annoying Japanese pixelation trying to hide hardcore shots, without much success most of the time. After the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave, she is lumped over her head with a baseball bat and taken back to the living room and saw dismembered in slow shots and in one of the most obnoxious scenes the male porn guy screws her in an open wound in the chest. This is after both legs have been cut off, her arm and a few other nice things. This movie offsets the guinea pig series with a long shot, in fact, they are not even close to realism, although cheap effects are shown in this movie. This is actually one of the best fake snus movies I've ever seen, if not the best. Now I have to warn you that if you are not in this thing, you must stay far away. This film is very strong, and with the real sex it is in a very sick way, erotic to a degree. And I mean in a very sick way. But wherever you come down to this topic material, this movie brings the goods home and I would definitely recommend you to find it out. After reading about the movie, I expected something very strong, but it exceeded it with a bunch.
