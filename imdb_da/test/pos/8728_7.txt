Anyone who has ever doubted Ingrid Bergman's ability to play comedy only needs to look at "The Bells of St. Mary's". OK, so she is a nun with TB who is surely in love with Fr. O'Malley, (think what Luis Bunuel could have done with it), but she also showed a wonderful joke for fun that made you want instructors to throw her into comedies more often. In "Cactus Flower" she is a stiff dentist nurse, (Walter Matthau is the dentist), in love with her boss, but barely keeps it up. When she is forced to act as her "wife" to hoodwink her mistress (don't ask), she lets loose and pop the buttons. And she's happy to see. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is a harder than regular translation to the screen of a Broadway hit (you can see there are three actions). It is a French farce (it was originally; it is taken from the piece 'Fleur de Cactas' by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Gredy), and it hits all the right spots. Matthau uses her big hanging expression to a wonderful effect and a clutchy blonde beginner, whom she then called Goldie Hawn almost steals the movie as the faint mistress who decides to give up her meal coupon because she feels sorry for the 'wife' even though the 'wife' has a ball. Hawn made such an impression in the role that what she did steals was the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
