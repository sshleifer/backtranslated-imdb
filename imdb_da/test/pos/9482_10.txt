From the opening drum hit by "We're Gonna Groove" to the last guitar hit of "Whole Lotta Love", this two-DVD set can be one of the best music DVDs ever to hit the shelves when Beatles Anthology finally became released earlier this year. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this DVD is the one on disc 1, a whole concert and many TV shows can be found. For example, the entire Royal Albert Hall concert is on DVD, as well as some of the best performances from the band's last concert at Knebworth. In the Royal Albert Hall concert, for example, the band had much room to improvise. Jimmy Page's guitar solos make "Dazed And Confused" a great rock power ballad as opposed to the blues song it was on Led Zeppelin I. <br /> <br /> Next on DVD 2 is a promotional video for Led Zeppelin III hit the song "Immigrant Song". One of Zeppelin's toughest rocking songs, the video is about as sketchy as a pre-MTV video was, but it shows a lot of guitar power by Jimmy Page, as it was taken from a live performance. When the video is finished, we are treated in transition with a short picture of fans filling the seats at Madison Square Garden. Following are performances that should be part of "The Song Remains The Same" but did not make the clip. Excellent riffs like those in the songs "Black Dog" and "The Ocean" were both present. After Madison Performances we are treated with Earl's Court. Most of the Led Zeppelin IV material was played here, as the most popular song Zeppelin has ever recorded, "Stair to Heaven". It is brilliant as always, even more than the version on IV. Finally, End Zeppelin is finally a concert in Knebworth in August 1979 to finish 5 + hours of live material. As the viewer sees this, they have to admit that Robert Plants voice gets harder and deeper from all the screams he has done in the past, and that's clear here. On songs like "Kashmir" and "In the Evening", Plant does not have its vocal boost from the old, but on "Whole Lotta Love" it returns to a more song. of the best musical DVDs ever released, only next to the big "Beatles Anthology" boxed set released earlier in 2003. The sound, both in 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital, like the Beatles DVD, gives you a sense of being on stage with the artists, standing right next to them as you would feel on the Beatles DVD when they collide in the studio. Although the Beatles and Led Zeppelin are different bands, they each received different DVDs. Although this set comes in only two discs compared to the five disc Beatles Set, it still feels a lot to fill the viewer after reviewing all that content. It's also a pleasure to watch over and over, not only because of the sound quality, but because of the clean energy on stage when Robert Plant begins to sing. <br /> <br /> A brilliant effort from the Atlantic.
