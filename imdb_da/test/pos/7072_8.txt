This movie has the courage to suggest that it may be best to just accept your life as it is and continue to smile anyway. As one who is more excited about the idea of ​​taking responsibility for one's life and moving forward, I felt beaten in the face, but it's okay: I don't have to agree with a movie to love it and respect it. Great acting of Streep and Hurt, and everyone else really, and some wonderfully quirky scenes. A serious movie. And take a hanky.
