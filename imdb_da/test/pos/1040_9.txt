Has anyone found a way to buy copies of this series yet? I can see that many people have asked, but I can't tell if any of them have been successful. It is hard to believe that a series this good cannot be seen by humans today, especially one based on real-life problems facing real people during the tense and exciting times of our country. How can that be true and what can we do to change it? As a side, I agree with all the comments made by other authors about this series on this website. This is an excellent story of events that everyone should be aware of and know about today. Many of us saw this series when we were in college or around that time anyway. Now we want to share it with our children ... but we can't? If that is true, what would be some good written materials that would reproduce the same information?
