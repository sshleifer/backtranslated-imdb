Well, not very true to say about this. But it's really good. Very good work from Softley director and the movie has a good cast of plays. Movie plot is also trustworthy and ... hehe good. So the good thing is the most important word in this case. I just hope there would be more of this kind of scifi movie. That is why this is pointed out in the crowd. I give it 8.5 out of 10
