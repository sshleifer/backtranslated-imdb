James Hacker MP does not expect him to be the next prime minister. Unlike in America, the party in Britain is elected while we, Americans, vote for candidates regardless of their party. In spite of the differences, Paul Eddington CBE's ministerial performance was premiered almost overnight by his senior adviser Sir Humphrey, played by another knight, Sir Nigel Hawthorne, and veteran actor Derek Fowlds also returns to the scene. Now, instead of satisfying some people, he must please the land rather than his constituency. Now he has a hard work to do even harder than before. Now he has to approve the honorary list and also work with Her Majesty on a regular basis. Hacker is not the hacking type. He is rather than any man we like and does not want to suffer and become a kind of villain or an evil dictator. Now we see the Prime Minister's point of view and all the pleasant things that must take place, and deal with strikes.
