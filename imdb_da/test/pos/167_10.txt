Blood birthday is playing on a child's presumed innocence and showing them as bloodthirsty monsters. Steven (Andy Freeman), Curtis (Billy Jayne, credited as Billy Jacoby) and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) were all born the same day during an eclipse. Besides sharing a birthday, they also share a love of murder (and they are not picky about who they are killing either). Young Billy, Elizabeth and Andy play those parts of these numb monsters quite well, but they know when to put on the charm. But they can't be fooled all together. This is an exceedingly good scare, it's not too unrealistic, there are a few good moments of excitement, and the kids portrayed the roles well (the adults are quite hammy though). I'd say it's worth seeing (I own a copy myself).
