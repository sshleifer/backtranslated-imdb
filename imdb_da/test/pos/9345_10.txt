"Thriller" is brilliant. It's a long video, but simply brilliant. The song itself is ... excellent ... add Michael JAckson dance and you have a golden phenomenon. Out of all the videos I've ever seen, this is the best. If you haven't seen the video yet, I urge you ... <br /> <br /> The special effects are great for it's time ... everything from the wearwolf transformation to the idea of ​​these creepy zombies slowly rising from their Tombs are grand ... spookishly grand it is. Vicent Price has its segment of bone rays ... known as "rap" Ola Ray does well as Michael's girl and Michael JAckson herself ... the dance and song (although not under the video itself) is unsurpassed ... <br / > <br /> 10/10.
