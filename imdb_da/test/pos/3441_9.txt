I just finished watching the movie for the first time in its entirety (although I saw some parts as it was first shown in Britain in the mid-90s), I really believe in being a masterpiece of the late twenty century cinema. Undoubtedly, a film of this magnitude raises many questions, just as why are there any narrative differences between the 60s Hermann in 'Heimat' and Hermann in this movie? For example, in the first film, Hermann has a relatively significant relationship with his grandfather (he finances Hermann's electronic music), while "Die Zweite ..." only mentions his father until the last episode. <br /> Another point interests me; reads on Edgar Reitz I'm hit by historical similarities between him and Stefan character (spoiler comes) in the last episode it revealed that Stefan has won a prize at the Venice Film Festival (Reitz won a prize for best debut work there for his film "Mahlzeiten "); Reitz's film industry is called 'Edgar Reitz Film Production', and Stephen's name is also named. I am interested in Stefan being autobiographical in nature, because apart from Helga he is probably the smallest of friends. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Stefan is a red herring, I don't know what I know is that I loved this movie and wish more were made like that, with the exception of Michael Haneke's "Cache" and Werner Herzog's "Grizzly Man" is not enough ambition, indecency and passion of this kind in modern cinema. I can't wait to see number 3 now.
