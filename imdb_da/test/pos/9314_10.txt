For many years I have studied all the great directors such as Kurosawa, Lean, Fulci, Lenzi, Deodato, Peckinpah, Kubrick and admire them a lot. My favorite movie is once in America. I have only recently become a fan of D'Amato, and while he was not a horror master, his film was extreme, whether it was soft core, hardcore or extreme. <br /> <br /> Porn Holocaust is now one of my favorite movies, the way its shot is brilliant and the music is eye-catching. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato was not a horror master, he is no Fulci or Bava, but yet he was an erotic gentleman, no other director could shoot erotic movies like him, nor did he try to make any movies outside of these genres either. <br /> <br /> Long Live Joe D'Aamto Master of Porn and Erotica!
