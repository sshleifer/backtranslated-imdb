This surreal, absurd movie is the first movie I have seen of cult Swedish director Roy Andersson. He is a veteran movie player who has made live film films, and only leads four feature films in the last forty years. This background shows: The movie acts as a collection of 50 minutes of arty advertising. There is no story linking these vignettes, although some characters appear in more than one vignette (there is a theme throughout them, though: the absurdity of modern life). Some of the movie's way (with the actors appearing in light white makeup) is more annoying than luminous. Some of the sketches are very small (a man is unsure of which queue to stand?). However, other sketches are better. The best part is the one about rock chicken, who dreams that she goes on a honeymoon with her rock guitarist break in a house that turns something related to a train (you have to see it to get it). A movie worth seeing, though comparisons made by some film critics with such great filmmakers as Keaton, Tati and Kaurismaki seem overwhelmed: Andersson lacks their vision and the lack of a story linking the vignettes is fatal to this film's regret of being a masterpiece.
