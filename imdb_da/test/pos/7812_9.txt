For a minute to pray, another to die, Clay McCord (Alex Cord) is an unhappy crime with a ten thousand-dollar bounty on his head and degenerative epilepsy. <br /> <br /> Realizing his days as a crime is numbered, he will desperately (but somewhat reluctantly) take advantage of an amnesty afforded by the hard and tumbler territorial governor Robert Ryan (excellent performance) who badly desires that McCord should abstain from his ways and accept amnesty as an example to others while in the Bandit hub of Escondito, outlaw Mario Brega plans to kill McCord to stop it. <br /> <br /> Also with Arthur Kennedy, Aldo Sambrell and a lot of other well-known European faces, this is written and produced by (American) spaghetti western pioneer Albert Band, who is also responsible for the pre-Leone movie Gunfight At Red Sands. <br /> <br /> Although the solution to the main character's epilepsy is lifted straight out of Howard Hawks' El Dorado, the script is solid, fairly fresh and inaccurate to us. This has a good balance between action and history, and Alex Cord is great in it. He really should have been a bigger star. To protect the shorter English version: Personally, I'm past the age when the longer version is always the better version and the end, where McCord is ironically surprised by grimy bounty hunters after his excuse, is unnecessarily nihilistic and completely destroys the film's message of hope and redemption. Call me old-fashioned, but I rooted McCord and felt he was making that happy ending!
