This is a low budget stopover movie from Brett (A Nymphoidbarbar in Dinosaur Hell) Piper ... and it just delivers what I would expect from such production: Brilliant (but cheesy) dialogue, some cute actresses and lots of stop motion critters. That's why I've given the movie 10 out of 10 - because it delivers what I expected to deliver ... and a little more: Tray is not penny-pinch when it comes to putting its critters on the screen. He throws lots of bugs at his throw to the finals. And yet, I love stop motion monsters, which, compared to CGI critters in larger budgeted movies, just seems to be so fun to watch.
