Mud and Sand is one of Stan Laurels spoofs of the popular movies at that time, one of Rudolph Valentino's Blood and Sand (hence Stan's Rhubarb Vaselino). Although it was not explained that it was partly inconsistent with characterization (how he defeated the bulls in the beginning, it is not explained), it was mostly fun from the beginning to the end, with one of the best sequences being a dance , he does with his then promising wife, Mae Laurel. Another fun order relates to his reluctance to romanticize a femme fatale, Filet de Sole, while his wife, Caramel, is waiting for him to show some glimpse of his later innocent character with Oliver Hardy. Well worth seeing for everyone interested in seeing Mr. Laurel's early work before his fateful teaming made him popular worldwide.
