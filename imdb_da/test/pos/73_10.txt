Yes, I am a romantic kind who likes musicals and comedies, and it fits the bill! Julie Andrews gives a fascinating performance at the beginning and end of this movie with "Whistling in the Dark" production number. The sederme-to-scandal number she performs in the middle of the story when she thinks Rock Hudson has seen a dancing / calling girl is eye-catching and will surely make you giggle. <br /> <br /> I just want this movie to be in video or DVD, as I probably wanted to buy it in a heartbeat for my home library!
