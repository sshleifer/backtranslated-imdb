Well, what do you know I'm painting my house today and an Elton John song came on the radio, which immediately took me back to this movie, as I saw in 1971. So long ago and so far away. Ten years later, I hiked through France's landside, and I would probably have been eager to see Michelle. The movie is probably not as sophisticated by today's standards, but more is a pity, but it seemed rather racy then. A couple of years later, a successor was created with Michelle, who lives in a high rise in Paris, and Paul comes back to meet her, just as the life they had moved on, the film was very unfortunate. Still, the original was fab, and if you could get a copy, hire it, just remember to blame it and treat it carefully. I notice Americans can be pretty prudish, so notes, scenes and themes might disturb Central America.
