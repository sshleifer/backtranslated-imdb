I was happy to see this gem of a movie available on DVD. Despite being a 'TV movie' and shot at 16mm, it provided a wonderful insight into the different types of people who wanted to become a 'London cabbie' along with their foibles and family responsibilities. Even the most unpleasant candidates, 'Titanic' with his uncomplicated wife, were able to see how Jack Rosenthal was able to make an often fun and sometimes tragic version of London's life for an entertaining 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Originally rewarded as a vehicle for Mick Ford (pun intended), the quality of the actress from an ensemble cast included Michael Elphic, Nigel Hawthorne, Jonathan Lynn, Lesley Joseph, and Maureen Lipman (Mrs Rosenthal ) that Mick might have had top billing, but he had to work hard in the face of such competing talents. <br /> <br /> Even 15 years after its release in 1991, it's still as fresh as ever!
