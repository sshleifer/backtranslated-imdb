There is a good running price for the price of a silk negligee. Bimbo in the office shows the bargain she got for $ 22 (closeup of roof). Later, Mary Astor finds the mark in the master's bedroom (proof that bimbo slept with him). Once again, Mary Astor is having an affair with Ricardo Cortez, watching the price of HER silk negligee ($ 14) and recalling how horrified she was about bimbo, and having spent $ 8 less than the "most obvious "woman she's ever met. It sounds an obvious change of morality, but it was well done. The movie would be stronger if Robert Ames' character had been played by a stronger actor (he is too low for a self-made salesman and he spends most of the movie with his face turned away from the camera) and if Ricardo Cortez had gotten more to do than to smile ironically. Both male wires are bland and forgettable, and are hampered by male pancakes so popular in this film's era. However, Mary Astor's character is interesting, appealing and credible. Behind closed doors is well worth seeing.
