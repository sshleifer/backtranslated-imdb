Although video technology can be dated, this classic musical game, now on DVD, is the best version of Sondheim's most important and polished work on Broadway. If you've never seen SWEENEY TODD, then you need to buy this DVD. I saw this production in November 1980 at the Kennedy Center in Washington - and fell in love with a pre-Murder She Wrote Angela Lansbury. Subsequently I tried to find all his works, among them: FILM: "Harvey Girls", "The Picture of Dorian Gray", "Manchurian Candidate"; CDs: "mame", "dear world" and "gypsy"; and many more. The rest of the molding is also flawless. All in all, this wonderful DVD gives us the final version of Sondheim's opera!
