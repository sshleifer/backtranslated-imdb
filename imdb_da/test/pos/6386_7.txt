An unusual movie that starts with the classic premise of a hooligan who marries a girl who loves him to escape the land. But a twist soon becomes the narrative on the head. Most of the movie hits the right buttons: the story evolves smoothly, the play is solid (Sienna Miller's drawl is invaluable, she can really act!), Chemistry between both driver and rolling American landscape and quirky side characters really make for a good time. The mood, which starts as light and romantic, soon enters into something darker and scary at times. <br /> <br /> Some times, though, the pace slows a little more than we'd like, but don't let this stop you from seeing this unusual little cinematic experience.
