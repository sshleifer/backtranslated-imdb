At the same time, John Russell played ranchers Nathan Burdette and tried to release his no good brother Claude Akins from Sheriff John Wayne in Rio Bravo, where he worked on the other side of the TV law. These years were probably the highlight of Russell's career, his best-known screenplay and his most famous television role, Marshal Dan Troop of Laramie in Lawman. <br /> <br /> Russell kept law and order in Laramie as James Arness did in Dodge City at Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, Laramie never developed all the little characters that gave you the feel of Dodge City at that time. Instead, he focused on Russell to take care of business and learn the law for his keen young substitute Peter Brown. <br /> <br /> Brown played substitute Johnny McKay, who was a most respectful young man who constantly referred to his boss as Mr. Troop. He was pretty handy with a shooting iron, but tended to be impulsive. The good series Marshal Troop was around. <br /> <br /> The second series was regular Kitty Russell of Laramie, Lily played by Peggie Castle. It was here that Lawman looked most like Gunsmoke. There was an unspoken understanding between Russell and Castle that even the smallest children could not have missed. And I was not the smallest of children when Lawman was in the first place. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Peggie Castle developed drug abuse problems after Lawman's race ended. I remember a small death sentence marked her passing in the first half of the seventies. She was a beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> Lawman was good, no nonsense western from the golden era of the adult television western. It was one of the best.
