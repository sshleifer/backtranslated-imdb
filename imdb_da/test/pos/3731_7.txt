I saw this today with a little background on what one might expect from the story. I go to movies as an escape, leave everything behind and enjoy a "story". I found this to be a good movie, not great but good. It was worth my money and tears :) <br /> <br /> Diane Lane was amazing as always, Richard Gere is not an over-actor. He kept his own and has a certain presence that we always expect. He brings his own style to the movie. <br /> <br /> I think it was the kind of love story that's not always told. It was messy and they had other priorities, but they wanted to be together and would wait for each other. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend it!
