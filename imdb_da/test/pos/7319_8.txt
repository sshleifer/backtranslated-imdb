Although I'm not a big fan, I'm a Three Stooges purist. I think their best work was far curled like the third Stooge, and their earliest movies are generally their best. This is because after a while they began to reuse their films and the gags began to become obsolete. Here in 1934 they were still quite fresh (in more ways than one) and fun. <br /> <br /> Here, boys play very unlikely roles - respected doctors in a hospital! The three running amok seems stupid, hitting each other and frightening the pants of anyone who expects to improve. The uninterrupted energy and freshness make this a must-see for fans. <br /> <br /> By the way, though I liked this movie, I highly recommend trying to find a much lesser known map from little educational pictures. NIFTY NURSES is much like men in black, but manages to be more fun and is about the oldest hospital comedy - better than Laurel & Hardy's COUNTY HOSPITAL.
