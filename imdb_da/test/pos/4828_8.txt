This work is rather atmospheric, with a few surprises a few really scary elements. I found this work more rewarding than I first expected, given the rotten reviews received here on IMDb. The dialogue comes across as natural and honest (given the circumstances), although the film's overall round goes from predictable to cliché with heroes falling down when they are driving and exploring strange sounds when they have to lock their doors. Typical horror movie fare. <br /> <br /> The local characters are some of the worst clichés depicting appalachian natives as in-breed developmentally challenged freaks. The child's and director's characters are great! The given development is sufficient and Scout Taylor-Compton seems to develop his talents quite well. <br /> <br /> Now I don't want to say that this is completely original or the best since the slices (which are not so great by the way), but it is interesting and I don't long for my 107 minutes back. I didn't want to say that this is a great movie in any way, but there are some really good horror elements in it. But there are also some really slow spots where plot / character development seems superfluous to the instructor's (or movie editor's) incidence. All in all, it's good for a rainy night, but not so good for a Friday / Saturday night view. <br /> <br /> It bets a 7.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
