If you go to the cinema to be entertained, amused, to fill your time, do not go out of your way to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you go to the cinema to appreciate the depths of human emotions, the emotions of real people, to explore the characteristics of the personality, if you go to the cinema to record magnificent photography, be sure to put this movie very high on your list, preferably in the first place. Experience is deeply rewarding, which makes the intelligent viewer make different reflections on life itself. With 'Mar Adentro', Alejandro Amenábar has surpassed the best he has done to date, and even redeemed some discrepancies in his previous film, which tasted a bit of being targeted at Hollywood. This is not the case with this visual poem set to music: Hollywood could never get anywhere near the effect of this dazzling inspired human and humane story. <br /> <br /> In no way should you interpret 'Mar Adentro' as an excuse for euthanasia This story, based on the real life of Galician fishing society Ramón Sampedro, is a cry from the bottom of the heart of life and love , an extension to human compassion, to understand emotions. Sampedro was an articulated and intelligent man who, after a diving accident off the Galician coastal rocks as a young man, was condemned to live the next 27 years in bed. 'Condenado a vivir' (2001) (TV) was the first version of this man's life that I have already commented on. But Amenábar has remarkably depicted this man with his permanent enigmatic smile and witty sense of humor in an equally articulate and intelligent way. <br /> <br /> And Javier Bardem rose to the occasion, met the challenge head -on, complete with a Galician accent, producing an electrifying, compelling, captivating performance, so that the actor and the fisherman merged to be the same person on screen. Here is actually an opportunity to make your cap, and soft muffle 'chapeau'. Bardem is driven by his grand cast, in particular Belén Rueda, Lola Dueñas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo (qv) and Clara Segura, Galician and Catalan accents who take prominent role. <br /> <br /> Amenábar produces wonderful dialogues as these six rotate individuals or in groups of outstanding chemistry, showing that this young Chilean-Spanish director is an artist who knows what he is and how to gets his results his global concept of the film contains his own music, mixed with pieces of Beethoven and Puccini on Sampedro's record player. <br /> <br /> While looking at 'Mar Adentro', I found myself comparing him and this movie a few times with Stephen Daldry and his masterpiece 'The Hours' (qv). I refer to the way in which the dialogues work with patience and passion and the meticulous sense of timing in each scene. <br /> <br /> Javier Aguirresarobe's photography is amazing as usual. As I mentioned elsewhere on IMDb, he not only films the events and scenes - he captures emotions and the atmosphere at the moment, catches his eyes, lights and shadows, so his work behind the camera is at once another player in history. An amazing artist. 'Mar Adentro' is another landmark in the history of Spanish cinema, among the best five or six works of art produced in the last 25 years. This film is next to such film art as' El Sur '(qv),' Los Santos Inocentes' (qv), 'El Abuelo' (qv), 'La Lengua de las Mariposas' (qv),' Las Ratas' qv, 'A Los Que Aman' (qv), and I think I should add 'Te Doy Mis Ojos' (qv). <br /> <br /> Excellent orchestrated story of a real man and those who loved him around his bed: not to be missed.
