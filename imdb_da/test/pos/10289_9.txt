This is a smart story of relationships and a display of three main categories of players in the relationship: playboys (Max), manipulative women (Alice) and the fools who may be in love (Lisa, Muriel and Lucien). <br /> <br /> Max and Alice are very unlikeable and perhaps despicable characters, but always in control of the game leaving their partners around in the dark. But as the much-known ending tells us, as veteran players like Max and Alice were, they would be happy to share roads at any time, as they might seem, as if the game was only announced to be over and each one of them could not fit less to get on with his own life and play another game with some other anonymous people when another opportunity presented. Lisa, Muriel and Lucien could be the ones who felt investing something right in a relationship, only being able to realize that they were the bait in the game and the ultimate losers (as far as what we showed was concerned .... Who knows if they are also advanced players of some kind in their worlds not shown on us on the screen. <br /> <br /> This is a very fast, delicately crafted and seductive witty story with a tempting execution of the cast. It also deserves a deeper thinking: How much is genuine in a game of relationships?
