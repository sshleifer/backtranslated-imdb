Check out the first 20 minutes even if the excitement has not yet kicked in. We get a good look at the super-secret Los Alamos just a few years after the big boom test that helped the end of World War II. Apart from the tight security, it seems uncomfortable enough. Notice how it is a TV repairman, an obvious regular guy who takes us through security. Once in a while it is like any city-US, cozy home, quiet streets, children going to school and a family TV on the flash. Later we see a little Tommy and little Peggy frolicking along the streets lined with stunningly beautiful facilities separated by locked gates. The movie seems to say, "Okay, we're hard, just because we have to be. But basically we're just people." <br /> <br /> Now, I expect it was a comforting message to the Cold War audience who are still not accustomed to the government's "doomsday" research. It is a clear effort for popular reassurance. The one darker note is when Tommy's mother (Clarke) cares about her son's mental state. He doesn't say, "When I grow up"; instead, it is "if I grow up". The doubt about doubts not only reflects a Los Alamo's reality, but also a national who in 1952 had just seen pictures of the apocalyptic H-bomb. Also note how professional FBI agents are portrayed, a standard feature of McCarthy's era fare. When brutal force is needed, it is not them, but private citizen Gene Barry who disseminates the information? An early version, I assume, about the modern era "tradition". When the kidnapping occurs excitement does not give up. The scheme is handled nicely with colorful LA sites that keep us guessing. The climatic scenes around the cliff dwellings may not be plausible as a hiding place, but the view of northern New Mexico is great. The old stone apartments also form one of the more exotic backgrounds of the decade. Also note the extensive use of police helicopters that only come into use as law enforcement tools. Among an otherwise subdued cast, Nancy Gates remains a sparkling presence as a teacher Ellen Haskell. Never Hollywood glamorous, she was still a fine usung actress and winning personality. I also expect this to be one of director Hopper's more successful film efforts, and although people have been accustomed to the nuclear test, the film is still a revealing and accurate document of its time.
