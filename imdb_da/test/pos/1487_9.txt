This TV series is about a foolish and unconventional English gentleman who stands up for all kinds of happy mishaps. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing Mr Bean with my family back in 1990 when I was still a kid. My family laughed so hard at each episode, and its contents still come up in our daily conversations 20 years later. The memorable scenes still in my head include Mr Bean, who tries to get out of his parking lot, shoot the lights, count sheep and him in the pool. We bought all Mr Bean videos on VHS, no mater how expensive they were. It was worth it because we saw them again and again! It is so rare to see a very fun TV series that suits all ages.
