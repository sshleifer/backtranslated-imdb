78 years ago ... the premiere of "Anna Christie" announced by the slogan "Garbo Talks!" The movie runs for 16 minutes and the viewers reach the highlight: Greta enters the bar and gets through a long awaited transfer from silence to sound: a few seconds closes her quiet era and finally Greta Garbo says a historical line: "Gimme a whiskey, ginger ale on the side and don't be clever, baby! " <br /> <br /> "Anna Christie" (1930) is the film by Clarence Brown who introduced a great quiet star Greta Garbo to talkies. Today, we can only imagine what serious transfer it was to actors and actresses. Many careers were bound to end - something we hardly ever see at this time. And it was no coincidence that it was Clarence Brown who directed the first talkie with the Swedish beauty. Garbo trusted the director after two of his great silent productions, FLESH AND THE DEVIL (1926) and A WOMAN WOMAN (1928): film that achieved an excellent success at the ticket office, both with Garbo in the lead. <br /> <br /> But we are in 2008, and the fact about the movie, which is now purely historical, seems to be of minor importance. The question for today's viewer is not what Garbo's voice sounds like, but if the film can still be seen after these 78 years. In other words, we all strive to answer the question whether the film has been a time test. Do i have it? <br /> <br /> When I recently looked at it, I came to the conclusion that "Anna Christie", with the exception of some minor technical aspects, including static camera, is still very entertaining. It is, on the one hand, a wonderful story of a life, a reality that the young woman faces (based on Eugene O'Neil's play), and on the other, an artistic manifestation of true greatness in the direction and action. Let me analyze these two aspects in separate sections. <br /> <br /> CONTENTS: Chris Christopherson (George F Marion), a heavy drinker, lives the life of a sailor on a barge. is full of sorrows, he is comforted by a letter from his daughter, Anna (Garbo), whom he has not seen for 15 years. She says she will come back to him, he begins to change too much, but forgets that his daughter is no longer a child who lacks experience, but a 23-year-old woman who has undergone various kinds of things on a farm in Minneapolis where she lived and worked. He also forgets that she has the right to accept another kind of male love in her life ... This short presentation of the content not from the perspective of the main chara cter but the one introduced to us earlier than Anna (her father Chris) make you realize how universal it is. It is simply no letter from the entire text that life seems to have been deleted after all these years. Cases discussed here in 1930 are still meaningful and valid ... PERFORMANCE. There are not many characters in the movie, but there are two that really shine in the roles. Of course, Greta Garbo herself did something extraordinary in her 15-year-long phenomenon, the presence that marked the story of early cinema (something I have already discussed in many of my previous comments on her film). But here is Garbo a little different. I admit there are moments in this movie when she doesn't feel very comfortable with her role. It seems to be caused by her new experience with sound in English; Her performance is, as always, genuine and unique. But that's what everyone has expected from Garbo. The true surprise of the movie for the 1930s and also for us is Marie Dressler as Marthy. She is excellent in her facial expression, in her accent, throughout the depiction of a drinking woman who sees life from the perspective of "framing the bottle". Her best moments include the conversation with Anna Christie at the bar prior to her hilarious talk with Chris. The rest of the support shock is fine, but not big at all (here the German version suggests). Especially Dressler, except for Garbo himself, makes a completely flawless choice. <br /> <br /> If you asked me what I think about "Anna Christie" today, that's what I want to tell you: it's a classic movie. But there is one more thing I must mention at the end. It's humor, wonderful white that is noticeable throughout. Although the content is quite serious and "Anna Christie" in no way carries a comic spirit (the only Garbo's comedy was NINOTCHKA), there are such moments when you want to share your pages. Don't skip for example Anna and Matt's visit to the amusement park, especially at the restaurant where he orders milk for her to think about how virtuous and innocent she is, beer for herself and how suddenly Marthy connects them by chance ... < br /> <br /> "Anna Christie" is a perfect movie for classic buffs, and a must see for everyone at least a little bit interested in the true grandeur of performance. If you are tired of many of the modern starlets, look for such movies and be content. Very much appreciated your search! <br /> <br /> Scale Greta Garbo! Scale Marie Dressler! Let's drink a bowl for the big jobs you did in the movie! After all these years, when wine tastes much better and your spirits are with us in a different sense ...
