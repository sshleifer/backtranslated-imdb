This movie was a heart-felt piece of cinema that helped show the darker side of childhood, and the little things that shaped who Tom Hank was. Using a very cryptic story, they could give you an idea of ​​what really happened to Tom Hank's character as a child. And while scenes like the flying machine may never have been the case, it helped show how even denial can help tell the truth. In all good conscience I could not judge this lower than a 9 out of 10, amazing performances by all the actors, and while many might not have understood the cryptic end where the brother is murdered by his stiff, and Tom Hanks covers it up to Use a removed story of a flying machine, pay attention to the small details that the turtle he still has, even though his brother "flew" with it. Really a beautiful piece of cinema, and every actor deserves recognition for it.
