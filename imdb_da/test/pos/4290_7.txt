Separate LIES changed my life. In fact, Q & A. did <br /> <br /> SPOILERS UNDER. Read only if you see trailers or if you have already seen it: <br /> <br /> Emily Watson character cheats on Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy dog ​​eye Emily was "It's Over. Dump her. Bad riddance." For some reason he stuck. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. At times he had to leave. But he stuck to her and let her live her life. But I still wanted to see her <br /> <br /> Subsequently, Julian, writer and director talked about the movie. I am glad he did, because I am honest, I am for you and was too immature to get the point before he broke it down for me. <br /> <br /> Tom's character loved her, and no matter how much her pursuit of her needs disagreed with what he wanted, he would always love her. The relationship and the love they shared was not a lie, suddenly, just because she wanted to be with someone else. The fact that she would be with someone else did not make her like she was. When you get past fifty, there is a great chance of finding the love in your life not going around again so you can't be as dismissive as you were when you were younger. You have to try to make things work because the alternative can be much worse. <br /> <br /> She needed what she needed and she couldn't help it. He had to learn to get rid of her if he were to be the full man he could be. He helped her in pursuit of her lover, even when it hurt him. <br /> <br /> Another thing: Julian said the strongest tool for a controller is to blame. <br /> <br /> Again: The strongest tool of a controller is to blame. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Tom released her from her burden. He felt a need to let her know he loved her, but not to get her back; He wanted to let her know she didn't have to feel guilty or think badly about the relationship just because it ended in such a terrible way. It is not my way of reviewing a movie based on the message rather than the performance, especially when I understand this message better when explained by the director, but I make an exception here as I feel more mature than I would enjoy of watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The performance of the film production was a nice, British pace. Rupert was slim and disgusting. Tom and Emily were their usually solid, real characters.
