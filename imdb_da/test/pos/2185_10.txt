George Hearn really went out and over the top, which in this case was amazing. I've heard the Len Cariou version, but it was too pretty. George was great in that character - very expressive. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury was perfect for that. She gave a good performance. She gave Mrs Lovett a great obscene and comical personality that balanced the dark history. <br /> <br /> I love the dark humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and George's angry feelings Hearn in his songs of rage, revenge and distress. <br /> <br /> I've seen this game 20 times since 1985 when I saw it at PBS. I bought it on video (after copying it in 1985 alone) when it came out in 1990, and I certainly bought a copy of the DVD when it came out in 2004.
