Transcendental, sophisticated, incisive, emotional, powerful ... I could think of a hundred adjectives to describe this amazing work of art and intelligence, and I would still feel they were inadequate. All I can really say is that I'm horrified by this movie. Applause for Krzysztof Kieslowski, Zbigniew Preisner, Ir√®ne Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant. May "Rouge" lives forever.
