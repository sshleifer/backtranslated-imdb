Personally, I can only but agree with Stephen-12: indulge. There really is no point in trying to "catch" this movie. I like movies where nothing (explicitly) happens. Herzog's 'Aguirre, who Zorn Gottes' has the same thing, though that movie is less convincing, as the climaxes are right at the beginning of history, so Herzog should focus on nature against Kinski. Morte a Venezia, however, is completely different, as it has several climaxes, turns etc. In fact, from the point where Aschenbach's luggage is lost, the film films almost to its final (his final sand grains begin to run through hourglass after the moment of happiness, where he fantasizes to warn the Polish family and caress Tadzo's hair). <br /> <br /> You can, if you like, search for some real tracks / symbols in it (he tries to leave behind his luggage from the moment he arrives, it points Tadzio at the end, the fact that in the entire movie's content and form is entirely in sinc), but there is no point in doing this: it will not make the film better or worse, as its power lies in the whole of the underwear of storylin, which is never made explicit. Tons of history, decaying Europe, the end of the "romantic era" that we have come to know of what has proved to be only the beginning of it (individual emotions and expressions are more important now than they ever were). But wait, now I myself started to develop one minor (small) error in the movie: 'Let's talk about art' parts. Now there is one thing to never do. I myself think that it could have been expressed in other ways. Besides, I think it will be very clear in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I don't like explicit movies. I can read books so I don't want a story that just speaks for my reasoning. I prefer movies that you can't explain in words, but only in movies (Lynch's Lost Highway, Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock and Roeg's Man, who fell to the ground also belongs to this category), because then and then only it has a reason to exist as a movie and not just as a book. So what about Thomas Mann's novella? I never read it, but forget it! The film gives a different viewpoint: it says things you can never say in a book. It uses the movie art to make you feel, through pictures and music, the same as Man made you feel, using text. Just brilliant, but different worlds.
