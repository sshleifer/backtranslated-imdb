As a child, I loved the song "Never Smile on a Crocodile" and if I found myself in this situation that is actually inspired by true events. Smiling would be the last thing in my mind. From the opening setup I have never been so anchored, trapped and finally exhausted as I was when I looked at this limited budget Independent Australian Horror movie, about three people in northern territory trapped in a mangrove swamp with a very creeping crocodile waiting in the water under them. What really brought the film to life was how realistically it managed to transport fear and uncertainty about the characters' situation to the audience. Semi-documentary camera work with an eerie scary background and authentic performances effectively pulls you out of your comfort zone. What we get is a patient survival story than just a bloody, all-out creativity onslaught. Think of "Open Water (2003)", where the budget and time constraints made it stay low, but this minimal barrier improved the experience. The slow-grinding story can be black and white, but it never seemed to be disposable, or succumb to formal patterns. Well not to a large extent, and the connection between the characters was emotionally engaging even with a mere straightforward script. Although you can say "less is more", with actions and expressions that illuminate the lingering thoughts that plague their minds. The test is totally scary because the threat is very vivid and never seems to loosen. That is what drives the film's chaotic adrenaline and where it lasts (even when kept buried) in the end. <br /> <br /> Writers / Directors Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich's financial guidance promotes and clever strings along the viewer with its tight pacing and harrowing psychological features. In some spots the notch goes up, with pressure-induced voltage and exciting images. The way the night sequence is performed is incredibly chilling and vibrant. The threatening crocodile-manipulating toy with its fresh meat in a distressingly exciting approach. Of course, some moments felt unlikely, but it never gets in the way or distracted. Sound FX is the key, and at times the lack of something is just eaten away at you. Rafeal Mays musical score is modest and does not go much into the mix, but when it does, it builds an organic sound quality. The movie of John Biggins is beautifully crafted and quickly aggressive when the mood changes. It was always on the move and claustrophobic, but none of these jerky movements. The editing was handled sharply, and the effect was professionally high quality by fighting live live crocodile films. <br /> <br /> Something like this production would also have to rely on its caste to sell to the story in a credible way and they do it. Diana Glenn, Andy Rodoreda and especially Maeve Dermody are convincingly good. Much responsibility lies on Dermody, and she delivers strongly with an inspired trip. Now, this topic may compare to another killer crocodile movie "Rogue (2007)", but the two could not be different in what they want to be and how they end. If I had to choose myself, I would lean more towards this excursion for its pure commitment to snatching on you. <br /> <br /> A remarkable effort on all fronts where everyone involved has the potential to really look.
