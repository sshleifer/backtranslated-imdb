In 'Hoot', Logan Lerman plays Roy Eberhardt, the new child in school who just moved from Montana. But Florida is very different from Montana. Despite trouble mixing in, Roy discovers a bigger problem. A new franchise restaurant comes to town, and families with grassland are in trouble. Can the new child, a tomboy (Brie Larson) and a path (Cody Linley) stop big business from destroying these owls' homes? <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty good. The kids (Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley) are the real stars of this movie. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) is okay, but really doesn't have a very big part. Nor is Robert Wagner (Mayor) or Jimmy Buffett (Mr. Ryan). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it was a fun movie that the whole family will enjoy. For a first-time producer, I thought Jimmy Buffett put together a good job. Plus the owls were really cute.
