This film is a benchmark in non-mainstream cinema history. The use of montage represents a quantum leap from the relatively simple side positions of Strike (Eisenstein's 1st film). Take the stage on the stairs and note the repeated shot of the soldiers down, to repeat the point on the horrors that actually happened! A very intelligent monumental movie, a must see for all movie students!
