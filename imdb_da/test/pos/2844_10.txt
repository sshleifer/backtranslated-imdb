I have seen 'nurse betty' twice in September 2000 at the international film festival 'movie by the sea' in vlissingen, Dutch. It impressed me so much that I continued to smile all day after seeing it for the first time and almost all evening, when I took the film as the final taste of the festival. In short, what I knew about 'nurse betty' was that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap opera star. But what I saw was much more than that! Excellent roles for morgan freeman, chris rock and renée zellweger. A strange mix of romance, violence and roadmovie. And for everyone a story that takes other directions every moment you think you're on the track. Many soap opera lovers will love the 'netty betty' movie and the character !!! - but they can bring all those non-soap friends, because they will enjoy the story even more for the harsh and humorous lines - freeman and rock - for the horrific scenes, thriller aspects and beautiful images. And I'm absolutely sure that in the end everyone will love 'nurse betty' for her captivating and innocent charm !!!
