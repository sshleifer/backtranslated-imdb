Cary Elwes must say a better performance when Costner did in RHPOT, yet. <br /> <br /> Must say this movie, it just makes me laugh a lot because the actors really look what they are doing and you just sit there thinking "what the hell are they at" but at a very much very good way. The random outbreaks of songs were brilliant and good, and the musical score I used really really well. Big casting and as before, before everyone seemed to be in their roles <br /> <br /> 10/10 from me tired <br /> <br /> Because unlike some other Robin Hoods.I can speak to an English accent'
