Pitch Black is a survival story. It's about how to survive in a hostile alien world against even more enemy enemies. The task becomes even more difficult when the closest enemies can be found in your own surviving group. The plot of Pitch Black is quite common and has been seen several times before in various variations. But what makes this movie shine over others is the well-written character. The group consists of very different people with few more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot who has a hard time with his own conscience; Johns, a bounty hunter with a fabric habit; Imam, a holy man, faces the fact that sometimes God is cruel, and Riddick, a prisoner and a killer learns to value others, not just himself. Signs begin to live in the movie. They are not just paper as in many other films of this genre. You start to take care of the characters, especially for Riddick, even though it feels quite strange. He was supposed to be the bad guy. In this film, the line between light and white is very thin. All signs are familiar with both. <br /> <br /> Other works in this movie are casting. Rarely do the actors fit their roles well. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelty and responsibility to John's. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does good work as Riddick. In his hands, Riddick is absolutely scary, absolutely very dangerous and also deep in character, just as he should be. So how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and enemies even closer.
