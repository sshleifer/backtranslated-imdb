Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford <br/> <br /> Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> John Ford brings the stock company into the Utah desert to film a western and come out with this smaller classic. No John Wayne, no conflicted hero, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture. <br /> <br /> This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (like Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They are horse dealers coming into town to do something, just like a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, being shown the exit. The group is starting a trip to their own settlement, but they know the odds and the hard terrain is against them. So they hire Travis and Sandy as truck drivers for their journey. Along the way they enter and take with a travel medicine salesman and his two female cohorts (Alan Mowbray as a doctor reminiscent of his appearance in My Darling Clementine and Joanne Dru as his "daughter"). Tension is added when the murderous Clegg gang comes on the lane. And there is also an atypical (for Hollywood) meeting with Navajo. <br /> <br /> Most of the story and humor is driven by clashes between ideals / cultures; first between Travis and Sandy and Mormons, between Ward Bond himself (he constantly tries to suppress his urge to curse and be a reformed man), between the doctor and his ladies and the Mormons, between the lorry and the criminals, and finally, all and Navajo. There is also a classic Ford scene in a robust dance that expresses one of his signature themes of civilization that comes to the limit. Here is no Duke here, but I have found Ben Johnson, especially the young, cluster Ben Johnson, to have an engaging screen presence of his own. He comes with his own backstory, with the drawl and also when you see him do the whole stunt that runs himself. He is amazing here in one of his early credited appearances. Harry Carey Jr., although he has been in a couple of years at this time, is still pretty rough at times, but he's sympathetic. Ward Bond is his usual fantastic, blustery self. I have found Joanne Dru to be a trait in what I see her in, but here she is mercifully discreet. Other well-known faces include Jane Darwell, Francis Ford and Hank Worden who play "stupid" as he wants in The Searchers a few years later. It's no more fun here. <br /> <br /> There are some spectacular b & w photography of frequent Ford partner Bert Glennon. Not only is there the typical masterclass on landscapes and horizons, there are also some blossoms in a handful of scenes with shade and (sun) light. The soundtrack has the legendary country music group, Pioneer's Sons. Can't get more cowboy than that. <br /> <br /> *** Â½ out of 4
