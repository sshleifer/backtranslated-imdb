We all know bits and pieces of Gulliver's travels. Small people, yes. Liliputians. Giants too, some of us can remember. Some may remember the word yahoo coming from here. That's where it stops for most people. <br /> <br /> Swift's book is ubiquitous in school libraries. It was when I first read it and there were many who read it for the last time. It is treacherously easy to write, like many of the old adventure books. Children can read it. Still drinking it with satire, black and uncompromising. That's something I think most screenwriters forget when adapting this movie. <br /> <br /> However, this movie remembers. Our hero, Ted Danson, gives a credible and serious achievement as the world-adjusted man who is thrown to mysterious countries resembles our own. Gulliver's travels criticize everything. Theories, scientists, government, common people, ethnicity, humanity itself. Few have been saved, and most of the satire is just as fresh today. <br /> <br /> While it is very faithful in history, one also dares to add new angles that all work really well. The screenwriter deserves all honesty to steer to balance so well between time and activity (it's not boring it is). <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are far beyond a television movie. With some marketing, this movie would have done well at the box office. All the amazing worlds Gulliver visits are well-presented, explained in detail and often very fun, like Swift's book. <br /> <br /> Actors are all benefits as this is a British production. Mary Steenburgen stands out with James Fox's dr. Bates, the chillingly cruel physician who, like Ratched, only wants the best of the patient. So a modest suggestion, if you ever get the chance to get this movie, do it. It's a real treat.
