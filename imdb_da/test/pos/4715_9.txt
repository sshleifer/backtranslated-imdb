A holiday to Burma with her sister seemed like a good idea to get away from it all, but when the pass was stolen in Rangoon, she could not leave the country with her sister and was forced to remain until she could get I.D. papers from the US Embassy. To fill a day before she could fly out, she took a tour of the country with a tour guide. "I tried to find something in these stone statues, but nothing touched me. I was stone myself." <br /> <br /> Suddenly, hell broke loose and she was caught in a political uprising. Just as it looked as though she had fled and safely boarded a train, she turned her tour guide off and shot. For a split second, she decided to jump off the running train and try to save him without thinking of herself. Still, her life was in danger. <br /> <br /> Here is a woman who demonstrated spontaneous, selfless charity that risks her life saving another. Patricia Arquette is beautiful and not just to look at; She has a beautiful heart This is an unforgettable story. <br /> <br /> "We are taught that suffering is the only promise life always holds."
