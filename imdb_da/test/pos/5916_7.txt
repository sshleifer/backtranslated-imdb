From director Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, The Seven Year Itch, Some Like It Hot), I can see that this is a bit of an understated and underrated movie, one to watch. This is the biographical story of Charles Augustus 'Slim' Lindbergh (James Stewart), who in 1927 wanted to be the first man to cross travel solo flight from New York, crossing the Atlantic, to reach Paris in a small cockpit. The first half hour or whatever Lindbergh is allowed to do, and the construction of the aircraft called "St. Louis Spirit" and make all necessary preparations. Then of course the rest of his perilous journey over the journey, overcomes fatigue, near fuel loss and moments to lose direction, but he succeeded. Also contributing to Murray Hamilton as Bud Gurney, Patricia Smith as Mirror Girl, Bartlett Robinson as Benjamin Frank Mahoney, Robert Cornthwaite as Harry Knight, Sheila Bond as Model / Dancer, Marc Connelly as Father Hussman, Arthur Space as Donald Hall, Harlan Warde as Boedecker and Dabb's Greer as Goldsborough. Apparently Lindbergh was a little younger, so Stewart was a shade too old to play him, but then again one can't think of anyone else who could do better. It's a witty and emotional drama, with Stewart (as always) fantastic, great music score by Frank Waxman, and good direction from Wilder, a good little known gem. It was nominated Oscar for best special effects (the only prize it was ever nominated). James Stewart was number 12 at The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was 3rd in 100 years, 100 stars - men, and he was number 13 in the world's greatest actor. Very good!
