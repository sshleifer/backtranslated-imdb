Admittedly, before I saw the House of Wax, I assumed that it would simply be another class of low quality teen slasher movies that follow in the footsteps of such films as The Darkness or Amityville Horror. After getting an advanced view on my college campus, I can honestly say that the people at Dark Castle have done an excellent job in the task of making a slasher. <br /> <br /> Begin with the usual staples of a teenage horror movie as the small group of friends departing on a road trip that comes across a strange detour that takes them through country roads that face creepy locals after slow But mandatory back-story this movie really reaches a quick clip. Paris Hilton appears in this movie that many already know, but I really have to give it to her for her ballsy performance. It was clear that her acting was not worth an Oscar, but the filmmakers use her look completely by squeezing two blatant satirs of her, let's just say, less noble media look in this movie. Ms Hilton also claims the title of the biggest death movie in the movie and not just because it was her death scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with scary moments and cheap scares, but Jaume Serra has certainly created quality excitement and excitement between characters. The causes of horror are partly based on making the audience aware of the signs that we do. By following the usual structure with a loud sound and shaking the camera some other scary moments. These standard film techniques, adopted from many film scenes, are almost perfected with this film and provide many good scares. In fact, there is not a slow moment after coming to the small town where the dreaded House of Wax museum is. <br /> <br /> This movie owes much to many previous films of this and other genres, although I'm not quite sure how much came from the original 1953 movie with the same title. Referrals to movies like both Texas Chainsaw Masacres, Saw and even Titanic, (see Paris Hilton's great death scene and you know what I mean) are common, but ultimately, the payout will leave you scared and fulfilled if you are looking for a good scare with a few laughs. Not bad.
