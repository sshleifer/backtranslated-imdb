I just saw "Checking Out" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. What a great combination of a heart-breaking story and a great cast. Director Jeff Hare has done an excellent job of inviting the audience in the incoherent yet hilarious world of Morris Applebaum and the family. The family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy the crazy antics, but feel the real pain and worry they have for each other. <br /> <br /> I'm not typically a Peter Falk fan, but he's Morris Applebaum and plays the role of great humor and humanity. I hope everyone will see this wonderful movie and enjoy it as I did. <br /> <br /> Hats off to the director, Cast, and Crew for a job well done!
