This is a wonderfully gritty drama with detailed information on the various aspects of the international heroin trade - from the hills of northern Pakistan, where the tacitly permitted cultivation of opium poppies occurs to a large extent; to jetsetting "Euro-Trash" in Germany and England, arranging imports of processed heroin into smuggled multi-kilo consignments to end users trapped on the web of addiction and the crime needed to support their growing habit and finally all levels of international government corruption and hypocrisy about police efforts to control the "drug problem" --- this drama is outlined with a wide range of in-depth rounded characters, full-fledged plot and outstanding character <br /> <br /> This puts Hollywood epics like "The French Connection" in their place! Traffic is a deeply thought-provoking and exciting story of modern drug-related espionage, and many people's international efforts to disappear. <br /> <br /> Contrary to many "criminal dramas" dealing with drugs, Traffik focuses strongly on identifying the societal causes * that people are slipping into drug abuse. As one of the signs puts it ". .. until we as a community build a world that people want to participate in, rather than get away from, we will not be able to stop people from taking medicine ... "<br /> <br / > This is a fascinating and full-blown drama. I highly recommend it!
