This was a very strong look at prejudice and group morality. Cast is composed of amazing actors doing a remarkable work. The sets are beautiful and just a little stylized. The art direction is top notch along with great filmography. The story is tight and shows how prejudice and bigotry can flourish easily. It is disturbing to its realistic violence and protocol of a fairly typical society. I was very impressed.
