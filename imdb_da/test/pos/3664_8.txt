Have you ever wondered what it's like to feel free? I am sure that each of us knows the importance of freedom and never seriously thinks about using it for our benefit. HARI OM shows the audience what freedom actually means. In this film, freedom is described in the form of style represented by Ises' discovery of India. Isa discovers her inner true love when she is in a Rickshaw journey with Mr. HARI OM. She looks at life differently and depicts freedom that every woman limits herself when she is in a relationship. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth a visit and I saw this for the first time at the Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF) and I left the cinema with complete satisfaction. <br /> <br /> "Watch it"!
