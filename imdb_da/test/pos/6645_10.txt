First of all, the story is not as simple as many previous reviewers have a tendency to emphasize. In fact, it's a very complex story, unlike Bergman's other films that are more bent on character studies. In the Shame we have two main characters, but when we are thrown from the start in the middle of a war, we have no idea who is fighting and why, everything is open to any decision. This creates a tremendous excitement and makes each event meaningful. As the story unfolds, we introduce too many characters that are converted into symbols of humanity, both its dark and luminous sides. We have the example of the innocent spectators trying to pass by during an absurd war, the cynical doctor who makes fun of his patients and gives the only bitter humor in the whole movie, the perverse opportunists trying to make the best of it a terrifying adventure (the character of the bear stars), the innocent dead children, the nameless figures almost became animals from the boat, etc. All of them are somehow seen through the eyes of Jan (von Sydow) and Eva (Ulmann), their characters is more sustained then in other Limman films (A Passion), and that is precisely because this is the story of how external events have the capacity to radically change human nature. Bergman made this film two years after Persona, where the most important conclusion expressed by the only word pronounced by Liv Ulmann's character is NOTHING, nothing. That's it: the meaning of art and the meaning of life, the latter is nothing but a game that includes all plays. But what about war? And especially the devastating of the XX century. In Persona, the only real feeling that suffers from Ulmann's character when she sees a victim of the Vietnam War is transformed into a human torch. In the Shame, this idea is extended to a complex analysis of the dehumanizing character of the war. In an nameless region in a nameless country (we assume only that is Sweeden) two factions speak the same language struggle an absurd war. Jan and Eva are two dreamers trapped in the middle, but their dreams are woven into a kind of counterweight. Jan is first an idealist who cannot respond properly to the world and a subject for his wife's will. Towards the end, he becomes a radically different personality, capable of unmotivated murder, strong will, unmerciful. (Beware of the suicide on the boat. The simplicity of the actions is appalling). On the other hand, Eva continually loses her reality, and at the end she is completely suffused in her own unfulfilled dream. From a technical point of view, the entire film delivers its message in a very effective way. Bergman places the viewer with the character, puts the camera in the car with the actors or in extreme close-up behind the actor. Nykvist controls an extraordinary control of the camera, there are some masterful "handheld" effects, very good at making everything seem "right". The shoots, when the characters are captured by the army, look remarkably documentary. The play is minimalist, but the story is quite complex for that matter. In fact, the whole movie is paradoxical, it has an intensity in the subject that is in sharp contrast to the cold and the lack of emotional engagement that it is aimed at and filmed. Nothing is melodramatic here, there is no compassion, no hope, and no apparent redemption. But as in Liv Ulmann's dream at the end, it is so beautiful that you can just be surprised at it ... It was not so terrible, as it was so beautiful!
