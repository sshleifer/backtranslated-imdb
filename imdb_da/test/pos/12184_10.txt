I must say that this movie is absolutely fantastic. I don't understand why it has such a low rating. It has romance, music, darkness and vampires. Also Stuart Townsend did a great job of being Lestat, the play was amazing. Also I am usually not in that music, well sometimes. But I have to say in this movie the music fits perfectly. If you like dark films about vampires, it is definitely for you or even if you do not have a love story for this. But all I can say is a word: Amazing! My rating is defiantly: 10 out of 10. Anyway, I seriously suggest you see it. I don't remember seeing this for years, I saw it again a year ago and I'm addicted to it again. laugh out loud. Great film !!!
