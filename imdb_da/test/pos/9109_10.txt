Calling All D-Sciples! Grab your friends, beat the theater and watch hell out of this movie. From the opening order to after the credits you will laugh yourself. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wild ride through D's story, and not just a list of the things they've done, but a chronic ascent to power. I'm a big fan of Rage Kage (Kyle Gass) and Jables (Jack Black) so I loved the movie of course. <br /> <br /> It helps to know about the show they had and their first CD, but it's just as fun if you don't. From the hilarious and vulgar texts, rocking rhythms, the massive amount of pan on the back and the comedians, down to the complete insanity that is the story, it's a movie for D-sciples and newbies alike. <br /> <br /> Many of their songs are featured, like two kings, tribute and kielbasa for their many soundtracks like Cock Push-ups, every fan in the audience will say I remember it as well as new comers say "It is F'ing fun! " I highly recommend this movie to any body ever rocked out. This movie is set in high competition to be the next "This is Spinal Tap". One of the best ever.
