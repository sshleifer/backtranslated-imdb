I was a little worried about actors and appeared in Italy when "Le conseguenze dell'amore" and Toni Servillo came. It was a long time I didn't see a charismatic actor on the screen. Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story of loneliness, and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years. The movie is not perfect, but 'Watch Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the movie's vision. Toni continues to perform in movies, you are definitely the coolest actor today (and not just in Italy, his performance deserves international acclamation). I rate this movie 9/10.
