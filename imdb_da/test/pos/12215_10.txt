Someone asked why it was canceled, I tell you why, because "reality" is making money. The display surface was canceled so that they could replace it with a "reality" show, this would haunt NBC, I and about half of my high school, having about 1000 people in total promised to boycott NBC until they bring this show back. in my area (I don't know anywhere else), but they had a good thing with the Sci-Fi channel, where the Sci-Fi channel would show last week's episode at 7:00, and then NBC would show the week's new episode clock 8:00 was good because it gave you a little refreshment about what happened in the last episode. I was so angry when I learned that the show was canceled and they just wanted to leave them on the church like that!
