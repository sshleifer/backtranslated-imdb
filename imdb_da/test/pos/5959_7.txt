Just saw the movie, it's actually pretty good. The trailers gave me the impression of either another Dujardin-one-man-show-turned film (Ã  la _Brice de Nice_) or an expensive, stupid French comedy. Surprisingly, it is not. Secret agent OSS 117 is stupid, but at least he knows it while I've always found out that James Bond was stupid, but acted like a smart ass. Dialogue is witty with a lot of heavy-in-kind humor as one would expect from a British rather than a French movie. The women and the music are beautiful. A refreshing ride in the past, where the wicked were former Nazis or Soviet brethren, cars were shining and France had colonies!
