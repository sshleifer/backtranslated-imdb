I am a great supporter of Indian movies, especially Malayalam and Tamil. <br /> <br /> Shame on India not to post this movie as their official Oscar entry. I have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed me the maturity the Tamil cinema has in its manuscript and narrative, which bollywood catches up. On the way to all of us western, Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood, which is all about good-looking glamor and promotion. <br /> <br /> Coming to the point, what did India think when sending a movie like 'Devdas' to the Oscar? It was a truly masochistic movement. I think they are trying to punish Oscar judges with boredom by sending Devdas when the judges overturned Lagaan last year. <br /> <br /> 'Devdas' is just a heavily colored but outdated melodrama of love, destiny and destiny. I would stay away from it. Anyway, not sending a movie like Kanathil Muthital shows how much of a renewed Indian administration should save them from bad administrators who lack intelligence. Now I know why this country has so many problems. They are highly talented but not shown correctly.
