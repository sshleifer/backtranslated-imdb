This was one of the best movies you could find as a child. I lived with The Chipmunk Adventure from 4 years to 8 years old. The story of this movie was: Dave goes on a business trip to Europe and stabs the boys with Miss Miller. While playing around the world in 80-day video games, two villains, Klaus and Claudia (brother and sister) round off Chipmunks and Chipettes for an adventure where the kids will have the hot air balloon their way across the globe. What they do not know is that the "game" is really a diamond smuggling ring. And when you find the airport at the villains, follow a hunt! And ending up in Klaus and Claudia for prison and Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor safe with Dave and Miss Miller. But I warn you now, it is a musical and pretty good. Most people hate musicals, but I'm not one of those people, I release love musicals like Rocky Horror, Grease, Sound of Music, Cats Do Not Dance and just about anything (except My Fair Lady). If you see this, share with your kids (if you have any)!
