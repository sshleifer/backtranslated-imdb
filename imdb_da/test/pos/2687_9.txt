As in the last ten years or even longer, the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms (in fact few people deserve this title because they are so predictable), the King of Queens is a very original, unique and astonishingly fun switch. It's about the daily life of a delivery man and his wife working as a lawyer in Manhattan, Queens, NY. With them, Carrie's father Arthur, an outgoing picture book, is played by the stunning Jerry Stiller, who steals the show from all the others every time he looks. Other important people are their best friends Deacon and Kelly, a married couple and their other friend Spence, who is almost 30 years old and still lives with his mother. What makes this show so unique and fun is above all that every character works so well, and Carry's cynical, sarcastic attitude is the complete opposite of Doug's good-natured, somewhat stupid optimism. And Arthur is the one who makes it completely unpredictable with his strange ideas and habits. He often gets in trouble, and Doug and Carrie have to pull him out of the mud. Although the quality of the show has, in my opinion, fallen slightly in recent years, it is still one of the best daily sitcoms ever made. It takes some time to get into the characters and relate to them, but after that it is done, you get some unstoppable laughs from it. Although I think I couldn't survive a day with Arthur in a closed room without knocking out his intestines, I really love him in this show. Look and fun, I give it a 9 out of 10.
