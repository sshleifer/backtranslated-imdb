The third and final Female Prisoner Scorpion movie directed by Shunya Ito. The series star, Meiko Kaji, would complete the series in the fourth, Grudge Song, directed by talented Yasuhara Hasebe (who also instructed Kaji in the superb Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). The Original Female Prisons # 701: Scorpion is one of my all-time favorites. The sequel, Jailhouse 41, is almost as good. It is generally considered the best in the series, and I think maybe if it ever gets better on DVD (the original, by Image, is very poor). Beast Stable, in my opinion, is almost as good as FP701. It is much slower, far more contemplative. It has its share of violence and nastiness, but there is more focus on history and characters. Sasori (Kaji) triggers detectives in the first scene (she is handcuffed to one and pulls her arm out and escapes with it in tow, which must be seen as believed!) And is related to a freelance prostitute, Yuki. Yuki gets the hassle of a local prosthetic ring that contains a huge-looking madame with a cats full of cat cats. What really surprised me is how sad the movie is. Yuki's story, which has never been resolved, is heartbreaking. The pictures are spectacular and Ito's direction is masterful. It's too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the FP701 series. This is a great movie.
