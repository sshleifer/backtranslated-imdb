Although I'm a little older than the recommended age group, I've really enjoyed this movie. It's a little break from reality, and every little girl must dream of making friends with a pop star. I know it was mine, to be sure! The first 10 minutes were really cheesy and the average girls said a few things that were also a bit cheesy. When you get over it, you can really start enjoying it. I loved the relationship between JD and Jane - it was really sweet and you could see how much they started to like each other. The soundtrack is perfect, and it fits in very well with the film. I also liked the family created for Jane, her sisters seemed lovely. Very well made movie.
