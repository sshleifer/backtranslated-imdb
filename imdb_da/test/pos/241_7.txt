Rita Hayworth illuminates the screen in this fun, fancy and delightful musical lead role of Kelly Kelly. Rita plays nightclub dancer Rusty Parker, who has dreams of being a successful Broadway star. Unfortunately, her career has not come to Danny McGuires Night Club. When one of her fellow dancers says she enters a Cover Girl competition, she decides to follow her dreams and enter. She recalls her grandmother's publisher, whom he was deeply in love with many years ago. But when she finds this success, her boyfriend is not happy about it. <br /> <br /> I had never seen Rita before this and I'm so glad I did! She has such a stage presence and is a very good actress. There are some good numbers in here, not the best of any musical, but they are melodic and good at listening to. One thing I didn't like was Gene Kelly's character. He should have supported his girlfriend! But it is perhaps the only criticism I have about this movie. Cover Girl is a brilliant, fluffy movie - perfect escapism. Not everyone's ideal movie, but a wonderful movie anyway because of Rita Hayworth's star power. Great movie, really impressed.
