I must have seen a different version from the first person in the user comments. <br /> <br /> It's really great ... Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are good together. Val Kilmer's character is like he was in the novel, although emphasis is placed on Gus and Call and Comanches. We'll see what happened to Call and Newt's mother too. I don't want to spoil it, but it gives much insight into Call's character. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a really convincing job. Steve Zahn had the biggest challenge I thought to follow Robert Duvall! There are a lot of actions, humor, tragedy. It has something for everyone. I can't wait until it flies, my family is jealous, I have to see it early!
