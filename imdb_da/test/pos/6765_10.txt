This is actually a brilliant movie. The story is grotesque, but the actors are brilliant. Especially Mads Mikkelsen's performance as Svend is magnificent. It's a simple story of two guys with a desire to do it alone, but it unfolds into a weird and absurd story where many people are accidentally killed and served as chicken trays. If only several people understood Danish ... This could be a good candidate for an English version. It is also worth mentioning Ole Thestrup, who always delivers the extra twist to the plot with his slightly delicate character Holger. I can only recommend this movie to the Danish audience. See also Adams Ã†bler (2005), a film by Anders Thomas Jensen, also with Mads Mikkelsen accompanied by a good play Ulrich Thomsen.
