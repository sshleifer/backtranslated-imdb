After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was damn worth the wait! "Rush in Rio" may well be the biggest rock DVD that exists. I'm not making fun. It's incredible! Everything busy with the sound being crappy is true, but it doesn't make the concert unattainable. I find it makes you feel like you are actually in Rio and see the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel that you are actually there. Also, Geddy, Alex and Neil have never been in better shape! Geddy's vocals are flawless, Alex's guitar player is still incredible, and Neil - absolutely no words to say. The camera's work at this concert was very good, I have to say. They gave us a good look at everything that was happening on stage and in the audience. Kudos to the cameramen! Anyways, enough of my raving! Go see "Rush in Rio" for yourself. You will be suprised. I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
