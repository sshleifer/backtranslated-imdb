My first Mamin movie saw it at the IFC long ago and LOVED it. It seemed quite artistic, original, fun and fun. Not a moment in the movie let me down or make me bored, and I laughed a lot or had a smile on my face. I think this movie is really fun. But here's the catch: it's also very artistic and creative - if you don't know Yuri Mamin (probably because many of his big movies aren't available here) he has a very original style like no other's and for me it's not even my favorite movie of his (right now it is insane.) I must also say as a Russian, this movie is good because you really see what the Russians are. And it is possible because this is a true Russian movie for me, NOT a foreign movie who is trying to be American or trying to appeal, Mamin did not sell (not even since Gorko (1998) was so good if it was not better. is true Russian style film that came out of communist social realism. <br /> < br /> If you liked this movie, I think you have a very good chance to love Mins other movie, in fact I like a few of them more than this one, assuming that one is his most accessible movie A similar film is Fountain, which takes place 6 years before per estroika, it has the same actor in leading role, and several of my permanent people, whom you will recognize from the window of Paris; This one has a supernatural twist at last, but is mostly a realistic comedy, a great one. Viva Mamin, hopefully the Criterion will be jawing all his movies one day, he's still working and his catalog is so amazing! See any of his movies if you can.
