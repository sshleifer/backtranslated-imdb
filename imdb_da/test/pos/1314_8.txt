Paul Schrader and his brother Leonard wrote Mishima, thus clearly drawing parallels between Yukio Mishima's life and his work. The film is divided into four sections: beauty, art, action, and the fateful day, when Mishima held an army hostage and spoke to the garrison, only to make it ridicule him and his Bushido ideals of the samurai code. Mishima committed ritual seppuku on November 25, 1970, and he planned it as an intervention of beauty, art, and action. Schrader editing scenes recreate the day with three different scenarios from Mishima's novels: Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Kyoko's House and Runaway Horses. Seppuku's moment is perfectly realized compared to the shocking climax by pulling the camera back while zooming in. <br/> <br /> Black and white sequences blend with the colorful moments depicted in Mishima's novels. The black and white scenes represent memories of Mishima's childhood and youth. Schrader correlates some of these autobiographical moments with scenes from novels that are often parallel to Mishima's real life, such as his tribe, the evolution of his bodybuilding obsession, and his advancement of the samurai code. Each of the three themes of beauty, art and action are exemplified in the chosen depictions of the respective novels. The color sequences resemble early, stagy Technicolor films that may give the film an intentional surrealistic quality in view of the subject. <br /> <br /> Ken Ogata plays the real Mishima with incomplete determination, led to generals office on the fateful day and resembles the real Mishima. Schrader took tremendous risks with this film in focus on novels he did, and by tying them thematically to both Mishima's personal life and his literary ambitions. The film's editing between the three main sections of November 25, 1970 clearly shows the black and white growing segments and the colorful novel images at the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty, art and action in Mishima's life. At times, it is difficult to follow and there may be little to recommend for the uninitiated viewer. *** of 4 stars.
