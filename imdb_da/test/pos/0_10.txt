I went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed by my friends. I admit I was reluctant to see it, because from what I knew about Ashton Kutcher he was only able to make a comedy. I was mistaken. Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well, and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism. The sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our feelings. This one did just that. The entire theater (which was sold out) was overcome by laughter in the first half of the movie and was moved to tears in the second half. As I left the theater, I saw not only many women in tears but also many adult men who desperately tried to let anyone see them crying. This movie was amazing and I suggest you see it before you judge.
