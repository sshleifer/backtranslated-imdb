This type of show is not supposed to be on TV. This is the type of edginess usually reserved for independent film. This is what only HBO has to do. The fact is, Denis Leary has managed to make one of the best TV shows ever and it's easy to join SOPRANOS, OZ, ED, etc. Kudos band at ABC to show that NYPD Blue was not fluke and that Mr. Leary and his gang to create a truly unique experience. My only complaint is that the show is not far enough ... an hour would do better, but I can't wait for the next episode!
