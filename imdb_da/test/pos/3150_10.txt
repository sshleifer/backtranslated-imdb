I saw the short title "The Reader" recently and found out that the movie was well planned and done. I really felt for both characters, as Morgan Hallett and Elizabeth Franz portray in this movie. Elizabeth was able to show great reach with her blind character and left me emotionally connected. Morgan was able to sell for me that she was totally committed to keeping "Sissy" or Franz protected from grief for losing her sister who had lived in Copenhagen. The great thing about the movie was in a short time and the budget of just ten thousand dollars, Duncan Rodgers was able to make a very well made movie that kept the interest of the viewer. Rodgers has a good insight into the actors' ability and transition of large camera angles to show their talent. I always feel if a director can make a good movie with a small budget, what can he or she do with a much larger one. Good work Duncan !!
