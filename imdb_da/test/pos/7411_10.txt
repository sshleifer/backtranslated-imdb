"Pharaoh's army" speaks the formula. Instead of selling off for clich√©s and big stars, it is totally dependent on the excellent spectacle of a strong cast, the power of a well-written script and a fascinating and bitter story. The result is a raw and realistic film that moves fast, with a heavy emotional flow. One of the best I've ever seen about the Civil War, and I think it may be due to the pleasure of being an independent film (if you like this movie, try to see the similar brilliant indie civil war film "Wicked Spring" "Pharaoh" simply tells the true story of a small expedition / feed layer of Union men running into a federal farm to make provisions, but ending up there because of an accident one of the men. Made and broken, nothing happens as Hollywood would write it, this movie comes from the mind of a person who actually cares about quality film and storytelling, Superb dialogue and plot show moves along a movie that looks very professional but has often do not want to watch movies, more as one hears a story. <br /> <br /> The movie boasts an incredible performance by Chris Cooper, showing a great versatility in exploring His role, He transforms, but is always at the height of credibility and is easy to emotionally relate to. Patricia Clarkson is just as amazing and realistic in a role that many actors will crumble. She shares an interesting chemistry with Cooper's character, and where she is the strictest of the characters is still so easy to identify with. The rest of the casting is fully capable and fills their roles well. <br /> <br /> The art design and set are wonderful, and I personally love the cinematography. It all has the feel of a civil war photograph with the camera, presenting strong contrasting colors and shadows and a tin-like metal color, but always keeping the naturalistic look of the rustic setting. They seem to have used natural lighting, but whatever they used beautifully. Everything seems to belong to where it is, it feels like period, something I find rare in American film. The actors appear in the 19th century, not as people of the 20th century in old clothes. <br /> <br /> Above all, this movie is very personal. I think that what indie can afford it. The movie is almost flawless with an excellent script that effortlessly creates and explores these people's relationships and personalities and lets them grow in a situation as bad as it is. It does not fail to get that point across, and it becomes the point across without the usual and overused techniques used in all war movies these days. It's brave. It depends on it's characters, a fantastic script, human feeling and in the cold hard fact that the civil war was not all CGI, big stars and hoop skirts.
