Considering this movie was released 8 years before I was born, I don't feel so bad about seeing it over so long. Back in January 98, but I attended the second annual Quentin Tarantino film festival in Austin, Texas. Special theme for movies tonight was "Neglected 70's Crime" and boy was her right. "The Gravy Train (or The Dion Brothers, as it seemed this print)" was an absolute gem. Fantastic performances, quirky characters, smart plot, hilarious comedy, and just a very good time. You rarely see a crime movie that is so entertaining and fresh. Margot Kidder in one of her earliest film performances is also extremely sexy. I hope some cable networks get hold of this movie and allow many more to see it. Meanwhile, go to an indie video store and hope they have it.
