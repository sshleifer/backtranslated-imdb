I watched this movie many years ago and I have never forgotten it. The theme is very timely. It was on TCM this morning, and I wonder why this wonderful movie is not on VHS or DVD. I've searched a lot about this movie, but can't find it. I think if there are enough people to request it, the movie will eventually be put on DVD. It amazes me that such a great achievement from Quinn and such a powerful plot is not yet available to the public. The fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must for both teachers and students. This film is a great teaching tool from the past, but in many ways as contemporaries as "Crash". From previous comments, I can see that this movie made a deep impression on everyone. Again, too bad it is not for sale.
