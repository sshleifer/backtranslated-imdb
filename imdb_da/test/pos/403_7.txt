Another good entry into the Crime Doctor series [# 4/10], with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some amazing Spanish American backgrounds and sets. And a more off-the-wall story too! <br /> <br /> A man who looks like the crazy murderer of his first two wives has been found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party. The criminal sector is on the spot (apparently as a guest) for immediate and dismissed proclaiming the murder, and then we are presented with a very strange set of people to mull over, for one of them did the deed. Was it the roaring brother of the dead 1st wife, the 3rd wife and the rich widow Hilary Brooke, the dancing brother and sister vampires, the intense young man, the eccentric cabinetmaker Lloyd Corrigan on loans from Boston Blackie, the irreplaceable butler or odds -on Jerome Cowan? Police Inspector Emory Parnell had his work cut out, but Warner Baxter as Ordway was as impossible as ever to work everything. One of the goofs listed on the IMDb is wrong: By breaking into the murder, Ordway says "right through the middle of the forehead" and Cowan answers "he didn't miss this time". Favorite Bits: Baxter and Cowan travel through the club sandwiches and beers at the nightclub to make changes to their interrupted dinner party; The scene where Braga's home is apparently shaken. The plot seems to be a bit at times, and the way it was explained was perhaps more worthy of Monogram, but letting it lie in the air as supernatural would also not do it! <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if you already like the genre, you won't be disappointed unless you really like the genre.
