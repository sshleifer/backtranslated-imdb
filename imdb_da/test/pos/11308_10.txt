This parody is cleverly done: from the songs (Express yourself being exposed to yourself, as a prayer is now party in my pants and Vogue is now vague) to the false interviews with the cast exhibition, this movie is fun. Remember Madonna, she didn't know about the rainy season in Asia? In this one she does not know about the volcano season. It's a precious jewel. They have a lot of money on the spoof and it pays off. Highly recommended !!!
