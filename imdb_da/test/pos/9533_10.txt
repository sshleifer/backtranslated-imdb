Edith Nesbit's best book has been adapted to a truly magnificent movie, I love it. The film itself has a beautiful filmography and a good realization of the subject. The finish is enough to have you in tears as it is so beautifully done. Lionel has directed some truly outstanding films, such as the amazing Mr Blunden, but this is his best film as a one-kilometer instructor. The costumes were lovely, matching the beauty of the landscape, and the sparkling and comfortably credible script helped. But it is the quality of the play that holds this movie together, as it is not shorter than incredible. Dinah Sheridan is appropriately sincere as the mother, a much needed character, and Bernard Cribbins was fun as Perks. In fact, I preferred Perks to movies as he is not so humorous in the book. The kids were perfect. Gary Warren and Sally Thomsett both gave exciting performances, but it is Jenny Agter's enchanting portrayal of Bobbie who impressed me the most. Another special mention is the beautiful music of Johnny Douglas, the title music reminded me of Charlie Chaplin's smile. In conclusion, a fun and exciting masterpiece, it's better than the book, I think. 10/10. Bethany Cox.
