John Leguizamo is a great comedian and narrator. Every time it has been on HBO, I have to stop and see it. John tells the story of how he grew up (probably some fact and fiction) and adds hilarious stories in the midst of life. If you like John's comedy, I'd probably say this is his comedy when he's the best.
