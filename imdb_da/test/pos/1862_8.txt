Paul Bettany had a great role as the tortured father whose favorite little girl dies tragically from illness. For that he deserves all the credit. However, the movie was mostly about that, when Darwin's adventure ceased to gather data for his theories as incomplete stories told to children and completely change disputes over his ideas. <br /> <br /> Two things disturbed me terribly: the soundtrack with its shiny sound that almost pushes sadness into the viewer's neck and the movie trailer showing some beautiful scenery, the theological paintings of him and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends when preparing for a fight against blind faith, and thus misrepresenting the film. <br /> <br /> To put it all, if one were to remove the stage from the movie trailer from the movie, the result would be a non-descriptive family drama about little child dying and the parents of her parents as a result. It was clearly not what I expected from a movie about Darwin, although the film was beautifully interpreted.
