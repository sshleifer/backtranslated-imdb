A good remake of PLANTS TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES in many ways. I think it's such a bad and sad coincidence that both John Candy and Chris Farley left us. As they still had many things to do. Well bless them both, I think the drawings of 2 movies are really alike, Road Trips of two different signboards and many unfortunate consequences due to Chubbies. This movie may not be Planes train and cars, but it is a really entertaining movie, especially with Chris Farley's amazing performance, The missing part in this movie is the worrying thing if we compare it with Candy & Martin Classic, but I think It is better this way
