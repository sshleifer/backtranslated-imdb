For Greta Garbo's first talking image, MGM wisely chose Eugene O'Neill's Pultizer Prize, which won 1921, plays ANNA Christie. <br /> <br /> Also wise, the producers supported Garbo with not one, but two members of the original Broadway Cast (George Marion as Anna's father, Chris and James T. Mack as Johnny Priest - transmuted to "Johnny Harpen" for film not to offend). <br /> <br /> This little change is interesting. As for many films accused (by those who want movies to be movies and ignore their origins) being "a little more than filmed stage games", the problem is not the game, but the filmmakers who would not be more faithful to the property. By diluting a fantastic movie stage work then it would not offend anyone or open it because they could for many lose the very qualities that made the piece worth filming in the first place. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the respect the studio had for both O'Neill and Garbo had allowed ANNA Christie to survive the normally destructive process admirable in Frances Marion's generally sensitive screen fitting. Excuse marvel, Marion even allows the POST of the scene where Garbo Anna shows her past on the "farm" of the man she would like to marry and the father who sent her there in tact! What the Assault Union must have thought of it! The source problem's biggest problem has always been that Chris's friend Marthy tends to go away with the first action and then disappear from the last two, so Anna can take the stage - the two sides of the real good woman do not always recognize. <br /> <br /> The perfect throw Marie Dressler (who had also cut the teeth on the Broadway scene before going to Hollywood) is the perfect balance for Garbos Anna in this area and the fast 90-minute movie gives us not too much time to miss her - one of the few benefits of the atmosphere is shown rather than eloquently described in the original - AND scriptwriter Marion is smart enough to win from O'Neill to bring Dressler back for a touching scene two third of the way through the movie, reminiscent of Julie Lavern's second action appearance in SHOW BOAT. <br /> <br /> Anna's and Marthy's early stage together on the screen (16 minutes in the movie) takes each other's goals and sets the whole thrill of the rest of the story, being among the most impacting scenes throughout the play. Not to be missed. <br /> <br /> ANNA Christie is a great tragic play and a good movie drama. It is hard to imagine that a last-day remake that would almost certainly lose gravel and atmosphere in this 1930's resumption (it was first recorded without sound in 1923 - also with George Marion's original Broadway Chris) could improve this excellent movie recording . <br /> <br /> The internal scenes are closest to the drama, but outsiders must not miss anyone watching the atmosphere. The background screen does not work on modern technical standards, but the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most movies in the era of the real world where the play is set (especially in the New York harbor). <br /> <br /> Almost all of Garbo's naturalistic notions of aging have remained excellent (only the often parodyed death scene from CAMILLE, 7 years later, will occasionally pull snickers because of the heavy weighted direction and parodies), but This ANNA Christie, along with the variety of her 1932 films, MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL, and the sublime Lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy, NINOTCHKA ("Garbo laughs!") are probably her best. <br /> <br /> O 'Neill fans taken with this game on the edge of his boasted "sea plays" were supposed to track the fine second World War shaped film released the year before the US entered the conflict, THE LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940). It is almost as skillfully drawn from these ocean games as one is from ANNA Christie and has a young John Wayne in one of his rare non-Westerns, supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way.
