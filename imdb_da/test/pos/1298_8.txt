I really liked this movie. One thing I noticed is that Korean TV drama is far better, as far as giving you the whole story. I watch movies when I don't have the time or want to go through 16-30 episodes. Movies seem to be premature, and if you do not look carefully, you can miss something. <br /> <br /> I feel this was shaken and I had to rewind a few parts to try to find what I missed, especially at the end. If you like good love stories, I still think this is sweet, and if you have that extra time, I still think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> It's always nice to go back, follow the actors in different movies that we won't follow when they start, as we do the actors' producers and directors in our own countries.
