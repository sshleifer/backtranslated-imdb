I saw this movie in the early 70's when I was about 10 years old. old on tv. It was after school, and as I saw, I was then drawn into the whole idea of ​​the two astronauts on mission to another undiscovered planet that I asked my mother if I could get the cassette out. She let me. So I wrapped the cord of the microphone around the channel button so that the microphone hung in front of the speaker. This movie is the first I have ever paid enough attention to - and provided enough to record. (Only the sound - there were no video recorders at that time.) The reason will make you hang on every word .. every minute in this movie .. The end will blow you. After seeing the journey to the far side of the sun. You will have flashbacks in your mind about it for a long time. I played the sound recording for many years ... and "saw" it again and again in my mind. Then - maybe 15 years later .. when the VCRs were ordinary and they sold tapes in stores. I've always searched for it ... but never found it. But when the internet came together one day, I searched for it and bought it in a second. So .. after approx. 30 years after seeing it for the first time - then I saw it again. WOW! ~ ~ It was spectacular! Just for reference .. I must have seen it 50 times since.
