"2001: A Space Odyssey" is set in 2001, and the main character is HAL. A computer. That's right, a computer that speaks and thinks entirely alone. This was made in 1968 and thinking in 2001 would make it possible for computers to speak is a joke. If this were in 3064, a speaker computer that had feelings and made its own decisions would be considered as moronic as this. There is nothing in this movie that evokes any kind of feeling. It causes two reactions, and it is called sleep. It starts with nothing but a whitish shot for well over two minutes. Then the first shot we see is that some kind of illumination is the "The Dawn of Man" sequence. So, if it is in chronological order, is the variety before this world's birth? <br /> <br /> Under the "The Dawn of Man" sequence out of no where does a huge monolith come from ?? Out of the ground, from the sky, we never know where it comes from, but for some reason it is there. The monkeys go Apesh! T when they find this monolith that only man could have made, but that's the catch ?? The man has not developed yet. So who made it and where did it come from? What is its purpose? The monkeys find a tool. The monkeys use bones to fight against an opposing group of monkeys. The monkeys with weapons are now the dominant group because they have used their thoughts to gain an advantage. The more advanced monkeys, and more importantly the smarter and more innovative monkeys, are the dominant group they have taken over the water hole. <br /> <br /> We jump quickly into space, millions of years later, when we see a bunch of spaceships floating around to classical music. We can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe and for a movie made in 1968, the visual effects are stunning, but obsolete. The result is legendary. The kinematics are spectacular. Editing is horrible. There are countless shots of boxy-looking spaceships floating in outer space for what feels, an infinite time. When we board the ship, there is not much to talk about. For the next hour, Kubrick shows different sources of life in outer space. Kubrick shows us an astronaut's life, which is very boring and we are getting very modest. The spaceships inside and out are bulky and outdated. Remember what the first cell phone looked like? Neither do I, but it looks the future in 2001. All the characters have clothes and hairdressers that look like 1968. The chairs are decorated in bright red colors and strangely shaped, because we all know that in the future we will be sitting in strange beautiful chairs. The screenshots are frightening, and this is obviously ahead of HDTV because clarity is terrible. All the TVs look like they were from 1968, so it's not that futuristic. As all movies put more than 20 years in advance, they look awful and convincing. Just because this is Kubrick, we shouldn't say, "Well, that's how you think it looks." No, I wouldn't. Just as I wouldn't think a computer would talk to me in the year 2047. It's not going to happen, and if anyone made a movie right now, put 30 years in time and had a speaker self-thinking computer, I'd laugh at it stupid. Like I did with "2001". <br /> <br /> HAL is the liveliest person, shoot ?? I just called him a person. HAL is a computer, but he has more life than any of the muted characters in the movie, and he actually thinks he's alive. HAL is the only one who is lively, and he sees man as his maintaining men who take care of him while he does all the work. HAL "reads" the lips of one of the very few conversations between Dave and Frank, and he "sees" that they plan to beat him off. This is where the only dramatic part of the movie comes in - A subsequent battle between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to enter the larger spacecraft. Oh, the drama. When HAL thinks he's got the upper hand, Dave makes his way back into the spacecraft, proving man's ingenuity. Dave continues to terminate HAL. HAL cares for his life as he slowly falls away, as everything else seems to take forever. The final act is as boring as the first two. Once again, the monolith appears as the Apes found at the end. It comes out of nowhere, again. Then an infant is born in a placental-like shield overlooking the earth from space. What does Kubrick say? Is it about transformation? Dave for an infant? Are you developing again? Is Kubrick saying this is the end of man and the start of ?? Whatever the foreign look is? Maybe I love to try to find out what this crazy instructor is trying to say, but the more I think about the more the beginning and the end make sense. There are so many questions left unanswered, especially for monolithic purposes. If you can handle it through the movie, it should rub some thoughts. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie struggles to get to where it will go. The first action and the third acts are strong, but the second action weakens and floats in a place for what seems like eternity. There are some exciting things in the movie that will provoke something if you give it a try. When the movie's start is sensible, the end seems much better, though you still don't do what Kubrick tries to say, which I don't.
