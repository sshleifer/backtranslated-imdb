There is already much written about the film itself, so instead of adding to the sound, I would just say a few words to the two female actors. It must be a frightening perspective for any actress to steal in a way against the spectacular Monica Bellucci, but Romane Bohringer pulls it out to sensational ends. A movie starring Monica Bellucci where I fall in love with the other girl ?? It should not happen. <br /> <br /> It has been said a thousand times, but Monica Bellucci hits the shy figure of modern cinema. I have never seen such innate sadness before. She wouldn't be out of place to break Lon Chaney's heart.
