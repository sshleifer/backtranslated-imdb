Like most people out there who have seen James Bond 007 movies. Most people never knew that Thunderball was originally FIRST 007 Movie to be released, but after Ian Fleming wrote the story with Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham. The other two authors took Ian Fleming to court and WON THE CASE, who provided evidence that Ian Fleming took the ideas from SPECTER (Special Executive in CounterIntelligence Terrorism Revenge Extortion). So instead of making Thunderball, they (fleming, broccoli, saltzman) continued to do Dr NO. <br /> <br /> This movie had the best of the best. From getting the sean connery back to again, he was paid over 5,000,000 for the NSNA. Irvin Kershner and Sean Connery had problems on the set, so much is true. But in general, this movie up there, I think with (Thunderball, License To Kill, Dr No) is my favorite from the bond series. David Dryer was hired for special photographic effects, he was working at Bladerunner at that time before you ever say anything again. The $ 100 million yacht makes the disco volante, resembling a canoe. This film featured the best Villian in a bondage movie just behind dr no. Klaus Maria Brandeau held this neurotic business together as a quiet way, with little joke to his authority over bond. Barbara Carrera was excellent as fatima blush. <br /> <br /> The music was better than any score that did not include John Barry who did the backround scoring music in most bondage films. Michel Legrand is not big in the US compared to over in Europe, he has played with miles davis and many other great jazz musicians over the years. It's a bit gently at times, but the 007 theme that happens about 3 or 4 times in the movie, NEVER AGAIN again, is so cool, I like it more than the original. <br /> <br /> 007 is back One More Time <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton explained it right, I thought you can't turn to a superman or a superhero, he or she should be human and have feelings. He was by far the best serious true for makeup version of the band. But Sean Connery proves he can still do the role that made him and others follow, I bet 75 now he could still draw a villian role in a MCCLORY 007 movie if ever. <br /> <br />
