I am a Christian and thought this movie was pretty good! :) While the actor was not the Academy Award caliber, I thought it was good considering that the cast had limited acting experience at the time this movie was made. <br /> <br /> The gospel message and the transforming power of Jesus Christ were wonderfully explained. The message that the director was trying to get across (which is the important thing, not how the characters dressed!) Surely come through. The theme of having the main characters involved in illegal towing was also a good idea (cool muscle cars, VAT). I think this movie will surely reach many young people. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie, it's a great witness tool! :)
