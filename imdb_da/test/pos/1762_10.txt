A shame nobody seems to know this little thriller masterpiece. Where larger budgeted films fail, "Terminal Choice" delivers lots of excitement, shock and bloody violence. A little seen gem that deserves to be searched in your local video store. The anonymous guy downstairs is right when he says you will never trust hospitals again ... it's so effective! Good ending too, not really a twist, but it doesn't end the way one thought it would. Yep, it's Ellen Barkin in an early role ...
