What I've seen in Wolfgang Petersen's films has been pretty good. He knows how to act, create excitement and get you interested. Eastwood tends to be large, sometimes excellent. This applies to both his action and his bill. They both live in solid work here. The concept is not bad and the cat-and-mouse game works well. Malkovich seems pretty good, and his and Eastwood's player of each other adds to the movie. I suppose this will not introduce anything new, really ... but it never claims or not. There are two good actors, each playing a basic type of role as they have proven at other points in their career that they can cope remarkably well and with a grand instructor at the helm. Really, it's entertaining, well done, and it's just plain supplies. Editing and filmography are good. Action and writing are also. The film manages to be exciting and intense, and if you let yourself, you will probably be entertained and engaged, even if there are superior movies out there. The pacing is largely spot-on. I recommend this to any fan of the most important players, the director and / or this type of movie. 10.7
