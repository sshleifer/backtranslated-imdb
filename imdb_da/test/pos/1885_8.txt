Ah, classic comedy. At that time in the movie, where brains are crushed, a two-minute scene with Bruce Campbell reminds you, reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can get you and pack you into a whole movie. <br /> <br /> This year and year by Bruce Campbell, what kind of movies we want out of him. We want to see strange movies like Bubba Ho Tep. We want to see cameo roles in Sam Raimi's film, and we want to see 'Man with the Screaming Brain'. With the title alone, you know it's going to hit the very stupid movie type, like the Army of Darkness, only with more stupid and smaller monsters. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is simple. Bruce sees doctor. The doctor has a new idea. Bruce gets bad things to happen on the way to see the doctor. Randomly, this is what the doctor wanted to show him who rescues him. Hilary comes along. <br /> <br /> With the addition of Ted Raimi as a strange Russian guy, and journalist Stacy Keach as Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov, it's fun, this movie does. Complete fun. Never a point scary. <br /> <br /> If you like the silly Bruce Campbell, you like this. So again, why would you see this if you didn't like Bruce Campbell?
