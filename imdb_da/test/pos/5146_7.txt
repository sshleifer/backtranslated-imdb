My family (two 40-somethings, an 8-year-old and my 71-year-old mother) saw this on a smut preview on April 29th. We all enjoy the movie a lot. The story was good and it was much easier to know that it was based on reality events. Luke Wilson was a hoot (pun intended) to see who was Tim Blake Nelson. And seeing Neil Flynn play something other than "the average Scrubs guard" was nice. The kids in movies did well and I am sure they will all appeal to a particular demographic at heartthrob level. Visuals were just lovely and Jimmy Buffet music added to the "Florida feel". OK, maybe the story was a little too nice and well-packed for some adults, but hey, who cares? I can't compare it to the book, I honestly hadn't heard of it before the movie came out. <br /> <br /> It was just a NICE movie and it had a good message. Simple and simple.
