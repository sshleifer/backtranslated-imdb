This immensely perverted and oddball early 80's teen body count flick can never reach the astonishingly high point of the deeply disturbing and criminally underrated murderous film "Devil Times Five", but it is still an above average killer opus anyway. <br /> <The slim but useful plot centers on a trio of misfit tykes - two bratty boys and a shining blinking eyes, albeit English-speaking little girl - all born during a solar eclipse on June 9, 1970. When the strange antisocial Staying together in a close independent and exclusive circle for up to ten years, the trio suddenly kill and start opening the season on the effortless, unsuspecting local waves in the hitherto sleepy and peaceful California suburb of Meadowvale. Writer / Instructor Ed Hunt, the usually incompetent innocent hack responsible for such wonderfully miserable clutches as the gloriously deaf "Starship Invasions", the outrageous Jesus Christ vigilante parable (!) "Alien Warrior" and the astonishingly stupid "The Brain" doing a pretty solid and skilled job here: the kill scenes are abundant and reasonably brutal (spike-through-eye gag is particularly ugly), there is a great smack of free nudity and soft-core sex, a good excitement is nicely created and maintained, some fine dolls of dark humor point to the arrested choked chaos, and the surprisingly ugly ending manages to be really jolting. <br /> <br /> In addition, the top-of-the-line track further elevates the procedures to Jose Ferror, like a small town doctor, future "Jake and Fatman" television star Joe Penny as an amateur astrologer, "The Prey" s Lori Lethin as the spicy babysitter heroine , Susan Strasberg as a bitch school teacher, "American Ninja" s Michael Dudikoff as a chowderhead jock, and Cyril O'Reilly (the lonely misanthrope vampire in the ghostly melancholy "The Damned Dance") as a libidinous teenage guy who gets a bag while You do just what you think with some naked hot chick on the back of a parked van. Billy Jacoby (who starred in the late 80's direct-to-video dross like "Dr. Alien" and "Demonwarp"), Andy Freeman, and especially the scary sweet Elizabeth Hoy, is truly incredible and convincing as the terrible troika of chillingly evil and amoral rugrats. And yes, it's nothing more than Julie Brown, the roaring comedienne who scored a surprise Top 40 hit with the hilarious news tune "The Homecoming Queen's Gotta Gun" as the lovely, vacuumy, full-breast redhead bimbo that makes a very long lasting, totally alien but still sizzling and much appreciated naked striptease while dancing in her bedroom for a cheesy blaring rock song! All in all, this baby sizes up as a robust and satisfying slasher object.
