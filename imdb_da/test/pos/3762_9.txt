In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was "the Greeks don't get any freaks". Is that right? I really liked the sound. I also liked "Hyde's Got nothing to hide" in the last scenes. Really a Baptist movie, but with lots of laughs and puns, sight gags and slapstick. Mrs Woo-Woo's place is reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other things that are truly amazing. She looks very different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity doesn't hurt her a bit. Mark Blankfield is reminiscent of Gene Wilder. Bess Armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time.
