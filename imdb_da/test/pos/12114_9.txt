Yes, I know, Roscoe Arbuckle didn't like being called 'Fatty', but I couldn't resist the joke. <br /> <br /> This is a fine Lloyd Hamilton card from its highest period, directed by Roscoe. The two work together with lots of good gags and Roscoe's usual attention to the details of shooting the picture in an interesting way. Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting. Roscoe uses a few long tracking tracks and some good cameras to tell his story and show him as a fine actor as well as a talented comedian. This story plays with some interesting themes, such as. Lloyd's classic MOVE ALONG: here it is about the perception of reality and the confusion that movies make of them. Or you can choose to ignore such problems and laugh at the head.
