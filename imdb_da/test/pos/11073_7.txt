This film brings in mind "Boys' the Hood," "Menace to Society", "South Central" and others of his ilk and even shares actors with some of them. The film's "us against the law" mentality is underlined by the completely black neighborhood towards the almost all-white police force. Here the police are so bad that they act as caricatures, and in a scene they even back the boys, as they drive past in a car they just "liberated" from their owner. It's like a bushwhacking from an old western, but the modern setting makes it look too real. The story focuses on young Jason Petty and his friends, to whom the school is just a hassle that takes time away from their "real occupation" to boost cars. This happens to be Newark, N.J., a rust-belt town low on jobs, but notoriously high on crime. In fact, the problem is so serious that the police all have "Car Theft" written on their backs to show that an entire entity must be dedicated to this crime. The boys use a "slender Jim" to pleasantly break into cars and take pleasure as if it is nothing big. They only run into real problems when police back them. The evil Nazi-like Lt has a vendetta against the boys and doesn't see them as people who can be worthy of redemption but as human goals. In fact, he is somewhat reminiscent of the sadistic Nazi in the Warsaw Ghetto who shot Jews to delight in the movie "Schindler's List". When the boys steal a police car in return for the ambush, it is predictable to go downhill quickly. They are hard hit by the police and Jason finally ends up in jail. Obviously, these are "bad boys" who steal your car in a moment, but the movie wants us to see them as anti-hero, showing that Jason protects his sister and his friend who takes care of his own grandmother. The movie left us wondering who to take and who feels sad for: the boys whose life goes down the drain, the honest citizens whose cars are stolen left and right and who could get caught in a fire in any moment, or the city of Newark itself, whose spirit, whose law is betrayed by brutal, solitary police. <br /> <br /> Despite the latter depiction of the latter, the film offers a realistic look of the ghetto, the protagonists and their families, and the car thieves' culture in a city where there appears to be only 2 career paths - law enforcement and crime. Strangely, the whole fabric has never been mentioned. The filmmakers (including producer Spike Lee) are, of course, biased towards the Newark police, which we hope are not so bad they are portrayed here. Nevertheless, they have given us another strong and influential story of inner city, and the black youth has gone wrong and Sharron Corley is fine as Jason.
