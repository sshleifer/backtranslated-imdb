Not only do I think it was the best movie in 1987, it's probably on my own amorphous list as one of the 10-20 best movies I've ever seen. For some reason, I really relate to this movie and it is one of the most personal movies I had seen at the time of my life (I was 26). For better or worse, I strongly identified with the Holly Hunter character (and I'm a guy!). She plays an extremely bright, loyal and intense woman who could not find out romantic relationships. There were so many things that she said in this movie, there were things I would say or have said to others under similar circumstances. And at the end of the movie I seem to be so much, very sorry. Of course, this role was the big break for Holly Hunter. It was clear that I was not the only one who thought so much about it.
