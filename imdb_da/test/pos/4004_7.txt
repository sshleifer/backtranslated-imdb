First of all, around the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what Kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not a real movie. I mean, I would choose a good Deniro movie myself or play a video game someday. But, guy, what are you talking about? Now that I'm out of the way, let's move on, do we? Customizing video games for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, as you may have guessed, is based on the movie of the same name. What is strange is that this was released three years after the movie was released. Whether it's due to a slow development time or just plain laziness, nobody really knows. At least I don't. <br /> <br /> The game allows the player to play as the four main characters in the movie: Jen, Shu Lien, Li-Mu-Bi and Dark Cloud (whose story is a secret bonus unlocked for separate gameplay .) All four of these characters have battle styles based on how they fought in the movie. The actual eye light, however, is the escape movements that allow each character to avoid the battles of an enemy attack in the most impossible and gravity that challenges ways first shown in the film. <br /> <br /> The story is obviously based on the story told in the movie. The story of the game is told using CG movies and spoken in a subtitle Mandarin language (A nice little touch, considering that I preferred the film's foreign language over the doubles). The story is about expanding what might have happened to the other characters under the film and even (no real surprise, since virtually all video game movie adaptations have done this) change what has officially happened in the movie to Get the game for more action. I never thought Jade Fox would go as far as actually going and getting goons. <br /> <br /> The right bonus for the story is the ability to determine how the game ends. What if Jen had all the ingredients to cure Li-Mu-Bi in her possession? What if Jen hadn't got her comb back? What if Li-Mu-Bi hadn't got the green fate back for the second time? Your actions will determine the outcome of these scenarios and the fate of the characters in this game. This is really the best feature of the game. <br /> <br /> But for all its forces, it also shows some errors. Enemies often tend to be annoying after some time, and the camera angle tends to be directed at the most inappropriate locations. Not even the special features (which are unlocked after beating the game) are good enough to even forgive such difficulties that are forced on the player. <br /> <br /> If you loved the movie, you can enjoy the game. But this game is the only way you will be able to immerse yourself in a playable version of such a beautiful and amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, you could just have chosen a Deniro movie instead.
