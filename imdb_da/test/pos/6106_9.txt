Margaret Colin stars as the protagonist of this story; As I saw it, I remembered his little part in Adrian Lynes' 'Unfaithful' as Diane Lane's neighbor in a Tony NY neighborhood. <br /> <br /> This movie was surprisingly good, and Diane Stillman deserves the credit for a precise portrayal of class, crimes, and misdemeanors that actually occur in upscale neighborhoods (bypassing the idea !!!). It is real, but not over-dramatic; The audience lives through her accident, the pain it has caused; denial; and the ultimate resolution. <br /> <br /> It's more than just a question of "what is a good person" that Colin speaks to her husband .... is a person's character defined by a single action; and should they be condemned forever because of their action? The questions are relevant; It's also fun to see more movie references to Martha Stewart (ie, the fussy, unpleasant mother); Colin is known by his one-time friends to be a "perfect host with perfect genes" .... (gag); and a scene where Colin is confronted with the police; ("The friends" also betray her later). <br /> <br /> The denial and facades of American society are addressed; (Oh, no murder happens here, resembling the theme of "S Season in Purgatory", by author Dominick Dunne, about the true murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Connecticut); Colin is aware of her crime; but consciously finds himself pursuing the facade until she finally breaks down; rent or buy this movie; She is an underrated actress who does quite well in these roles.
