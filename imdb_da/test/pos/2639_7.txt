Fast times are not. But check out this movie, it has a heart. Pour yourself a drink and enjoy. It is filled with a kill of just beginning stars. Sherilyn Fenn has her first screen-credited cameo on the screen. Chris Penn, Lea Thompson, Eric Stotz, Jenny Wright, Rick Moranis, etc. - they all look so young. Oh, and if you look close, the cop's wife Nancy Wilson from the rock band Heart is.
