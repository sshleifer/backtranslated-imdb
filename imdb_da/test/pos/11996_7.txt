Caddyshack 2 has a terrible reputation, just because it is a successor to a senior classic. People have criticized the film for many reasons, but ultimately they all back to the fact that this is not Caddyshack. <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that we should just take Caddyshack out of the equation and consider this movie on its own, but I think it would be unfair. The film has much in common with its predecessor. The class-related themes of 'snobs versus slobs' and the desire to fit into a class over your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie. The two things that really are missing here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, who are replaced by Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason, respectively. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not trying to argue that Ackroyd comes close to Murray in the movie, but Jackie Mason is an admirable successor to Dangerfield. He comes out as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without biting too much on either. I don't want to say he's anywhere close to being as fun as Dangerfield is in Caddyshack, but there's a lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the movie. <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase only pops up and handfuls of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. Perhaps these special naysayers did not notice that he only popped up a couple of times in the first film. For my money, his scenes here are much more fun if something excessive. <br /> <br /> While I am on the subject, it is really the transformation of this movie that brings it down. It comes across so far more self-conscious in its attempts to get a laugh. Many of the jokes are being worked and there is far too much of Gopher who seems to have taken a much more anthropomorphic personality and a voice just if we didn't understand the idea that it was fun. <Br /> <br /> Characters are also hammered home, especially smarmy yuppy kids. Jackie Mason rarely misses a stroke and is consistently sympathetic and very funny, but we didn't need the tango sequence at all! The director is obviously not of the same mindset as Harold Ramis. Not to mention that Caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily adorned with a quirky music cue. All in all, this is a fun, goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at that time were to say. Don't be put off by the terribly low rating on IMDb, check it out yourself.
