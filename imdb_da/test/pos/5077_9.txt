"I fear you are talking on the stand where men are enforced talking something." This Shakespeare line from The Merchant of Venice is echoing again in the new movie release that introduces the viewer to the "Enhanced Study Methods", reproductions that began in the Clinton Administration and become more common since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. <br /> <br /> The film has an all-star cast with Oscar winners Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Reese Witherspoon, as well as Peter Sarsgaard, Jake Gyllenhaal and Omar Metwally. Supporting roles filled with unfamiliar actors also deliver, suck the audience into the plot, and show how many people can be hit by overseas terrorist attacks and our means to investigate them. Extradition follows an Egyptian-born terrorism suspect (Metwally), taken by US officials after his flight from South Africa to Washington DC for an unannounced prison abroad. His pregnant wife (Witherspoon) ventures to Washington DC to find out about his disappearance through a family friend and senator's employee (Sarsgaard). Gyllenhaal plays a young CIA analyst at the overseas detention center, which monitors the violent interrogation. <br /> <br /> This movie follows the emotional suffering of the torture victims (Metwally) and those involved in obtaining the suspected information from him. Some, like the CIA analyst (Gyllenhaal), are visibly shaken and appalled by the practices being practiced, while others, such as Senator (Streep) and the foreign professor (Yigal Naor) see it as necessary and effective. <br /> <br /> The movie can be described by some as a political piece, but is ultimately an emotional one. Metwally's performance as the tortured prisoner is Oscar-worthy. The film does not intend to preach, but rather to question and inform the audience of a subject that often does not have a human face put on it. Publications have been known to function but have also been known to produce false information from innocent prisoners. The film simply portrays the emotional battles of those involved in such a serious business, and does so in a way that will affect every seer differently. The movie will hold your interest, and have you engaged in each of the characters.
