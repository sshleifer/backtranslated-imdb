I thought it was a beautiful movie - very brave. Such beautiful pictures - and I liked the use of breaking glasses with applause. Also how the best friend repeated the line of ".. and she is a year older than me .." showed that their friendship is revived and grown, but perhaps there is some competition left ... I loved the footage of hands that felt substance. The dance concert was beautiful. The beginning seemed slow, although it took a while to feel the signs - the man could have been more offensive - he just seemed absent as other characters talked about him - it didn't fit very well. The case btwn. the best friend and man seemed to be random .. the doctors' meeting seemed to suggest that there was not much time left (to live ..) so when the adultery was revealed, I felt not so much sympathy for the character - more like relief! the end was so great-lines btwn. her and the man and the scene where she is pulled over are brilliant!
