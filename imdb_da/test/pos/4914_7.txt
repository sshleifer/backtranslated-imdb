A fine performance by the Vittorio Mezzogiorno and a masterful of Jean-Hugues Anglade adorns this stern tale of lust, desire and alienation in France. The work of the two leading artists is striking - subtle, intense and passionate. Alas, the script is deliberately turgid and sordid, and the overall effect leaves one with worn spirit. Nevertheless, those who can appreciate fine quality sources can enjoy the courageous task of the leaders in this often difficult movie tour of Gallic low life. <br /> <br />
