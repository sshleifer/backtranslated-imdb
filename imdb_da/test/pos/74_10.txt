Darling Lili is amazing! It's by far my favorite movie! It certainly does not deserve the bad reviews it received. Julie Andrews, who plays the role of Lili Smith (Schmidt), is the best part of the whole movie. She is entrancing and spectacular! When Julie Andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far, I was most surprised not to be surprised at how amazing she is. This movie is just ... amazing (I run out of adjectives!), It is magnificent, amazing, amazing, fun, terribly romantic, sad and just an all-out excitement and all thanks to Dame Julie Andrews! And to her husband, director Blake Edwards. Oh, yes Rock Hudson was ok too :) Julie Andrews is the beautiful and beloved singer, Lili Smith. Rock Hudson portrays Major Larabee, who quickly falls for Lili and she with him. But their affair was not coincedental. A German government meeting was planned (I'm not sure if that's exactly what you would call them, but you get points) because the warm, happy, song lingerie Lili is actually a German spy. Lili is told to seduce Major LArabee for information on the new Top Secret Operation (later known as "Crepe Suzette"). Although Lili is on a solemn mission, she falls in love with Bill (Major Larabee), for real, making her original quest challenging. But Lili completes and completes her job after finding out something that is not really right with Bill. The end will remain invisible to me as it is wonderfully laid out. If you want, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie, I definitely did it !!!!!!!! <br /> <br />
