Once again, there are bad government agencies that stop for nothing to prevent public knowledge of some important events. In this case, the discovery of a new underwater species that could threaten the planet's ecology. Although creation is not E.T. he seems to be friends with a youth who protects it at all costs, does not realize it is only an infant of the species and will be much bigger ?? and baths This series in 2005 had a lot to do for it. It's family drama, sci-fi, thriller with more than a few comic moments. The characters are credible, well-behaved and well-photographed. The show keeps the attention. Of course, as with a sci-fi show, suspension of disbelief must be achieved. And I think it's here. Alas, the series crashed after season one, so we never get a decision. Infuriating .. There is a general comment I feel worth doing here. Many TV networks and / or movie distribution companies are, quite arbitrarily, canceling outstanding TV shows? particularly intelligent sci-fi ones. Now there may be some very good reasons for this, although the audience is treated with utter contempt and rarely told the reasons. This in itself is annoying. What really gets my goat is that after canceling the series, they issue, as far as it is, on DVD, in an obvious attempt to grind cash cash as far as possible. For previous viewers of the series who are OK, they know what they are for, but ?? many of these unfinished series end up with a cliffhanger. Two who are going to think right away are "Surface" and "Odyssey 5". If you have heard good things about the series and have not seen it, then you go and buy the burst DVD and end up with an undissolved plot problem ?? it makes me very angry !! I enjoyed "Surface" immensely and didn't realize the poor signs would end up in a situation that was so untenable? And we never know what happened next time. I think there should be a prominent message on all such DVD issues so that history is unfinished. Today I check on the purchase of TV shows (IMDB is an obvious good starting point) to find out if a 'complete' series is really complete or not. Buyer beware.
