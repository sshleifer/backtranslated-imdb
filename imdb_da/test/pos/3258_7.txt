"Two Hands" is a hilarious Australian gangster movie set in really hungry Sydney. I bet tourists never foresee Sydney and Bondi to look like they did in this movie: all sweaty bodies, oppressive night and gangster in nylon shorts and jandals. Heath Ledger plays an amateur boxer with an eye on becoming part of the local King's Cross boss's gang. He looked pretty magnificent in his green leaf and blue patterned buddies. A sweaty tattooed booth becomes him. I have always had him as a "Home & Away" boy and he has been in the soap which is a bit harder than the Weetbix insipid "neighbors". The movie is really worth watching for its combination of Sardinian humor and ugly violence - the drowning scene is expected to give me nightmares soon. Totty prices: Country girl loves interest city brother and tattooed streetkid.
