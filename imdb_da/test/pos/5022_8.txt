I have made a great international journey, both on a business trip and as a tourist. For both types, I assure you, the best advice is also the oldest: Always drink the wine in the country. In this movie, Archangel Michael comes to earth on business, wrapping it quickly and deciding to hang around for a little trip. Boy! Can he "drink wine from the country." <br /> <br /> Can you be drunk forever with spirits, love and battles? <br /> <br /> He would go up in the morning and love lying down for nights. <br /> <br /> These are things you can't do in heaven so he enjoys them while he's here! It turns out, of course, that he had a couple of other jobs to tackle, and if he's less direct about them than he was about the first, he's just as successful. The final scene is a bit schmaltzy, but it is also wonderful. Jean Stapleton is going to dance with John Travolta.
