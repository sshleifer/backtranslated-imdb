This film, published in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the Western released during the 50s; The cavalry needs to protect the territory from an Indian's murderous band, an officer determined to see this task through, and the men with him with various character defects that he must merge into a cohesive entity. This little band must stick to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know all too well that the small band is understaffed and could be wiped out before the aid comes. A big difference to this movie, "Only the Valiant", is that it tries to play the usual story but at the same time delivering the message that duty is a major concern for being shared by everyone, even if they do not accept this charge. <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck is the troop that is tight-cut to prevent the Indians from breaking into the territory. The troops, which he takes with him to the small outpost, are the troop's dregs at the fort; they in turn have grips or weaknesses that make them wonder if the captain has not taken them out because of their general lack of affection for a cause. Eventually the captain and the little band confront the opponents, and at the same time confront their own fault. Support includes Western Stalwarts such as Ward Bond, Gig Young, Neville Brand, Lon Chaney, Jr. and Warner Anderson. <br /> <br /> A sleeper of a movie and a good solid western for fans of this genre.
