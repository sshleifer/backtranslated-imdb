This was an excellent movie. I am dealing with a child I travel with who has the FAA, and to see that this movie was more than a word can explain. I also bought the book and it was fantastic. I want a copy for my own use, and then I can get my son's teachers to see it too. I would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie, let me use it for a while or refer me to someone where I could buy it. Thanks, Myra I would recommend this movie to anyone who deals with children / adults with special abilities. This movie will be shown again on TV. The doctor of the doctor who has tracked my son would also like a copy. His special Ed teacher has also asked me to try to find a copy that he can have or that he can borrow. <br /> <br /> Thanks
