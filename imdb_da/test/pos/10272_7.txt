A film that is visually graceful, but interesting is mainly the reason. The film depicts a zigzag progress in exploring the inner actors' inner feelings. Max, who has lived in New York for two years and intends to marry a girl he met there, comes back to Paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend whom he still wants but finally finds out the one he loves most is her best friend. Non-linear narrative so many flashbacks and each part is articulated quite well. The three women Max has met symbolize something we should pursue, although may not have a clear picture of the underlying motivations. His fianc√© is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see. She also gives him no love, but only stability. True love cannot be found in his relationship with ex-girlfriend. Just a fantasy for him to escape - many things very romantic he has done for her, but almost nothing seems to be acceptable. Who really animates Max's life is actually his best friend. The balance achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because Max has understood much more about his inner feeling. The non-linear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated. Not as brilliant as "Pulp Fiction", but things seem much more natural in "The Apartment". Max is not the only sign that undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description of Romane Bohringer. The good movie film also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful. A good comment on today's love and no doubt a movie worth seeing. <br /> <br />
