It's my favorite movie because there's so much going on that you don't see first and so many things that make you wonder "Did Kieslowski do it or is it in my head?" For example - is the judge supposed to be God or some supreme being? <br /> <br /> Also, Irene Jacob as in Double Life of Veronique is excellent, there may be some superficially beautiful actresses, but no one manages to convey the beauty of spirit with physical beauty as she does. <br /> <br /> Tritingnant is also magnificent without really saying much, and the things he says are excellent as his response to Valentine. . . "Be".
