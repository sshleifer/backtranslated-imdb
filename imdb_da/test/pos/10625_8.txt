Overall I found this movie good: unusual works with disturbing scenes (some essentials, some useless) and weak second half. CONTAINS SPOILERS The film is divided into 2 parts. I thought the first half of the pianist was great. We meet Erika Kohut (wonderful Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher and introduced to her world. She is single, struggling to find her place against an overprotective and cross-border tyrannical mother. We understand that she has lost or rarely experienced love as a physical + emotional chemistry. She protects herself from being sharp and offensive to people, releasing her sexual tensions in sex shops, as a voyeur or in sadistic self-proclaiming. This first half is very clinical and builds incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable. Then comes Walter, a young, beautiful and outgoing man (played excellent by Benoit Magimel). Although he is going to feel Erika's cold at first, he seduces her and slowly skips Erika's fortress. He loves her deeply, but she needs him to fulfill her sadistic desires. So when she is falling for him, he is confused by his world, and finally we discover that Erika cannot love or feel at all (especially since Walter is portrayed as an impossible not to love). This is the second half of the film, very touching, as we see Erika's inability to love to lead her to self-destruction. This second half seemed less like the Haneke championship, and sometimes did not have credible scenes that paradoxically reduced the drama. Of course this is a raw movie, at least in the French version: You see porn sequences from the sex shop, bold mutilation and sex scenes. The very talkative fellatio scene between Magimel and Huppert was quite good, I thought, and is central to understanding Erika's sick relationship with love. Regarding the actors, Huppert is amazingly the whole movie, Magimel gets better and better to perfection, and Girardot (mother) is excellent. <br /> <br />
