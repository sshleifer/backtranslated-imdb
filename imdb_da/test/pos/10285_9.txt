In this tense and character-driven romantic tragi comedy, we get an insight into the interwoven lives of four thirty Parisian Parisians. In the center is Vinz Cassell's depiction of Max. A starry Romeo, he falls head over heels for beautiful stranger Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraged by his best friend Lucien (Ã‰coffey, in an undervalued but effective performance), he wins his heart and they happily ever live ... that is, until the schematic, neurotic and obsessive Alice (the versatile Romane Bohringer) becomes much involved in the lives and love of the other three people. The rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological jumble, and the film appears as a complicated jigsaw, the picture card Paris in the heart of it all. The use of color does not go unnoticed, especially in Lisa's spectacular occasion (presumably representing the title of the film), where red and yellow provoke fires in passion and desire. <br /> <br /> The audience can relate to Max: He really carries his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by irony and circumstances for it. In a memorable scene, our counterfeit lovers (agonizingly separated by a "choreographed" misunderstanding) miss the opportunity meeting that would surely reunite them. Independently of each other, they travel to the same destination: her on the subway, him in a taxi, practical close-to-tea. Yet fate seems to have it for them, and the audience is captivatingly tame. <br /> <br /> The shows in this movie are really what make L'Appartement stand out. I still can't understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside France. He has the presence and diversity in abundance. Monica Bellucci (Cassell's spouse at the time of writing) has recently found fame in the English film industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - true she is divinely beautiful, but behind it is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in classical 'leading lady's style that many British and American actresses reject in favor of the overly light 'subtle' approach. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can watch this movie! I doubt you will be disappointed. It is poignant, satisfying, fun, sad, sumptuous and a lesson in artistic filmmaking.
