Then forgive the * real * lame game-play scene, cardboard background and studio as the stadium. For this part I should have got the film 5 instead of 7, but read on ... From the premise to plot there are many similarities with "The Replacements". Some say this movie rip off "The Replacements" while some say this script wrote before. <br /> <br /> Both films require a kind of "suspension of disbelief on the basics, and this is especially difficult for" Second String "as it has NFL license holdings and the whole story behind it. The sound is too low for some people and not to mention in "Second String" Bills you have to overcome big points over and over again, with the limit bet to shoot the game play scene, so make it look even worse. <br /> <br /> In "Replacements" is the premise and the league fictitious, but you know it happens in real life.I think it is easier to accept fictitious story and setting with true event ("Oh yes, it happens before!", rather than real attitude / background with fictional scenario ("There is no way Bill can win a Superbowl!"; part of the scene was actually shot in the pre season game of Raven games, real stadium, real audience and an NFL match with the same shooting angle. /> <br /> But let's say both movies came out the same day and we delete the budget factor (hence d ive play game action scene): Overall, I like "Second String" over "Replacements", not much, but I like this more. <br /> <br /> It has "relatively better" character development. In "Replacements", Keanu's character is also "out of sync with the world" and all he cares may be, get a girl? In the second string you see QB's struggle to get the job back and handle his past with coach. Or the fumble guy problem. This "keep the ball all day long" solution is of course not new, but we see progression in attachment. <br /> <br /> What about these trick games? I think it's "relatively realistic" than "Replacements". The "Dan Marino" as fake kneeling, flea fluttering, wildcat full back rush, all right, except sometimes it looks a little too easy. But for me it is better than "Replacement" s center catch and rushing for 50 meters call, or how a 60 meter field target looks too easy. OH BTW, I'm glad they didn't force the TE kicker to make his shot .... Of course --- if you objectively review this movie over any other football movie all there, this could easily be a 5 out of 10 movie. But some say this is the worst football movie? Try "The Comebacks".
