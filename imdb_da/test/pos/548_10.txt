Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us how much she hates her mother, Adele (Susane Sarandon). How to start the movie. Adele decided that her and her daughter moved to California without asking anyone and leaving her husband for no reason. The story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter. It's really deep and touching, thanks to the actors' great work. Natalie was nominated for a Golden Globe for that role. She is one of the most talented actresses I've ever seen, and that's Sarandon. They really look like mother daughter. The soundtrack is also fantastic. The movie is amazing. * 10 out of 10 *
