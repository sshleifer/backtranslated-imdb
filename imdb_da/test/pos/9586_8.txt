I always enjoy watching this cartoon, with Sylvester trying to catch Tweety on a train, rather than at the grandmother's house. It is actually a standard fare, but entertaining, especially when Tweety pulls the emergency stop line. One of my complaints about this is how sloppy the animators were with the train. When you look at this over and over again, my little boy (who loves trains, why he liked it so much), starts to see some things. <br /> <br /> Throughout this brief position the trolley changes on the train, either 3rd, 4th or 5th and in long shots at all. The engine has either the number 651 or 814, or none at all. The coal offer has either the number 99 or the letters "S.P. & Q.R." on it or at all no numbers or letters. The coaches carry "S.P.Q.R." without "&" in long shots, and then in close-ups it has the word "SouthEast and Western." <br /> <br /> All this does not disturb history, but the details of production were clearly not looked into very carefully. <br /> <br /> Still this cartoon is among my favorites with Sylvester and Tweety.
