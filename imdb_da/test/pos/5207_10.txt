If we compare the film industry with a sea, we have the tendency to observe the surface only. Powered by the strong Hollywood marketing force, we saw all the war movies like Gem Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. But under the splashy waves grow in silence, from time to time, lesser known pearls. When choosing one and looking carefully at it, you wonder why this gem is almost unknown and why it is not already on the crown. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" is such a gem. Why does it have a group of multi-million dollar rated players? No. It has thousands of extras? No. It has breathtaking, spectacular, shining computerized visual effects? Not at all. So what's so special? Well, in one word it is pure past reality recreated and converted to celluloid thirty-five years later. The tragedy of the most bloody struggle in history is here. Dirty, wounded soldiers, Russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion, burning villages, collapsed buildings, derelict suburbs, firearms, explosions, flames in tanks, soldiers shot, burned alive, grounded by tanks in their pits or chips in pieces - you got all. But the real horror is somewhere else. People are reduced to simple peasants, without the ability to change anything. The soldiers we follow in the film are trying to leave the battle zone and they fail. The civilians remain in prostration in the midst of heaven, crying only for their killed children. Mercyless, the great war painting machine merges people, equipment, villages, cities - and asks for more victims and destruction over and over again. <br /> <br /> Throughout this collective insanity, a group of German soldiers are struggling to survive and keep at least a minimum level of normality. They do their duty and fight bravely. But as everyone knows, a fight is almost lost when people start to lose confidence and faith. We see how all these people are left, how they plan to leave, how they fight to catch the last plane to Berlin (full of wounded), how some very badly injured soldiers were treated as simulators and shot how they were forced to Performing a small group of Russian civilians, including a young boy, how they later discovered a place that literally followed the ceiling of food and drink - intended only for some "superior" officers of course. One by one they fall dead. The end of the movie is one of the most bitter, depressing and touching endings I've ever seen, all on the grand score of The Munich Philarmonic Orchestra. The war destroyed everything in its path. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must-see for everyone. A true movie lover should have it in his / her collection. The strong anti-war message must be a warning to all of us. Unfortunately, man never learns, nor even the politicians. Self-destruction is in our DNA, and human pain seems to last forever. Can we be reasonable enough to stop the war?
