The commentary told me that this movie is the worst ever forced on him / her as a child. I have to say I loved this movie as it was small and I still love it today. The film has the best ongoing theme for the whole family's context. Considering the time period during which the movie was released, I thought the movie was doing well. I just wish I could still find a copy of it somewhere !! Of all the 1980s movies I watched as a child, it was on my favorites. I know I've probably seen it at least once a week with my brother and my mother. I would definitely recommend it to anyone I know - or don't know. So if you find a copy of it, I suggest seeing it! It is wonderful and cordial.
