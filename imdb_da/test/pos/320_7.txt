Touching Bollywood's epic melodrama about a 10-year-old girl who finds out she's adopted and is determined to find her birth mother. The great success of the film is the performance of P.S. Keerthana who plays the girl. The first half of the movie is very good. There are also a couple of really good songs, especially the number that introduces the main character. Unfortunately, the second half of the film, which takes place in war-torn Sri Lanka, feels a completely different and disappointing film. It is big on explosions and special effects, with srigran soldiers and rebels killing grenades, running from fireballs and being killed by stunt cables. Everything the film can offer as insight is cheap platitudes like: "Some day there must come peace" and "Maybe the kids will find their way". The final order in which the daughter and mother are reunited is good, but then over-top with the music and a good time spent, it feels like a cheat. I know I know it's all in the style of Bollywood. But it's a story where great moments simply detract from the simple, powerful central story. Bollywood could certainly also use a little restraint at times too.
