I absolutely loved this movie as a kid. I can't seem to find it anywhere! I mentioned it to some friends just the other day, and not one of them remembers it! Can anyone help me out? My older sister remembers it vaguely. There was also another movie, I remember it was half live action and half animation, but I can't remember the name of it. The characters were animated and the background was real ... I think it is about a kangaroo and I think the movie was in Australia. I go out of my mind and try to get copies of these movies that were such a memorable part of my very pleasant childhood. Edit: I searched for IMDb for this second movie and found out that it's called Dot and Kangaroo! All I had to do was type in "kangaroo" in the search box underneath the sign, and the name of the movie on the list was like a bell that went out! MAN, I love IMDb! Thanks!
