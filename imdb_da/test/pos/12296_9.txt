No one would ever ask the director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we are wondering is: is he an insane genius? So many people hated this movie! I am usually the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, obnoxious and pretentious films (like the horrible recent movie 'L'Enfant' and the meaningless and offensive 'Feux Rouges'). But strangely, I actually think that 'Pola X' is a great movie, made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft and containing remarkable performances. The film carries the melodrama to more extreme lengths than I think I have ever seen on the screen before. But then Carax is extreme, as we know. The film also includes what I consider to be top-notch or anarchist fantasies and wet dreams, how about a mysterious group of young men training to shoot machine guns in the bourgeoisie playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band that has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels. Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a castle (whose mother-in-law is Catherine Deneuve, and he walks into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath by the way). But he suddenly "snaps" completely when he discovers that his late father, a famous diplomat, had fostered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience. This is because the sisters suddenly appear as a kind of Romanian refugee with wildly confused hair, expressive face and little ability to speak French coherently. Depardieu then transforms itself into a "class hero" to the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, living in crooked and extreme poverty while scoring a great heritage. He then begins an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister who appears in an explicit sex scene that has offended many people, even though I have no objection to it, since I think people are too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where it apparently never happens. The intensity of the play and the film makes this unlikely scenario as an experience of powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama. The differences between Carax making an extreme movie like this and the many extreme French films that I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he seriously tries to explore a meaningful, extreme emotional state, whereby a human being dissolves and turns to his background. Many would say that the extreme elements of this movie were free, but I do not agree. I think Carax was genuine and not at all exploited an exploit. It is very difficult to defend a man who goes so far and, as for all I know, can be a complete lunatic, but I think he deserves to defend himself for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
