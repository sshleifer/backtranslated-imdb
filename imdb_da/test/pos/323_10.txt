It pays to see Reader's Digest. Or Time if it was the original source of the article that served as a presumptuous inspiration to Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece. Based on a true story of an adopted girl looking for her biological parents, Mr. Ratnam a classic that rivals as much as it attacks, appreciates as much as it speaks and preaches as much as it practices. <br /> <br /> Where do you start? The vain gloom that precedes fresh fighting in northern Sri Lanka? Family chaotic household led by a fire engineer author and 3 adorably naughty children? Or the scary area where reality crosses the point of creating a pleasant existence and becomes a monster of incredible and eerie events and ideologies? Regardless of the way you look at it, this movie is worthy of your collection if you happen to like Mani Ratnam's compelling dramas. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ratnam is a former champion in the mix of fictional tales of reality events, and in this film he oozes the class in adapting two reality stories to one. I do not want to go into history as it is better than read. But what I want to dwell on is the influence it had on me, and why, for all the war assembly happening in this world, it cannot destroy the simple but inexhaustible force called hope. Innocence, in its purity, cannot understand the complex wishes of adult decadence and greed. It also does not recognize dangers when accompanied by the hard determination to seek what it wants. It is an innocence of such kind that drives Amudha to seek her biological parents, despite warnings that they could be lost in the civil war boiler. Having survived a terrorizing experience of talking to a physically challenged man only to realize that he is a more lethal entity in disguise, Amudha sticks her in a way that breaks her opponent's resistance. And finally, when the two meetings, mother and daughter, the reunification is so tense with emotions that even the temperamental adoptive father is reduced to tears. Supported by a coruscating background score from A R Rahman is the scene that follows, exciting to melt even the stoniest hearts: A list of questions that Amudha must ask his biological mother. In a culmination as dramatic as the order of events leading to it, a child discovers his mother, alive in the body, but lost in spirit. With the crushing realization that she has no hope of staying with the one who carries her, Amudha makes her adoptive mother what this movie's title means: a cock on the cheek. <br /> <br /> With regard to the throw, the track is clearly blazed by the brilliant PS Keerthana. Mr. Ratnam has a gift to extract spectacular performances from lesser-known children's artists, but this shouldn't take anything away from Keerthana for an award-winning performance. With a stand in support of Madhavan (Thiru), Simran (Indira) and the amazing Nandita Das (Shyama), she adorns the scenes in almost every frame she's in. The music can't be as memorable as any other Rahman offer, but It still didn't stop him from giving another national award for the best musical direction. "Vellai Pookal" is so much an ode to the need to protect human life as it is for nature. The dialogues are top notch (try the touching exchange Amudha and Indira have on the swing, shortly after the revelation that she is not Indira's biological daughter) and the cinematography, amazing. <br /> <br /> This film is a clear statement to release weapons as much as respecting human life and expression. Do not judge it as a lesson in film making; You will only lose out on experiencing one of the very best from Mani Ratnam-A R Rahman stable.
