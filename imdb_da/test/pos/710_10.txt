I love to see Jericho mile. I think watching Peter Strauss drive the mile is like seeing usain bolt sprint 100 meters. I think Peter Strauss is an excellent actor and should make another movie. He is lightning fast has great energy and can run a mile in under 4 minutes and that my friend is great. no man alive can out race rain Murphy i believe the man runs 80 kilometers a week no one does, but he. I've seen the Jericho mile 100's and want to see it 100s more. big movies are seen more than movies that are not. I thank the filmmakers decision makers for giving years of life to do so. They are good people and I bless them all. Thanks to getting my word out again, thank you all.
