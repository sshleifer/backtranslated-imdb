Having starred in Western history when I was a college student by seeing the views of World War II, is quite unpleasant and in a whole quite wrong. World War II was the most graphic and bloody affair that would ever occur in world history. While the Axis Commandments made many crimes against humanity, which are still the prospect today, and the real many people forget that not every German soldier was out to exterminate the Jewish people, not all Japanese soldiers swung a samurai host and flew kamikaze missions and not every Italian soldier was a fascist. Most of these soldiers to the Axis powers were normal people like you and I caught in a terrible conflict and just happened to fight for a country they loved. The battle at Stalingrad was undoubtedly the most deadly struggle in world history with over 1,500,000 losses during the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader, Lieutenant von Witzland, when they are relocated to the eastern front to fight the Soviets at Stalingrad. Von Witzland acts as a kind of protagonist with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They are all normal men and seem to be completely unaware of what is happening in Germany and Poland. <br /> <br /> The film follows the course of the battle. The movie is generally very bleak when it comes to its depiction of struggle and the life of a soldier during the battle. We are shown several cruel battles and intense violence outside the fighting (including a firing squad sequence). Overall, the battles are the earliest examples I know of what portrays the loss of limbs and generally of your facial deaths and violence. Much of the inspiration for saving Private Ryan's fighting sequences seems to have come from this movie. The film does not aim to make the Germans completely innocent of everything in the film. Several of the army's senior officers are portrayed in the usual sight most people use for evil. Most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak at home. The film makes it clear that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust. Most of the country and the army were completely unaware that genocide took place. The film makes it clear that the soldiers of the German army simply fought for a reason they really did not understand, and most just wanted to return home rather than freeze in negative degrees in Russia. <br /> <br /> movies really show how the hell war is, especially World War II. The battle scenes will shock you with its cruel realism, and the story is quite easy to follow as you simply follow a platon during the battle. As with most war movies, not expecting much happiness after seeing it. It will leave you a bit of a depressed mood from seeing the life most of the soldiers on the east front face. Not recommended for children. <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
