John Carpenter shows how much he loves the original from 1951 by giving it the utmost respect he might have, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoia core of John W Campbell's novel. The secret to this version is the unbearable excitement that builds up when the group of men becomes suspicious of each other, where the burden of literally waiting to be taken over takes a terrible team. The carpenter manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery needed to keep the movie headline in the right direction. To be a scary scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the movie is a perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is the site of a group of men trying to keep it in doubt, and Carpenter's score is a wonderful frightening heartbeat that further sets the sentiment of judgment and paranoia seaming through the movie. The cast is amazing, a solid collection of actors led by Carpenter fave Kurt Russell, while the effects used provide the right amount of cancer. But first and foremost, it is the end that is the chronic glory, an end that does not pander to the norm and is incredibly appropriate to what has gone before it, let's wait and see what happens, 10/10.
