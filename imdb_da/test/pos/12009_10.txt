I grew up outside Naila Germany (where they landed), all the details of the film were 100% authentic, the power lines they flew over, the curious neighbors, the grandmother told the kids they can't watch West German TV, etc. This movie brings many good memories back to those who are European, a great production from Disney ... The same movie in German has Klaus Lowitsch and Gunter Meisner using their own voices to translate the English version into German ... to German version they use also cocoa birds, a bird that is native to germany as background noise to tell you that you are in germany. I showed this step to many of my German relative and they really liked this movie. (These people made a prototype balloon that they had to give up because the materials they used were too porous and the other 2 balloons they used to escape. The burner problem was solved as they turned the propane cylinders upside down.)
