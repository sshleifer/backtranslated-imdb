Many Americans are lazy and this has manifested itself in our DVD watching. Many of us do not like to take the time to read an hour and a half (or more) of subtitles, so we choose not to see many foreign films. A movie that is totally worth your time, no matter how common a task you might think the subtitle reading is, is "The Green Butchers." It is by far the best foreign movie I've ever seen, and tops many American movies I've seen lately as well. It is a complex situation that is told in a remarkably simple and fun dialogue. The character depth derived from this movie is AMAZING. The way Svend and Eigel (sorry if they are misspelled) feeding each other's contrasting people is even spectacular! The actors were well-groomed and I very much hope that a sequel is under consideration ... it has very little of the Bjorne and what is the face ... just give me Svend and Eigel on a kind of journey with supporting characters and more fantastic dialogue! To the author of this fine manuscript I say: Write more! The story itself is pretty twisted but you will find yourself rooting for the bad guy anyway ... with no regrets. Please check out this movie!
