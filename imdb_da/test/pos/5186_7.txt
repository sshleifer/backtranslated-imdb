This is a disaster film in London. Starting several hurricanes, storm current and tornadoes in Scotland are staggered to the east, downing England coast and later south. After several hours of heavy rain, London's barrier over Thames cards is over and it paves the way for disaster. So, a colossal tidal wave journey is relentlessly down east causing destruction and life for millions of Londoners in danger. In the center of history, a climatologist (Tom Courtenay) is a climatologist who tries to save London from the effects of huge wave, trying to convince the authorities that the city dike was uncertain, in addition a marine engineer (Robert Carlyle) and his ex woman Samantha (Jessalyn Gilsig). They are trapped in the barrier and dropped to the sea. Meanwhile, the secret government body HQ ruled by Nash (Joanne Whalley) under direct orders of Deputy Minister (David Suchet) to control many displaced persons and to avoid more dead, approx. 200,000. They have little time to save London from total disaster. <br /> <br /> Perfectly acceptable drama disaster with okay action. Magnificent Tom Courtenay as a climatologist who predicts disaster and excellent Robert Carlyle and Jessalyn Gigantic as ex-marriage that re-teach their love. The movie packs impressive flood scenes, vivacious by the amazing computer-generator special effects, better than the classic of the 70s, such as. 'Earthquake, Inferno Towering' and similar 'Armaguedon and the day after tomorrow'. Although it is not a clear dismissal, we know that the flood is due to the greenhouse effect and global warming arising from the ozone hole. The movie is well directed by Tony Mitchell. I would recommend this movie to people who like disaster movies. Another flood adaptation is as follows: 'Flood (1976)' directed by Earl Bellamy with Robert Culp and Barbara Hershey; 'Hard rain (1998)' directed by Michael Salomon with Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater; 'Flood: a river's rampage (1979)' directed by Bruce Pittman with Richard Thomas
