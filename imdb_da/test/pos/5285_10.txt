Even from the very beginning title of this movie, I really love the art and canvas layout on one of the national islands in Japan. We see some beautiful rolling green hills and some oriental houses in a coastal town. We immediately look at the Pacific beauty on the wide-screen theater. And to prove how big this movie is, I have to say that Charles Darwin would be proud. Teachers of evolution classes and school science such as biology would greatly favor Hayao Miyazaki's brand new movie "Ponyo". The title character that you want to see can be the perfect animation icon for media to represent in all classrooms and auditoriums. <br /> <br /> In addition to the scientific aspect of all this, let's dive into the blue waters of this exciting story. We have a skinny, old and strong wizard named Fujimoto, who lives in a submerged and is cynical of man's urban expansion and their pollution of industrial waste. He wants complete control of the seas and the sweet appearance of peaceful aquatic life, including fish and organisms. Fujimoto, whose blood is composed to be half human and half amphibious, resembles an ocean loving anti-hero and antagonist; resembles the James Bond villain Stromberg in The Spy Who Loved Me, Running an Atlantis-dubbed Underwater Village. <br /> <br /> His daughter, whom he treats as an over-cared-for pet, is called Ponyo. She is a great goldfish that already looks like a beautiful red-haired girl. Her father forbids her from the real human world and claims it is dangerous and too much for her to handle. But frankly, Ponyo's explorative curiosity is as strong as her amorous nature. Gradually, with building forces resembling stunning scenes by Nick Park's "Chicken Run", she breaks free from her father's rocky and fossilized water town and swims to Japan's water surface, and for her luck and happiness, the caring hands of a youth ship's thoughts fall captain named Sosuke. <br /> <br /> Living in a sea front house on a neat looking beach (or crowded beach), Sosuke has two overtime parents, a senior home working mother Lisa and the first mate of a tank truck barge Koichi. Lisa seems angry with her spouse to be on a ship and leave her with all the housework. Even more, the black magic exercised by Ponyo causes an apocalyptic event chain: The Moon approaches the earth too dense and the waves rise from the imbalance of the tidal interaction forces, and humongous tsunami waves bring the peaceful but evacuated city. But what seems to underestimate this curse and seems literally stronger than supernatural power is the love and close embrace of the childish captain Sosuke and the sweet redhead Ponyo who wants to be a sensitive human than just a preserved fish. As the frizzly-haired and open-minded hobbits in the Lord of the Rings, Ponyo reminds me of it. <br /> <br /> I was able to rewrite and talk about this amazing animated movie, the best page "Coraline" that was in theaters in February. And right now, Hayao Miyazaki, attach your eyes to another 10-star class from your animation fan, Graham Abraham. The year 2009 can be filled with dozens of animated films; However, Ponyo is the highest film in many environmental beauties and should be dedicated as a new wonder of the world.
