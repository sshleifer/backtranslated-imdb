If it wasn't supposed to be a comedy, the filmmakers went safely. If they intended to be a comedy, they hit the mark. Our critic says Homegrown is a wonderful movie filled with family values ​​and community spirit, recommending it to all audiences and saying he really liked Jamie Lee Curti's performance. It deserves a theatrical re-release.
