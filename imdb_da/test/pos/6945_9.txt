Kennedy-Miller could hardly have done a better job of tackling a very challenging exercise: dry political events act as human drama and provide a uniform representation of explosive controversial topic. <br /> <br /> The key to its success on the first counter is brilliant acting, although I was less impressed with Max Phipp's performance as Gough Whitlam than some other commentators here. The clear standouts for my money were John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. The latter must have been one of the easiest choices for casting in history - Hunter could not have been more perfect for the role. On the second counter, the series avoids the "myth of objectivity" through a narrator who articulates the director's sympathy (Phillip Noyce, who recently showed his left vouchers in rabbit evidence), while being meticulously consistent and sympathetic in his dramatic depiction of all parties. Adherence to the Lady Kerr / Lady Macbeth theme popular among the Workers might have been a bit partial, but not ruinous. In particular, credit is due to the sympathy that appeared to Kerr and the unusually difficult position he was placed in what one might think of his actions. <br /> <br /> There is, however, a sour note that producers might not fully blame - the depiction of Jim Cairns / Jun Morosi affair. Those who come to the series without background for these events will get the impression that Cairns and Morosi were the innocent victims of a prurient boys press release campaign. Producers may have been prevented in this regard by Australia's stultifying defamatory laws, and Cairns and Morosy's recently demonstrated willingness to use them against those who suggested their relationship was sexual (which Cairns would eventually admit a year before his death). But more could have been made of the bizarre way in which Morosi led the Cairns office as a treasurer. <br /> <br /> Speaking of defamation, there are a few disorienting occasions where the dialogue is hidden due to regulations taken out of the offended protagonists - by a beeping noise on one occasion, and a very loud call on another. An additional curiosity: DVD release releases a line from the comic relief scene where a customs officer (played by late Paul Chubb) serves Tirath Khemlani on arrival at Sydney Airport. Next in the queue is a disheveled looking hippie who now only receives a misleading glare from Chubb when presenting his paperwork. In the original version, Chubb said something like: "Drug bust in Bali, eh?". Clearly, this line is no longer true in the wake of the Schapelle Corby case, which dramatically illustrated that those who busted for drugs in Bali can expect far worse than expulsion.
