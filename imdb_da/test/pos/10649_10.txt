Eisenstien's "Potempkin" (Bronenoset's Potyomkin) is among the finest films ever made and possibly the best of the silent era. Eisenstien was a pioneer in film form, and his use of montage editing has affected film to this day. Odessa steps massacre footage is just as powerful today as it was first seen over 70 years ago. Don't let me see the chance to watch this movie!
