I honestly found that Wicked Little Things was a very cool and fun horror movie. My friend had given it to me, and I really saw it as something other than a crazy low-grade gyro movie. When I saw this, I was wrong it was very sweet and very good, and while I say it might seem a little unnecessary at times, and although it may not be the best horror movie ever, it's still good. I thought the play was very good, especially from the girl playing the mother (she seemed very trustworthy and very pleasant to me). And even though it's a little clich√© and the best, it's good. All in all, let me say whether the after-film Horror Fest movie is not your style, so you shouldn't have anything to look at this, but if you like horror movies or a wicked little time than check out evil little things. 8.0 out of 10 stars
