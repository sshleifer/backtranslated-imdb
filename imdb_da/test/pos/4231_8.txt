The first Childs Play was an original and effective little horror movie. As expected, the two horrible successors seemed to spell the end of this franchise. <br /> <br /> Well, when I heard that they were making a fourth called "Bride of Chucky," I just rolled my eyes and muttered "When will they ever learn." <br /> <br /> But when I heard that they had a good director, Ronny Yu and a solid cast, including the impressive inspirational Jennifer Tilly, were my interest in it. <br /> <br /> This movie is extremely well done. It has a great sense of humor, highly stylized graphic violence, great filmography and the astonishingly sexy Jennifer Tilly stretching her most impressive stuff during the first half. (I should add that she is also a great actress.) <br /> <br /> it holds the tongue in the cheek without turning into the campy area. The doll's effects are good, and the verbal interaction between them is invaluable. It is more of a horror / comedy than just horror, but humor is welcome and well integrated. <br /> <br /> I've already heard that they're planning a son of Chucky. If they can match the quality of this movie, then perhaps this franchise will have made a legitimate comeback. <br /> <br /> rating: 8.5
