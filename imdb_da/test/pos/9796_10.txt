Where do I start? I first saw this movie in 1995 and had no idea what to expect, I was actually looking for movies that Elijah Wood had star in, and this one had come highly recommended. I sat and then filmed one time and didn't know what to think. I saw it another time a couple of days later, and the floods were just opened. Never before in my life did I ever really cry while watching a movie, and I danced, every high and low movie I ride right next door, on an emotional roller coaster. It hit such an emotional chord in me at many levels, the intense sadness and elation we see in the movie, the wonders of childhood and innocence, the longing for a time that once was, but no more. More than anything, this movie reminded me of my childhood (apart from the abuse) at a time of my life when I had pushed my childhood some years before and not even really noticed I had given it up and moved on to a life entirely without it. Radio flyer made me wake up and suddenly realized what I had given up without really noticing. From that day forward I immediately began to change my life and myself, and I did. <br /> <br /> This should sound corny, but basically I rediscovered my inner child, I started a path that has been going on for the past 6 years and has changed me so much for the better , to embrace and live that part of myself. I've found out who I really am. I don't think it was simply a case of the right movie that came together at a crucial time in my life. Radio Flyer really did something very special, and I still see it as an incredible piece of work in every way, an incredible movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, I cannot fail to mention the music. I am a big fan of Hans Zimmer, and this is among his very best works. The sheer breadth and depth of emotional expression he has put into this film's film is a big part of what makes the movie what it is for me. Like subtitles for a foreign language film, his soaring music is a crib for the intense emotions that this movie will take you through. Find the soundtrack at all costs, it was unfortunately deleted a long time ago, I never expected to find it, but it was great after chatting with someone I met on a Hans Zimmer fansite guest book. Watch this movie, let yourself live the emotions, don't get rubbish in the trivial nitpicking of the end, be it kid again
