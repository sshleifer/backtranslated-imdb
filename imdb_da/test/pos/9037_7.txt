Take a look at these faces next to the entrance to the prison. They are not Hollywood extras faces. Someone in production was really smart to take the film to Oxford, Mississippi, because you can't get that kind of authenticity from a study team. Extend the narrow dusty roads, the frozen soil beneath, and the skeletal trees barely hanging on. No wonder these faces look hard and unforgiving; they just reflect the land from which they come. Old man Lucas (Hernandez) fears his life better, but then he jumps from the same hard ground. The film works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor sentimentalises and even has excitement. Old man Lucas is not very sympathetic. He is a victim and we sympathize, but he is also arrogant and unfriendly. Wisely, the script refuses to set him up. In this way, we are forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the less sympathetic. The script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism, as it tends to be predictive and less effective. Instead, we show how easy prejudice can judge an innocent man and condemn him to a terrible death. So it is through our common instinct to see justice done, to postpone the effects of racism, a far more effective way. It also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable as they are otherwise part of the Jim Crow system. <br /> <br /> Note how the movie does not attack separation. It is doubtful that the old man Lucas will still interfere with whites, and there is no suggestion that even lawyer Stevens (Brian) will cross the color line except to see justice done. No, the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future as symbolized by the child (Jarman) whose head is not yet filled with "performances". He is not exactly friends with Lucas, but he has glimpsed the common humanity to be conscious of falling into the frozen river. The last line of dialogue also shows that he is sitting with his uncle, the lawyer, instead of his more hidebound parents (the dining table scene is important and easily overlooked). The lawyer may not be able to participate in a future civil rights march, but the child can. It is the movie's realistic hopeful side. There was a bunch of racing music movies during this short 3-year period 1949-51 (The Well, No Way Out, The Brave, Lost Boundaries Home). Even the reputable detached MGM came into the mix with this little gem. Unfortunately, the McCarthy purges in Hollywood have stopped "problem" movies that may not serve Cold War ends. Nevertheless, each of them is worth catching up not only because they are good movies but because they are even relevant over 60 years and Jim Crow.
