I love pop culture, but I was a little worried when I first heard about this. Then I saw an episode and I love it! I was a little sorry when I found out that Christopher Eccelson would no longer play Doctor Who. He was probably the best they have had. He fits so well with the sign. It's sad to see him go. I really don't think the new guy should pull the doctor and Eccelson. <br /> <br /> I think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some spots and creatures like the darlex. The story lines and signs can more than make up for it. I am currently waiting for season two and I will also review it if for some reason the quality falls. <br /> <br /> In any case, I think everyone should try to see an episode. I did, and I have loved it ever since. Well written, well-molded and well-produced, this show is worth the hour of viewing. Doctor Who gets a 10/10
