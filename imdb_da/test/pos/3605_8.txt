Captain Corelli Mandolin is not an Oscar candidate, but it was pretty good. I must admit that Mrs Cruz can really act. She performs a very good performance. In fact, she makes our girlfriend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to enjoy herself. I bet he felt he went back to his roots as an Italian. However, I learned something. A new chapter in the Horrors of Nazi Germany, the many Italian soliders killed during the period surrendering to the Allies and Germany's possible surrender.
