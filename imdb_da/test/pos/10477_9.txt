This movie is almost unknown, but it is very good. In a lonely Danish town, two old sisters live, who remember a distant youth, as they had to reject happiness because of a strict puritan education. Agree, then, they live in a worthy hassle until Babette, who flies from Paris, frightened by the scare of war, arrives. Within a few years she will be able to turn the goodness and love she received when she arrived. A good lottery prize lets her arrange a big banquet, according to the best rules for French gastronomy. All neighborhoods are invited (all fanatical puritans). They accept, but they commit not to show traces of pleasure or pleasure, as it would be a shame. But the seductive power of the delicious meal they eat is being seduced by the sensuality of French gastronomy. The banquet ends in a very felt, but quiet, happiness. The love between people has aroused. The miracle of emerging human kindness because of the pleasure of the senses has begun. The movie is surprisingly good, but it is not for every taste. During most of the film, nothing happens, everything is so quiet and so peaceful that for many minutes you can only see the lives of the inhabitants of the city. But as the film develops, it becomes more valuable when Babette wins the lottery prize (after 30 minutes of film), the show begins. With a perfect instruction, the author can show us how Babette prepares the banquet how she mixes all the ingredients with the most wonderful (Love), all told in a quiet way with perfect knowledge of photography and acting. So when the banquet passes by, the quality of showing us how the mood of all the eaters changes because of the meal, with only the first shot, with impressive filming scenes one after another is simply amazing. In addition, the pace of the colors and the photography is also fantastic, almost all scenes in the movie are like a picture, so there is work involved there. If you are able to admire good cinema and are able to realize that sometimes the way to tell you something than what is told is more important, it is your movie. If you fancy good meals and just love the good gastronomy, you will probably feel amused as most feelings of the movie will be familiar to you. An Oscar deserved. The only problem is its slowness in setting up the story, but I can forgive it (I hope everyone too)
