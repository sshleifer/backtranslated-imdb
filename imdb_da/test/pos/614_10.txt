I expected it to be good after I had seen some other ozone's amazing moments and read a lot about it ... but this movie is brilliant - clever, very light (emotionally and visually), perfect at all times. Every movement is there for a reason, everything fits so closely and initially true and honestly. this is the movie of beauty and innocence; Whether it's simplicity.
