I just watched a few episodes of this series on very bad VHS tapes that I recorded the series about. I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> Ramona is based on the children's books by Beverly Cleary and follows the fairy tale of the eight-year-old (Sarah Polley). She has fun with friends and family and comes in trouble like many eight-year-olds. All ten episodes are pretty good. "Mystery Meal" kind of brings me out as vegan, but it's fun to see that parents are trying to get their kids to eat the cow's tongue! And any episode that mentions Godzilla Versus The Smog Monster, twice, cannot be all evil. I like "Ramona's Bad Day" even more. Although it is discouraging to see Ramona go through a hard day, she imagines herself revenge on her friend Howie's uncle (a pre-Psi Factor Barclay Hope) who always justifies her. "The perfect day" is also good. <br /> <br /> Lori Chodos plays Beezus, Ramona's sister. I swear I saw her on something else, but IMDb doesn't contain anything besides this show. Unfortunately, this series is not on DVD. Why are all crappy shows these days on DVD except for something I really want to buy? An injustice if ever there was one!
