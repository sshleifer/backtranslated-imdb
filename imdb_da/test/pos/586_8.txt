A joy from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Muppets, then I just have to spoil you. This amazing movie not only reproduces the popularity of the Muppet - it is a well-developed and well-written film in itself. It has good songs, and it has the thread of wistful melancholy that was always present in Jim Henson's creations, and which is most personified in the character of Kermit the Frog. I have always responded to this as a child, and that is what makes Muppets still fun for me as an adult when other material aimed at children makes me mad. <br /> <br /> A large cast big name that appears in cameos makes this movie feel like a kiddie-sized version of "Around the World in 80 Days", except that it's about 80 times better. <br /> <br /> Degree: A
