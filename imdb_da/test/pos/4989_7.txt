Too much added with too much taken away from a great western, written by McMurtry about the Texas Rangers vs the Indian. This manuscript only takes it to fill this mini-series with many hot fuzzy relationships that were truly secondary to the main story. It ends up with an incredible and detached end that is not written in the book that makes you question how we should be transported to Lonesome Dove. The main characters of the series were indeed thrown very well, the movie sites were excellent, but this mini-series should have been true to what is a great book.
