This is undoubtedly one of my favorite Columbo episodes ever. The play is very well done, the music is very captivating, the script is brilliant, and the direction is fabulous. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk, who appears brilliantly in all Columbo episodes, works particularly well in this episode. <br /> <br /> Also amazing performances by Stephen Caffrey, Gary Hershberger, Alan Fudge and Robert Culp. The end is absolutely brilliant and I love the way Columbo describes it. <br /> <br /> This is a Columbo movie that won't go wrong.
