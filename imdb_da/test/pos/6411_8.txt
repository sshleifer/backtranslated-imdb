In the middle of The Hole I emailed a friend of mine to sum it up. Not sure if the movie would break into a series of submissive movements, I felt a little useless to recommend it, but then I saw the end. It's perfect. I've been living in Korea for 6 months, and this movie can just as easily summarize the weird enui and frustration of any Asian city that it takes on Taiwin here. It uses the myth of Hong Kong musicals in the same way that Godard or Hartley uses western musicals, but takes it to an extreme, it's gritty world and occasionally Kafka-esquire logic makes it all the better. I really feel that The Hole's closest comparison is Hal Hartley's survivor desire, but has a kind of gloomy edge to what ultimately hopeful and weird metaphorical films are. Yet this is what I wrote to Esther. You also hope The Hole. <br /> <br /> Hi, <br /> sees a feature called the hole. Taiwanese think I think a little strange to China unless it is Hong Kong. It is worth looking so far. It's about a guy and a girl in an apartment complex. the guy's ceiling caves in and the girl starts to get annoyed and well it's a bit of a strange metaphor for simultaneous joy, degradation and pain of a rather intense crush. There is also a kind of zombie virus sub-plot for and a lot of weird little scenes where the girl works out of her desires through rather innocent and quite fun 50's doo-wop sequences. worth a visit.
