People have often been uncomfortable with "The Merchant of Venice" because of its anti-Semitic subject. Fortunately, this film avoids it, and instead chooses to show how anti-Semitism ruled the highest in 16th-century Europe. The story, of course, is that Antonio (Jeremy Irons) needs money so he can help Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) pray for Portia's (Lynn Collins) hand in marriage. He gets the money from the Jewish shipowner Shylock (Al Pacino) who requires a pound of Antonio's meat if the latter does not repay the loan. When Antonio cannot repay the loan, Shylock is determined to get what is due to him. <br /> <br /> We expect this roll to do a good job and they do not disappoint. It's another testament to what a great actor Al Pacino is.
