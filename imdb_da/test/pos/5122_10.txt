Logan Lerman & Dean Collins III by Jack & Bobby Fame gives a good touch of acquaintance as friends in this though not as close as they can be to Jack & Bobby, but the expressions of young students taking their stand for a good cause is very well expressed in this movie.Logan Lerman can seem to be typecast in roles of being "different" as seen from here as seen in this as well as in Jack and Bobby.The Movie also opens up with a very nice melody like a lost 45 "And I wonder where the lions are?" A song that I had always heard on the speaker @ my old Job of ChristmasTreeShops and got it played on my local radio program by The Lost45s hosted by Barry Scott, but last time I suggested this with this movie as it is dedication, but the dedication was omitted.Environmentalist demonstration is well expressed in this film also for the protection of earth owls as seen in this movie too. What a hoot for this movie is. Hoot, Sogive a hoot in the tradition of Wo odsey owl advertisements from the 1970s too. Truly, Stephen "Steve" G. Baer et al. "Ste".
