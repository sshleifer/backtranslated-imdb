This movie was amazing. It is definitely a top 5 hitchcock movie. The director and camera images are almost flawless (except for the dog scene when he licks the hand of the hand, clearly in slow motion). The reason is well-written and realistic. It was very credible that an innocent man could fall into a trap like that. <br /> <br /> I would judge Bruno as hitchcock's second most interesting character (of course, bates are first). Robert Walker plays a very credible maniac. He did not exaggerate the part that made it credible (much the same, how perkins did not overdo his part). All in all, this is an excellent movie, an absolute must see for any hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> <br />
