A formula for murder is not a known Giallo, but that is not to say it is not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late in the Giallo bike, but more than many of the films released around the 'golden' period of the early 70s. Despite the lack of logic in some areas, the movie works mainly because of the competent way it blends Argento style death scenes with some really surprising plot twists and a wealth of well-defined characters. The film may not be as exciting as many other films in the genre; but this is more than compensated for the assured way that the central situation is fed to the audience and its tension. The plot begins by showing a false priest rapping a young girl named Joanna before pushing her down a staircase. We run so fast forward for several years, and the girl is now a woman who unfortunately is in a wheelchair. She is being trained for a sporting event by Craig; a man who also has romantic designs on her. However, his proposal is not met with the pleasure of Joanna's personal assistant, who also has romantic designs on her. <br /> <br /> The movie has a plot twist halfway through which forms the backbone of the movie, and while not entirely logical; It's good to see and suggest that you're in for an interesting movie. Director Alberto de Martino is obviously not afraid to show a couple of monstrous scenes, and the best thing about this movie is that a priest is killed by a spade - and I personally would not hesitate to mention this order as one of my favorite Giallo murder scenes! The reason can be a bit uneven at times, but in general the action is very good. The director uses it as an eternity at the end of the movie; but it is completely filled with excitement and the way it plays is good because it exploits all the plot points that have gone before it. The musical score, taken from Fulci's The New York Ripper, also works well in this movie, and by breaking a Giallo tradition, the Martinos films also have some pretty good plays from the carbon veteran David Warbeck and Christina Nagy in their only feature film. Overall, this movie is not one of the easiest Giallo's to cross; But it is worth tracking and coming recommended to fans of this kind of movie.
