When Melvil's "Pierre or The Oddheter" hit bookstores in 1852, his first publication since "Moby Dick" was a year earlier, the public response similar to that found among IMDB's "POLA X" reviews. Newspapers even published headlines such as: "Melville Insane!" which of course he was not. However, when comparing the writing formats found in "Moby Dick" and "Pierre", the latter finds a sharp deviation from the simple and often declamatory style found in the former. It was evident that he mimics the over-arched style of the now forgotten Victorian romances, which easily constituted his immortal "Moby Dick". However, he was not happy to show the kind of product his publisher wanted and it would certainly have sold. His version of a Victorian romance was perhaps a twisted, cynical, but brilliant synthesis. The alternative title: "The ambiguities" is quite appropriate. As Pierre seeks, and thinks he finds the truth, we become increasingly uncertain of what and who should believe. When looking for happiness, he becomes more and more miserable. <br /> <br /> "POLA X" is a fascinating adaptation of this novel, located in modern or almost modern France. Although it somehow leaves it a little bit to the imagination, and graphically shows us the incestuous relationships that Melville could only indicate, the ambiguities that create the novel and its message, so lovers, are in full swing. The questions it raises are those that few movies plan to ask, but the answers are left to the viewer. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading the novel, which is much shorter than "Moby Dick" before watching this movie. I hope more people discover this exciting movie.
