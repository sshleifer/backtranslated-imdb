It's probably the funniest thing I've ever seen - from the beginning to the end, it was perfect in timing, atmosphere, strokes, background music, battle sequences and anything else you could think of. To be honest, I find this movie as fun as their (Rik & Ade) sitcom "Bottom" - maybe even more fun. I laughed all the time through the whole movie and can only recommend watching this movie ... But if you see it without knowing (or like) what kind of comedy Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson have done before, you may not think so is fun to everyone - but I really can't understand those who don't like it - IT'S HUMOR PEOPLE !!! (People are hit with frying pans, guys are running around with red rubber underwear, green vomit that fills times, guys are kicked in b ****** s and get candlesticks in their eyes - how can it not be fun ???) 10 / 10
