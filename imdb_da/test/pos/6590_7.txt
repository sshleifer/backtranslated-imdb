So far, Miguel Bardem's career has been one of the more terrible for the latest Spanish cinema. He has just made nonsense ... until now. "Incautos" has been quite surprising: it is a serious movie with rhythm, with a great cast and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> The trick of stealing, that's what "Incautos" is all about. A movie that looks like David Mamet's "House of Game" and things like that. A thousand words in the manuscript, and a story where nothing is as it seems. <br /> <br /> The weak points of the latest Bardem movie may be the so-American language, making some of the characters look rather unnatural especially Victoria Abril. She is an actress, but in "inkautos" she looks a bit). Ernesto Alterio is not that bad, but he is not half as good an actor as his father ... And what to say about Luppi ?? Well, he's MAN. <br /> In short: a good movie. The best thing Miguel Bardem has ever done. I hope this is the beginning of a whole new stage in his career. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
