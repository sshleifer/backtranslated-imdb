Peak Practice was a British drama series about a medical operation in Cardale ?? a small fictional city in the Derbyshire Peak District ?? and the doctors who worked there. It ran at ITV from 1993 to 2002, and was one of their most successful series at that time. It was originally with Kevin Whately as Dr. Jack Kerruish, Amanda Burton as Dr. Beth Glover, and Simon Shepherd as Dr. Will Preston, although the doctor's list would change many times during the series. <br /> <br /> The series was axed in 2002 and joined a literal cliffhanger as two of the series' main characters fell out of a rock. Viewers wrote to ITV in their thousands, and a petition for a last episode was created by the Peak Practice Online site. But all the pleas were unsuccessful and ITV said they would not make any more episodes. Peak Practice was replaced by Sweet Medicine, another medical series in Derbyshire. It took a few episodes before it was dropped from the schedules. Cardale was based on the Derbyshire village of Crich, and the series was filmed there and in other nearby Derbyshire towns and villages, especially Matlock and Ashover. At the end of this program, ITV attempted to launch a follow-up series called Sweet Medicine, which extended the stories of various characters from the original show.
