We just finished screening El Padrino in Australia. A phenomenal piece of film work. We look forward to seeing many more movies from Mr. Chapa in the future. It was great to see such a well-composed film with such excitement and a story that must remain an instant classic. Watching a movie of great quality really outlines Chapa's serious potential and his talented skill as an author, actor, instructor and film maker. Chapa has impressed many with his triumphant "blood in and blood out" performance, and now he has proven to anyone who has seen his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed film producer with genuine artistic control. With his starring Kilo Vasquez being a perfect combination of Milo Velka from "Blood in Blood Out" and Al Pacino from "Scarface", the film will do wonders for us here in Australia.
