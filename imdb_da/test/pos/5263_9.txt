Most of the comments so far have nailed this right upside down. Viewers under "a certain age" and with three-digit IQs should avoid "Chance of a Lifetime" as a George W. Bush sets against a congress bar. <br /> <br /> Cast is composed largely of veterans who know the way around a well-written script. Is the condition wildly original? No, but the film stands out as a lighthouse at midnight in the current and endless glut of film / television directed at the most desirable audience demographic of teenagers and "young adults". In addition to Betty White and Leslie Neilsen in the lead, the cast has also ever trusted veterans such as Elaine Stritch and William Windom. The sharp dialogue is easily and effectively delivered by these professionals. <br /> <br /> "Chance of a Lifetime" is certainly not a movie for Will Ferrell / Adam Sandler / "Saw" slasher gore-fests, "American Eye Boring," and ninety percent of the rest of the sludge wiped out of Hollywood and TV.
