I think I'm a kind of Road Runner fan. I don't care how predictable it is to laugh anyway. 'Beep, Beep' is predictable most of the time, although it is also beautifully brilliant. Of course, Road Runner is being chased by Coyote and of course, Coyote fails to catch Road Runner with every new attempt. The plans Coyote comes with are very fun. You see exactly where it will go wrong and you will not be disappointed. Once you are a little disappointed, what you think will happen, not, but it makes the joke even more fun. <br /> <br /> If you like Road Runner shorts, you'll love this one. The predictable gags work and animation are great and pretty original at times.
