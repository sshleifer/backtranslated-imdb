I originally saw this several years ago while sitting on the couch and stuck to it on HBO. With the remote control out of reach, I decided to go with it and wait for a miserable movie that I had avoided for a year. So it started and I wasn't very optimistic about it, but after approx. Ten minutes I was laughing myself. The complete opposite I had expected. The comedy was smart, the play that was really good considering that the role worked really well together, and the story (although a bit awkward and false) was actually quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> Three prisoners brothers manage to escape their sentence and eventually hunt for their happiness. The film is set in the 1930s. So along the way they encounter a number of fun and interesting charatcers. Everyone has a different story or performance they strive for. In fact, the majority of the film may appear random. Some may say it was pointless and boring, but if you're looking for the clever comedy (and occasionally stupid) embedded in the movie, I'm sure you enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I liked the performances of George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. Everyone was very good at their roles, and they worked well together. But to finish it, "O Brother, where are you?" is a smart, fun and a movie adventure that I wouldn't let pass.
