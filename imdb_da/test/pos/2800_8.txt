"L'Auberge Espagnole" gathered the audience where it was shown. The total audience prices at many film festivals worldwide. And it's not strange. We have the ability to see a cheerful and astonishing work of art. And that is wise by the way. "L'Auberge Espagnole" is a very fun comedy about young people and grows up. But first and foremost, it's about light and shadows in living in the European Union. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is a French student of the economy Xavier. For his future carrier, he is sent to a year to study for Barcelona. In Spain it appears that the lectures are given in Catalan language. It probably won't help increase knowledge. But it helps to tighten the conditions within the group of foreign students. Especially if they rent a large apartment together. There are 3 girls: English, Belgian and Spanish, and three boys: German, Danish and Italian. Our French guy also comes there. One year is a very long time. Long enough to get close and make friends. And get to know some European stereotypes while trying to break them apart. <br /> <br /> Klapisch addresses this particular case of a process of uniting Europe with humor and without pecky didactism. He comes out of the idea that young people everywhere are the same. They like jokes. They like to make irresponsible relationships. But they do not neglect their expectations. The most interesting thing is the sum of the experiences of this small community. They live together in the fire in everyday tasks struggling with the surrounding reality. They are full of unusual ideas for life. Young Europeans come back to their countries to kill an adult alone. They are Europe's hope of fighting the many problems of the Union. For example, the scary management system. In the end, they show that they can not only communicate and make friends despite the many differences. But they also now how to live their whole lives. And they will not allow to take full of life away from them.
