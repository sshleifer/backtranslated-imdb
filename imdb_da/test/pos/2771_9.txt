know someone where I could get my hands on this video or movie for this. I have long sought to show my daughter to show her and I can't find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video, and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk. <br /> <br /> I saw this straight out of Disney back in 1996, and I think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has all sorts of emotions that appear throughout the movie. also has many actors who started their career with this movie. If anyone knows how to get a copy of this movie or has a copy and willing to sell it to me for like 50 bucks or something, please call 201-566-0148. thank you
