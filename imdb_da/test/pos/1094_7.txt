One should not be too critical of the Director's second function. <br /> <br /> I really like Madiba's camera work. As Mr Shawn pointed out, he had a unique way of looking at things. But how come a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful pictures? Remember, he has no education of any kind. I don't think English is the common tongue in Cape Town ghettos. Even worse, Madiba looks even less than his expected age of 14. Any way, if you overcome the above-mentioned peculiarities, you can watch the movie and still enjoy it because of a good camera work.
