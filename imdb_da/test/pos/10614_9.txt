I watched this movie over 20 years ago and still remember how much I loved it. It really touched me, and I thoroughly enjoyed noel cowards work on it. highly recommended: atmospheric and touching. <br /> <br /> I think of this movie from time to time and am disappointed that it has not had so much of a revival as many classic movies. had not realized I was seeking it today that it won an academic award for best original story for Ben Hecht and Charles Macarthur. It basically involves a scary character that destroys the careers of others and is damned because of it. He dies, but is allowed redemption if he can convince someone to throw a tear over him. The majority of the films show him in pursuit of this goal. well written and nice. I had known him for his acting so I was surprised to see him in this role on television late one night in New York. One has to see if you ever have the opportunity.
