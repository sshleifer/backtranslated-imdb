"Crossfire" is remembered not so much because its three stars all had the first name "Robert" but as one of the first Hollywood films to deal with anti-Semitism. The story opens with the murder in the silhouette of a man whom we later learn is a Jewish man named Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene). Pipe smoker police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) is awarded the case. An ex-soldier, Montgomery (Robert Ryan) arrives on the murder scene and we learn through the flashback that he had met Samuels in a bar along with other soldiers who were being patterned out of service after World War II. <Br /> <br /> According to Montgomery, he and pal Floyd Bowers (Steve Brodie) had followed Samuels and Cpl. Arthur Mitchell (George Cooper) for Samuel's apartment for drinks. Montgomery tells Finlay that Mitchell left the apartment first and that he and Floyd followed shortly with Samuel's still alive and well. <br /> <br /> Unable to find Mitchell, Finlay mistakes him about the murder. He calls at Sgt. Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) to help him find Mitchell. Mitchell has meanwhile wondered the streets in a dazed state. He meets the prostitute Ginny (Gloria Grahame) in a bar and turns up a friendship. She gives him a key to her apartment, and he goes there to rest. Unexpectedly, a man (Paul Kelly) is looking for Ginny. Mitchell, still in a drowsiness, leaves and goes back to meet Keeley and his friends. Keeley manages to keep him from the police and hides him in a movie theater all night. From Mitchell's perspective, we learn that Montgomery hates Jews and is probably the killer. Finlay begins to focus his investigation on montgomery trying to prove his guilt. He arranges to have one of the soldiers, a child named Leroy (William Phipps) sets a trap for mongomery. <br /> <br /> "Crossfire" is considered one of the best of the "movie noire" genre. In fact, it has received several Oscar nominations, including Ryan and Grahame for the best support actors. It was made on a modest budget in about three weeks. <br /> <br /> It has all the elements of classic "movie noire", the shadows, the low key lighting and the story that plays most at night. The necessary "femme fatale" of the play is Graham's Ginny, who plays a minor role but is nevertheless your classic "femme fatale". The unnamed character played by Paul Kelly (in a brilliant bit) has been chewed and spat out of Ginny and was she doing the same to Mitchell? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan stole the image as the brutal Montgomery although it would write cast him in similar roles in the coming years. Robert Young makes a good low key detective, but Robert Mitchum has little to do other than being friends with the Mitchell character. Others in the cast are Jacqueline White as Mitchell's wife, Lex Barker (who would go the following year to play "Tarzan") as one of Mitchum's soldier's palace and Richard Powers (formerly known as Tom Keene) as Finlay's assistant. Executive Director Edward Dmytryk would soon run by The House Un-American Committee as having communist affiliations and spending a few years in prison.
