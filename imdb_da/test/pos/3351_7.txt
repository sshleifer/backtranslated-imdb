Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll story is much better than you might expect. Here, Alice is a virgin librarian who falls into the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self-image. Produced at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a nice little movie more like the low-cost movie today. Despite what you might think, this movie actually has a good script with fun jokes and good songs. It's a scary little tale for adults. If you are wondering if my recommendation is a good one or not, you do not think that the movie was just about available in its non-hardcore version for the better part of the last three decades, simply because the movie stands up with sex, which is how I first watched the movie many years ago on cable TV. The relatively recent home video release on DVD puts sexy back (in horribly grained inset clips), making it clear that the removal of shots was the best choice around. If you are an adult adult with a taste of something spicy, I can highly recommend this little movie as a good diversion.
