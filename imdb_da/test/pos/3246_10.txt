This movie gives you more idea of ​​how the Australians work. Although The Castle is a great Australian movie, it's a little out there. This movie is by far the best Aussie flick I've seen (haven't seen Dirty Deeds yet) and probably would be my favorite movie. The point is, if you haven't seen it, you should see it. If a crime / action / comedy is your thing.
