I saw Marigold on an example that showed a few days ago, and found it to be a thoroughly exciting and fun movie. The film is about a not-so-successful American actress who goes to India to trade in a low-budget film, only to find herself stranded there when she finds on arrival that the film's funding has disappeared along with producers and investors. A chance encounter with an Indian film shooting nearby leads her to be hired for a small dancer role in it. As Indian films contain a significant amount of song and dance, this is a problem for Marigold, who has two left feet, not to mention a personality so dearly and the thorn that she can hardly hear the music, let alone feel like Prem, the filmographer's choreographer advises her to do. <br /> <br /> But "prem" - the word - not the person - means "love" and Prem - the person, not the word - seems to embody that feeling in the way he deals with him all over, whether it be are his production assistant friends who introduced Marigold to the shooting film, the narcissistic and arrogant wires of the film or the bitchy and uptight Marigold himself. Soon, he finds Marigold's feet - literally and figuratively - during his expertise and welcoming treatment. I have to say a word to those who are not familiar with the use of song and dance in Indian movies. Unlike American musicals, the story evolves through these dance figures, as plot development unfolds, and character transformations occur in parallel with the dance. It should also be emphasized that Indian dance is about much more than just movement. An essential part of it is the enactment of the dancer's feelings and feelings while telling the history of dance. This is the main purpose of the dance and the dancer. <br /> <br /> At Marigold, when this stage of achievement is demonstrated in a fantastic dance halfway through, when Marigold, when she performs the dance, she must do it for the film-inside movie, also expressing her love for Prem . It's a great achievement by Ali Larter, especially when you find out she's not used to dancing in her movies or resisting her character's feelings through dance. It shows her abilities as an actress, as well as how much hard work she has put into the role. Of course, no romantic movie can work without a credible Prince Charming. Salman Khan, who plays Prem, fits the role of a T. Even when it turns out he is a prince not so charming, he does not lose the audience's sympathy. Salman has been the ruling Hindi cinema (sometimes called Bollywood) for many years now, and it is worth remembering that his first leading role was also Prem. He is completely charming, sweet, sweet, sexy and vulnerable. For those who have never encountered him on the screen before, be prepared to be hit with megadosas of pure magnetism! He and Ali Larter make a lovely couple and they are just as well suited to their behavior as in their appearance. Will they be able to solve their problems? It doesn't work as we hear the film's last song, a nice mix of facts and imagination, reality and metaphor. The ending certainly took some of the audience, I looked surprising, but they were left satisfied. The songs are used very wisely. They are in Hindi, without a title, for the film-inside film, and in English for other occasions. But their meaning is always evident from the context and choreography. <br /> <br /> Marigold is a very satisfying romantic comedy - yes, there is also a lot of humor in it. The Indian places and costumes give it a fairy tale quality that fits a story that is comparable to a modern adventure. <br /> <br /> If you are or have been curious about Indian cinema but were hesitant to try it, this is an excellent introduction. It captures the colors and liveliness of the Indians, not only in costumes and jewelry (which is quite impressive), but also in the lively dances and the world's sound music. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Ali Larter, you should see it for her brilliant acting depicting a selfish, demanding, "high-maintenance" woman who still has an inner attraction that inspires two men's love. If you are a girl, you will enjoy admiring Ali's lovely costumes and ogling her bastard by a leading man. If you're a guy, you can't just admire Ali in his sexy costumes, but learn from Salman Khan what it takes to bring out the loving heart, even from such an edgy as Marigold.
