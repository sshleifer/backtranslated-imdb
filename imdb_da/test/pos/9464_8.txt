First, I honestly thought it would be a corny movie. But after seeing this, I was totally surprised. Amanda Bynes was convincingly fun with the supportive cast (Especially the character played by "Bullet Tooth Tony" from Snatch. What a contrast role between the two movies!). Now I am not one to say whether an actor is good or not, but her action was especially pleasant. Though the plot was run to a teeny-bopper, love threesome (though it's very fun) halfway into the movie, I think this shouldn't discount what I think the movie really is: simply entertaining. So if you happen to stumble upon it, whether you're at DVD or theater, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
