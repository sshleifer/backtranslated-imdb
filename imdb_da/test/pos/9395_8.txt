Okay, it's not easy to confuse this with the lame Stuart Gordon movie called "Death Bed" that came out a few years back because it is "The Bed That Eats". And how do I even begin to describe this? Well, first of all there is of course a bed that eats. This is due to demon droplets, which naturally affect most things, I think, in a negative way. The bed is in the neighborhood of some old servants or something, and has been responsible for the disappearance of very few people in his time. We have a narrator who is a ghost who sits in the wall behind a painting and gathers all the non-edible treats (jewelry, etc.), as the bed goes on. He died of consumption, one of the few people to put in the bed that was not eaten, probably because he was ill, he theorises as we see him hacking blood in hankies ..... bleah. Things about this movie are having a very strange sense of humor, but it's all played beautifully deadpan. The movie is divided into several "actions", I guess "Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Just Desserts". For fans of the incredibly strange and bizarre, it may well be right up your alley. All I can say is that you have to see this one to believe it, it speaks well of the description. 8 out of 10 stars.
