The director of Kannathil Muthamittal directed the first Indian movie I had seen "Dil Se", which led me to buy well over 122 hindi DVDs in four months. I can say I understood the overall attraction, I was <br /> <br /> confused as to why the movie would stop for "music videos". It was an excellent movie, I didn't know what to do about the dance and the female vocals were a little shrinking for my western ears, but somehow I found AR Rahmen's score hypnotic. I bought the soundtrack the following day and then Lagan, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G the following week and with the exception of "Ichi <br /> <br /> killer" a few other Korean movies, I can't be bothered to see much else . Kind of strange for a person who has only seen a strict diet on Hong Kong, Horror <br /> <br /> and Action / Science fiction film for the past 30 years. But I had to come back to Kannathil Muthamittal, it's one of Mani Ratman's latest efforts, and I laughed, cried, got totally angry, scared and most of all, I didn't feel manipulated. The action was amazing, the photography was beautiful, I think you could stop the movie at all times and would notice that any frame would be worth painting. The music fits perfectly to the movie, and after <br /> <br /> the credits rolled, I would look again ... so I did. <br /> <br /> It would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you might miss the joy of seeing the events unfold and the characters evolve. It's about a great movie! I stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over! <br /> <br /> My wife now looks and I can't wait for her response, I can't expect it to be any less than mine.
