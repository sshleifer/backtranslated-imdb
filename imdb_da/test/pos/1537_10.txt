This movie gave me recurring nightmares, with Alan Rickman's voice representing a omnipotent, insidious, fascist ruler. The scariest movie I've ever seen - psychological terror is more powerful than any "horror" movie has ever achieved. Alan Rickman's voice will always represent me of a totalitarian state's power and terror, reminiscent of Orwell's 1984. This film describes to those who do not care about the reality of much of the current world governments. This movie is disturbing, but in a way everyone should see it - it is a description of a reality that no one should ever experience, but so many do.
