I must have seen this movie about four or five times already and it gets better with each view. That's enough to say: This is the best movie I've ever seen. And I think I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> But I've always wondered why this movie was cut off in some reviews or reviews. For example, take the IMDb Top 250. Why is it only on # 216 (from today)? Surely the answer is not in the film itself (for it is nothing but faultless), but in reception. The film caused controversy in its depiction of compassion for a doomed killer and its anti-death sentence. And of course, the more conservative mind could probably not use the movie (as you can see from some of the other comments). So DEAD MAN WALKING gets a ranking that is nothing but ridiculous in terms of its quality. These people did not understand what the film wanted to say, and perhaps they would not understand being the death penalty. So now I get it: It's all political. You are a death penalty - you do not like (and therefore will not hear) what the film has to say. I am really sorry that there are still so many people out there who just reconcile when a new perspective questioned their beliefs. <br /> <br /> Mr. Robbins, your movie is the problem divided by people's opinions. Some considered their point of view, some simply did not listen, but you made a very important point. Your movie will probably never show up on any "TOP 100 MOVIES OF ALL TIME" list, but it will be remembered, long after movies like Braveheart or Babe or Apollo 13 (all of which were unwanted favorites over your movie at the 1996 Oscar) forgotten. Congratulations, Mr Robbins, and thank you for this important piece of filmmaking.
