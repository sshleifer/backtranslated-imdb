What is often neglected about Harold Lloyd is that he was an actor. Unlike Chaplin and Keaton, Lloyd did not have the Vaudeville / Music Hall background, and he was not a natural comedian. He came to Hollywood to shop; and he discovered that he had an ability to act fun - first in shorts and then in a row. He made a name for himself as "Lonesome Luke", a Chaplin knock-off; With the "glass character" that made him the all-American boy instead of a grotesque, Lloyd found his step and his films became some of the best produced in the quiet era. He developed a reputation as a "daredevil" in some shorts and kept this in some of his best films ("Safety Last", "For Heaven's Sake", "Girl Shy"). He was more popular than either Chaplin or Keaton during the twenties, and he became very rich before the appearance of sound. <br /> <br /> The first sound films were often disasters. To get the most out of their "sound", too many dialogues were used in many films. <br /> <br /> After two decades, Lloyd's acting skills were geared to silents. He didn't have a bad voice; Its high pitch fits his "glasses" character. And his sound film was not the unqualified disaster in the legend. Still, silent movies were recorded to a high art (especially Lloyds, who was not on the budget and was extremely well-off); With the introduction of talkies, the movies had to learn to go again and they made some mistakes. Although he tried to move with time and embraced sound, Lloyd's best bits from his early (overly talky) talkies were still visual - such as The scene in "Movie Crazy", where he appears to be in a swimming car, but actually "hitched to ride" on his bike. <br /> <br /> Trying to resume the daredevil antics made him famous as he did in "Feet First", was mistaken. (In "Safety Last", his best movie and the one who with profit or not, Lloyd pushed the box like a "daredevil comic", he played a certain young man and climbed to the top. "Safety Last" had a natural structure He climbed up to his grading on the side of the building, apparently scared, but his fears added to humor, and in "Feet First" he accidentally came across a scary building scaling position and his scary cry for help frightened humor. His character was pathetic and cringing, aspiring to save the throat - possibly a precise statement from the 1930s, but not entertaining). <br /> <br /> Harold Lloyd was not spoiled in the past as some Wacky Norma Desmond. He embraced sound and tried to take his films in different directions, growing and changing with the industry. When Feet First failed, he left the daredevil business and made a satire on the talking movie industry, "Movie Crazy". Just as he had to flock through many films like "Lonesome Luke" before he cut his place in film history with the spectacle, he had tried several directions in sound film before hitting his steps in sound as he did with "The Catspaw". <br /> <br /> In "The Catspaw" he plays a missionary's son bred in China, who inadvertently is elected mayor as the front of corrupt political interests. When he finds out the truth, he sets himself up in the task of cleaning up the city. Only in his early eighties could Lloyd still act the brash young man. <br /> <br /> But "The Catspaw" was another box office failure, and Lloyd made only three more films, including "The Milky Way". Of his main competitors, Chaplin still had quiet films in him, and Keaton was hopelessly mismanaged. "The Catspaw" and "The Milky Way" suggest that Lloyd could have mastered the audio comedy if he had been a little younger, or if the audience had given him the benefits of the doubt after his early phases of sound. <br /> <br /> Although the film has been unfairly wrong about the way Lloyd's character cleans up the city, it fits him. From his days in "shorts", Lloyd wanted to scare his audience, and the climax of "The Catspaw" achieved it again in a surprising way; Until the trick is revealed, it seems cruel, and then the laughter comes. <br /> <br /> Seen as a product of its time, "The Catspaw" is charming and fun. A very well-written audio comedy, well acted by Lloyd. Directed by Sam Taylor, its curious mix of drama and blurred humor makes it look almost like a Frank Capra or Preston Sturges comedy.
