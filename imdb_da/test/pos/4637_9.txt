I would watch this movie every time it was on cable and it never got old. Who can forget about some of the best lines in film history? --- JOHNNY'S FAT BOY CITIZENS !! JOHNNY'S FAT BOY CITIZENS !! and look between the happy melons! I used to wish that I could drive across the city in a treasure hunt as fun as this. It's an all-time fave and I'm happy to hear it's out on video! I am positive that this is where MTV got its original premise for the Road Rules series.
