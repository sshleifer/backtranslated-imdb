Having seen John preform this one of a friendly show, I had to share ..... It was really something to see an adult man portraying himself as a child. I like the fact that with each character he "became" you could see how they looked. It is more entertaining when you can understand the individual. "Freak" is what true "stand up" should be. John is really talent.
