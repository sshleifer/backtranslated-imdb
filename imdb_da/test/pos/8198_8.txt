This is an epic film about joining the ancient kingdoms of China in the third century BC What makes it interesting is the king's tragic downfall and the entire palace's intrigue is around him. It reminded me of a little "King Lear" and some of the other Shakespeare plays. The King begins with noble ambitions to unite the kingdoms under a ruler and to stop all the quarrels so that people can thrive and live better. He and his childhood sweetheart, played beautifully by Li Gong, draw a scheme in which she pretends to exile in a rival kingdom to recruit an assassin to kill the king and thereby give him a pretext to go to war. But while she's gone, the king becomes sadistic in her desire for power and goes on a killing spree. <br /> <br /> There are many pages that keep the action going. There are awnings that pretend to be stupid and fabulous, but who is really very smart and wants to be king himself. He fathers two children with the king's mother and manages to keep it secret for years. Then there is Prime Minister, a political rival to the king who turns out to be his father. <br /> <br /> The assassin is a complex character himself. A skilled swordman and murderer, he undergoes a reformation when the king's lover comes to recruit him. He wants nothing more to kill, but eventually won by Li Gong (who wouldn't be?) When he sees how cruel and vicious the king has become. <br /> <br /> Some spectacular cinematographs, especially the battle scenes performed on a large scale - as they used to say, a cast of thousands, literally. The action is ok, nothing special. It is the story that is interesting, but in over two and a half hours it pushes the limit. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
