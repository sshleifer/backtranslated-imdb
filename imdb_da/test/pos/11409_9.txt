I was recently at a sleepover birthday party with five other girls all my age (eleven.) All of us, thinking it would be a harmless little movie that Jaws decided to rent it with the Rat Race. (We looked at the Rat Race after a stranger calls to ease our fears.) We put the movie at. 11 at night and put together in our sleeping bags that hide behind the covers mostly. I screamed five times, which is unusual for me when I get scared in movies, but never scared to scream actually. <br /> <br /> We were all scared to leave the bedroom as we were all positive, Stalker (Jenkins as we called him for some reason) would get us. I played an average trick; one everyone was all off when the rat race was over, i hid under my sleeping bag and said quietly and low "HAVE YOU CHECKED THE CHILDREN?" They all scraped like nuts and were so scared. All in all I would rate this movie a 9. All I didn't like was that 1. There were too many false alarms when Jill thinks that Stalker is there and 2. The kids never woke up until Jenkins kidnapped them and hid them in the closet, at which time they all did cry like babies. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes thriller. But one thing: I'm not BABYSITTING at. 21:00 ever again1!
