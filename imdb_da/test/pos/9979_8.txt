Rainy day with not much to do. We surf the movie network channels and found this just started, so we gave it a try. The more we saw, the more we were engrossed in history. Its the old story of the working class underdog trying to do it in a sport that at that time (1913 I think) is usually played by the rich upper class, but this movie was just as interesting as Seabiscuit and it is also based on a true story . <br /> <br /> The play is trustworthy and the casting is brilliant. AND. . . . We are not golfers, so be sure not to miss this just because it is about golf. Any individual sport would serve the plot because it is about the people. Golf works well for this story because of the class distinction and snobbery that seems to involve some playing the game. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. . . . It's a good movie. It is well put together and it is not always fun to see those who think they are better than others taking down a stick or two.
