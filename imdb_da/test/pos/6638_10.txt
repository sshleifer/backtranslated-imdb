This movie offers one of the greatest experiences for filming. It is by no means a pleasant movie, but offers realities and feelings that the human mind may never have had to touch. It opens up ways in which an individual thinks, and afterwards will change the person forever. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was in class, and immediately after seeing it, I had to skip my next class and walk around campus to reset my body and mind. I felt destroyed and somehow unreal, as if I didn't exist. It was only a few months later that I told one of my friends about SHAME, and she asked, "Oh, is it when you got messed up after seeing it and ran into me and talked all about it ? " I didn't even remember driving into or talking to anyone at all outside that day, I was astonished. <br /> <br /> In plot terms, it is the simple tale of a few torn apart at war. Those suffering are bigger than the dead and in the end ... there are no words to complete the image that Bergman creates. It's like a terrible dream that makes you wake up, change your own reality forever. This movie should be seen.
