This is a movie that is much more entertaining than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways it is like a 50's version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS - with much of VALLEY's overruns and sleaziness polished a bit for the public in 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on Fast Track for success - but this time it is in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (although one of the ladies in BEST OF ALD has ambitions for Broadway). <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Hope Lange joining the company for his first business day. She is awarded to hard-as-nail boss Joan Crawford, who appears in her first supporting role for decades. Despite how creepy Crawford thinks, Lange is determined not to give in - to do so in this job. And over time she quickly moves up the line from secretary to editor. At the same time, her two new roommates also try to move up the row - one through the stage and one through a relationship with a rich playboy. Like DOLLS VALLEY, everyone has theirs up and down (mainly downs), but at the end of the movie there is hope that at least some of them will do it - battered and broken. Nonetheless. <br /> <br /> In this movie, men are mostly pigs. The only guy who seems decent is played by Stephen Boyd, so of course Hope Lange disappears for a ne'er who does good ex-boyfriend. As for the guys played by veteran character actor Brian Ahern and the rest, they are sexist foam and finally you understand how Crawford became so bitter and wild. <br /> <br /> This movie has it all - adultery, premaritalism, abortion, etc. and is certainly not an artistic triumph. But thanks to excellent production values ​​and a juicy script, this is a joy to see. Just don't expect Shakespeare !!
