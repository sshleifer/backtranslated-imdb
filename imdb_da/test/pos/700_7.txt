This is simply a good old fashioned western .. not too complicated or long. It does not deceive by thinking that it was made, but for entertainment. Still, it is one of the westerns you can see once and finish off without returning. It has former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford whose friendship is strong despite Ford's Cheyenne Rogers being part of bank robbery (he even steals Scott's Sheriff Steve Upton's horse without knowing his good friend as he thieves). In the red valley, Upton is under great control for a bank robber who ended up with several dead. Claire Trvor portrays Countess Maletta, a friend of Cheyenne who gives him and his friend "Nitro" (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams) a place to live for the moment. Cheyenne wants to go straight, but finds it difficult when Jack Lester (Bernard Nedell) and his bad crowd will rob Red Valley's bank. It's actually Jack who is behind the murders, but Cheyenne's troubled past is hard to get away with. He and Nitro will be accused of the murders they did not commit (the robbery was a Cheyenne not committed) and it will be Upton who somehow has to save the day before Lester gets away with murder. There are subcategories that include Cheyenne's in love with Alison McLeod {Evelyn Keyes; The irony of the story is that Alison's father, Uncle Willie, is actually in cahoots with Banker Stanley Clanton (Porter Hall) in a planned unified theft with Lester stealing the town of Red Valley's lodge}. Will Upton uncover Uncle Willie and Banker Clanton's treacherous scheme? Will Uncle Willie be able to go through it without his conscience always bothering him? This movie has a fantastic barroom brawl and a dandy of a climactic shootout. Columbia couldn't have chosen a better genre to start the dyeing process, as this movie has some fine mountainous shots that men hunt for horseback and so on. Don't expect to have your socks blown away, but the movie is simple and good paced.
