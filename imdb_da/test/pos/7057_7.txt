I just saw this for the first time in 10 or 15 years ... maybe close to 20. In some ways it was better than I remembered ... in others it was much worse. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is the music. It's just awful. There are only 5 songs in the movie, most of them used more than once. The opening song is sung by a choir of annoying children, and the disco-y title track is performed by Rick Dees. It won't get any worse than that. Even the background music is horrible, with much of what repeats the themes of the other nauseating melodies. We also get some really lame slapsticks, mostly in opening points. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Bill Murray is spot on brilliantly as usual ... you have to ask yourself if he ad-libbed it all or if the authors just gave him all the fun lines. Or maybe he's just as big - making a weak manuscript for comic genius. The best part is his surrealistic PA messages. ("Hummer ... get out of here ... you are a threat!") <br /> <br /> You also get much more character development than you have the right to expect in a movie like this. At least half of the characters seem like real people ... and mostly real people you want to have around. Even "Spaz" gets one more than any other Eddie Deezen-type character ever done, and when he gets the girl, it's plausible. (She is not absurdly hot, but he does not automatically mate with one of the nerdy girls - see "Revenge of the Nerds" for examples of both movie phenomena.) And when the plot seems klichéd ... Now ask yourself if It wasn't a cliché yet when they did this. Although it was not the first summer camp movie, you should go back at least to "The Parent Trap" - this is definitely the movie that made it into its own genre. In fact, I was surprised that there was no Talent Show scene ... "The Wet Hot American Summer" spoofed the summer camp genre so perfectly, I just assumed everything in it came straight out of meatballs. (I'm also half-expecting Jon Cryer to pull up a convertible with a chimpanzee, thanks to "Mr. Shows" epic camp-olympic spoof "Monk Academy"). Nevertheless, this seems to be disappearing a little as far as the late 70s / early 80's comedies - it is no longer a cable clamp, and certainly does not have the cult of Caddyshack or Animal House. I was happy to catch it on Showtime today - and in High Definition on it! Sure, it's pretty awful in spots, but you can do much worse in a 70's / 80s teenage comedy. And again, Murray is a genius.
