The Centurions are one of the best cartoons ever, and it must be put on TV and DVD so people can have younger generations enjoy a good show that is far better than the waste they have made in the last 14 years. I have a petition online that is on the website address Http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html, which originally tried to get this show in five days a week, but now try to get this show on the DVD page The TV station it was focused on has poor public relations. We all need to convince the people who own this show to put it on DVD so it can be seen by future generations. Also, since Hasbro Toys owns the toy line in this show, we might try to convince them to make a live action movie of it as they did with Transformers and once this year G.I.Joe. We need good cartoons like this to come back and enjoy the younger generations. Please sign this petition so we can one day get DVDs from the guys who are famous for shouting "Power Extreme!"
