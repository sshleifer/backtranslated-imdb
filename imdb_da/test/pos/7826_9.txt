It's very easy to find out why The New Professionals was a dud, at least in New Zealand: it didn't just follow the original footsteps, it followed Bodyguards, which exhibited the show significantly with its boss and to-agent formula . Cmdr McIntyre was a last-day George Cowley: tough on his team, but one who would defend them to death against others. The shade exhibited was huge. <br /> <br /> Well, not as big as it should have been in the UK. Here it became the network network in prime time. It was even marketed in the promotions as: 'They are the professionals.' Someone else clearly noticed the difference. We were fortunate enough not to have this show released in different regions at different times. <br /> <br /> It was the high production values ​​that sealed the deal for me. As other reviewers have noted, it followed the British tradition of an hour shareholder, but blended into personal items at the same time. There is a slight undercurrent of something that develops between Liz and Ian, even though it never distracted one from the real plot. Most episodes were based on inflammatory diplomatic events, the kind of things that help Spooks together from time to time. <br /> <br /> Unlike many 2000 series, the plot was not sacrificed at the expense of fancy pants photography or over stylish direction. Directors like Christopher Young kept up the pace and did their job. They used good places, which made Bodyguards slicker than if it had been shot in the back and spawned. It was modern, it would still stand up beautifully today and it was one of the better examples of British actions in the 1990s, showing that Britain can still make them better than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Maybe apart from the Germans and their cobra 11.
