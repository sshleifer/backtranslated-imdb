I think if they are not a brother, this movie becomes very common. how long were they able to keep this? if we were shared, what should they do? so natural feelings, so ordinary and barren words. But I was crying almost in the night blood relationship brotherhood love knot film. in another word, the older brother is very sweet. If they are not brothers, they will not have as many forbidden factors, from the family, society, friends, even their hearts from the beginning. The older brother is doubtful whether he is coming out or not in the beginning. Maybe the little brother is there with his brother for so long and even does not get any praise from his father, it made him very sad and even sad, maybe it is a key blow, let him feel that no one in the world loved him, except his beloved brother. And I would say that this is such a human natural feeling that there is nothing to be ashamed of, you may fall in love with your mother, brother, sister. Just a faint heart looking for the backbone to trust
