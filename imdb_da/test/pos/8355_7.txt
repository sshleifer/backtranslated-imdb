Oh well, it's not a bad movie. It's good, and I like the introduced characters. I also like Lady and Tramps more in this. <br /> <br /> But I'd like to see Lady And Tramp more. I know it's called 'Scamp's Adventure', and I love Scamp And Angel to bits, but it's a sequel to the original, in my opinion I should just publish it as 'Scamp's Adventure', not 'Lady And The Tramp II' ': Scamp's Adventure'. <br /> <br /> Tramp had a right role but he didn't have much time with Lady. <br /> <br /> Yet, the songs are quite good, and Scamp and Angel are sweet. I've seen better followers, but hey, it's not a mistake. <br /> <br /> I give it 7/10. Very good but still lacking.
