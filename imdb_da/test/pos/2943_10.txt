I usually don't like watching movies while they are still in theaters because of high fares, but I did see a poster for some things that stays and I thought, "The young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the one usual blonde teenybopper BS ". So I decided to take the plunge and watch this movie on the opening night. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this movie without expectations. I didn't really know what it was about, but the red feelings and honest teens experience expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling quite satisfied with my decision. Alberta Watson also did a fantastic job as the role of Tamara's afflicted mother, and I must also add that I was totally impressed by the comic stylings of Megan Park as Tamara's friend Brenda. <br /> <br /> The film was wonderfully directed by Gail Harvey and pulled together in the kind of kitschy 50 way that leaves you feeling warm and happy, even though the story didn't tend to be so uplifting. I also thought the movie was well shot, many beautiful pictures of a 1950's landscape will remain in my mind for the coming weeks. <br /> <br /> This movie as a whole was quirky and great. I found it unpredictable, and although the story ends in a slightly open way, I was still satisfied. Whether you're looking for a fun yet powerful story, or just want to recall life in the 1950s, I guarantee this movie is for you. Even if you have no expectations, it is still very likely that you will be most impressed. Give this a shot!
