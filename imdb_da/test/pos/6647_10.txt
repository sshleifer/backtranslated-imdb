I can't remember a movie that so full shows the emotional destruction of war as the mirror in a single marital relationship. The focus of the film is the association between Ullman and Von Sydow - the two are in each scene. Throughout the film, they experience a rollover - one has the strength of survival, and the other is reduced to emotional escapism through dreams. Both will lose a measure of humanity, but one more than the other. The characters and viewer go through periods of closeness in the vicinity - the camera pulls out and away, the sound disappears, words are lost, only for the camera to return to picturesque close-ups of its facial expressing stars. The confusion and fluctuation can make this movie difficult for some viewers, but it is all useful during Bergman's master hand. I believe that the use of a "false" war makes the movie timeless, as relevant today as ever before, and by focusing on the human relationship through war, the film is relevant to everyone. The couple could be someone. The film is not grounded in space or time, but rather in feelings. A unique and effective war film, unlike any other. Bergman's film is virtuosic in presenting human relations - that he would bring this to a war movie is masterful.
