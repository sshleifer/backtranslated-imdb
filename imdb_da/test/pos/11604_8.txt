I bought the DVD a long time ago and finally came around to watch it. I really enjoyed watching this movie because you don't get the chance to see many of the more serious better quality movie movies like this one. Very well done, but I would say that you have to be aware of what is going on, as it is easy to lose. When you start watching the movie, don't do anything else! I would actually advise people to read all the reviews here ... including those with spoilers before watching the movie. Raima Sen gave her first amazing performance that I have seen. Aishwarya was easy on her. All performances were strong, steering and filmography ... go see it!
