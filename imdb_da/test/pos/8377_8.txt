A fast paced and entertaining noir in Vienna right after W.W.11. Donald Buka is a refugee who cannot find lawful work because he has no papers. No papers mean no work permit, which means no way to get a passport. He survives by driving a friend's cab at night. If he gets caught, it means three months in prison. One evening he picks up a fare at a big hotel and drives the man to an airline office. Belly takes the man's luggage in and returns to the car. There he finds that his customer has acquired an unnecessary hole in the back of his head. What to do? Call the police? Without a work permit, they will really hit him fast. No, he needs time to think this out. He drives to a remote place, empties the man's pockets and stores the body. He now has an American passport and lots of cash! He falls off an underground contact to get the passport changed. Now he just has to go to the man's hotel and collect the man's flight ticket. His ticket to freedom! It would of course be too simple to say. Waiting for the hotel is the mistress of death, Joan Camden. Camden is on the run from his rather scary husband, Francis Lederer, Lederer is of course the pig who had hit the man in Buka's cab. Camden calls the police when she thinks Buka has robbed her lover. The belly shows his new passport and manages to speak his way out of the mess. Camden goes down when her hubby Lederer appears at the police station. Lederer convinces police Camden has suffered a mental breakdown and she is released to him. She escapes again, finds Buka, and the two decide to flee the country together. Lederer puts a look again, and Buka must decide whether to help Camden be free of his freedom. This movie is much better than I make it sound. The belly is best known as the low-life cop killer in the 1950s "Between Midnight and Dawn". The film was produced by actor Turhan Bey.
