This movie is a little slow at first, for about the first 10 minutes or so. But when it kicks in, you can't turn it off. Adam Beach and Rose McGowan play the best parts and are good at their plays. You could never guess who the killer is. I gave this movie a 9, because in some parts Adam Beach needs to talk a little so you can hear what he says. 9.10
