As another of the most recent over-the-top dramas brought by us by Hollywood, this film distinguishes where others have completely failed (especially in view of the most underrated performance in the recent dramatic character portrait of Natalie Portman, this movie is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry shared by both Susan and Natalie. They seem to be so natural during the film that you will confuse them into a real family. They go through so many mother-daughter conflicts in history, it's hard not to pick up their actions. I feel that these two actresses picked up talented recordings where the story was missing and almost too familiar (full of cliches) and really saved the suffering plot. I would recommend this movie primarily to those who like one of the two actresses or such over-the-top drama.
