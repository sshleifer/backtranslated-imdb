"Strangers on a Train" was one of the movie classics I had always heard of, but somehow it never came to be seen. I finally saw it a few weeks ago, and as always with a Hitchcock movie, it was not just for the time being, it was far better than most thrillers that were made today. You can see the inspiration for future action movies here - the climate that ends with the incredible joyful round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the great action sequence at the end of Jan de Bont's "Speed". "Of course," Strangers "are over forty years older than" Speed ​​"and contain no modern special effects, but the visceral excitement is there - Hitchcock was a true genius The non-subtle homosexual side of Bruno (Robert Walker in a great performance ) has taken shape in many other psycho-stalker characters in future movies, consider him a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Single White Female." He knows about Guy before he even meets him on the train - we almost get the feeling that their contact is no coincidence - and is soon obsessed with him. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock loved the Oedipial elements of his movie (see also "Psycho" for more blatant undertones) and there is much of it Here, Bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother, his uniform ways and blatant homosexuality must have just struck off the censors in 1951 when gays were not "allowed" to be portrayed on the screen - Hitchcock nevertheless receives notice effectively, when we see Bruno in the lounge on the phone wearing a very non-masculine robe, flirting with Guy and responding to his mother. <br /> <br /> The deep layers of this movie make it a fast-paced thriller than you can return to again and again - unfortunately it is recreated as a major budget Hollywood production, but after seeing the original can I honestly don't imagine anything that exceeds the pure white bone tension of this movie.
