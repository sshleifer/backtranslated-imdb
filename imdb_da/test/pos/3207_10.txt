I am not the type of person to watch T.V. shows, because the play usually sucks or it is unrealistic or too dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality, and Lorelai Gilmore is best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little fun. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She prides herself on wanting to participate in Harvard and boys / boyfriends always come second in his book. She is a loyal friend and always a peacemaker. There is subtle romance that I like, personally. Not the lush, gushy romance that not many people have in their lives, but a realistic type of romance. Every character gets it eventually, and they don't find their prince's charming at first glance, and they don't just fall in love with every guy who comes their way. It's a realistic show, but when you see it, you better brush up on your movies, pop culture and random facts, because Lorelai Gilmore always makes references. I fell in love with this show and if you give it a try, then you will too.
