This often maligned movie is a must for fans of Blake Edwards, Julie Andrews, Henry Mancini or Hollywood musicals. Other writers have commented on the shift in tone, confusion of plot, etc. But the film has many things to recommend it. Scoring is one of Henry Mancini's best (and he has written many wonderful), several songs are sung to perfection by Andrews, Julie's performance is nuanced and she is embellished in some beautiful clothes (she is here quite gracious here), on -location shots are breath-taking and there are some fun Inspector Clouseau-type sight gags to boot. Rock Hudson basically called his performance, but he's pretty good. A real curiosity is that it was the last big movie Julie did in about 10 years and in many ways is a precursor to Victor / Victoria. It is great to watch and listen to. When will it be available on DVD ??? When that is the case, I would like for both of the versions - the longer and shorter, the director's cut. Since it was lampooned in S.O.B., they would make a big two-pack!
