So the movement in Paris in May 2006 ... I discussed between it and mission impossible ... I am very happy that I choose OSS 117, not just because it was fun, but it might as well see a FRench movie in France. I had a good time ... would recommend it. It's important to have some understanding of French society today to really enjoy humor in this movie ... can't wait for the DVD to come out ... I don't know how some of 'jeu de mots'' puns' would be translated into English I will definitely buy it when it's out! P. S. I looked at 'BRice de Nice', which is a movie starring Dujardin, which all children talked about in France. this movie is a comedy, but sillies than you can imagine ... by comparing both films I have to say that Dujardin did a good job in OSS 117.
