I watched this movie in Santa Monica on August 23, and it has stayed with me. I would like to thank the filmmakers for digging into the details of Harry's enigmatic, eccentric, life. And also to show the shortcomings and mistakes of Nilsson the man. Thanks for showing the good and bad, ups and downs, and for uncovering the amazing BBC footage. The film is also a good showcase of a large amount of Nilsson's music, very well placed throughout the film. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good documentaries, especially if you are interested in Harry Nilsson or the music scene in the early 70's. Some reviewer on the Is It It Cool website wrote that this was the best movie movie they saw at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and I think so. The film is informative, fun, sad, touching and full of great music. It succeeds at all levels. Really really good.
