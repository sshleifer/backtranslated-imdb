This movie is excellent. Not because it does anything special or new, but because it is consistently large in all its parts. No part stands out as "groundbreaking" or "stellar", but all parts are far above mediocre and that makes me an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> I own several copies of this movie and can acquire it on collectors DVD or Blu-Ray, one day (right now because of high blu-ray prices and of course the face that I don't has a blu-ray player ... but it is next to the point of this review). It is a kind of ordinary, but quickly becomes a drama filled with tensions, action, highly portrayed characters, and a well-though plot that keeps you interested until much end. <br /> <br /> Wait, no, it doesn't start with ordinary. <br /> <br /> It starts like a Qun. Tar. movie WANTED it could be. With a fantastic scene where an attempt to buy coffee and a donuts goes ... very, very wrong. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, nothing seemed like it, and a few people have died, and a few people are very rich. I will not tell you who ... look and enjoy! Overall rating: 10/10, A **, Excellent!
