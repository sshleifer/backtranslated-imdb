Eve is an eye-opener, because of the amazing scenery and tech-no music in the background, we hear. This film shows a good aspect of the human body being God's creation and taking it into account, viewers can better respect the legendary story of Adam and Eve (whether true or just an adventure depending on what we believe) from watching this movie. Actress / model Inger Ebeltoft's imitation of Eva is so good, there is no good word to describe her performance, and I can't imagine having another actress Eva. This movie for me comes in really handy for that type of stress relief therapy. We had never fallen so relax so before from watching this movie. This film is a masterpiece, God would have liked this movie to be made in the first place! <br /> <br /> Mr. Razbin!
