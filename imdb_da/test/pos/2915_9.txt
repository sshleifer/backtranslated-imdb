This is not what you would call a happy story. The title leading character (Edmund Purdom as THE Egyptian) does not get mad - though he (?) Obviously gets the last word, the otherwise most important tragic figure (Michael Wilding as the political myopic Pharaoh) ends tragically and the wrong guy ?? Even though it is Victor Mature, the winner wins all the marbles. Peter Ustinov might have been the best part (Kafka) and may have stolen some, if not most of the film, except the top picture Jean Simmons as the slightly lighter than the average barmaid (Merit), which may have more on the bullet ?? intellectually and spiritually than all the rest of them put together. <br /> <br /> The burning and pessimistic Sinuhe doctor (that is, Purdom) is portrayed as a dark, cynical, tortured soul who spends the whole plot ?? his lifetime, seeking the meaning of 'life'. (Btw, and to rewrite John Lennon, 'Life' is what happens while you make other plans.) Excuse the lack of philosophical depth in the previous parenthesian comment, but ultimately the plot unfolds to reveal just that! <br /> <br /> And when we speak philosophically, as if things aren't morose and negative enough, John Carradine (like the un-named grave robber) pops up in a cameo role in the middle of the girl's life. is meaningless and is only worth living as a bad alternative to the ultimate ultimate disappointment. So here we are over 200 words in, and I haven't really got a friendly word, so why the heck did I rate it so high? Well, there are a lot of Shakespherian tragedies and lots of moral worth in it. There are ethical contrasts, true friendships, true and untouched (almost) love, and - despite the limitations of the 50's production capacity, it is very good (sound) staged, pleasing both eye and ear and very good / even pace. The action is mostly uniform very good ?? as it is a 50's costume drama, and the interactions are credible right down to the 'fatal flaws of the characters - which are abundant, thus making it fair to the best of the Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> There is some redemption, Sinuhe discovers and embraces his son ?? played by Tommy Retigg, who, despite Ustinov's best efforts, really needed Lassie to pull it off. A few other 'wrong' souls get their just desserts ?? the 'foreign' fleshpot Nefer (Bella Darvi) ?? Apparently, in Egypt, a carnival exploitation work, which formerly spooked Sinuhe - and the dyke princess Baketamon (Gene Tierney as Pharoah Wilding's sister), who knew a deep dark secret of Sinu's ancestors, then tried to use it to oppose him , her brother Pharaoh ?? nice people, huh. <br /> <br /> Purdom's performance is actually something to see. He carries the dirt well enough that a place before the end of the pixet you will slap him over the pillow, grabbed him by the lapels and say "see dummy pulling you together, the glass is not half empty, it's half full!" ?? and so that you are personally disappointed with Horemheb - truly Sinuhes best friend (Victor Mature as Pharoah's top soldier) for himself to have the error of his character that prevents him from succeeding in doing anything positive. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the secret for the whole movie is that it achieves very quickly and then maintains the necessary "suspension of disbelief" and at an early stage you get understanding and concern for the characters that stick to the point that you really are sad and their missing chances of happiness; a happiness that otherwise was not so far from their understanding. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why this one is not already on DVD and hope it will be fixed soon.
