This movie brought me to tears. I must say that if I didn't have a beautiful man at home, I would ask this beautiful work of art to marry me. Aaron Carter gives a masterful performance as a confused young pop star, while Timothy Barton writes quick and witty dialogue that only promotes the genre of Carter's performance. Kyle is pretty gay, but his performance was nothing short of spectacular. He is also very nice and sweet. I am thinking of asking him a date and giving him a very nice good night gift.) <br /> <br /> If you want to discuss this movie in the future, please contact me. <br /> <br /> Nick Burrell Vassar Class of 2012 Malibu, California Malibu West 310 924 0126
