It was very sensitive very deeply. It's my favorite all the time, you can't watch movies more deeply than this incredible movie. Susan Sarandon did her role as a matured mind actress, and she realized her role. She deserved the prize. She convinced me to be a nun. The music was very impressive and sensitive. Really I liked this deep masterpiece.
