Back to me is a movie you want to own. It is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. The story, though seemingly impossible, strives for divine intervention when a man loses his wife in a tragic accident and finds the love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver provide warm-hearted performances like the nominated to-lovers who come by chance. But the real story lies in friends and family around those who love and support them in probation. Carol O'Connor as Minnie Driver's grandfather is authentic in all scenes. Bonnie Hunt as a friend whose white and encouragement emphasizes Minnie as a 'sister' is fun yet warm in the scene especially with James Belushi as his husband. Classical scenes and writing make this story so entertaining and touching to see over and over again. Thanks for making a movie that shows families and friends so closely knit caring people who love each other through difficult times.
