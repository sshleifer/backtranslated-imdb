When you sit down to watch this movie "A Cannon for Cordoba" you get the feeling that it will be a great one. The reason? The film begins with an exciting score by the noted composer Elmer Bernstein, who gave us such memorable themes as "The Great Escape and The Magnificent Seven." In fact, when reading the opening circuit the headlining cast is none other than George Peppard as Capt. Rod Douglas, you know it will have action and much of it. And when you see actor John Russel playing General John J. Pershing, you know you're in for a heroic tale. The story is taken from the annex of the Mexican Revolution and involves the United States in a border city conflict with the Mexican bandits crossing the Rio Grande in the early 1900s. The revolt of the rebels is General Cordova (Raf Vallone). With his army of Mexican revolutionaries, he attacks Pershing, kills his men and steals some valuable artillery pieces. When the US Army cannot enter Mexico legally, Capt is sent. Douglas on what is slated a suicide mission without orders and without the help of Pershing. His mission is to retrieve the cannons, destroy a rebel battle and bring Cordova back to life. By choosing the toughest, toughest, most experienced, certainly the most outrageous men who are vacant, Douglas enters Mexico and attacks the almost impregnable fortress. Dramatic action follows, like lots of explosive tension. If you ask for criticism, I would say the choice of weight. Vallone and John Larch are not particularly threatening. Not so with the men sitting with Peppard. Pete Duel and Don Gordon (Who's amazing.) Nevertheless, this movie is recommended as a good show. ****
