My family and I don't usually look at local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time. <br /> <br /> The trailer "Nasaan ka man" caught my attention, my daughter-in-law and daughter are so we took the time to see it this afternoon. The film exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the actor fantastic. Jericho Rosales was really good, so is Claudine Barretto. That I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective in his role. I have never been so touched, moved and touched by a local movie before. Imagine a cynic like me dabbing my eyes at the end of the movie? Congratulations on Star Cinema !! The road to go, Jericho and Claudine !!
