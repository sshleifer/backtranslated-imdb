There was a video out in America called 'Cartoon Scandals' that presented about an hour's worth of forbidden cartoons. <br /> <br /> Most of them were World War II. This was where I first saw (and heard about) this one. <br /> <br /> The opening news broadcast cock turns into a grab with an Asian face that says 'cock-a-doodle-doo thank you.' After that, it's eight minutes of propaganda played out as a newsletter. Viscously racist, but when you look at it as a piece of history, it is (can) be forgiven. <Br /> <br/> Slices ration cards to make sandwiches. <br /> <br /> Showing the ruins of Rome while calling Moussolini 'Ruin # 1.' <br /> <br /> A minesweeper uses a diet. /> <br /> A manned bomb with the pilot says 'RET ME OUT OF HERE.' <br /> <br /> And of course stereotyping. Each Japanese was drawn with big teeth, constantly bending and saying 'please' at the end of each broken sentence. <br /> <br /> The Funniest Bit? The air raid siren, there were two bow men sticking each other in tush with pins. "oooo-OOOOOO" <br /> <br /> Hi AOL. Leave this one out. It deserves notice. My wife laughed at this. And she is 100% Japanese.
