Focus is another great movie by William H. Macy. I first discovered Macy in Fargo, and I've seen a couple of his films and he hasn't yet deceived me. Macy is the archetypal "nice guy with something to hide". In Focus he plays the role of Lawrence Newman, a loyal and hardworking stiff who has his disabled mother at home. The scene is set after World War II, at the height of McCarthyism. Newman is the head of Human Resources for a company that is basically anti-Semitic. After he accidentally hired a woman of Jewish descent, he was asked to buy a pair of glasses to improve his failing vision. <br /> <br /> Amazingly, the simple act of buying glasses has major implications for his life and that of Gertrude Hart, his wife (played by a great Laura Dern). As the film unravels, Newman will begin to see a completely different world where it is Jewish, akin to being an animal. The film is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was quite normal. The chilling thought is that sometimes it is probably still.
