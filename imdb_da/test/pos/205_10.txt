I'd like to tell you a few things before considering watching this movie. If at some point you thought you had seen good camera work, be prepared to be amazed at this movie. For the record this film was made in 1957 in Russia, but the technique used here is probably something we have seen much later in the Western world ... about 20 years later. The level of emotion through the film varies quite a lot: happiness - life war - despair-joy, but ultimately you remain with something completely unique: the joy of watching a masterpiece of filmmaking. The young directors of our time should study more this kind of movie and maybe they might create something similar .. even though I think movies like this are very hard to get past ... If you've seen "I'm Cuba" So, this movie would appeal you a lot, but if not, be prepared for a unique experience. The Russian leaders have something in common: very small budgets, great actors and a joy of creating art ... and yes, they are able to create more masterpieces than the whole Western world together. I'm not a big fan of Russia, I actually hate everything that is communist, but the film in that part of the world is capable of creating such emotions that are hard to describe. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it. </ br /> <br />
