"Crossfire" is apparently a killing mystery, but what distinguishes it from other similar films in the period is the killer's motive, which is anti-Semitism. The story highlights examples of the kind of ignorance that burns bigotry and contains references to a "hillbilly" and an Irish immigrant who also suffers from abuse because of their ethnicity. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is based on Richard Brooks' novel, "The Brick Foxhole," about a hate crime where the victim was gay. It is ironic that this story of some form of intolerance must be met with the intolerance of the censors, who stated that for that particular screen version, that type of bigotry should be changed to anti-Semitism. Another irony is a soldier's behavior, which seems to be extremely proud of having served in a war against the Nazis and yet embracing their hatred of Jews. The director and producer of this movie also suffered another form of intolerance as they were blacklisted after being called to appear for the "House Un-American Activities Committee". All these points just seem to emphasize the deeply rooted and cumbersome nature of the whole problem of bigotry as depicted in this film. <br /> <br /> When police chief Finlay (Robert Young) examines the murder of Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), he discovers it at night when he was killed, Samuels had been with a group of soldiers, and one of These were corporal Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell (George Cooper) quickly identified as the primary suspect. Further information is also gathered from Montgomery (Robert Ryan) who is another of the soldiers present that evening and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), a friend of Mitchell. Keeley, with the help of other soldiers, searches for Mitchell, and when he finds him, he hears what he did on the night of the murder, including his meeting with a dance hall called Ginny Tremaine (Gloria Grahame). Keeley helps Michell avoid being arrested and trying to identify the killer. Ginny Tremaine has been questioned, but her information is insufficient to prove Mitchell's innocence, but Finlay's investigations lead him to recognize the motive of the crime, and subsequently create a comprehensive trap that causes the real culprit to postpone his own guilt . <br /> "Crossfire" is a movie with a message and the identity of the killer is revealed at a very early stage in history. The "message" is conveyed in a way that was undoubtedly appropriate for the period in which it was made, but according to today's standards, it seems rather heavy handed. The cinematography of J Roy Hunt is just amazing with low key lighting and creative use of several strategically placed table lamps that combine to create a look that is perfectly compatible with the drama being played on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite being a low budget production, "Crossfire" was a great box office success and has benefited from having an absorbing and highly relevant story with a fantastic cast, two of which were nominated for Academy Awards for Best Support Actor (Robert Ryan) and Best Supporting Actress (Gloria Grahame). The additional nominations for Edward Dmytryk (Best Director), producer Adrian Scott (Best Picture) and John Paxton (Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay) are just further evidence of the positive recognition that this movie was rightly receiving.
