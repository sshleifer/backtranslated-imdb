"Here On Earth" is a surprisingly beautiful romantic tale of Samantha that has both boy problems and health problems. As her love for her current boyfriend, Jasper, falls away, her love for Kelley flourishes as a new spring flower. <br /> <br /> I found this movie very touching, very warm, very romantic and touching. I enjoyed every bit of this movie ... and it's pretty rare! I highly recommend this movie to all movie lovers! This is a movie you will not miss !!! : D <br /> By the way ... if you are a very sentimental person who easily cries while watching movies, WILL KNOW !!! On the other hand, it was a really great movie !!! Very romantic ... and surprisingly good !!! : D <br /> <br />
