Can a mentally challenged black youth be a catalyst for reconciling people in a South Carolina city? The answer seems to be that despite his disability, James Kennedy, understood much more than what he was getting credit for and went on to become a fixture in the sports scene. Also in the film says how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if we only have the patience Coach Jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart. "Radio", directed by Michael Tolllin, is a formal film inspired by a true story. Yet the film is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances that the director was able to get from his wonderful cast. <br /> <br /> Coach Jones is helping get the young man named Radio because his passion for collecting those involved in sports is a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has only had hard blow in his young life. Coming from a Bad Background, Radio, lives with his mother, who is protective of him and asks questions about the coach's intentions. Radio is seen by the schoolchildren as a mascot, initially his sunny disposition wins him acceptance of all because he is a good person without an evil of his body. <br /> <br /> The movie owes much to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. who make a great couple as coach and radio. Sir. Harris, one of the best actors of our time, is never boring in anything he likes with his presence. He gets the essence of the principal coach who sees the opportunity to do something for something that plagues him from his past. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also at its best to portray the mentally challenged young man. <br /> <br /> The support molding is excellent. S. Ephata Merkerson, one of the best actresses of his generation, makes interesting work as the radio's mother. Alfre Woodard, another good actress plays the college principle in style. Debra Winger has only a few scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> "Radio" while you are sentimental will warm everyone's heart because it shows how we tend to see that some people are in our society that we do not know and where quickly we shall judge them. Michael Tollin puts many ideas in the right perspective for us.
