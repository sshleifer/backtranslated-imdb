I swore, I would never allow myself to object to the false government figures in the sixties who told me it was better in the good old days? The current Australian Prime Minister is a sordid example of such a mindset. <br /> <br /> But I switched over to "A decade under the influence" because I found watching the much-hired "Sneakers" movie about the second channel such a vanishing experience. I found the values ​​of the "Sneakers" interviewers too ugly to accept as reasonable. So materialistic! Then devoid of any kind of violence in a society that can imagine killing someone to steal their very ugly shoes! So, for some valuable purpose, they need to report without interruption, the exploitation of an audience by having them hold these shoes over their heads to lock a sponsorship deal with themselves with a company of cobblers just too much to continue to watch. <Br /> <br /> "A decade under influence" depicted a completely different answer to the fruit of stupidity, corruption and concupiscence in high (and low) places. <br /> <br /> I have noted the change in film making it accompanied the exposure of US disastrous foreign policy debacles in Vietnam and so many less reported sites on my website www.peterhenderson.com.au. "A decade under influence" documents the exact time when the change took place. Before the 1970s, the armed forces were depicted in American films as an invincible combat force consisting of decent people who transmogrified to conquer heroes on the battlefield. After the seventies, they are generally portrayed as a vanished rabble deceived by a bunch of bureaucracy in the Pentagon. Before the seventies, the FBI agent and the honest politician used to be depicted as your friend and protector. After the seventies, the FBI agents were all incompetent, and the best thing a policeman could strive for was ignoring their stupidity and his superior corruption and maintaining justice in his own idiosyncratic way. Before the 1970s, archetypal American "little guy", "average joe", the Jimmy Stewart type would come down over the problems and thus gain insight into the underlying wisdom of his chosen leaders and justice in the "American way". After the 70s, Kevin Costner uses this role, but now he is a voice crying out in the desert, because evil is being postponed or accepting his party and doing the best he can. <br /> <br /> Now, these "old time religion" mindsets have been removed by any honesty and justice and portrayed (with some degree of justice) as devotion and self-serving hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> "A decade under influence" tells it as it was. "A decade under influence" tells it as if it is now. It portrays the redemption of the American film industry from the hands of artistic, moral and intellectual bankruptcy studies. It shows the storm of the Hollywood Bastille by the independent filmmakers who promised to get a disillusioned and tired audience back in the theaters. The fact that their mistakes were numerous, and sometimes disastrous, just underlines the magnitude of their achievement. A performance reflected in the adventurous and questionable attitudes of the big box office stars such as Clooney, Daman, Affleck, etc. And the directors and producers who deliver the vehicles to their talent.
