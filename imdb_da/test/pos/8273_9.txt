When this was first sent to the Masterpiece Theater, it had a profound impact on me. It's beautiful and busy. I immediately read the book by Mary Webb, and it's still one of my favorites all along. Janet McTeer is wonderful as Prue, and I fully expected her to be regular on the British drama scene. I think she chose to focus on the British scene instead. <br /> <br /> I hoped that with the American success of Janet McTeer years later (with Tumbleweeds), this movie would again be available to us. Unfortunately, it has not yet been released on DVD. If anyone out there listens, make it available again!
