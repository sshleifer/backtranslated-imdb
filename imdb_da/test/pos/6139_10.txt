William M. Thackeray once said "A good laugh is sunshine in the house." As I looked away, I had to say that the sun was shining in my house. This movie was amazing, the opening was very wise done, the story held well in a nutshell two fish'n chip shop owners, who are usually enemies forced to form an alliance of sorts to engage in a David and Goliath fight against a fast food chain that builds a restaurant on their street. The ending was hilarious, although I have found many who disagree with me on one. <br /> <br /> However, the movie was very discreet and portrayed modern Australian ethnic stereotypes, especially the collision or cultural collapse, if you want between the traditional Anglo-Australian and Italian Australian stereotypes, and how they found some sort of "unity, even though ", very nice. <br /> <br /> I found Vince Colosimo's performance as "Tony Stilano" an Italo-Australian fish Chip Shop owner in the thirties to be first-class, his action was very genuine and compelling, through his accomplishment really managed to bring the essence To the surface, or to say the soul of the Italian Australian stereotype, which is not all too Italian, but not Australian, Colosimo found that balance, breathed into the lungs and gave it life. Cinematography could have been better, more pictures of the local area would have been nice, from what I can see it was in Melbourn e, but where in Melbourne? for me it looks like somewhere between Ivanhoe to Bullen, though I'm not 100% sure of it. <br /> <br /> I don't know why so many people compare this movie with "The Castle", though they have similar themes running through them, taking away stands in their own league. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was great with a capital "E" it has everything, it's fun, the jokes are amazing it deals with modern issues with the Australian community, the story goes well, I loved it ! I highly recommend it.
