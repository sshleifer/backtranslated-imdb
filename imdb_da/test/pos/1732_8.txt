I just looked at the season 2 final of Doctor Who, and apart from a few boring episodes, this show is amazing. It's a boring loss that we say goodbye to a protagonist again in the season finally, but the show goes on. The BBC needs to increase the budget on the show, there are only so many things that can happen in London and the surrounding areas. Also, some of the special effects, even though they are very good, in the odd occasion must be a bit more polished. It was a great game for the BBC to bring back a show that lost It has been a long time ago and they have to be congratulated for doing so. <br /> <br /> The role of Christmas 2006 especially was the Christmas Eve special in 2005 by far the best on TV.
