I went to see this because I have some friends in the Ukraine. But the film moved me beyond what I had expected, by turning out to be a perfect blend of belly laughing (alex strange use of English) situational comedy and heaviness that borders on depressing. I loved the interval. It made me jump into an old car and make way to the Ukraine. alex (hutz) plays his guide part perfectly and gives a good counterpoint for elijah woods' poker face seriously. the film shows the positive side of humanity when ppl of different cultures can bind and do the right thing when they feel sincere about the situation, even when they entered it with preconceived notions and prejudices and how this can open doorways deeply buried Memories. There is a lot in this movie.
