I went to see this mindset, it would be a great comedy and a comeback for Robin Williams, but when I saw it, I realized that I had listened to commercials as this is more drama than comedy, even though it has a couple really good laughs in it. It felt like I was watching two movies. One was a fun body with Robin Williams who should have been the whole pool for the film anyway, but you also get a techno thriller movie with political anxiety in the middle. I really don't know how to classify this movie. But I can tell you it was good, and I laughed, not as much as I had hoped, but at least Williams is back in the right direction. See this but know before it goes it's not all comedies and is a bit intense.
