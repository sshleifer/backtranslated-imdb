Tagline on the box comes, "100 TRAPPED PASSENGERS ... 3,000 VENOMOUS VIPERS!" You should almost admire the degree of "no chance in hell we will ever deliver on this promise" bullshit. I could admire the Asylum's hucksterism more, so if they made movies that you know were good or at least worth a curse. Haha, and that's what I like about these movies. They are garbage. You put them on a toilet and then you flush. It worth the price if you are a fan of cheesy movies. It can become a cult classic among many fans. Gore scenes are effective, there's not much I can say, it's a Z-flip that parody the new movie with Samuel L. Jackson, hell, it might be better, so who knows it!
