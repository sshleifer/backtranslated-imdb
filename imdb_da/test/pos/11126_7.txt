"Fame" is a very well done portrait of the students living in New York City's High School of the Arts. The film focuses on a group of students who dream of doing great while perfecting their craft at the now famous school. Director Alan Parker allows each of the highlighted students to mature on the screen so you can feel a connection with each one. The music here is contagious and fun. The dance is exciting and fresh. The movie gradually became the basis of an Emmy winning TV series with Debbie Allen and some of the other actors from the movie. One of the more pleasant "dance" films from the 1980s. Received Oscars for music. 8.10
