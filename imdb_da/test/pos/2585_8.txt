Me and my roommate got free tickets for a pre-screening. I suppose you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I expected something controversial, provocative, unnecessary overdone, etc. But the movie is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It is not overdone, and the film is made in a careful balance, so you do not get scratched or say it unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> It is very well composed and does not care too seriously. It's the beauty of it. If it tried to take it seriously, it would have failed tremendously, but instead it carries itself through humor (some unintentional) and some surprisingly good plays by Ricci. Although Timberlake fails in its role, the movie is good enough to put it on the page. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this movie, if not for any reason other than the fact that it's something different to experience.
