Sequels is a moody lot with most places not close to the size of origin. Sometimes you find a sequel that is considered better than the original, some critics (like John Charles) have stated that Project A2 is better than the original, I disagree with something, but this movie is still a valuable follow-up and fits in well output of brilliant Hong Kong action cinema in the 1980s as well as Jackie's own work. I wonder how such a fantastic release of great films that his later films were not so good. He has only directed two films in the 1990s and none before, but he has had much complaint in many of the films where he is not official director. Earlier in 1987, Jackie had brain surgery after a catastrophic fall in the film of God's armor. This encouraged him to work on his next film close to home. This did not encourage him to stop risking his life and his stumbling block for our entertainment. What resulted in is a smash hit at home that darkened the original in box office tallies ($ 31 million compared to $ 19 million for the original). Jackie Chan is again the policeman's extraordinary Dragon Ma and he is ordered to work with "Three Wan" Superintendent Chun (Lam Wai, Royal Warriors), who is the only Chinese police officer who is allowed to have a gun yet be arresting to make him look better and ignore the triad gentlemen's crimes named Tiger Au (Michael Chan Wai-Man, Dragon Lord). Chun seems to have too much power to be taken down directly, but he's relieved of the Sai Wan district (now he is "Two Wan") that Dragon Ma takes over. This inefficient and corrupt office will soon get a makeover, and there is a big scene where three officers, who do not know who they are dealing with, are trying to persuade Ma to teach him a lesson to complain about police officers. He has soon taken care of this district ship and Tiger Au. The fight choreography and stunts with Tiger and his men are quite awesome. My favorite stunt was a beautifully brutal fall from the second floor to a large vase and that vase did not seem to be soft. Meanwhile, there are a few subplots. There are pirates who have survived from the first movie seeking revenge and food. Then there are revolutionaries, including Maggie (Maggie Cheung, In The Mood for Love) and (Rosamund Kwan, Casino Raiders) trying to raise funds for Dr. Sun Yat-sen to overthrow the Qing government and state operations trying to find these rebels. Throw in a mix of corrupt Hong Kong and British police as well as legitimate ones, and you have a stew that gets a little too many ingredients, yet it still seems to gather. This works well when there is a Marx Brothers influenced scene (Marx Brothers has made this type of scene a couple of times with The Cocoanuts (1929) as the first) at Maggie's place, where everyone is looking for someone while hiding from someone else. . Many weeks were spent on this scene alone, and the effort certainly shows. <br /> <br /> There are several errors in the movie. There is a certain didactic nature that creeps into the film, which seems a little out of place ?? especially a small speech to the end, which Jackie gives when dealing with the mainland revolutionaries and the very simple transformation of the pirates who survived from the first film. Female characters are once again underutilized and undervalued, especially Maggie Cheung. I wasn't so happy with the continuity of the plot as much as the first movie either. The individual scenes dominate my feelings for the movie rather than thinking of this movie as a coherent whole. I did not fault the movie for not being able to have Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao as the first myself (I heard the main reason for this was that the two filmed Eastern Condors, but I wonder if Jackie could have waited a little to get To do this, they would work together for the last time the following year in Dragons Forever), but they are missing. <br /> <br /> I found this to be quite comfortable and good-looking and rightly regarded as one of the better comedic action films of the 1980s. This movie is also pretty good at a couple of unexpected places. The art direction is fantastic (Eddie Ma Poon-chiu), the costumes are exquisite, the cinematography is good, and the film looks quite authentic. But stunts, comedy and action are what I remember this movie for. There is a hunt that involves a handcuff Dragon and Chun that is fantastic (part of the screaming scene would be used in Shanghai Noon). The last twenty minutes are full of awe-inspiring hits, falls, chili peppers as mouth-mace (Jackie writes in his autobiography on how he used real peppers in this scene, you can see him in the mouth's pain during outtakes at the end) and is a worthy conclusion for this movie. The most famous stunt from this order is his tribute to Buster Keaton from Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928) with the exception that there is no hole and only a weak section where the head goes through. <br /> <br /> Fans of Jackie and / or Hong Kong action cinema should consider this a must own and watch. I certainly do.
