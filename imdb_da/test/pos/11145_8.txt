The story takes place in rural Germany on the eve of World War II, a unique setting where a few British agents are held by the Germans in a farmhouse. Since they are not technical at war yet, it seems that both sides must have realized what is coming. Both agents (Bruce Lester and Ray Milland) flee to the countryside and split. Milland happens on gypsy woman Marlene Dietrich one evening when she is alone at the camp preparing dinner. Their meeting is a stunning and captivating scene, not so much for Milland, but for Dietrich, who takes sexy sultriness to a whole new plane. Milland indulges himself as a gypsy to hide from the Germans, but he remains committed to his mission of locating the scientist who knows the formula of a new poison gas, but who is also not a committed Nazi. Hollywood takes care of the gypsy's life and customs are predictably portrayed, but the underlying knowledge that they would be one of the Nazi extermination targets adds some excitement. The film stretches the line between being a serious story about the poison gas and the urgent search for the formula and a colorful but not convincing love story between Milland and Dietrich. But they are both very good; It is the film's fault that did not give them or their relationship enough dramatic realism, relying on and exploiting obvious cultural differences for questionable comedic purposes. Nevertheless, there are some exciting and interesting points here and there, the surprise meetings with German soldiers and Gestapo agents, where Dietrich makes a good palm and Milland almost as good forgery, and an evening meeting of Germans of various stripes where the Communication comes across the radio that Germany has been attacked by Poland, and everyone stands and makes a stiff armpit. Mitchell Leison may have missed some opportunities here and there, but he fully exploited others.
