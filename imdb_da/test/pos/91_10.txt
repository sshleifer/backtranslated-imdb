This film made by NFBC was made in honor of the Montreal Canadian dynasty in the 50s, 60s and 70s. My 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. I have been a Canadian fan for 29 of my 30 years of life. on a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a 117. All hockey fans should see this as I hope it will be placed in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and shown at the Bell Center in Montreal or here in Edmonton at Rexall Placer . Watch this movie with your family, it's a great movie. I also recommend the book both in French and English. Go Habs Go.
