I don't understand why everyone hates this movie, except the fact that they're just jealous, their music career never took off as mega popstar Aaron Carter. Like that or not, Aaron has experienced more success in his young life than most people could ever dream of having, so it just seemed natural to him to make a movie. Lou Pearlman and company have been known for over-exploiting their pop protégées, do you remember Justin Timberlake's foray in TV movie Model Behavior? Granted this movie is not large scale and impressive, but it shouldn't be. It doesn't try to impress people or be an Emmy prize winner, it was released directly to DVD. It's just a cute little movie about an awkward teen who makes her dream come true with her favorite pop star; I know many of you out there, have had that dream at some point about your favorite singer, don't deny it. It is sweet and gentle, and I welcome it for not entering into gender, violence, and vulgar language that seemingly throws in more and more of our movies today. Where's the decency? Where's the line? Teenage dramas come in dozens these days because teens are a big market for business, at least this is more tolerable to me than Bratz (aka Slutz) with all the fake little girls running around and going "Oh Mah Gawd! " in tank tops and mini skirts and fathoms are better than the making party films like Saw. I feel like the protagonist girl because I was a nerdy outcast girl in High School who loved Aaron Carter and NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys and other pop music and still does; and as Aaron's character would be crushed "testophobia", especially in mathematics. If you judge this movie solely on the basis of the fact that you do not like or are jealous of Aaron Carter and his fame, then of course you will hate it and garbage games speak it in reviews. The only reason Britney Spears' dribble Crossroads got a higher score is because she has breasts. Accept this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be. I think this happy formal teen movie ends up on a high note and makes you want to sing.
