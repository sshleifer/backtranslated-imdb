I can understand why others reacted rather uncomfortably to the climax, giving a twist that is really hard to take seriously. However, I think the structure for it seems pretty good. The music, quite threatening and the spine, really gives a scary aura that matches the unforgiving sound of a constant ringing phone struggling to fight for English actor, Joan Matlin (Jean Marsh) bonkers. She borrows a girl's lovely apartment while trying to start her career in New York City (the city's buildings outside the window look just as realistic as David Letterman) and is undoubtedly welcomed by a noisy phone ringing a little, followed at high slams against the wall. Seeking answers for one responsible for such a breach of her hygiene, Joan discovers that no one is renting that room and that a former tenant had actually strangled. Without the help of the manager, Joan will decide to find out who is causing her such anxiety. Joan discovers the room empty and the phone with a special female voice that will haunt her. <br /> <br /> The section I believe is a tour force for Jean Marsh, a woman's show. She is the only actress who is visible and we follow her through the crisis, which slowly erodes her, the phone and the banging from the other room, causing her much distress growing in fear. Instead of leaving, Joan remains so shaken by the noise and the breakpoint where she just wants to call the phone (... or the caller). The section gives a possible answer to who is bothering Joan and why. A character named Beth enters the story quite late when Joan struggles to find out if the female voice it was across the second line that knew her name on the dreaded phone she discovers in the room across her . Beth's fate can just tell the viewer why Joan is being traumatized. I think this episode is an exercise in ghosts instead of credibility, some didn't like it very much, but I certainly did. I will admit that the phone, as a physical threat "crawling" towards Joan, is difficult to take seriously, not to mention the attack on her, but I thought that the intense opening twenty minutes before this was adequately chilling enough to handle it.
