It is simply that those who call this movie something under "decent" do not know their cinema. The "Doll Master" creates a sense of fear and excitement rarely seen in movies outside of Asia. Think of a mix of "Manga" and "Ringu" rolled into one, and it's all about it. <br /> <br /> First-class acting, first-class direction, first-class sets and effects. <br /> <br /> This is right up there with the best of Asian horrorbios; Ringu, Dark Water and a number of two sisters. <br /> <br /> An absolute must. <br /> <br /> Take it from a guy who knows his movie.
