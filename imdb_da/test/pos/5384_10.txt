Bwana Devil is known as the first large studio, full-length feature that is fully captured in the 3D process. Apparently producer Oboler went to Africa to shoot another movie, but after hearing the story of two male lions terrorizing railway builders, he decided to do so. It's also a good story, almost Hemmingway-like; fear, redemption, the great white hunter and all. It is the story of the story that seems to be drawing, almost as if filming in the new process was too heavy for the crew. The action scenes are stiff, almost too staged. But these technical problems seem small in light of the film's dramatic conclusion.
