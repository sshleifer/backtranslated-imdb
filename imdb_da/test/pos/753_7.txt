The nurse Charlotte Beale (the lovely Rosie Holotik) has arrived at Dr. Stephens' outpatient clinic prepared for a new job. What she doesn't expect is to find another supposed doctor in her position after Stephens has been attacked by the ax-wheeled "judge" Oliver W Cameron (... in a running gag when he confronts a situation outside his control, he returns to repeat his name). This doctor is Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick) who is not sure if Beale is a suitable fit for their establishment. After a long discussion about the position (which is a quite unpleasant scene, when the two debates on Beales are sent a letter by Stephens, who gets a job at the clinic with the Masters, often reminds her that he is no longer responsible) Masters agrees in letting her work in the care position, but the good doctor can't be the one she thinks. <br /> <br /> The range of loonies includes Sam (Bill McGee) a simple kid who was Stephen's last victim of lobotomy, Jennifer (Harryette Warren), a woman who needs an adult to comfort her as she meets at Masters' heel as a puppy, Danny (Jessie Kirby) a troublesome annoyance, often trying to steal the fake baby from disturbed Harriet (Camilla Carr), Allyson (Betty Chandler), a sexy nympho who will just be loved and hoped by any man she sees, and "Sergeant" Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) is your typical case of soldier who has not escaped war frenzy. /> <br /> The film shows Masters' unorthodox methods of running the clinic letting patients walk around freely with the doors of all rooms without locks that question. And not to mention the fact that Oliver is still allowed to walk around despite the fact that he just cuts Dr. Stephens with an ax. And what happened to Dr. Stephens? Ah ha .. <br /> <br /> Tacky 70's drive-in trash can be fun if you're in a combed movie theater. I am attracted to bizarre flicks about mental rejections because of their unpredictable nature. You just never know what the hell can happen, especially in this case where they are allowed to walk often unattended. Some consider the low budget a commitment, but in the case of this movie I think it improves the experience. With image photography and weak production values ​​(which shot to peanuts in a worn house in a horrible location), it seemed more beautiful, and I felt like a voyeur peering in mental illness through a camera lens on the outside.
