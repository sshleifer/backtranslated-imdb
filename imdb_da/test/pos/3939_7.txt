Richard Schickel's 1991 documentary on Gary Cooper - "Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend" gives us a look at the huge American star through his films and his life. Intended by Clint Eastwood, the theme is surely "Gary Coooper, American", which we have taken through quick clips of his many appearances in westerns, and scenes from "Meet John Doe", "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and" Sgt. York. "The best part of the documentary is gay film from Cooper and his family as well as his childhood images showing him as a beautiful blond child with the sunny smile he wanted all his life. There is also a hilarious clip of Cooper on" The Jack Benny Show "makes the comeback on the number" Bird Dog "- and Benny loses it. The documentary also takes us briefly through his tumultuous affair with Patricia Neal, who almost destroyed both their lives. <br /> <br /> There is some cohesion missing from this bio / retrospect - it jumps a lot around and has no footage by Cooper being interviewed, which would have added a lot. Also, Clint Eastwood's story was described as discreet, boring and monotonous, as Cooper himself tended to be strong, silent type on the screen, we could have used a small animation. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, Gary Cooper was one of the handiest men who ever lived - there were some looking at him in his prev ige film, bu Not nearly enough for this fan. The smile, the lips, the bone structure - he was beautiful all his life, but in movies like "Morocco" and "Desire" he is devastating. Instead of sitting through a scene from one of his worst performances that Howard Roark in "The Fountainhead" gave a speech he admitted to the author, he didn't understand - a young suave Cooper in a tux would have been a good touch. This documentary, unfortunately, was certainly produced by a man.
