Kate Gulden, played by one of the most nominated actresses of the last decade of this century, and also one of the most talented actresses Meryl Streep (Out of Africa). She is wonderful is any part she plays. The Yale candidate is the American cinema's pride and joy. Kate's health has worsened, and her husband, George, role well-developed by brilliant actor and also Oscar winner, William Hurt (Smoke, Kiss of the Spider Woman) has difficulty with the worsening health of his one true thing and seeking his daughter's help . The poor daughter, Ellen Gulden, Ren√©e Zellweger (Jerry Maguire) has too much to expect from her. No breaks! History takes a very realistic view of a parent's illness. In this movie, the only daughter must put her life in wait to care for the needs of others. There is always one in every family who is facing that kind of responsibility. Ellen is twisting the beginning of the movie, but when the time comes, she ends up understanding her mother's lifetime dedication to her family. She even asks her mother: How do you do his, every day, in and out and no one notices it? That's what women do, much of what I call invisible work. In addition, we clean, we repair, we repair, we stretch, we celebrate, we are the best friends, we are confidential, mistress, outreachers, disciplinary, sensitive. Some of us, like both women in this movie, have the perfect education, the psychological pillar of the whole family and also do all the invisible work! It's Kate Ellen, and many women in our community. Many of us have already gone through this stage of life when our parents are old and dead. I've been there. They just went for young people. I have given my parents my thanks, but I have never understood them as good as I had to play their roles and have to wear their shoes. This film reflects the reality of life. Maybe it's sad, but that's how life is at times. George a professor at Harvard is a complicated person who seems to believe his work is more important than everyone else and has a very "master / servant" mentality towards the women in his life. He is not strong enough to cope. If you want to see good acting and the reality of life, don't miss this movie. Favorite Images: The restaurant comes to Kate, Violins and all. Making a table out of ruined China. That I looked symbolic! We are all broken ships! Favorite Quotes: George: "It's only uphill that you realize you're really downhill." George "You have a Harvard education, but where's your heart?" <br /> <br />
