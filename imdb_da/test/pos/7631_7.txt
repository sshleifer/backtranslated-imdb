I have read a few reviews of this movie, which has recently been released on DVD by Eclectic. Apparently, the opening titles are letterboxed, but the rest (most) is full screen. The first release, in 1982 by Planet Video, is completely letterboxed. Although it was a primitive release, it got the compositions right. Later releases had sharper and better picture quality, but they were full screen as the DVD is. Any publication of this movie must be letterboxed, as it contributes significantly to the visual experience of the old Planet tape.
