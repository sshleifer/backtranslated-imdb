Unlike the previous poster, I liked celluloid treatment. It looked good and made the movie so much more enjoyable. For me, it did not at all detract from the power of the documentary's content. In fact, I felt that the slickness of the appearance allowed me to lose myself much more in the content. The previous poster was fair to compare the style with a Nike advertisement; It certainly has that look. But in my opinion it worked really well (and I'm far from a fan of Nike advertising). In my opinion, this is how to make documentaries. I can't wait to see the next rates from these promising movie makers.
