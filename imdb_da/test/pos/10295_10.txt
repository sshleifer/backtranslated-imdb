I watched this movie for the second time tonight after about three years, and it was as wonderful as before ... <br /> <br /> There are more than a dozen modern amazing French movies from a couer they pull to the three colors trilogy and everyone is special. This movie is one of them. A real pleasure with so many good things going for it from greeting to Hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in Romane and Monica. While Monica is very beautiful, Romane is a very sexy lady and steals many of the scenes she inhabits. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why people think this movie is confused, as the scenes are a perfect blend of the past and present, as an adversary to the characters' own remarkable journey, that the movie simply flows, And you hardly realize that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery have left the oppressed and enchanted. <br /> <br /> Like most French and European films, this story would never translate across the Atlantic as no studio could capture the magic without blasting it out with Hollywood bleaching common to most movies lost in translation. Americans make brilliant movies, but not of this type ... maybe if they let someone like a young Polanski work on it, then maybe they wouldn't quite slaughter an English version ... For those who don't see subtitles you want to spend a lifetime in ignorant bliss. For those who can read, you would spit yourself missing out on movies like this ... <br /> <br /> I would describe this as Neo-Franco-Noir, but only for the critic of the critic named this movie elite . I think I saw him making a supplement for twenty-four pies. He believes that Romane Bohringer is a kind of French mayonnaise ... It is artificial in the way that Pulp Fiction is arty ... but with more Gallic savoire faire ... 10 out of 10 with each look ... and has someone got roman's phone number ... she's the perfect french salad dressing ...
