Jewel Thief is * THE * criminal thriller in Bollywood, and why shouldn't it? It is directed by the largest exponent of criminal thriller art in Indian Cinema Vijay Anand ('Johny Mera Naam' and 'Teesri Manzil.) I could see this movie for one of the following reasons (in order of importance): <br / > <br /> 1 Vijay Anand's direction 2 RD Burman's music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Majrooh Sultanpuri's lyrics <br /> <br /> Though Jewel Thief is not a Bond Movie, it certainly has a gangster. Helen, Tanuja and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some cameos.) But our sauvé Vinay (Dev Anand) is anything but Bond. He is out of control for most of the story and goes where the story takes him almost always as confused as we are. He even flirts with Anju (Tanuja), who tries to hit his romantic nerve just because he can be hired in his father's shop. Dev Anand may be in a dual role - well I do not want to ruin your movie otherwise I would have told you. It's most of the mystery is about. Dev Anand works in a jewelry store and there is a robbery when he has to be at work - even though it is not or at least has a perfect alibi. We wonder who did it, is the Dev Anand as 'Vijay' the person he claims to be, or is it 'Amar' someone we have not yet seen, but many people claim is his appearance alike. Coming 'Shalu' (Vyjayanthimala), who claims to be her fiancé, in a tense situation Dev Dev will prove he is Vinay and not Amar. While everyone is wondering if Dev Anand is Vinay or Amar, he is asked to remove his socks. Amar, we are told, has 6 digits on one of his feet. As we look with breathless spirit, the events that are unfolding to find Dev Anand find even time to joke. <br /> <br /> The real-life brothers director Vijay Anand and actor Dev Anand have many films between them, this is not the best of them, but definitely the best in Crime Thriller. <br /> <br /> There are moments of Hitchcock's North City Northwest, but the movies are very different. Apart from the confusion about who is who, a treacherous woman leader and many travels, there is not much equality. Dev Anand may well be Amar besides being Vijay. People have seen him, they identify him wherever he goes. There are too many of them for this to be a fraud. Finally, Vinay thinks it's better to continue to be Amar to find out what's the truth, and that's a sad mistake. He gets too deep into it, only to be saved by Cinema's twists and turns. <br /> <br /> As I watched the movie as a child, I was absolutely not amused, the confusion completely ended. Even now, there are parts about the end that I do not like, but I still recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Even as a child, I enjoyed the songs this movie has to offer. 'Yeh dil ...' - a particular song song in Kishor Kumar's voice. I could hear 'Rulake Gaya ...' all day long. Dito for 'Aasmaan ke neeche', which is set 'under skies' by Gangtok (at least the story says it). 'Raat akeli hai' among the sexiest song to get out of Hindi cinema with Tanuja as the seducer. 'Meri taraf dekho' - Helens cabaret and we look at her '. "Hothon pe ..." - now there could be a better thriller of a song than this. As the song progresses, we are more excited than we ever were, and the words "hidden in Shalys lips" add it.
