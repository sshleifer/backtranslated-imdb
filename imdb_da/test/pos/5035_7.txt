Captured this movie on TV and I watched it again. I told myself it has been a long time since I saw this movie, so why not. And once again, this movie excited me. It's so easy, so tough and so human that I don't know why some people like it. <br /> <br /> John Travolta shines like Michael (his dance and every movement), an angel that can hardly be related to this word. He smokes, drinks and he eats like some game, but he has a big heart. On the way, Michael helps all the people he meets. Dorothy Winters (Andie MacDowell) in her song and find a real man. Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) develops as a good and decent man. Michael has even helped dear old Pansy Milbank (Jean Stapleton) - the last scene is beautiful as they dance in the street. <br /> <br /> Travolta was very helpful in other players. Andie MacDowell is so handsome and sympathetic, William Hurt is amazing as usual, late Robert Pastorelli shows his talent. Jean Stapleton and Teri Garr are also good, but my favorite supporter in this movie is Bob Hoskins as the tabloid holder. So we have here a solid film about people with a warm story too and attractive cast. Just don't take this movie seriously and I can guarantee you have fun.
