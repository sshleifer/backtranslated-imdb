Endearingly stupid anime, only six episodes in duration, about a rude delivery boy named Kintaro (yes, he is called a birth dream, even though he's meant to be in his 20s) and the adventures he has on his travels. Each episode sees him come in a new city, acquire a new job, develop something of a love interest before each episode ends with him leaving. <br /> <br /> Sensibly sexist, juvenile, very immature at times, this is the kind of anime that just puts a smile on the face. <br /> <br /> Not one to begin with if you are not a fan of anime as it certainly will not convince you of the genre, but for those who are already converted, this is entertaining fluff.
