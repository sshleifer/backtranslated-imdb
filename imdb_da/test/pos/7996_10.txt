Forget the over-rated "Batman Begins, this is the ultimate Batman movie you don't want to miss. This movie has it all and it surpasses the first 1989 mega hit. It may not have done well at first in the box office But it's definitely a much better movie, the visuals are amazing, Burton works his magic as he always does in his films again. Gotham City, Batman's hunting ground is a great sight to see. bad guys in this are very interesting, much more interesting actually when there are comics counterparts. Tim Burton and screenwriter Daniel Walters go one step further to get you a real emotional connection with these characters. The penguin played to perfection by Danny Devito is a kind of tragic character, abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeking revenge on the world that refused him, very disgusting to see at times, but he has some of the most classic lines a villain could ever pronounce in a single movie. The other villain is Catwoman, played so brilliantly by Michelle Pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time, giving a WOW performance, and stealing the show as far as any of the previous and current live action batman villain. is worried. she also has a tragic background. Her name is Selina Kyle, and she is a very mousy secretary for a sharp businessman named Max Shreck, who later kills her by pushing her out of a window. Somehow, she survives and gets "awakened" by cats and decides occasionally to become the legendary Catwoman, not of course the amazing order in which she completely lets and destroys her entire apartment in one of the most Oscar worthy of rage and anger I have ever seen in an actress. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton once again forms cape and cowl as Batman and also as Bruce Wayne and this time he is much darker. There is not much else to say here except that Keaton is simply the best actor to play Batman ever. He just oozes cool, and he has some kind of Clint Eastwood approach to playing Batman, and he's very dark. He does not speak much, and when he does, he sounds very cool, and he does not voice his obedient and false IE bales "Batman" voice in the batman begins. He struts around Gotham as a man possessed by his own inner demons. He is pshycologically disturbed and you know it. In this excursion, he takes on 2 of the most famous villains to ever reach the Batman cartoon world. <br /> <br /> However, I have to say, despite the awesomeness of the action scenes, which the scenes of the coolest Batmobile NEVER go down the street and knock the throats to the ground and batman glides over Gotham, that's the romantic angle between Pfieffer and Keaton That really makes this movie classic a top choice for anyone who wants to see the real Batman in action, I rate this one 10, would give it more if I could.
