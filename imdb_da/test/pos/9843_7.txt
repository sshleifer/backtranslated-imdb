James Cagney (The Yankee Doodle Dandy Boy) had just started his career and could perform as a gangster and also a social worker for a Boys Reform School run by corrupt politicians. The reform school's inmates are underprivileged minors from the New York streets, such as "East Side Kids", who were poor and unmoved during the Great Depression. In the final stages, there is a test held by reforming school boys with flaming torches and a fire that is on fire and a big leap from the corrupt leader. I noticed that they first let the horses out of the barn. This movie is not shown very often and I can really understand why!
