The view basically reflects the typical youth's typical nature; Attaching and fetching chickens is the common weekend destination at the clubs. People wrinkle the show because of their "perverted" idea of ​​capturing girls using technique and strategic characterization, but the truth is being told, almost every young guy is out doing it at the club. Overall, the show appeals to the younger population as we like to see the results of a "player's" performance at the club, as the show provides a comical approach made possible by the scoreboard. <br /> <br /> 10/10; a cool, fun and exciting series that allows the audience to interact. Good Job Boys.
