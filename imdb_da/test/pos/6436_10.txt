I remember seeing this movie in 1981 when I was 7. It was absolutely brilliant! I found the DVD just a few months ago. I almost jumped up and down with pleasure !! I bought it and showed it to my kids. They loved it too. They asked what words the seaport was singing (I didn't tell them because I don't think saying "gay" and "ecstasy" to 6 year olds are very good parents). The songs are brilliant. I still remember them all. I still remember them when I'm 60! There or near. Tommy Pender is (was) such a brilliant actor. It's a pity he gave it up. <br /> <br /> If you find the movie, buy it! You will love it!
