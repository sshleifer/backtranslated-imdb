Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) has been hired by the British Government to protect a Swiss scientist Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.). He has a bomb that the British want to win the war. Unfortunately, the evil dr. Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) with the Nazis and stops nothing to get the doctor - and his invention. <br/> <br /> Moving Sherlock Holmes to the 1940s sounded like a stupid idea, but it works for a reason - Basil Rathbone. Maybe he's the best Sherlock Holmes ever put on the screen. He plays the character so well (and precisely) that it doesn't matter which era he solves crimes. As for Nigel Bruce as Watson ... everybody has trouble with it. He plays Watson as a bumbling old fool ... it's NOT Watson of the books. You seriously wonder why Holmes sets up with him. Yet he grows on you (in a way). Then there is Atwill having a whale in a time playing Moriarty - the discussions and the battle between wits between him and Holmes are just amazing! I never wanted Dennis Hoey as inspector Lestrade - he is such an idiot. Makes Watson look like a genius. And Post Jr. is pretty good as Tobel (although his accent entertaining continues to change!). <br /> <br /> This movie is complete and runs just over an hour. Still, it has it slowly, and I never understood the secret code department. <br /> <br /> Still worth catching if just for Rathbone and Atwill.
