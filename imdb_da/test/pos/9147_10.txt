No matter how many times Wile Ethelbert "Famishius Famishius" Coyote tries to get Road "Burnius Roadibus" Runner, we always know what will happen, even though our sympathy always stays with the WEC. The highlight of "Hook, Line and Stinker" is a Rube Goldberg style chart that WEC hopes to finally finish RR; But of course you know what happens. So, Wile E. continues hilarious engaging in fanaticism (defined by George Santayana who transforms your bet after you forget your goal), while Road Runner is hardly ever aware of the potential danger - or lack thereof - where he could find himself self. A real classic. <br /> <br /> And yes, the middle name of the coyote is Ethelbert. I learned it from "Jeopardy!"
