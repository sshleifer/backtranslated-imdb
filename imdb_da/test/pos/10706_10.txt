Shining documentary on how a small group of idealistic young men have used music, art and dance to unite and cure Vigario Geral, one of the most violent slums in Rio ("favela" means neighborhood in Portuguese) and offers young people a positive alternative to the mortal gangster world of the drug smugglers. <br /> <br /> In their feature film debut, Zimbalist and Mochary have made a movie that is breathtaking because it works on so many levels. As a social document, it gives the facts we need to know in order to get a connection to understanding the meaning of the particular story being told here. The story itself is well developed with a strong storybook, and for further goals it is shot through with great excitement. There is an arresting, charismatic central protagonist, Anderson Sa: he is a knowledgeable natural leader, articulated, courageous, spiritually developed, a talented performer, a visionary who goes his speech. <br /> <br /> There is also plenty of music and dancing to entertain. There are talking heads ?? mainly Sa and his closest association, Jose Junior - but they are presented with imaginative cinematic brilliance. The editing blends nicely different images of different themes, separated only by a few factual text. The pace is as lively as the music. Much is achieved in 78 minutes. <br /> <br /> Grupo Afro Reggae, the neighborhood social club, which Anderson, Junior and a few others formed in 1993, distributes music and dance as weapons to climb into the drug addicts and the Polish police. They teach percussion skills to any child who wants to attend a class, along with dance, martial arts, a community newspaper. The only requirement for children to belong to is smoking, no drinking, no drugs. There is a subtle, soft-selling spiritual substance that runs through the movement, loosely based on Hindu God Shiva, the destroyer of ancient habits. <br /> <br /> Jeff Zimbalist, also a leading film artist and editor, is a modern culture and media student at Brown University. He burnished his cutlets editing feature documentaries to PBS and others, and he teaches films at the New York Film Academy and elsewhere. Matt Mochary, as Andrew Jarecki ("Capturing the Friedmans") some years ago, recently came to business movies. <br /> <br /> Together, the Zimbalist and Mochary won the Best New Film Creator Award in the 2005 TribBeCa Film Festival, and "Favela Rising" was tied to this year's Best Film Awards in 2005 awarded by the International Documentary Association. I could go on pages about Afro Reggae, Sa and this movie. One way better idea is simply for you to see it! My grade: A 10/10
