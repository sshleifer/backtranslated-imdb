Jacques Audiard's direct debut See how they fall aka Regarde les Hommes Tomber is our old friend, the film of two different stories that gradually converges and turns out to be the same story after all, simply told from various sides. It's a shaggy dog ​​story, with Matthieu Kassovitz's simply following the unlucky-in-cards driving Jean Louis Trintignant with the mutt-like affection that even stretches to kill for him when he is asked to repay his gambling debt in kind . However, Jean Yanne's over-the-hill travel dealer is increasingly obsessed with finding the hit man who put his cop into a brain-dead coma, meanwhile, his life, income and relationships gradually removed as he gets closer on its prey. But although it can offer the perfect set-up for a modern neo noir, the film is often more surprisingly playful, more interested in character traits and a slightly skewed sense of humor (appropriately served by the individual ironic captions and Alexandre Desplatts half-scary, half-contradictory score) than the traditional thriller sets and plot mechanics. Unfortunately, the movie is poorly served by one of the worst Region 1 DVDs released in recent years: the image quality of the Synkronized disc is so poor at times, you continue to expect to see the audience's heads in front of the picture as a pirate disc.
