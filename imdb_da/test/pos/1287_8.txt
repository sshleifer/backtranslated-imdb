I just finished looking and I thought it was great. I rated it 8 out of 10. I plan to see it again with the instructor's comment and then again in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I rented this movie because of my fascination with Christopher Nolan's recent movie Memento. The following have some similarities; this movie was probably blueprint for Memento. Even the music in some parts is very similar. <br /> <br /> Taking the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feeling. The story and the dialogue are really good. The exercise of the actors is credible. <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan made this movie on a very low budget. I look forward to his next release Insomnia, a great budget film with my favorite actor Al Pacino.
