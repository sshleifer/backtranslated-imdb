* Minor Spoiler * <br /> Inhabited is not scary, but it's scary. It is an interesting "little" story with good acting and great special effects makeup. Basic List: A little girl accuses the strange things that are happening in her family's new house and accompanying playhouse on her faerie friends. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't waste time moving even though the finish could have been more involved. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to those who expect / want hardcore horror, but I recommend it to those who want a chiller and not necessarily a thriller.
