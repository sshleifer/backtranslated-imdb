The movie is a joy to watch, not only for the plot, which is poignant, but also for the amazing performances of the actors Deneuve and Belmondo. Although one considers a 'flop' on its first release, it has become a critical success and it is clear to see why. Deneuve's performance style suited the film brilliantly. She always gives the impression that she is holding back or saving something, and her character in this movie is. I will not spoil it by saying what, even if it is revealed quite early. Belmondo is lovable as the rather nutritious but in love tobacco expert. I would recommend this movie to all Truffaut or Deneuve fans. It is a brilliant Hitchcockian style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that evolve as the movie does. The film is about 2 hours, so you feel you have not been sold short. Deneuve steals the show in this movie and it is clear that at the time of making the film Truffaut was very infected with her. A particular must look for any cineste or moviefan. 10.10
