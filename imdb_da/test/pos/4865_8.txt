You know the concept of "guilty pleasures"? yes, you have them to admit you so - and enjoyed - goonies, battlestar galactica AFTER they reached the ground, v series, Charlie's Angels, Starsky & Hutch, 1950s version of superman or godzilla movie. <br /> <Here is the ultimate in guilty pleasures. combined with Jack of All Trades in a co-raimi action-packed hour, this half-hour slot is fast, easy to follow and filled with fun to see beauty-clad babies. <br /> <br /> The man who brought us evil dead, Xena, Hercules and the adventures of Brisco County Jr. does it again with this 2000 update of Charles's Angels. we have charlie (voice) an unknown creature who has the knowledge and time to find people who need help, the bosley (mouser) gadget man and three beautiful babies who kick a ** to live. <br /> <br /> And oh what a living!
