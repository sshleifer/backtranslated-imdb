This is a really sad and touching movie! It deals with the topic of child abuse. It's really sad, but mostly a true story because it happens every day. Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello play the two children or Lorraine Bracco, a single mother who is just trying to make a home for them. While living with her parents, a man who likes to be called "The King" comes into their lives. He hits the youngest boy, Bobby, but the two brothers do not promise to tell their mother. But finally, she finds out after Bobby is badly injured. That end kind of ruined it for me because it's so incredible. But apart from that, I love the movie.
