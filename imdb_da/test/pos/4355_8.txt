Werner Herzog again explores a person's psyche. In "Little Dieter ..." we meet a roaring, brilliant man who survived the war in Bavaria and experienced hunger and strange sights, moved to the United States and fulfilled his dream of being a tile. War, food, death, survival, hoarding, flying, heads coming out ... how an American is born. Herzog again sees madness as a plan of existence and the surrealistic mixes with the exciting that Herzog himself tells this psychic travel note about a German becomes an American flying flight plans in a war of the late 20th century, when the culmination of Technology, pilgrimage and eating out of waste cans with spoons are melded with constant optimism for a man redefined for American. As always with Herzog, we are faced with florid madness, brilliance and what is man in the light of his own profits, social and personal. We laugh and crush and am amazed at this man. Where else for this man, but America?
