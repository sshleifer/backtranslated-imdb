The problem with other players thrown into Dorian Gray is that they either looked too old for that part (Hurd Hatfield, Helmut Berger, Josh Duhamel, David Gallagher, Ben Barnes) or that they couldn't pull the English aristocratic way out without being stolen. Dorian is the eternal 19-year-old (or so), all milk skin and honey'd lock, as described by Wilde, so the challenge is to find an actor who has maturity and reach for that part (ie who can portray the naivite, coolness and manipulativity), but at the same time resembles a person in his late teens. And Peter Firth pulls everything in this excellent British television adaptation. <br /> <br /> Gielgud like Henry Wotton, while it was considerably older than what Wilde had in mind, wonders with his scenes - Wilde's theories never sounded so natural and undisturbed. Especially George Sanders in the 1945 version was rather weak in comparison (and his costume didn't fit). Finally, Jeremy Bratt plays Basil as the most masculine and at the same time the most gay trio, again an appropriate interpretation. In general, the film contains enough homosexuality without making Dorian himself homosexual - he is all things to all people and supposedly there is no medicine or sexual perversion that he has not tried in the 18 years covered by history, but it does him more narcissist than homosexuals. He seems to spread chaos on both sexes here, as he should according to the novel. Of course, the budget for this production was not very large, so everything feels a bit stadiumy. Especially Dorian's meeting with Sybil's brother suffers from the obvious study appearance. Finally, the last shot of Dorian (a puppet I suspect) in his white paddle-like makeup is more salutary than convincing, and Basil's death scene is unintentional fun. (Also, as far as I remember, Basil should have been killed sitting at the table.) But all in all, this is a very worthy adaptation. I'm sure Wilde would have liked it. The only thing missing is the sensual side. Not so much sex scenes, but Wilde's decadent world of fragrant flowers, luxurious clothes and precious gems is not really explored here, ie. the aesthetic is completely missing. But like "I, Claudius", the excellent play makes you easily forget about these deficiencies in production values.
