The railway children, at least this 1970s movie version written and directed by the long British character actor, Lionel Jeffries, is an unmitigated ... classic. It tells a childhood story with great simplicity and charm; sentimentality is subdued; Involvement of childhood adventures is involved; and Jeffries brings wisdom and style to his production. <br /> <br /> The Waterbury family leads an idyllic life in Edwardian London. The father is wealthy, the mother is beautiful and loving, the children are happy and loving, their home is warm and cozy. Then there is a man during the Christmas holidays two men at the door, speak quietly to the father, and take him away. For a moment, the life of Mrs Waterbury (Dinah Sheridan) and Bobbie, 14 (Jenny Agutter), Phyllis, 12 (Sally Thomsett) and Young Peter (Gary Warren) have changed. Only their strength and good spirits will see them through. Mrs. Waterbury now takes her children to live in a brick-built old country house close to a railway line, not too far from a small village with a train station. The children discover the rail and regularly sit on a small hill to wave the passengers while the train is passing by. One day, an old gentleman who goes to his business in the city looks up from his newspaper and finds himself waving back. It's not long before he wants to play an important role in history. <br /> <br /> As time goes on, Mrs Waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to bear on her children. She starts writing stories to make money. She teaches them their lessons and provides a home for warmth and security for them. The story, however, is about these three children, especially Bobbie. At 2 pm she is old enough to share her mother's concerns, yet young enough to enjoy the adventures she has with her sister and brother. They find a poor man at the station who can't speak English. They discover that he is a Russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and child are. They insist that he come home with them, and their mother takes him in. Before long, the children have written a great sign to the old gentlemen on the train who are asking for help. They help a young man participate in a tower that breaks his leg in a train tunnel. Soon he is home with them. They decide to have a birthday party for the station master, a man with few friends and more children, who is a sticker to his dignity. It is not long before the children help him realize the difference between friendship and charity. In other words, the three children encounter all sorts of problems in their childhood adventures and are ready to help see that all problems have happy endings. <br /> <br /> But what about their own problems? Bobbie finally learns from her mother that her father was taken away because he was accused of treason, giving state secrets to the Russians. Will Bobbie find a way to help? Will the old gentleman be more than just an old gentleman on a passing train? Will their father's case be reopened? Will there be a good ending? <br /> <br /> Jenny Agutter was nearly 18 when she filmed her part; she plays the 14-year-old Bobbie with great naturalness and charm. As important as the other players are, especially Dinah Sheridan as a mother, Agutter is the heart of the story. For me it is Jenny Agter's talent and Lionel Jeffries' style and restraint that makes this movie so memorable. History's problems do not come with any serious doubts, but they are resolved. And Jeffries not only gives us a professionally adapted and directed movie, he adds touches that are hardly felt but charms us. This can only include a split second of a two-person freezing plate; or a slow close-up of a small yellow wildflower in the grass outside Bobbies home, then a slow retreat from a yellow oil lamp is turned inward; or the realization that a lovely inner shot or view of the green landscape or a look at the train station from a hill ... all of a sudden reveals the charming Edwardian hand-drawn drawings of a perfect time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this gentle story cannot compete for the time the kids need today to improve their Nintendo monster splatter skills. I'm almost positive, it would never catch the attention of most of their parents, especially those accustomed to Batman and Leone. Still, it is a perfectly composed movie and should not be forgotten. As a page 19 years later, the story was told as a television program. This time, Jenny Agutter played her mother.
