The film eXistenZ is about a futuristic video game on a "pod" system that almost corresponds to virtual reality. The only copy of the video game is damaged when attempting to kill the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Unless it can be repaired, the many years and $ 38 million spent on development will be wasted. However, the only way to repair the game is to go to the game with the only person she believes she can trust (Jude Law). This movie was pretty good, but does not really take up very much in the movie. The best thing about this movie was the twists towards the end. Definitely worth a look. 10.7
