Rififi deserves a great mention for the famous heist scene, and actually deserves the scene all the credit it gets. It is a masterful excitement, character interaction and photography. But Rififi is not only one scene - every scene in the film is so masterfully composed, and as a whole, the film is not only taught in excitement, plot and character, but an exquisite told moral narrative that set the stage for film noire in the coming year. <br/> <br /> Cinematically and technically, the heist sequence can be the most impressive scene in the movie, but for me it is the last scene that has the most power - Tony hallostinis hallucinogenic drive towards redemption.
