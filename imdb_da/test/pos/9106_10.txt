This is the only thing I can look back on from 2006 and now it rocked. It rocked hard, but it also praised tasty. Mr.MEATLOAF added a nice little touch to this bowl of a movie before the opening circles just rolled. Now you tell something this movie rocked itself before it STARTED! Now I will not give too much away or be a "spoiler", but this movie ROCKED! If you've heard the new album and thought of yourself "this seems a little subordinate to stubborn material, it's like I'm just playing badminton with Satan, what does it do?" Then this movie will raise your appreciation for the music and you will marvel at this steamy satanic masterpiece. For those who want better, do not know what they want because better would no longer be D. This movie is the D period. So dare if you dare on the local seaterum if you want your socks rocked.
