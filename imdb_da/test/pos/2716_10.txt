I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite recommendations, discarding the movie as a clich√© of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top plays. Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come forward and sweep you off your feet. <br /> <br /> The movie catches your attention very early and there is no moment to rest after it. The monkeys Sen has done a wonderful job of sticking the audience to all lines of the film. The impeccable character development, "just the right" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end that matches everything ... I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi. She strikes expectation once again after Side-3 and Mr. & Mrs.Iyer. Prof. Anjali's role is very well developed, and Shabana is fully entitled to the character. Rahul Bose, Shefali Chaya, Waheeda Rehman adds incredible flavor to the movie. <br /> <br /> I define "shower moments" as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you think about in your shower infinity until your wife / boyfriend / mother bangs at the door. 15PA supplies many "shower moments" especially the conversation between Anjali and her mother, where the mother is cautious when talking to Anjali about her thoughts. It immediately brings Anjali's personality to the audience. <br /> <br /> The end is a very bold statement from the director; probably too westernized to the Indian audience; however, delivering the elements to promote the film from a "good" to a "great" status.
