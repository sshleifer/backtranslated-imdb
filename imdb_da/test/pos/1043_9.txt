Although it is not "perfect", it is close. Love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Superman's Chief of Police), the housekeeper, the waiter at Restaurant Felix and the judge ...... I can continue. This movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition since I was young and my kids grew up with it too! The "baby swallowed the clock" was always my son's favorite line. Sexy Barbara Stanwyck in pants and dress stole the show with the nice, funny S. Z. Sakall. Dennis Morgan also has some good songs. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake (blah).
