Very politically charged drama that, while biased, is extremely well-managed and one of the most intelligent movies ever made. It contains almost no sermon, but rather follows a naive TV rep that gradually comes to realize the threat of nuclear power plants, not because of an inherent danger, but because purveyors are more interested in the bottom line than in the safety of those many had hated the movie because they saw it as a political channel made by ultra-liberals such as Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas, but if you see it simply as a drama, it is gripping, exciting, full of well-developed, distinctive characters and ultimately a really exciting modern thriller that hits close to home. Historical Note: For some, especially those in the energy industry and residents of Harrisburg, PA metro area, it might have hit a little too close to home, as less than a week after this movie was released, the devastating explosion occurred at the core of the Three Mile Iceland. <br /> <br /> Update, 04/08/2007: For nearly a decade since I first wrote this criticism, I've heard a lot of comments about the movie. One thing that I think really should be noted is that this film is not the "ultra-liberal" anti-nuclear tire that it is often labeled as. <br /> <br /> While creators and stars are (or were) remarkable "Hollywood establishment" liberal, what this movie is attacking, is not the very idea of ​​nuclear energy, but rather the idea of ​​human greed, corruption and falseness that sets question the potential dangers of something that nature has already made dangerous. <br /> <br /> No one who accepts reality can argue that human exposure to nuclear radiation is at least quite likely to be fatal. Close friends of mine who worked at a nuclear power plant for several years told me about their employer's official policy on the maximum "safe" exposure levels that employees could handle. <br /> <br /> You don't have to believe these companies are inherently evil to accept that individuals, in pursuit of wealth and power, are greedy and often corrupt. And even if you dispute that claim, you cannot dispute that all people are inclined to make mistakes. When it comes to exposing innocent people to nuclear radiation, we can't afford any mistakes, and that's more than any argument this movie is trying to make. <br /> <br /> If you should, condemn it, but try to have a little perspective. We are currently involved in a war whose ongoing results are completely different from the originally predicted, incredible animal wars without end in sight. And whether you feel the war was needed to fight global terrorism, you cannot dispute the reality that the length, economic cost and most importantly the loss of human life has exceeded the levels that the "experts" backed us back in 2003. So even though no one involved is greedy or corrupt, errors were made "and errors of a rather serious size, to start. The same kind of serious error, if it may come in the nuclear energy industry, could make much of the earth's surface uninhabitable.
