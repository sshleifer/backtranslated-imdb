I have never been a big fan of Oliver Stone, often because I have found his film to be forced, preaching and generally flawless. The two rock movies I really like are JFK and Talk Radio, but Talk Radio takes the cake to be Stone's finest performance. Stone is an instructor in which you are either a fan or you are not, it is safe to say that before you watch Talk Radio, I was not fond of the guy and considered one of the most overrated instructors in the film industry, but After seeing Talk Radio some of my perceptions have changed. Talk Radio is a disturbing and entertaining attack on what is now known as "reality TV". Talk Radio follows a self-reliant, dysfunctional, definite, hysterical, outrageous and confusing radio value, called Barry Champlain, hosting a controversial late-night radio program in Dallas. He quickly becomes known for his bold and neat air presence, and he becomes a sennat experience, whereby averse junkies, crimes, racists, sociopaths, sickos, perverts, and morons admit to being ridiculed in the air. The film shows the rise and fall of the man's career, carefully making a precise account of freedom of speech. Originally adapted from a stage game, the film puts on the theater theme, as it was originally built around, wonderfully conveying the violent nature of the film. <br /> <br /> With the horrible energy and non-stereotypical air, Radio brings all the hilarity behind "crass media". It is even more exciting today than it was in the late 80s. The film explores the types of arrogance, self-observation, offensive behavior, controversy, hypocrisy, and ignorance. The movie shows in a controlled way how good it is to have a personal opinion and freedom of speech, but it is something that must be used wisely instead of shamefully dull. Stone is trying to show how freedom of speech is crucial in life, but that is something we should be careful and careful about. The film asks the question "is our protagonist starring the same as the sad people calling the show?" <br /> <br /> Stone creates the factory movie key set (radio station) with an ambition and cold atmosphere. He then succeeds in capturing the isolation, the fear, the ambiguity and the dangerous emotions built on the radio station. Eric Bogosian is perfectly cast as the isolated, self-absorbed and complex genius, Barry Champlain. He fits in with the role that completely offsets his lines with such enthusiasm, urgency, confusion, brusqueness and ultimately the bold greeting in his offensive nature. The priest brims with spark, which was apparently robbed by an Oscar nomination. His voice fits the character, as it is a primary element of a radio host and his power to perform with tragedies and comedies seems excellent. <br /> <br /> There is a strong use of editing in Stein's movie and Talk Radio boasts some of his purest, most rhythmic editing. He uses beautifully controlled camera techniques, which differs from being quiet to suddenly becoming turbulent. There is a live energy behind the film, with its raw and wonderfully lovely script, which acts as a central piece for the film's grandeur. The striking and virtuous cinematography currently stands out inside and outside the studio, which impresses most impressive city at night. Not forgetting the exciting heartbreaking yet dark fun climatic "downhill spiral" is ultimately remarkable cinema. Talk Radio is an important modern masterpiece, I'm sure you'll be surprised at how great it really is. I highly recommend Talk Radio to anyone interested in media or movies. Talk Radio is a great example of top-notch, intellectual and insightful entertainment that still packs a well-deserved wakeup call. Finally, if it wasn't for Eric Bogosian, the movie would not be the fun, lovely and enduring masterpiece it is today.
