I watched this movie when it was released and was really young and not too much for the cinema. It was one of the most fascinating movie experiences I ever had, and it really was a brand inside me. First, I did not fully understand the story and probably failed to make the necessary connections between past and present when the film presents them to the viewer. Years after I first saw that I managed to see it again, and that was the time I fell in love with 'The English Patient', it touched me so deeply, and for me it became the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Anthony Minghella made a fantastic movie, everywhere is great and he manages through his camera to create incredible feelings within you. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie's music is such a big part of the character's entire emotional journey, and the movie wouldn't be the same without it. <br /> <br /> But the best thing was the fragile performance that Ralph Fiennes gave in th's masterpiece. He plays so well the man who falls in love slowly, but so deeply with Katherine Clifton, opens his heart and dives into this forbidden affair. <br /> <br /> The most heartbreaking scene for me will always be the one where wounded Katherine is worn by Almasy against Swimmers Cave, and she wears the Thimble he bought her. She says, "I've always used it. I've always loved you" and at that moment he begins to cry with such pain flowing from within. <br /> <br /> Juliette Binoche is also great in her performance and really deserved the Oscar she won. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a movie that anyone who preaches himself as a cinema should look at their lives.
