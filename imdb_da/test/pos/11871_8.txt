This movie will never be on a list of the 50 best movies all the time, but if you compile a "funny movie" list, this is not a bad place to start. Liv Tyler is amazing, captivating and delicious, and everyone else is dead, just for their parts. It is a 21st century counterpart to "Tom Jones" - in other words; Just good, fun fun. I think this can be Tyler's breakthrough movie on the way to great stardom. With no nudity she throws sex in this movie. It is no wonder that all the boys give their toys. How could they help but do it for a helpless, innocent like Life's Jewel?
