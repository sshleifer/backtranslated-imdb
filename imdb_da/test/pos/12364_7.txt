Victor Sjöström was quite a master of this film, had stared into it, directed it and even wrote the script! It's pretty amazing. While few have any idea who Sjöström was, he can be known to Ingmar Bergman fans as the star of Bergman's most recognized film, WILD STRAWBERRIES. <br /> <br /> As for this movie, it is a very mixed bag. On the one hand, you must respect it, because it is a very good movie for 1921. The idea of ​​the Grim Reaper sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is quite imaginative. Plus, the special effect of Phantom Carriage is quite convincing and technically this is a well-made movie. On the other hand, it is a fantastic dated and preaching movie - more like something you would expect to appear at Sunday School instead of an honest goodness theater. In addition, some of the elements of history do not make sense. Instead of coming out as dedicated or good, the dying salvation works like a juice - a very sad and confusing juice. Why is she "in love" with this man? I'm missing something? So my recommendation is that if you are sindssy in love with silents (like me) then watch it anyway. But if you're not a silent fan, this movie can't do anything to convince you that this style movie is brilliant because the story is so melodramatic and dated.
