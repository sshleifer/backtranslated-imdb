There is a serious scene in this movie. A scene that lets you know that his movie won't pull many cheap battles. It takes place in a crowded train station, and the protagonists are hit by murderers with automatic weapons. They pause for it and just get out into a shotgun. The main train station station is now filled with bodies of innocent people caught in the crossfire. Some will call it too sad and / or bleak to put into what would be an enjoyable action flick. I call it honesty. Most action films tend to lean against the "safe side" to show violence and plot elements. This means mostly that innocent people, despite massive shootings, tend not to die or at least we do not see them die. The violence is all the good guys compared to the evil boys with mainly the bad dead. A bit of common sense clearly shows that this is absurd. Renny Harlin showed a hint of this in his first (and unfortunately only) hit, Die Hard 2. The scouts intentionally steer a plane full of people to get their point across. The scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people aboard down, but the ugly and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used. But to fit the spirit of the first movie, Die Hard 2 was mostly a "fun action movie." Here is the uglier and more convincing edge transparent. Violence is bloody. The one liners are fun, but with a certain style that echoes natural human sarcasm than clich√© displays at important moments of action. The plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action films. The villain is not just a villain for revenge or a crazy grip on power. It's less ridiculous, but also more scary than that. From recent films, the "Bourne" trilogy almost comes with the less cheesy than the usual action movie style, but this movie is from 1996 and 7 years before "The Bourne Identity" with Matt Damon made it to the big screen. <Br /> <br /> Another interesting aspect is that main hero is actually a heroine. And it is good before the movie version of "Tomb Raider" became a hit. What's more, this heroine really looks like she could take down John McClane and then take her still-lit cigarette. This movie marks Geena Davis' second action-heroine role, and she still failed to score a hit. While Angelina Jolie stars in "Tomb Raider" years later and scores a hit. The reasons are beyond me. Quite. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is not all dark-edged. There are many monstrous and spectacular sets of pieces that can only be seen in an action movie. The climate explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular exhibition of movie pyrotechnics, with more than one physics law taking a convenient break. Thus, there is formula here, but it is anti-formula for the daily Hollywood Action Movie Formula. --- 9/10 <br /> <br /> BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence, disgrace
