"Gaming? Nicotine? Fisticuffs? We are moving in a downward spiral of evil!" So says the head of St. Swithen after inspecting the master's joint at Nutbourne. The Faculty and the students in St. The Swith has been ordered to share facilities at Nutbourne to avoid German bombs during World War II. Then there is the master's library. "Samuel Pepy's Diary? Abbreviated ... It's Something to Be Grateful for. What's Here? Casanova Memoirs? Wasn't that the book we caught Jessica James reading in the closet? Decameron Nights! Well, really! place maybe or not, it is no place to bring carefully-groomed girls! "<br /> <br /> Yes, a horrible mistake is made by the Ministry of Education. Nutbourne is a school for boys. St. Swithen is a school for girls. And what makes this one of the best post-WWII British comedies, is Nutbourne's chief champion Wetherby Pond ... played by Alastair Sim, while St. Swithen's main mistress is Muriel Whitchurch ... played by Margaret Rutherford. <br /> <br /> "St. Swithen's?" says dam. "You don't mean to say you're a school for boys and girls?" He asks one of the early girls. "Only girls" she cheerfully says. "Does that mean Mr Lord," one of Nutbourne's teachers asks, "do we expect 100 young girls?" "This means that the Ministry has not only made a mistake sending a school here at all, but it is guilty of a terrible sexual deviation!" <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford's Miss Whitchurch, as positive and uninhabitable as a battleship, intends to make the most of it by quickly taking over Nutbourne, if possible. Alastair Sims Pond is enchanted to its large bald head and is determined to save its school. Meanwhile, there are 100 young girls and 170 young boys to be fed, and there are places to sleep (along with all their teachers). The chefs and caretakers, totally put on, go out. Miss Whitchurch and her girls are, however, up to the cooking tasks. "Come on, Angela," she says to a girl trying to touch something in a big jar, "haven't you made porridge before?" "Yes, but no one ever had to eat it." "It's a defeatist attitude, my dear. Touch it well and don't rinse shally." <br /> <br /> It's hardly going well when Pond discovers four governors from a school he hopes to lead, arriving at any time to see for himself how well Led Nutbourne is. And Miss Whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents have just come to see how their daughters do in the new boy free, they were told - facilities. The only solution? Miss Whitchurch and Pond, their teachers and their students, collide a split shift of classes to give the notion that Nutbourne has no girls and that St. The Swith has no boys. After the parents have examined a dorm and left for a class, the girls go to the beds underneath and the boys who have been hidden jump into the beds, just as the governors enter. Boys are observed in rugby and, as soon as the governors turn their backs, the goal post is taken down, nets for lacrosse are set up, and just as the parents go over to observe the girls. A parent places her daughter in a science class, then instantly sees her in a choir exercise, so moments later .... "There is Angela again," she says to Miss Whitchurch. "Why it is," she replied, pursuing the parents to avoid the governors approaching just around the corner. "The child is quite ubiquitous." <br /> <br /> Leaving Nutbourne, everything has been discovered. Students are repainting. The teachers are dazed (except for two who kiss.) The Ministry of Education has just sent several busloads of students. The parents are speechless, but the governors are not. "We are waiting for an explanation," you say strongly. Pond holds his head and shakes. "Don't you see, I'm trying to think of one." <br /> <br /> The movie moves from a complicated and ridiculous situation after another, braced by a very funny script and two hugely comedic performances by Rutherford and Sim. Sim's droll exasperation and Rutherford's undeniable determination are so well-matched that it's a shame, it's the only movie they've ever made together. Joyce Grenfell, like Gossage, St. Swithen's tall, awkward running sports teacher gives them some competition. If you watch out, you can also find some entertaining references, director Frank Launder works in, including a gong at Nutbourne, which looks like a midget version of J. Arthur Rank's, a faint echo of the quote theme from The Third Man and a shot. David Leans Oliver Twist's chair, except this time, the little boy stops holding his porridge bowl and says, "Please, sir. I don't want to anymore." <br /> <br /> Frank Launder and his partner, Sidney Gilliat, were responsible for some of the best films produced in Britain in the thirties, eighties, and fifties. They wrote, produced and directed, sometimes one, sometimes the other. Somehow, they were responsible for such top class movies as Green for Danger (with a master droll performance by Sim), I see a dark stranger, The Lady Vanishes, Night Train to Munich, Wee Geordie, The Belles of St. Trinian's, The Rake's Progress and many others. With the happiest days in your life, the laundries wrote and figured while they were both producing. It's one of their best.
