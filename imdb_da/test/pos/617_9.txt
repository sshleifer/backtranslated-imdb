This is one of the movies to start watching with an open mind. You know it goes to a dumb you can look forward to or be afraid of a lot of emotions. <br /> <br /> Forget it. The movie starts with a little black humor and then begins. From then on, it takes you on an ever-frightening trip through Moscow's dark centers. Okay, it must be said: The unexpected terms are expected, and mute is used mainly as a plot tool or fear builder. But this movie doesn't allow you to go. <br /> <br /> It's like the old gangster movies, but without any glamor at all and in Russia. And this is one of the most important aspects of this movie: It is located in Russia. This has a great influence on the movie, according to me, it does better. Everything becomes simple and basic, life is without nonsense. This could be a great potential for more films in the future, gangster film about the Russian mafia. It's a beautiful and scary movie. It's horror, but you can't feel but sympathy for the little mute. One final piece of advice: Don't look this late at night if you want to sleep well.
