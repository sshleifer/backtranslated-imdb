First of all: If you like watching movies I do NOT recommend you to watch this. Why? Afterwards you will not appreciate another movie so easily more ... <br /> <br /> I will not actually give rise to any great expectations, but it is almost scary how perfect, intense and beautiful this work in Einar Gudmundsson is. When in most movies is there at least one aspect that spoils everything, like good actors, but terrible dialogues or a nice landscape, but low budget filmography? in the "angels of the universe" there is nothing of this ambivalence. Really everything is just amazing, even (and not least) the soundtrack with the magnificent Sigur RÃ³s. <br /> <br /> In this story of Pall, a student who goes schizophrenic after being dumped by his girlfriend, especially the dialogues (and monologues) deserves some attention: along with (and sometimes in sharp contrast) The plot ranges from depressing and fatalistic to the opposite of comic and completely absurd. Moreover, they are often (with quotes from Hegel and Shakespeare) of such a poetic beauty that the film almost goes into a surreal bullet and is only stored in the real world by its incredibly authentic actors. <br /> <br /> One of the other comments already referred to another point: This movie is not a trivial entertainment for relaxing at night. In spite of several comic reliefs, it is largely disturbing, partly cynical and bitter and most sad. a modern poetry about a life of madness with all its emptiness, rage and loneliness. <br /> <br /> Finally: Once you've seen the movie ?? see it again. There are some good visual metaphors and allusions in what you only understand when you look twice and connect them to the moral of history. And of course, read the book, it contains much more of the little funny stories in between and makes you also able to understand some things in the movie a little better.
