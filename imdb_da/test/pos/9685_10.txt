This movie was the limit of raw humor .... I can't quite believe that these people can get away with this. Johnny Knoxville didn't cross the line ... he stomped all over! This was better than the first one ... EVERYTHING! What I found about the first film was that shenanigans were something like it was at t.v. show. NOT THIS TIME !!! they have completely made a 180 degree flip ... the whole casting is so excellent in what they do and was not stunty crazy ... but the music basically fits in any situation ... GOOD WORK !!!! When you see this, be sure to use the bathroom before going to the theater, maintaining a strong stomach and rememba not letting your drink squirt out of your nose.
