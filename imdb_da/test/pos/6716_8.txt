"Lifeforce" is a truly bizarre adaptation of the novel "The Space Vampires" by Colin Wilson, written by Dan O'Bannon & Don Jakoby. A common US-British space research team makes a landmark discovery: a foreign spacecraft resting inside Halley's Comet, which contains three units resembling humans, one of them a female beauty (the oh-so enchanting Mathilda May). <br /> <br /> They take these discoveries back on board their own spacecraft. Big mistake. It turns out that these creatures drain the lives of humans and as American colonel Carlsen (an intense, edgy and committed Steve Railsback) and British S.A.S. Colonel Caine (a solid Peter Firth) looks in horror, an attack by vampireism overtakes London, with the fate of the earth in the balance. <br /> <br /> This image certainly doesn't miss the imagination. It moves a little slowly at times, but offers so many strange and imaginative ideas and eye-shading images that it's hard not to be entertained. The first of director Tobe Hoopers' three-picture deal with Cannon Films (he followed it up with "Texas Chainsaw Massacre II" and "Invaders from Mars" remake) makes him something unique. Includes elements of sci-fi, vampire movies, zombie movies and end-of-the-world sagas like what I haven't seen before. <br /> <br /> Railsback and Firth are strongly supported by such strong Brit actors as Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart, Michael Gothard, Aubrey Morris and John Hallam. Mathilda May is very memorable as the enchanting, enigmatic scrub; It doesn't hurt that she performs much of her scenes in the key. It is also worth noting is a touching music score from none other than the "Pink Panther" composer Henry Mancini. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous it may be, but I also found it fun. It is flamboyant and exciting entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
