There is a "Third Man" look at the shady B&W photography of STOLEN IDENTITY, a thriller produced by Turhan Bey, a star of Universal images during the 40s. It is an expertly filmed tale of jealousy that leads to murder when a famous pianist (FRANCIS LEADER) becomes too possessed by his wife (JOAN CAMDEN) and will soon make an arrangement to murder a man she has an affair with . /> <br /> A taxi driver (DONALD BUKA) happens to give the woman's love a lift to the hotel when he steps outside for a moment to chat with a worker digging up the street. Lederer uses the sound of the drill to subdue the sound of the ball he puts in the passenger's head from the outside on the back of the car. When Buka returns to his cab, he finds a death in the passenger seat. <br /> <br /> Enroute to report the murder of the police, he changes and decides to change identity with the dead man who has an American passport, which means that Buka could realize his ambition to return to the United States . The stolen identity plot becomes thicker when the man's boyfriend (Leader's wife) appears at the hotel to accuse Buka of publishing the dead man. It's the kind of plot movie-goers have probably seen countless times, but it will be a great training here with many excited scenes, as Buka and Leader's wife plan to run from the authorities to a final confrontation with the killer and the police. It is extremely absorbent, well done and keeps the interest everywhere with some excellent atmospheric photography by Vienna that reminds most movie guests of "The Third Man". <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
