I think Pierre LÃ©aud, or his character, is accurate, is really outlandish but with grace: I also remember the chess player and the girl who seems to be random in her home, something really curious ... woman who acts as lawyer, is one of the most beautiful actresses ever seen on the screen ... but I have to admit that the plot is too inconsistent to be taken seriously .... The character as a leading theater actor is really nice, especially when he is annoyed by the new actor, the purple t-shirt ... also the scene where the bearded actor - belonging to another company - heads the stage, is really fascinating and relaxing, as often happens with this movie - for example when they drink tea, they just make you have a cup ...
