This series when dinosaur lived 65 million years ago. Dinosaur looks very real and is very realistic as they move. It is also very interesting how the climate changes. <br /> <br /> I am very interested in how the dinosaurs lived and died. I'm also interesting in how the dinosaurs behaved. <br /> <br /> The color of dinosaurs is also interesting to see and discover. They think about what color they had. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing is why the dinosaurs died and what happened after that. The BBC has made a brilliant series of how the dinosaurs lived and died!
