Matthau is a widow hospital doctor enjoys his single status and the footloose and available nurses on staff while colleague and friend Richard Benjamin looks at with amusement and amazement. Their boss is keen on the Senile Chief of Staff Art Carney, who is re-elected to that post. <br /> <br /> Matthau is happy to play the field without commitment until he meets single mother Glenda Jackson who insists on being the only woman in her life while in her life. At the same time, he comes under pressure to meet the amorous progress of a potential hearing in a flawed case and to support the Shambolic and incompetent Carney in his attempt to be re-elected Chief of Staff. <br /> <br /> This is a superior old-fashioned romantic comedy adorned by four Grade A actors and an excellent support box working with a premium dry, caustic and sarcastic script. Carney steals every scene he is in, and in the likeness of IMDb, we have rolled on the floor and laughed loudly when he came on the screen. We are otherwise entertained by the on-off relationship between the two leaders and different subplots. <br /> <br /> Lacking the ambition to be a good movie, but still one of the best of its kind and can be seen and re-watchable for its comical value alone. Deserve more attention than it seems to have received and worth the price of the DVD or video cassette.
