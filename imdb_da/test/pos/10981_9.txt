Witticisms, colorful characters, family relationships, difficulty handling, living with fun and humor. This movie has it all and more. What a great 'every man (and woman)' story, with a top notch plot and script. It just offers fun, lots of laughter, lots of smiles and pure entertainment for the whole family. Other reviewers describe the story some. I just want to offer this comparison teaser ?? It's part of "Best of Show", "Grumpy Old Men", "Millions" and some other comedies and life flicks rolled into one. This gem of a movie probably had limited edition and is probably not much available for rent. But it is now out on DVD and I highly recommend it for purchase. If you like good old-fashioned fun and entertaining movies for the family, don't miss out on "Manna from Heaven." This movie is a safe fire scene for the blues or to chase the dark away at unpleasant weather or hard times.
