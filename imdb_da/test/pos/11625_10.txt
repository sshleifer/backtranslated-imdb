As an adventure mini-series, it is as good as it gets. I considered it as it was originally shown on HBO. Sigrid is absolutely credible in his role as Philadelphia, and the whole production was first-rate! See all 400 minutes of it if you can. I highly recommend this mini-series. Great that I can't judge it officially, but for you readers / users I will tell you it's a solid 10!
