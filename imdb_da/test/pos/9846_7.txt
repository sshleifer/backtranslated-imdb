The big James Cagney, capitalized, is not shown to the second third of the movie, and is likely to have less screening time than Dudley Digges who play eee-wild reform school potentate. But when Jimmy comes as a substitute for something to reform reform schools, he flushes the air with his hands and jumps on the balls at his feet and spits out punchy Warners-First National dialogue with all the usual and expected panache. The psychology of this sharp antique, one of Warner's many efforts to claim his place as the "socially conscious" study, does not run deep: Digger is bad, just because the manuscript requires him to be and there is the picturesque view. that juvenile delinquents will become bulging children if they just get a touch of autonomy. But it's made in the extra fast style that the studio specializes in, and it never lives. Frankie Darro, who entered all sorts of screen problems over a short period of time as Warners' favorite Rotten Street Kid, is an ideal JD - a beautiful charismatic rogue with a pug nose and a hat-filled star that could thicken steel. No child actor today can touch him.
