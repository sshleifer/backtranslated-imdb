On another view, this is still a wonderful romance which, in my opinion, is much better than the movie it featured on my 2-DVD set, Leo McCarey weepie classic "An Affair to Remember". Still, it seems to have fallen out of favor a little (Only a 6.6 rating here on IMDb and dismissed by many critics as "gooey slush"). How sad, because this is an intelligent romantic drama with very good work by the two leaders, Jennifer Jones and William Holden. If that were to be the case, the film must be well-knit for the beautiful color kinematics and the unforgettable musical score. I don't like Valentine's Day, but it gave me an excuse to watch this movie again and I'm happy about it. While I still think the character's character's death is too strong foreshadowed, excitement takes off the last scenes, this movie is very moving and I really enjoy it.
