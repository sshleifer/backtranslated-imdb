** SPOILERS ** Shocking but true story of the horror that took place in Alabama / Georgia's border town Phenix when it was taken over by a gang of organized hoodlums that transform it into the South Sinby. <br /> <br /> With crime skyrocketing and no one turning to a group of concerned citizens, well-respected Phenix lawyer Albert Patterson, John McIntire, will be running for the Office of State District Attorney. With the criminal element of Phenix doing everything, from intimidation to direct murder, to keeping voters in shape to getting the Patterson nomination, he still wins with the other 86 counties of the state, not including Phenix Russell County, giving him the key with a little over 1,000 votes. <br /> <br /> Fear of what Patterson would do when taking office manager of Phenix Mob Rett Tanner, Edward Andrews, has hit him. Patterson has been shot down while driving to his office, but his murderers are mocked by Ellie Rhodes, Kathryn Grant, who soon becomes an informant in Patterson's office that Tanner's next person is in the process of targeting murder. What Tanner & Co. hadn't expected that late Albert Patterson's son John, Richard Kiley, got the news from Ellie about his father's murder before his boys could close her! The big miscalculation on Tanner's side will end up putting an end to both his criminal organization and his freedom! Powerful documentary film with the actual people involved in the events given about 15 minutes at the start of the movie to tell their stories. This despite the fact that they were still in danger of being murdered by Tanner Mob, who was still running at the time their interviews were filmed! <br /> <br /> Finish what his brave father started John Patterson with a hand brought story about Phenix City to the front of both the state and national newspapers that give Tanner the very negative advertising that he tried so hard to avoid. With the now Alabama National Guard flooding to Phenix City, the bloodthirsty and ghastly, who were not willing to stand up for cannons in their hands, Tanner Mob evaporated from sight as a morning mat after the sunlight hit it! And with John Patterson, now taking the place of his murdered father as the new lawyer of Alabama, you can be sure that Patterson Mob has seen his last days pushing people around and murdering them. All they want to see now in the future is the gray prison walls and bars that will be their home sweet home for the rest of their rotten and miserable life! <br /> <br /> Very probably the most graphically violent movie to get out of Hollywood until then "The Phenix City Story" took no beating in showing how a group of lawless and powerful criminals can make a completely American City to living hell for everyone in it. No one was spewed from these ruthless gangsters who did not even think twice when it came to killing even women and children if that was what was needed to keep them in force! As for the Phenix City Police Department, they had better things to do so enforced the law that they were sworn and paid to maintain. They were having coffee and donuts while their town was burnt to the ground by gangsters like Tanner who had them in their hip pockets!
