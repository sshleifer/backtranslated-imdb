I thought the movie started a little slow and uninhibited for the first hour. However, it became more absorbent, fascinating and surprising in the last two hours. So, as it begins as a cheap horror movie, it develops into a beautiful and wonderful fantasy film. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda stands out as Snow Queen. This was her best performance, and it is boring that this was apparently her last achievement since she hasn't acted in the last 7 years. She definitely personifies both the winter's beauty and coldness. My daughter, 14 years old, found the movie a bit scary, so if you show it as family entertainment, be with your child and reassure her or him that it's just a fairy tale fantasy and not to take it too seriously. It's really one of the best fantasy movies I've seen in a long time, a little better than "Eragon" or any of the "Lord of the Rings." It's about as good as "The Golden Compass".
