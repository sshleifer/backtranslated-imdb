Not all movies are worthy of Oscar, but let's see, sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression. This left me smiling and happy and I couldn't wait to squeeze my own son. Anyone who has had a pet (no matter what type) knows what it feels like to lose one. I think most people would identify with Buddy, who almost lost his best friend as he traveled from birth. Bruce Willis was great when tycoon became good guy and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing as a good mother. The little boy who played Buddy had a cherub face, and his sister and friend Edgar played amazing backup roles. I liked the movie a lot and it was something the whole family could enjoy. Thanks!
