I can't see why everyone is bombarding this so much. I thought it was a really fun time that unfortunately wasn't popular enough to be the famous one. Believe me, I've seen a lot much worse than this. If you want a bad movie, watch the bloodshack or the stranger's death or something. So what this is usually slasher fare but better than most. And it can be seen. This movie also has one of the best audio tracks I've heard. Some of the music is very exciting. And death scenes are also cool. We see a very bloody body in a bathtub with the words SOLD written in the blood on the mirror, and we also get a cold double stroke at a toilet stamp! with razors attached to it! This was a good fun 80s slasher that is definitely worth your time despite what others say about it.
