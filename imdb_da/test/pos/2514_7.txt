A bland title disguises this solidly carpentered example of old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment. This movie shows a huge successful hodgepodge of several elements: a while, a romantic drama, a crime movie and a political thriller. Interestingly, though it is made by Fox, its main characters are ?? Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck ?? both were normally associated with other studies; Their on-screen chemistry is palpable and ultimately led to marriage in a few years. While a little too young, Taylor is a burgeoning hero (a Marine designated by President McKinley to uncover the sins of an organized cleanup of many banks); not surprisingly, he has not previously tracked them (led by smooth Brian Donlevy and thuggish Victor McLaglen) that he falls to a chanteuse (of course Stanwyck) who has thrown his party with the gang ?? Even if truth is told, song is far from being the actor's forte! Similarly, apart from proving his worth to do so in his fold, he must devote himself to McLaglen for Stanwyk's attention; By the way, the practical joker reminded the person of the former me very much Charley Chase in SIGN OF DESERT (1933), who was otherwise governed by William A. Seiter. Later, Taylor is in two thoughts of involving Stanwyck in the upcoming bait and trying to offer his resignation to the president while he goes with the girl ?? But the jealous rival disturbs their plans. The robbery went wrong, we found Donlevy's death and the other two in prison; Taylor hopes for McKinley's intervention? has meanwhile learned the identity of the evasive and obviously prominent 'inner man'? is apparently dashed when the president wins up murdered himself (a great plot twist, although the resulting eleventh tension feels constructed)! To get back to the movie's style of styles, even though the vaudeville sequences are a matter of taste, does the romantic triangle lower something and it scatters something on the excitement aspect, which seems like a beautiful production indeed? Douglas Fowley, Sig Rumann and, as two US presidents, Sidney Blackmer (The Bubbly Theodore Roosevelt) and Frank Conroy (McKinley) already mentioned, are already supported by John Carradine.
