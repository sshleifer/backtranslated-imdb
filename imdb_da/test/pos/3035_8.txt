I saw Conrack on one night, I couldn't sleep, and I was never so happy to get insomnia! This story of a young white teacher taking a position on poor black children on an Carolina island is a great advertisement for teaching and simply helping each other. Seen in the early 60s with the civil rights of Viet Nam and everything that came with the 60s, it is forgotten that the Peace Corps and many young people went out to make a difference to help the non-privileged. Along with his open learning style, he is interested in these children as humans and encourages an honest interaction in his class that scares the power that is. The biggest part was that Jon Voight said they had a 20 year reunion and 18 of these children became teachers !! That's enough to make you believe that we as humans can have a chance to survive us, perhaps hopefully. Watch this movie.
