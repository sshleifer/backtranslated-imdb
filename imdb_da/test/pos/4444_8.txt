I'm not a big fan of Lucio Fulci's movie. Most of his 80's gorefilm had their moments, but often came across the second class Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining "Zombi" (who was a George Romero imitation), I couldn't really enjoy them. I know that Italian scare often ignores the plot, but the story and characters of his film were just too threads, even by the standards. That's why "Torture a duckling" didn't surprise me. It is actually a very well-filmed movie with an exciting murder mystery. Its possibly the best giallo ever made, only seriously rivaled by Dario Argento's post in the genre. And unlike Fulci's former giallo "A Lizard in a Woman's Skin", this never pulls. <br /> <br /> Fulci's direction here is pretty good. He keeps the story moving at a good pace and preserves viewers' interest throughout. Furthermore, the conclusion comes to the mystery as a complete surprise to the audience. In addition, he adds some clever hand, such as the upbeat soul music during a particularly disturbing cemetery limiting sequence. Overall, the violence here is maintained and used only when necessary for history. The plot is also good for the most part, full of familiar faces from the 70's Italian exploitation cinema. Both Thomas Milian and Barbara Bouchet are super cool all the way through. The only weak connection is Florinda Bolkan, whose performance is far above the top. That's the only ridiculous aspect of the movie. "Torture not a duckling" definitely comes with my recommendation and can be a good introduction to giallo subgenre as a whole. (8/10)
