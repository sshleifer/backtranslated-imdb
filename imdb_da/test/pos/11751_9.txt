Directed by a veteran Hollywood director Henry King, who began his career still in 1915, love is a great thing that was one of his last major films. It was based on a bestseller of Han Suyin, simply called A Many Splended Thing term, which was borrowed by the author of the poetry of the kingdom of God by Francis Thompson, where the many spoken words "love" were used in a completely different and rather transcendental context means God's love. Created in the 1950s, the film co-branded with works by such directors as Douglas Sirk and Vincente Minnelli a kind of renascence of the melodrama, its florescence and once again a top popularity. The story begins when a stylish American reporter Mark Elliott, who plays William Holden, once again in one of his irresistible `playboy 'roles comes to Hong Kong and meets a young and handsome Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) of half Chinese semi-English origin working as a doctor in a hospital and whose husband was recently killed by Chinese Communists. Immediately Mark felt a rather strong attraction to her, but in the beginning his deep feelings were not entirely retarded by his heart cold after her husband's death ("I only believe in human heart now as a doctor"). But very soon she is releasing the persistent vengeance of tempting as hell Mark, and both go into a passionate relationship that apparently can be stopped by nothing, even though Mark is unhappy married and his wife will not give him a divorce or social differences and prejudices caused by Han's Chinese origin. But it is still the fate that has a final word to say to determine the justice of the eternity of such a happy loving relationship, no matter how long the two assume it is the merciless time waiting in a court alarming form of death, prepared at any time to prove its imprecision. Undoubtedly one of the most romantic films ever made, love is a many exciting thing with fine performances by William Holden and Jennifer Jones, a wonderful Oscar-winning musical score by Alfred Newman and extremely romantic, touching, heart-warming but ultimately heartbreaking story. Don't miss out on the many amazing movies. 8/10 <br /> <br />
