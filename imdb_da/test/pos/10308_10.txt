Regardless of the truth of the fact, Bandit Queen is a true story, it is true, because the themes it deals with hold so much truth today as they made their way back in 1994. This film is violent, powerful and thought-provoking. The protagonist is a woman of flesh and blood whose adversity exclaimed the best (or worst) of her. Retaining subjectivity aside there is no doubt that Phoolan's character from a young girl of 8 who is married to her father to remove a debt (proverb) to a gang leader who continues to become a leader of it The bottom caste has evolved into a master in itself. Her portrayal is so powerful that the viewer herself is willing to forgive her for a massacre. <br /> <br /> I can understand if the Western audience can't appreciate this masterpiece, the Bandit Queen should be "studied" in the Indian context and not just checked out in stereotypes. I may not be able to sell it on its universal appeal, but it is definitely a must to see the Indian audience. It is a pity that the film had a delayed, overtly censored release in India. Bandit Queen is the story of a woman who fought against two odds in India, as a woman and that for a lower caste, her rebellious nature and the inability to just give in, caused her the most terrible experiences in life that only continued to strengthen her into a self-proclaimed goddess. She reacted to violence with violence, and it became the entertaining woman community who wanted her to be. Call it Divine Justice or Legal Failure if she had killed a single person she would have been hung, she killed 24 and was honored, respected and glorified. <br /> <br /> PS # The one who found his character "psychotic" needs to be sodomized at 8, gangraped by 10 men on the go and paraded naked. Then they should be asked - How normal do they feel?
