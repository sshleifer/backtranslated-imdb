Like most other reviewers, I really enjoyed this TV miniseries. I didn't see it when it first came out, but my grandfather - a big fan of mysteries and war movies - happened to record it in 1989. I remember seeing it with my grandparents' cabin one night and I was totally drawn into history ! It has a very exciting plot and a good mix of drama, romance and espionage. I've seen lots of movies set during World War II, but no one with a twist like this! Fortunately, I was able to make a VHS copy of the movie several years ago. I've seen it several times since then and I still enjoy it. I would love for this movie to be released on DVD. It would be so much easier to see with chapters.
