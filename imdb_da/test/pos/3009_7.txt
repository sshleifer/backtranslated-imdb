I couldn't believe the eye like that from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I'm happy to report that the photography in this movie is a splendor for the eye to see. There are so many rich, full-length images in front of me that every time I watch this movie, I find something new that I hadn't seen before. As with previous films I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color is used to capture his attention extremely well. Although the characters could have been better developed, the action and costuming was worth the price of admission. I recommend you buy this for your DVD collection. Even if you haven't seen this on the big screen, you won't be disappointed. I know I wasn't.
