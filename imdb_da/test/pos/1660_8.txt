American foreigners Jules Dassin makes an award winning French gangster movie. The plot involves Tony Stephanis, a hoodlum just outside the prison who takes his band of twenty on a $ 240 million jewel hoist. Unfortunately, his former wife's relationship with a notorious gangster named Grutter, an Italian security user named Cesar with a weakness for women, and his own friend's defaults. Well, the successful heist gets to be a bloody race against the time, which Grutter holds Jo's son scourge for cash in typically "crime never pays" tragedy fashion. "Rififi" in the title is explained in a song that means slang for basically violence and sex and the full title "Du rififi chez les hommes" means "Some cheeky men's house", which is pretty much where the characters' fatal errors occur. Let it go to a gangster movie to put most of the weight on the failures of the women, but this time, Jos wife gets the last laugh (if you could call it a laugh) when she predicts "Just kill every other." The characters are not the most sympathetic, and the women are mostly weak, but Dassin still builds an extremely well-made tension film out of them as they pull a heel that requires the utmost quiet, hides the goods and then tries to survive what basically becomes a cross-country cat and mouse game. In the mix, some very amazing photography and a fine attention to detail in editing, leading to a pacing and visual experience that translates the otherwise generic plot. Not only is it easy to see why this is held as a classic, it is also easy to see why it is among the top 250 on IMDb: it is exciting, visually magnificent, full of sex and violence, and maintains the stylish gangster setting , we film as much.
