This is a brilliant movie. The story begins in Romania, where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who can speak someone to do something. There is a really fun scene here, where Crystal is a child and tells her father who is a rabbis in eating pork (you may know that this is a parody of the religion of Christ). He is mostly a talent scout and he tries to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole movie has a terrible crew member, he accidentally falls into a small river. To believe he's dead, some big hands come out to reach him. He later thinks he's in heaven. He finds out that he is not, but that he is in a monastery. Believing in God saved him, he becomes a monk, searching for who saved him. He later finds a 7 ft 7 in man, which he throws as the perfect villain (he also recites Shakespeare!). Watch the movie and find the rest!
