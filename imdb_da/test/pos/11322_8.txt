Well, this movie was certainly in keeping with the present times. No happy conclusions, superheroes or miracles here. Just down-to-earth fiction to stimulate our minds in step with terrorism and what-if. Kudos to Percival and Mickery for an excellent script and great direction of Percival. Movies like this are needed to keep us aware of what's out there. If any peace-loving man and woman on the ground reported openly suspicious activities, I think terrorism could not thrive. This film showed just how hard it really is to undermine these terrorists, even with good intelligence. Although the film is a little propagandist over Islam (the use of a Muslim police officer as the protagonist), I think it was quite realistic. It was supposed to be shocking in the bombing incident. As a very clever tool to pass on the humility and indignity of people caught in an attack like this, the full nudity of women proved to be decontaminated after attack. It didn't take me long to realize that it was supposed to infuse even more into the viewer who believed, that is, we didn't have control over everything in such a situation. Although this took place in London, with the usual British high-level play, it declares every part of the world. Big movies don't have to be blocking epic productions, and this movie is very much worth seeing.
