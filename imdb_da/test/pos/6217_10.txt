Every episode I saw when I was an innocent child was stupid. There were some funny looking dolls called "The Mitts" that would always discuss childhood things. They wanted to play this song before the "The Mitts" part of the show goes like this: "Let's join the Mitts ..." There was a Groucho Marx puppet who told jokes. Before the session, this man would sing "Hot Fudge! Right On!" There was a green puppet with teeth called Seymore. We always wanted to see more Seymore. He wanted to crack jokes and sing all episodes. There was always a morale in each episode. An episode, a man sang "Liars are losers!" Another episode he sang about sharing and caring. Seymore said tell me about the two little girls "Sharon and Karen." The Hot Fudge Holey Moley section has this man doing nice things and they played weird music.
