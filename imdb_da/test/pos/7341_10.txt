Thanks for making such a wonderful escape. That's what I love about movies. I am so impressed with the aireals, how they were shot, and the timing was so dynamically perfect with the music. I am a dancer myself and have been part of many dance films. Choreography is usually chopped, cut and sometimes not even beat ..... "Showgirls" the Movie. The relationship between the ladies was ever so present in the movement. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the last time she's pulled over. I've seen the movie before, another version., And I didn't like the man last time. I felt a little more sad this time. It changes how I feel about the female love birds. It's all so magical.
