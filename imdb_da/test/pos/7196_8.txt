I just managed to find a copy of "Mission Cleopatra" which is not as easy as you would think for anyone living in the United States. So far, I've only been watching the first 10 minutes of the movie, and I can safely say that I laughed more in the 10 minutes than I saw the whole of the first * live action Asterix movie. <br /> <br /> I see the copied version, and while the dubbing job is a bit confusing, I've found the movie to be very fun and true to the book. I see that people here have said that the duplicate version is much inferior to the subtitled version, it may well be true, and after I have seen the subtitle version (also on my DVD), I may have to come here and change my review. As it stands, however, I think to be a very entertaining movie, and it does more than the mess they made of the first movie.
