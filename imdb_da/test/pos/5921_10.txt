This is a great story. Although there are some Jimmy Stewart cornball parts, it is mostly a compelling tale of a person with a compelling drive, vision and adventure experience - to say the least. The bottom line is that it is one of my favorites to look at, and I've probably done dozens of times at times - that is, until someone stole it from a bag I break back on a flight on a flight to California! <br /> <br /> Some have commented too many flashbacks, but I don't know a better way to keep a long flight interesting. For those of us who actually fly, planes can be hours of boredom punctured by moments of terror. I would not have wanted to see the plane shortened at all. The oppressive need for sleep and drone and surrounding loneliness is part of the story. <br /> <br /> There are many parts that I would especially like to include takeoff from Long Island and land at night in Paris (Wow, things have really changed with us and the French since then!). The aircraft's scenes and the record-flying flight from San Diego are interesting, just as the incident across the Atlantic in ice (which I understand is not quite true but happened on the San Diego flight). <br /> <br /> It is understood that one of Lindbergh's greatest assets is his enlightened followers as well as his persistence. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines calling in my head now and then include "Pulling Chocks!" on the start stage and "I hope I don't use it that way" as it describes the submarine-like "periscope" of the lady who lent him a mirror so he could better see his overhead instruments. <br /> This movie is not for everyone, but it is for me. I hope they do it on DVD soon, so I can replace my stolen version!
