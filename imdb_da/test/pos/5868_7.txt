Having been familiar with Hartley's "The Go-Between" for quite some time, both in its original book form and in its disappointing Pinter-Losey movie adaptation, it was interesting. "Hireling" sometimes shows almost a mirror image; set in a slightly less distant period for the body, with exposure of the British Class System, and containing a set of sports games (boxing takes place for cricket), which turns out very much. <br /> <br /> This is updated in its small scale, character focus. You don't exactly understand Lady Franklin and Leadbitter in Romanist sense, but this distance is appropriately played in telling the body's language and bending from the actors. Your distance from always fully sympathizing with a true sign reflects the dormant 'difference' that judges the central relationship. Miles and Shaw are wonderfully subtle, and we see more in their 'less'; Never once are these acting, flashy performances. They are appropriate Stanislavish interpretations that create the impression that these characters have life outside the film's framework. All other parts are handled very satisfactorily, even though they are much smaller in this movie than I assume in the novel and actually compared to "The Go-Between", a great work of disillusionment. <br /> <br /> The disillusionment in the middle of this movie is so sad and moving in the late stages where Shaw kisses Miles and is rejected, and then a drunk Leadbitter confronts Cantrip and Lady Franklin. It's a frightened shame that what would have been an incredibly exciting ending to broken, desolate life on both sides of the screen is "embellished" with a certain odd little coda. One is completely confused by the leap in tone when Shaw's Leadbitter appears and ironically sings "Rule Britannia" and "God Save the Queen" as he crashes his car into things. The political point is strongly overshadowed by this bombastic, rather dingily operable end. All feelings of subtlety so effectively performed so far are lost as the implicit point is heavy and obediently made. Agit-prop probably has no place in this kind of delicate period drama. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, one cannot be too hard. While this absurd end piece is a big mistake, the rest of the film must be praised as a sensitive, evocative film, of sorrow and detailed observation of how the British community was in the past. Hartley's slim but crystal clear touch is very evident in evidence. It's just a shame that we don't end up with the split conclusion to Shaw's drunk scene. The tragic, fake figure of Sarah Miles' Lady Franklin is suddenly denied her place on the epicenter of the movie, as the excellent human drama bizarre slides into the realms of political pointscoring. Shaw also - the most dry and yet deep feeling of actors - is betrayed by the excess profits that close the movie. thus; a fine, small scale triumph is sabotaged; But we should remember the many good points. <br /> <br /> Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
