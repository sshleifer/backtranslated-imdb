Seriously engaging, intelligent and thoughtful drama at its very best. Mean, gripping, mood and captivating. Every home should have a copy! Don't take my word because it sees it yourself. One Life Stand enables you to consider your own lifestyle and how to treat your family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive plays make it one of the best biographical graphic experiences of the year. John Kielty's debut is a pleasure and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and twig film. This is a movie that cares and has an honesty that is unmatched in recent years. No car hunts, but a movie filled with hum our and emotions. I first watched this movie screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2000 and am now happy to own a copy on DVD.
