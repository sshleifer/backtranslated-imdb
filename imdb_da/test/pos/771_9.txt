I have felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise from the role everyone knows of him. So even though I had never heard of this movie before, when it appeared in my cable TV listings, I immediately switched to that channel. I'm so glad I did! <br /> <br /> I've read from other reviewers that they generally don't like to come in ancient stories; On the other hand, I certainly do. I am one of those who always comes in age; I've been since I was 12, I'm 52 now, and I will probably continue until I'm 92. Being in age is nothing more than suddenly realizing the opportunities another day brings. The realization, its size, sometimes throws us into disarray. If we try to live our delicate self from it, then yes, I can see how the coming age can end. But if we just come across us and get acquainted with the new direction we have discovered, then we are suddenly on a new path, and we are as vibrant as we were yesterday, only stronger, brighter and I daresay, more interesting. <br /> <br /> So that was what this movie was about. This was a forthcoming age story all around; Young Ben, his father, father Robert, and certainly Dame Evie ... all went through a wonderful transformation. In fact, so did it, Mr. Fincham? All I did, suspected, except actually the mother, despite her enormous opportunity to do what was provided by the events at the end of the movie. One is left with the feeling that she will continue on exactly the same path she has been on, only with perhaps another supporting casting. So an excellent movie that could not have been made in America, which is totally depressing to think about but thank God, we have a steady supply of movies made elsewhere that we occasionally see. I really recommend this movie as long as you don't mind cutting through the parts of it that are all too familiar to all of us and laughing throughout the rest of it.
