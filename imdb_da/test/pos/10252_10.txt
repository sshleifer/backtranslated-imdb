In fact, Cooley High was a drama with comedy moments. It was a reflection of high school life back in the day. I attended Coolidge High in Washington, D.C. from 1976 to 1979, and much of what was in Cooley High was an everyday life at Coolidge. In fact, after the movie came out, everyone started to call Coolidge "Cooley High." To get high, shoot dice, chase girls, cellar parties and battles that sum up high school life for many in D.C. back in the day. I can't forget Motown because Motown music began and ended many a day back in the 70s. Hits just kept coming. But Cooley High adds a layer of humanity over the madness, because when everyone was said and done just like in Cooley High, my classmates and I had a lot of love for each other. And like the characters in Cooley High, there was life after high school, but there was nothing like waking up every morning and experiencing every day full from homeroom to seventh time. Thirty years later we are ready to celebrate the good times. Cooley High is definitely a while that just gets better over time, because that's the only thing left over from those days, memories, some good and some are bad.
