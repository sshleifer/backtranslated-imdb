This is one of those movies where it is easy to see how some people did not like it. My wife never saw it and when I just rewatched it last night I waited until she went to bed. She may have been amused by a few little excerpts, but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes. The head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is heavily mired in the psychedelic era. It can be seen as cinematic surrealism in a nutshell, or as a postmodern acid tour through movie genres. If you are not a big fan of these things - psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernism and "acid test aesthetics" (provided there is a difference between them), you should probably stay away from this movie. On the other hand, if you're a fan of those things, run out and buy Head now if you don't already have it. <br /> <br /> It is strange that the film has never had much respect. It probably has a lot to do with preconceptions. After all, it makes the star The Monkees - Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork - and The Monkees was a musical group of actors composed by the producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider to be a kid-friendly bubble-gummy Beatles to A tv-series. In their era, they had as much respect as, says Menudo, New Kids on the Block, Spice Girls, and so on. As a fellow IMDb reviewer rightly notes - "Maybe people in 1968, thinking of Monkees as a stupid factory-made pop band rip-off of the Beatles, refused to see (Head)". <br /> <br /> The monks and the head have never been quite capable of throwing the negative public opinion. It's a shame because there was a lot of talent both musically and otherwise in The Monkees. It is probably enough that Rafelson, who heads here and co-produces with Schneider, and Jack Nicholson (yes, Jack Nicholson), who wrote the manuscript and also contributed, decided to take The Monkees in this unusual direction. It is as if New Kids on the Block suddenly broke out an album similar to Pink Floyd's Ummagumma (1969) or Atom Heart Mother (1970). In fact, the songs in Head, written by The Monkees and frequent business partners such as Carole King and Harry Nilsson, have a Floyd-like quality, somewhere between the South Barrett era and the immediate post-Barrett era. This is much more prominent than any Beatles equality. Some people have complained about the music in the movie, but for me, all the songs are pearls. For that matter, some people do not think about Barrett's era (or anything else) Floyd, which is just as difficult for me to empathize with. <br /> <br /> But what _is_ Head about? The basics are that The Monkees take a tour through various movie genres - there are war scenes, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comedy scenes, drama scenes, western scenes, sci-fi scenes, romance scenes, and again and again. Except in the reality of the film, it turns out to be primarily (if not exclusively) on a study party. At the root we see The Monkees shoot a movie. Of course, all the scenes in the different genres have something surreal and self-reflective about them, and they, and individual shots within a scene, tend to lead to each other by using dream logic that is no different from Monty Python's television show. As a dream, the head tends to vacillate between a good dream and a nightmare, while it is often someone who will make you laugh at sleep (something that I often do by the way). Technically, Rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to realize the above. There are scenes with extensive negative images, there are many very fast cuts (including a fantastic sequence containing Davy Jones and Tony Basil, alternating in a white and a black space with a combination of white and black inverted in each of and to switch back and forth as fast as two pictures at a time), there are many bizarre segues that are an animated koemund that are strange editing units and so on. For my money, I want these things not only to be a relic of the psychedelic era. This is the kind of artistic approach I am looking forward to. It seemed like a good idea since then, and I still think it's a good idea. I would like to watch movies like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou using (2004) using these types of extended techniques. Now it would make the movie surreal. <br /> <br /> In terms of interpretation, some people who are not so consistent with the acidic trip aesthetic have complained that it is basically b. to offer meanings for something intended to have no one. I disagree with such a pessimistic / nihilistic view; The head was supposed to have a lot of meaning (s), and it is not just movies without conventional plotter that have more interpretations. Nicholson, Rafelson and Schneider have many interesting things to say about The Monkees film postmodernist commenting on their produced status; popstardom - before Pink Floyd, Head gathers popstom and violence, from images of war to images of fans who cannibalist dismantle their idols; and naive American-oriented ideas of international perceptions and respect - well-armed aliens in a desert surrender Micky Dolenz, just because he is American, then they blow a Coke machine (again in the desert) for him because he is thirsty and cannot access . The film commentes on many other topics - from large industry to police, investigations, spectacles (especially in relation to tragedies) and over and over again. The head is filled with ideas, appropriately enough, with intelligent, multifaceted things to say about them. Head deserves to be considered a classic - it is largely shot for the same vibe as The Beatles' Yellow Submarine. Both performed in November 1968, interestingly enough, and both were calculated as some of a summary of psychedelic aesthetics. Yellow Submarine was not entirely successful. The head is everything Yellow Submarine should have been.
