I watched this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and director Aku Louhimies introduced his movie and was ready for Q&A after. For some reason, this movie is called Frozen Land in English, so I don't know how the distributors were frozen out of Paha. This is a very good movie. It's not enough for me to knock it up in the excellent category, but I spoke to some viewers who felt it was an excellent movie. Louhimies said that back in Finland people either loved this movie or hated it and said many people in theaters went for it. I'm sure some protested against some of the violence, gang, drugs and alcohol abuse and sexual explicit scenes. It's a very smart story about how these different lives are woven together because of a trickle down effect. This film has very interesting and strong characters. I would rate it a 7.0 out of a possible 10 and would see it again and recommend it with caution.
