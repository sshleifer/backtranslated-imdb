Restored in beautiful water colors, Ponyo At The Cliff is certainly a sight to behold, the guard remembers the trailer, the witch I found not so impressive, I was surprised at how beautiful and detailed it was. This film is just washed over me with its purity. In the middle is a young boy who comes into contact with a sea animal, and it is their relationship that carries the film. Miyazaki is a champion both by creating memorable images and showing young interactive in a credible way with their small quirks intact. <br /> <br /> There are a few parts that don't fit well with me. It would be an understatement to say that the music during a particular scene "resembled" Ride Of The Valkyrians, it's a shame because such a precious movie like this can't afford to take liberties, and it hurts someone else really great scene. The antagonist and its back-story didn't interest me either, but I think it served more as a background than anything else. <br /> <br /> Anyway, great movie. The boat trip scenario with all its pictures and sea creatures stood out for me thinking. Clean and magical. And yes, handrawn artwork is more intimate than computer animated, I'm really pumped to Princes And the Frog now.
