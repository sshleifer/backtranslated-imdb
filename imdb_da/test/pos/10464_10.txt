This film highlights the soul of modern "elite" food culture, even though the film is 17 years old. The standing principle of the movie is: Food is more than just nourishing. It is also a strong symbol and a medium for culture itself. The main characters literally become heavy on the finest wine and food, inspired by idealistic thoughts and culture as they release their puritanism and passionate table manners. Karen Blixen's shortstory makes use of the difference between Northern Europe and Southern Europe to point out their inherent different approach to food. When the strict and slightly boring scandinavians are infected with "Eros" from the south, the party goes on. So what are you waiting for? Go see it ..... again!
