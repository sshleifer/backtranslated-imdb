DALLAS has a number of things to do with the "old-fashioned" westerns of the 30s and 40s (like DODGE CITY). Gary Cooper at his coolest, dazzling Technicolor photography by Ernest Haller (GONE WITH THE WIND) and a pulse pounding Max Steiner (KING KONG, GWTW, DODGE CITY et al.) Score. In addition, there is a masked, erroneous identity, a false death, and more hair breathing escapes than a republic's series. As always, Cooper defines what it is to be a man under pressure. Forget about the 50s anxiety Western ... this is pure entertainment!
