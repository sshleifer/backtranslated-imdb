I would suggest that Only the Valiant is one of the most original and exciting and in some ways strange films that Peck ever did; bold, surprising and one of his few best westerns (no, of course not a western real, but a military chronicle sometimes better -). It's pretty low budget, but, oh, very original and striking. It is one of those that treats a real buff, sometimes gets; film that no one has yet told you they exist. You say? It sounds exciting or interesting? And it exceeds your expectations. All in all, the script shows a level of maturity that is unusual for Westerners, and somehow it reminded me of ULZANA; It is also without a doubt. <br /> <br /> Peck looked good as a young and tough, somewhat gloomy and stoic officer; and there are many unexpected touches that the blonde child kisses and flirts with the one she has decided not to marry, perhaps a sense of her right to justice and retribution. Even genre ?? wise, ONLY ?? is so much more than a military story? It is also an action drama, a thrill movie, a command / action thriller ?? the strangest combo imaginable; a bunch of soldiers in a special mission to counter and stop a possible native attack ?? - the crazy decision not to take all the available troops to the place where these natives could be stopped? but only a handful of people ?? - And this plot never takes a shit? as most would and did ??. The interests of people, of people and of their reasons and actions never fall. <br /> <br /> A word about the word about Peck himself; he performs with brio, and although I usually find his famous movie to be a little incomplete and boring, I find in such small excursions all of Peck's gloomy and even chilling glamor. He was an unusual star. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this extraordinary movie.
