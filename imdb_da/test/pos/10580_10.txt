After reading all of Sarah Waters books, I was eagerly looking forward to a BBC adaptation of Fingersmith. Especially since Tipping the Velvet had been done so well by the old well-known Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> I wasn't disappointed with the results, I actually think this might be on a par with TTV; both romantic and entertaining. And not like so many ignorant people wanted you to believe, a meaningless lesbian romp. Having been a fan of Elaine Cassidy's since she had seen her shameless journey in Felicia's Journey, she thought she had both a deceit and a growing fragility like Maud. Her transformation was credible and impressive to see. I recognized Sally Hawkins as Zena Blake from Tipping the Velvet, a small role primarily, so I didn't have so many expectations, but she was amazing in the role of Sue Trinder. Her eyes were fascinating, conveying everything from rage to absolute despair. The two of those who acted together combined these talents made this drama unacceptable. Of course, Imelda Staunton was amazing as usual, she is unmistakably a national treasure, and the support molding was all of a high standard. Even the direction from the rather unknown Aisling Walsh used contrasting yet beautiful shades of blue to Briar and brown to London. But so much praise must be given to the Ransley scriptwriter. Creating a 600-page book with each line being of the highest quality for a three-hour extravaganza is a huge feat. time. He has my full admiration. In summary, a brilliant adaptation where everyone involved gave 100% and made this one of the best BBC dramas I've seen.
