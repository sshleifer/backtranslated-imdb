I recently watched this movie hoping to see a precise portrayal of the bloodiest battle of the 20th century. I got what I expected and so much more. Just to believe I came across this movie successfully before I had never heard of it. It's a German movie made in 1993, so I suppose I can't be surprised that it's almost completely unknown to the modern American audience. It's a shame because this really is a remarkable movie, I dare say it's so good if it's not better than Platoon, Full metal jacket, Apocalypse now and All quiet on the western front; all of which are iconic war films. <br /> <br /> 1942: World War II is in full swing. Nazi Germany has overrun mainland europe and parts of north africa, so adolf hitler orders the invasion of the Soviet Union on a full scale. A destructive step that ultimately condemns Nazi Germany to defeat. In the early stages, the invasion goes well, and the German armies conquer large parts of the Soviet territory, but a critical blow follows Stalingrad, a city that has a great symbolic and strategic value. The battle soon becomes a bloodbath of epic proportions, a nightmare for both German and Russian soldiers. On the border of taking the city, the Germans suddenly become counter-attacks by the Russians, who end up cutting off entire German 6th army within Stalingrad. To make matters worse, the Russian winter will cause incredible suffering for the Germans. Throughout the entire match is seen through the eyes of some young German soldiers struggling to survive not only against the Russians and the harsh winter conditions, but also against their own sadistic officers who only care about medals and glory and the generals who have little regard to average foot soldier. <br /> <br /> This movie will spoil me for a while. The German soldiers that the film concentrates on are so young and naive, so their humanity and hygiene are removed from them, and you really feel sorry for them because they are not the demonic Nazis who are often portrayed in movies. Everything they fought for is no longer important, and everything they believed was split, and after fighting a cruel fight against the Russians inside Stalingrad, we see them further deteriorating at the start of Winter, which gets many to freeze to death. Strokes and winter scenes were like a terrible nightmare, but it also felt so right. It is amazing, at first we see strapping young men in their senses of life, and ultimately removing a distinction of their former selves for everything. After experiencing so much bloodshed, these men just lose their will to live on, it was really sad. When there is finally a moment of hope, they are betrayed by Hitler, who ultimately surrenders these men to a terrible death, which is just another of Hitler's crimes that surrender to the men who fought for him to stay slaughtered by the Russians. <br /> <br /> A good anti-war film depicts the atrocities of war, and that is what this film does. The battle for the tractor factory's order Is the closest thing to hell on earth, but it really is what The Battle for Stalingrad was. The German and Russian soldiers were depicted with humanity, it was only the bad apples (specifically on the German side) who sentenced the men. The bottom line is this movie is a great reason why we see how men break down physically and emotionally during the war. We all have our borders, and these men were pushed far beyond their borders in the most deadly battle of our time. What the average foot soldier issued at Stalingrad was beyond imagination. Even if they had survived everything they had seen and done, they would have arrested them for life. Stalingrad shows us why the war is hell and what just as much looks like.
