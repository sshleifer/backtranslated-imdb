This is a bizarre marvel, directed by the guy who edited "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." Chuck Conners provides a hilarious over-the-top performance as the owner of a roadside "wax" museum, which our convicted teenagers happen to break down nearby. The adult figures look "so right", one teenager points out. Heh hehe ... Not so much a slasher movie as a weird mix of psychologically scared and old-fashioned "House of Wax" style terror. I can think of many, many horror movies that are worse than this one.
