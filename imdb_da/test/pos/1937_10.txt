This is a forgotten classic of a movie, and Harmony Karin borrowed a ton from it to "Gummo". Rubber is good, River's Edge is way, much better. It is no secret that Keanu Reeves is not the best actor on earth. No, he's actually a terrible actor. But he was born for some roles: Ted Preston, Esquire from Bill and Ted, and his role in this movie. He is perfect as a kind of good natured but very apathetic and confused teen. Then there's Crispin Glover. I think his performance in this movie is the best of his career. He is phenomenal as the driven wackjob character. Then there's Dennis Hopper, who is also perfect. This movie is simply amazing, and if you haven't seen it, run out and watch it today. It is brilliant. One of the best portraits of modern America I've seen.
