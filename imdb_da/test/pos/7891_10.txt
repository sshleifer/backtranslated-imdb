I finally saw the real reason why Peter Boyle became famous. It wasn't the monster in "Young Frankenstein" or rubbing Frank Barone on "Everybody Loves Raymond". For younger people who only know him from television, this movie gives a try, it makes Frank look like a saint. "Joe" is Boyle's finest acting role, and as someone mentioned, probably inspired "Archie Bunker" at "All In The Family". I think Boyle himself went back to "Joe" a little to play Frank. (I say this because I noticed the basement of both "Joe" and Frank Barone). <br /> <br /> I didn't know anything about this movie when I checked it out of the library, I only knew Boyle and Susan Sarandon was highlighted. Yes, Susan looks good here, and a young actress has a very good early role. A young hippie will be, who escapes her parents home and lives with the ultimate lost in a drug-induced hastehippie who also sells as much as he buys. After a near-fatal overdose On too many pills, she is hospitalized, while her parents are gathering her stuff, her mother does not go into the smelly, run down the apartment, but her father does. While Dad picks up her stuff, her boyfriend comes home, and the two exchange words and then Dad do what we want to hear later, Joe says he would like to do with a hippie. Joe shoots his mouth about how he hates various cultures / races, hippies and a laundry list of others. When he says, "I really want to kill one of them", Dad (trying to look like he's doing fun) says, "I just did". Joe almost buys it, but takes it so much fun. <br /> <br /> Later, when the police are on stage and the story is in the paper, Joe realizes he is not kidding. Instead of sailing the rich guy for money through extortion, he actually fights a kind of challenge. By just having him and his wife "get to know" him and his wife. Long story short their association is awkward, but after Sarandon gets wind of what her father did, the bottom is in danger of falling out. <br /> <br /> In the end, how this all plays out will have to look for yourself. Although it's over 35 years ago, the end is something you won't expect. Unless you've seen the movie before, of course. Again I recommend it most to those who haven't seen it. <br /> <br /> 10 stars for Boyle not only plays quite the opposite, but for what will show others that he was more than just a television and movie comedy actor. (END)
