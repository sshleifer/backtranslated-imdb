As a camera operator, I couldn't help but admire the beautiful look that this image achieved. The performances were excellent, just like the story. Just as I thought this movie was slowing down, it didn't. Heart-pounding excitement, great pacing through editing, and a score that knows when to be quiet, all come here under competent and competent direction. The camera was always in the right place. Love it.
