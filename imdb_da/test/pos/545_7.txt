I thought everywhere, but here was a good movie. It's the stars two wonderful actresses Susan Sarandon and Natlie Portman, who when I heard they were in a movie together, I'm not able to see it. On the whole it was a nice movie. It had been moments where I felt they were trying hard, and there was also some really exaggerated and worn material, but there was nothing in the movie that I absolutely hated. I liked how they used pop-up performances of unredited Thora Birch, and all the little happy / sad moments touch and are effective. If you want to watch this movie, go ahead, because although I don't recommend it, it's not something you should avoid, and a 5.9 rating seems unfair in my opinion.
