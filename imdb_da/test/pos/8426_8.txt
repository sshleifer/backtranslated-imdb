Here is one of Jane Austen's films, which I found very nice. I read the book first and listened to it on CD and was fascinated by how a young Victorian girl could be persuaded to marry the man she loved because of his lack of wealth or education. The joy of knowing that Anne is apparently reunited with a lost love. The fact that her godmother is trying to marry her for a good for nothing cousin, which is only for the money. Look at the snobbery that comes from the upper classes and how the class distinction can divide pairs from following their hearts. Captain Wentworth acknowledged that he still loves Anne after seven years. His final understanding that Anne's love was constant all the time and that she would not let her family interfere with her true happiness and any marriage to someone she truly loved.
