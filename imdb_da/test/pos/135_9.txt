The camera is the shiny feature of the movie. Park really knows its stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes behind a camera. Each shot is filled with vibrant colors that pop out of the screen. Each movie frame seems to tell a story alone. I hope there is a Blu-ray release of this movie because it will look great. It is quite exciting to see which elements of the vampire mythology park are used for his vision. Singing hyeon must drink blood to survive, and to remain undefined, has incredible strength and is vulnerable to sunlight. However, he does not have fangs and also has a reflection in the mirror. Although I have never seen the movie, I couldn't help but it feels like this was the Chan-wook Park version of Twilight. The whole center of the film is devoted to the love of Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo to each other. It felt like the adult version of Twilight, really. There are lots of blood, nudity, sex, and even a few obscenities cast in good measure. Maybe it's the Chan-Wook Park fanboy in me, but I honestly feel I can guarantee this is the better movie of the two. The psychological aspect I love about Park's earlier films is also in Thirst. It's an important factor for me as any movie that makes me think or is unusual, in any way blows into being a favorite for fans. The soundtracks for Park's movies always seem to fit their respective movie as a glove. Thirst is no exception. While the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time, it fits the overall atmosphere of the movie fairly effortlessly. <br /> <br /> The middle part of the movie seemed to be stretching beyond anything else in the movie. It's weird, though the scenes of that time are crucial to the film's history and it's hard to imagine that Thirst is the same movie if any of these scenes were cut. Nevertheless, it's my only nitpick of the movie. <br /> <br /> Chan-wook Park bites into vampire mythology with Thirst and puts its own dark, psychological twist on it. The park's films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following: good writing, beautiful filmography, a solid cast, a kind of psychological twist that gets rooted and a memorable ending. Thirst delivers on all fronts and will hopefully get more of the attention it deserved during its theatrical round of DVD (and ultimately Blu-ray, hopefully).
