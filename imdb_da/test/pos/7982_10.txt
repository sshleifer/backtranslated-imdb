Any Batman fan will know how great the movies are, they have been a great success. Batman Returns is by far the best movie in the series. A combination of excellent management, brilliant plays and settings makes it worth looking at one night in. Tim Burton, who directed this movie, has specifically ensured that this movie provides a realistic atmosphere, and he's finished a good job. Danny Devito (penguin man) is a man who has inherited penguin characteristics as a baby, and grown up to become an ugly and ugly thing! Michelle Pfiffer plays the slender and very seductive 'Catwoman' after cats had given her the nerve to be bitten. The result of both character changes is excellent, and both Catwoman and Penguin man play a very important role in this excellent movie. The mysterious Catwoman is very fun to watch - her classic words and a fun part that jumping with her whip in a jewelry store adds so much fun to the movie. Danny Devito also does well, his ability to imitate some strange creatures was crucial, and he adds a good mood to the movie that takes us back to the boring sewers where he lives. You can't forget Batman though. Micheal Keaton again draws a pleasant performance and shows us another side to Batman. His devotion escapes when he confronts Catwoman at the end of the movie, and his encounters with her when she is a normal person, Selina Kyle, result in him being seduced a lot in his own home. There is a smart part after this when they leave, and the movie is full of amazing scenes. It is worth noting that Bruce Wayne's Bat mobile is not used as much as in the other Batman movies, as close combat and narrative scenes make this movie. The winter setting is created perfectly in Gotham City with most of the scenes being set at night and the city is filled with snow. Therefore, if you see this movie in the summer as I have, it doesn't feel the same. Best to see it in the winter. All in all, it's a great movie. All the credit goes to Tom Burton and the cast, they have done an incredible job.
