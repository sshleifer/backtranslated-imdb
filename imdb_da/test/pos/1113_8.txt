The most lively portrait of the small town oddity I've seen for a long time - and I'm not just talking about Australian movies. This piece of work seems to have been made "under the radar", and it is truly a fascinating piece of work that has a world-world that is mostly invisible in the latest Aust. film production. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is quite slow and strange - it seems to meander hither and hence not really sure if it is a thriller or a "main movie". But the amazing aspect of the movie by Alex Frayne is its iron-fisted, ruthless direction. It's never wavers, it's very controlled, accurate and completely confident. The cinematography is some of the most artificial, beautiful and lyrical I have seen. The sound is all psychological, the music builds up the excitement. In the third act, the story is rampant and episodes collide and converge - try not to pick up the puzzle in the last 20 minutes, it's a bit of a duty - but at that time the movie has a bit of trance, a kind of hypnosis, and you're been sold a riddle - it has no real answer.
