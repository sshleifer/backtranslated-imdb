But George and Gracie are not among them. The movie is fun and the pool table scene with WC Fields must be among the funniest I have ever seen, but Gracie and George are more annoying than comic in their roles, partly from script lacking and partly from their interpretation. I gave it a 7 out of 10 for the rest of the throw, WC is a treasure of comic timing and energy in it.
