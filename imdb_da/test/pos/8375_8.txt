It's a good movie in Vienna about a taxi driver, Toni (Donald Buka), who steals a passenger's identity when the passenger is shot while sitting on the back of his cab. This gives him an identity as he is an illegal immigrant, but he must play the victim's role until he takes a flight to the United States with a ticket in the victim's name. Mrs. Manelli (Joan Camden) holds him, but she is accused of having mental problems by her husband, Claude (Francis Lederer), a concert pianist. As a result, Toni gets rid of the hook. Claude doesn't want to share his wife, but she runs away from him. There are several plot twists and finally both Toni and Mrs Manelli run together for it - they both try to escape from their lives in Vienna. There is an exciting, exciting structure for the final. Should they get away ..... ?? ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the picture quality is not great and there is a line running down the middle of the picture for a while. Cast are all very good in their roles, especially Francis Lederer's portrayal of Claude. Also important for the story is Heinth (Manfred Inger) as cab company owner, Marie (Inge Konradi) as Toni's hometown boyfriend and inspector (Hermann Erhardt). <br /> <br /> It's a good movie.
