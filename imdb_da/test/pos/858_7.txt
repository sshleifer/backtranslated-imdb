When I watched this movie, the first thing that jumped at me was that Kelly Overton's performance was a young (and up and coming star) actress, whom I saw for the first time, completely blew me away .. she's amazing on the screen and I'm really looking forward to seeing what the future brings her to. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was good in the sense that Kelly Overton does her thing and take the fan on a trip ... not very new tho I had the feeling I had seen everything before. but a good experience :) I would recommend this movie ... if only to see Kelly Overton .. this scene actor takes the screen by storm .. I give this movie a voice of 7 ... 5 for the performing performance and 2 for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> And on a last note .. sorry about my bad english .. if this is gibberish for you: P plz ignore me ...
