I saw Borderline several years ago at AMC. I've seen it ever since. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream, and I didn't care where. I will never forget the curtain that blows in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but I find that life is like that. It didn't disturb me. The injustice of the ultimate rejection of an innocent character strikes me as unfortunately true. I loved the faces that the camera lived on them. The camera stared at the set with the unfocused eyes of a daydreamer. Borderline was right for me in a way movies are not. It was precisely the lack of explanation, color, sharpness that made it come into my consciousness like a thief at night. I love this movie. Today I want to own it.
