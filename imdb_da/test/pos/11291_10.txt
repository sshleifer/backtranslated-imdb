I first heard about the Begotten when my boyfriend picked it up in a "cool classics" section of my local video retailer. She knew I liked obscure artsy movies, so I rented it and brought it home. It was sitting on my TV for a couple of days, and then I put it in the VCR just before I went to bed. I thought I might see how it is first, and rather spend more time for the next day. What followed was that it actually woke me up. I sat through the whole movie and loved it. After I went through the final credits I saw it again. Only when you see the final credits will you get an idea of ​​who is who. When you know you can see it again with renewed understanding. Don't listen to the people who tear this movie apart. It's not for everyone. If you are a person who does not like to read subtitles than this movie is not for you (not that there are subtitles, there is no dialogue at all). If you are someone who actually owns Rush Hour 2, this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> This movie is truly original and inspirational. It does what other movies have never done. It looks nothing more and is bolder than almost everything out there - from 1989 to the current date. You can tell that anyone involved in the production of this movie really loves the art of doing what they do and understanding what can be captured in the cinema form. <br /> <br /> If you want to be "entertained" then the movie is not for you. However, it is pure escapism in an extreme way and in film form. It's like any attached wiring to my head and wallpaper one of my worst nightmares. But this nightmare makes sense if you really see and look at the pictures, dissect the actors' actions and not sit there while you noodle your guitar passively, but don't look and blink. People compare it to Eraserhead but Begotten is so much more. I'm not talking when I say it's my favorite movie. It is an important film, visually stimulating, mechanically inspiring and hypnotic. However, a review I read about it is very true, "no one will get through the Begotten without being marked."
