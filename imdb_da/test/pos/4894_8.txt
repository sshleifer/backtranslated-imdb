After three excellent BBC TV shows' and a Christmas day, the bizarre and grotesque (yet perversely lovable) characters in the gloomy fictional city of Royston Vasey jumped to celluloid along with their creators - The Gentleman League. <br /> <br /> Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are the more well-known three-quarters of the foursome, with the central roles being shared between the trio. In an added twist, the final member of the team - Jeremy Dyson - is depicted by actor Michael Sheen. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Dyson (Sheen) is in talks with his cohorts when - horrors of horror - he is visited by two of his grisliest characters. Both Tubbs (Pemberton) and Edward Tattsyrup (Shearsmith) are unhappy with the league's decision to kill the vicious people. "You're not real!" Dyson scares in vain as the local shop owners from hell exact their revenge. Mayhem follows, as reality and Vasey converge with the vast number of characters entering our world to save theirs. <br /> <br /> Confused? You will be, as the camp, induendo-ridden Teutonic, Mr. Lipp (Pemberton) is forced to take on the daily cover of Pemberton (Pemberton), while Pemberton (Pemberton) is kidnapped by cannibalist butcher Hillary Briss (Gatiss) and Geoff Tipps (Shearsmith). <br /> <br /> With shadows of even more demented misery, Briss is trying to force Pemberton to rewrite the movie - thus continuing his life - but letting Geoff be responsible is never a good idea. The former comedian gets involved in The League's latest, post-Vasey adventure - The King's Evil - into a typical twisted 18th century England, complete with cameos from Victoria Wood, Peter Kay and David Warner. Known as George of Asda (due to his chosen line of clothing), Geoff saves the day and is treated like a hero, but for the film he is old and new at Royston Vasey Church to meet with their decision makers. <br /> <br /> For fans of the series, the movie is a must-see. And yes, it has Papa Lazarou (albeit a little too fleeting). Pen-loving Pauline, Mickey, Barbara, and cursed veterinarian Matthew Chinnery are some of the other favorites on the show, and the league's portrayal of itself (plus Sheen's as Dyson) is also a fascinating insight. The Men's League is the British comedy's radio head - they are ambitious, groundbreaking (witness the excellent series of three) and are not happy to rest on their laurels. They also share their opinion accordingly. Their macabre sense of humor is certainly not for every palate, and although they are not written exclusively for "fans," an understanding of history would benefit those who have previously seen in series. Nevertheless, Apocalypse is a movie in itself, and The League will no doubt be able to attract a new breed of fan, as well as appealing and pleasingly existing.
