I bet I watch this movie 4 or 5 times a year, and I will do that more often now, as Hollyweird moguls have seen it good to put it on DVD because it is a Classic with a capital "C"! This movie is timeless! How can people pay $ 10.00 today to watch the JUNK coming out of Hollyweird with movies like THE Egyptian; The ten commands; BEN HOW; CAPTAIN NEWMAN MD on tape; DVD; and cable film channels; I could go on forever, but this movie is so big, and for a relatively unknown, Edmund Purdom wears the film as Atlas wore the world. The story is wonderful, the play is first-rate, and the graphics at the end are so powerful you sit in your seat for a few minutes, just try to let the words sink in! Really a knockout of a movie. I would give this one 15 stars if they would let me! They don't make them more like this, but they should !!!!!
