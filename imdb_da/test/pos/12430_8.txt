This was on Showtime the second night, and I figured it would be another made-to-video crap party, like "Earth vs Spider" or any of the other HBO horror shorts. Instead I found a comedy / go classic. It was legitimate fun, and surprisingly, the play was pretty good. Even my wife, a senior horror hater, agreed and laughed at parts. In addition, the film was of high quality. <br /> All in all, the movie felt like a parody of Joy Ride / Jeepers Creepers, and the two main characters reminded me of the couple from Shaun of the Dead. Definitely worth looking at, but don't take it seriously. <br /> <br /> The end.
