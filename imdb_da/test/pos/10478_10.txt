If not the best movie ever made, "Babette's Feast" is definitely among the most loving. This is a wonderful exploration of the importance of art, generosity, loyalty and grace. Humor is mixed with longing; characters treated with looking for honesty but also deep respect. There are meditations here on memory, fate, old age and faithfulness. Marvelous camera work by cinematographer Henning Kristiansen: rarely has wrinkled faces as luminous in candle light. The meal is accompanied by delicious time music, Brahms, Mozart and simple folk song. Enjoy this feast for the eyes and the spirit, for as the general says, "Mercy and truth have met, and righteousness and bliss shall kiss one another."
