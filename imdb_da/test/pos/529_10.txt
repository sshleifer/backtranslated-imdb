I absolutely loved this movie! Since I do not want to give away much, the basics are about a mother and a daughter and the life they have together. It's a very cordial story, between the battles they have. I also think Natalie and Susan have perfect chemistry throughout the movie! This is definitely worth seeing! Two thumbs up, all the way up!
