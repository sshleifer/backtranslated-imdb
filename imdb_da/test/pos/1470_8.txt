Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of South Park, are finally out of their lopsided schedule to talk to the cameras while sipping champagne in their hot tub. Only when I looked at this did I not feel so much sarcasm as it was in this. I knew they were funny when they wanted to complain about various actors on the show and when Trey said he wouldn't give his mother any of his money, but there is so much sarcasm all the way through that this documentary is more of a mockumentary full of interior jokes. <br /> <br /> This "documentary" shows all about South Park (until the second season anyway). It shows what goes on behind the scenes with the animation and the recording. It has interviews, many of which are false interviews, but some of all the fabrications give insight into the show. Clips from both Trey Parkers Spirit of Christmas shorts are shown, as are many good clips from the show. If you were a South Park fan, then it should have quenched your thirst for some knowledge back in late 1998 when this was made. Now, visually has changed, but it's still interesting. What we have here is a funny documentary where Trey Parker (especially) and Matt Stone come out as arrogant jerks, and that's exactly what they wanted to come out like. They may be like that, but here it was a joke, a 51 minute insightful joke. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out of ****. 51 minutes. Not rated, contains language and sexual content.
