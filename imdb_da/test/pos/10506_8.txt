This movie will undoubtedly not go well with some, mostly of horror being mental. But it has a little something for almost everyone, including a couple of really cool abduction scenes with foreigners. The film makes widespread use of alien theology while also showing a bit more intelligence on some aspects of abduction myths than one would expect from a movie. Jillian McWhirter is excellent in what should have been a cruel show.
