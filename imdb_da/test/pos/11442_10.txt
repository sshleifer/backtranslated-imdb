This movie probably gave me the most pleasant surprise of anyone I've ever seen. It was not a big budget production, and its premises, middle-aged amateur jazz musicians, get an unexpected professional engagement on a Catskills-like resort, seems pretty modest. What is not modest is the success of the movie. This is a small slice-of-life movie that is most entertaining all the way through. Director Frank D. Gilroy also wrote the script and it is full of interesting subplots and unexpected phrases. The actors are travelers who do a solid job. The biggest revelation for me was Cleavon Little. He plays a professional musician who is employed to fill a suffering band member. His attitude immediately breaks with the others. While they see it as an opportunity for great fun and once in a lifetime, he sees it as his job and not a particularly interesting one. This leads to conflict, but when the group gets into trouble, he steers them through. Little, who died too young, really showed me that he was a fine actor with this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a true sleeper, the kind that a movie fan always hopes to discover. I highly recommend it.
