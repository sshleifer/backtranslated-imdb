I've never read a Jacqueline Susann novel, but I've also seen Dollard Dollars, based on another of her books. On both occasions, I thought the movie is probably better than the book and will improve better with age (certainly contrary to the books). The reason is that a movie focuses more on a particular style in fashion, design and behavior patterns. And in this aspect, The Love Machine offers a great deal. The set design fits perfectly with the story. And all the characters also fit in. They are perfect in the way they perform a well-balanced general image. They are superficial and do not evolve, it is true, but in this film I will not have it different. David Hemmings represents the role he played in Antonioni's Blow Up. And it's more than a rip-off. He is a fashion photographer, looks visibly aged and seems to start going a little to seed. Robert Ryan represents the role he played in Max Oph√ºl's Caught, he is Smith Ohlrig again, greedy, bored and boring, uninspired and uninspiring. It is possible that Ryan did not want to be in this picture and acted accordingly, on the other hand he could have thought a lot about his part and then having a carefully studied performance. Whatever happened, it fits the picture. Dyan Cannon is great (amazing wardrobe!), She dominates every scene she's in and is involved in the movie's two highlights: the burning of a luxurious bed and the slaughter of the Hemmings character with an Oscar statuette. <Br /> <br /> The title, The Love Machine, is of course meant ironic. Robin Stone is a kind of Barry Lyndon in the pop era (by the way, the movie is a little kubrickysh). That he chooses a television station to work his way to the top, seems to be a mere coincidence. He sees love (means sexual favors) as a means of personal progress. There are quite scary hints about a restless sexuality that is not explored in the movie. Homosexuality is treated very relaxed, probably not the standard of mayor films from the period. Television managers' open cynicism does not have to fear comparing with other good films on the subject such as A Face in the Crowd or Network or Truman Show. They produce crap, they agree on each other, it's bad, and they know they will make a lot of dough with it. <br /> <br /> I do not regret using the odd 108 minutes of this movie and would not be surprised if it fetched a cool one, provided it got the chance (meaning a DVD release).
