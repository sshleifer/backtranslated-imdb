Well that's a good movie. But you have to admit that Van Dam's movie hasn't been so good lately. On the other hand, if you are a hardcore van Dame fan, you need to see this as there is a huge improvement in combat situations. Also what I really liked is the music beautiful music. is sure this will kill time if you are action fan. As for Isaac Florentine, the director of undisputed 2, I do not think he did a good job as he did with undisputed. I can't wait when one day Van Dam's movie hits the movies before the DVD. Perhaps one day :). <br /> <br /> Finally, it is worth looking at if you have no other action movies to see, it could make your hour and half fun.
