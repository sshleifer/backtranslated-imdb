It's too bad that iameracing wants to deny the reality of Faulkner's and Clarence Brown's purpose in creating history and movies of "Intruder In The Dust". I suppose the burden of a racism story is difficult for any southern to bear and I can understand it. But to say that this film was not specific about racism, is ridiculous and inaccurate. YES (to borrow your use of the headgear) iameracing, there are many many places where black and white people in the south go together quite well. But to deny the way black people were and are still forced to live, the conditions and injustices they have had to endure are not imaginary. Sometimes black and white people came together because of true love and understanding. Sometimes it was only so long that black "knew their place". The point of making the Juano Hernandez character (in film and print) a somewhat dot type, not hot and unclear, should be emphasized that bigotry is wrong in itself and human rights are just that for everyone, whether we like a particular individual or not. <br /> <br /> It would do well to stop the existence of racism and the great damage it has done to the Americans in all stripes. The fact is that black people (among others) are not usually an exception, receiving the benefits of justice as straightforward as whites. Segregation, discrimination and lynching are historical facts. People like iameracing can argue that these things weren't as widespread as some think and would probably love to rid their ancestors and heroes of any connection with such behavior. It would be a wonderful thing if the southern ancestors of americacing (if any) never participated in any of the terrible racist acts that marked the history of this country and I hope they did not. If so, congratulations to them, but the fact, if it is true, does not erase the fact that others did. And even though the terrible things that were done for blacks in the south (and other areas, let us not forget the discussions in the time of civil war) were only half as many, only a third, making them less dreadful? Are the murders of ten children hanging on ten men sexually assaulted by ten women who are no less horrible than the same things happening with one hundred? <br /> <br /> Iameracing asks us to get the "Mississippi Burning" plate away from our shoulders before we see "Intrusion In The Dust", well I ask you, has the civil rights activists murdered or not? Why should it be forgotten? Forgiven? Maybe. However, to prevent their recurrence, they cannot be forgotten or revised in minor instances. The racism shown in "The burglar in the dust" is shown intentionally. It is there to make a point. <br /> <br /> At a cinematic historical level, it is also ridiculous to avoid discounts on the racial angle. Any viewer of movies filmed before the 1960s knows that black actors / characters / extras were usually deliberately cast. Judging from our film history; wars were always fought by middle-aged white men; There were no black people in the Old West; it was possible to walk down a street in a big city and never encounter a black person; there were no black hospital orders, taxi drivers, clerks, salesmen, etc. Blacks were almost never cast for a role unless race was a factor. If Falukner (and Brown) had wanted to tell a simple murder story, he would probably not have made Hernandez's character black. <br /> <br /> Racism exists in America racing. Probably for various reasons I am sure we both want it not, but it does. If things want to be the way we want them to be, they can't help but they still don't.
