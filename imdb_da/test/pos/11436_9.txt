This is a wonderful new movie still in cinemas in my country. Its director, Calabrian Gianni Amelio, may, in my humble opinion, be the only modern Italian director along with Nanni Moretti to deserve to be called great (that is, except the old gentlemen who are still around and occasionally still running out of movies ). It is one of my biggest regrets that today's Italian cinema has been cumbersome since the mid-70s, mainly due to a serious lack of funding and care for new talent, something that can be transferred to most fields and that makes Italy one of the most static industrialized countries of our time production (both in the industrial and cultural sense) ... as opposed to, China says. And this is among other things the topic of Amelio's latest film. Few directors can talk to me about the true, present country of the world and the world that Amelio can do, but his pictures also have a valuable timelessness and universality. And for those who are already concerned that they can be slow, bad and dignified - be sure of them: I have certainly not seen them, at least not if you are used to qualifying European cinema. <br /> The basic plan: Vincenzo Buonavolontà is a technician at an outdated steel factory plant somewhere in Italy, probably north. He is played by Sergio Castellitto, one of today's most versatile and talented actors in Italy. When a major Chinese steel company buys some of the Italian steelworks' industrial machinery, Vincenzo tries to understand itself from the non-Italian speaking Chinese director, trying to tell him that the machine is defective and its conversion needs replacing an item it is working on special construction itself. He warns them that not doing so can have very dangerous consequences. Meanwhile, a young Chinese woman called Liu Hua works as an interpreter between the two men, but seems to struggle to find appropriate translations for some of Vincenzo's technical jargon. The Italian eventually loses her patience with her and almost pushes her aside and asks her to give him the Chinese-Italian dictionary so that he can do the translation himself. <br /> <br /> Despite Vincenzo's warnings, the following morning he finds that the Chinese factory director and his staff have returned to their own country while not even being able to afford the appropriate use of the industrial machine. Vincenzo, thus equipped with its great integrity, sets off for China. And here begins an infinitely fascinating road movie through China, a highly current 21st century Odyssey through the Asian Giant. One last day Marco Polo's quest for the mysteries of the mysterious nation? Not quite. As in all Amelio's films, the journey itself becomes much more important than whether its ultimate "mission" is performed or not. In fact, the way the point is literally brought home is not without a hint of humor, a nice, exciting paradox and irony that made my eyes good while smiling at the same time. The spectator has entered into the secret that Vincenzo's turn was ultimately useless, but he himself does not know it and goes home to a happy man, a fake innocent. At least you reckon he's happy. Sort of. They travel as Amelio's characters embark on complete uplifting and stripping them down to their harsh, human essences. They are instantly without a name, status or someone to put a word for them. These Theo Angelopoulos-like themes have also been explored in Lamerica, in fact my favorite Amelio movie, closely followed by La Stella che non c'è in accordance with personal preferences. In the 1994 film Lamerica, two Italian racketeers travel to Albania to "run business". Like Vincenzo, they intend to go there, do what they need to do and then go home again. Instead, these two Italians end up for an almost homeric journey through this ruined land right after the fall of communism. <br /> <br /> But let's go back to La Stella che non c'è: sometime Vincenzo is in China, he predictably discovers that the apparent "simple" task of transferring the converter to his new owner is anything but straight ahead. The machine's new location is apparently almost impossible to determine unless he begins a hard journey through China. When he comes across Liu Hua, the young interpreter has mistreated, now works as a librarian, he tries to talk to her, but she reacts hostile and informs him that because of him, she lost her job as interpreter back in Italy. Playing by the relative newcomer Ling Tai, Liu Hua soon becomes a Virgil to Vincenzo's Dante when she hesitates to show that she could do worse than acting as a guide and interpreter for the Italian on his journey (of course, for a uniform sum of cash). This young Chinese actress may not have Ziyi Zhang's beauty or Gong Li's movie star glamor, but her charming, expressive and beautiful face exudes a combination of incredible strength, intelligence, dignity, and anger humor that makes her features difficult to forget when you have seen the movie. In addition, she and Castellitto have a wonderful emotional chemistry like co-stars. <br /> <br /> Amelio weaves dramas that are serious, poetic, mythical, post-neo-realistic, and humorous at the same time while maintaining a heart-radiating ability to examine the fleeting essence of humanity in everyday life. A documentary-like naturalness hides what is actually a carefully thought-out wallpaper of faces and places, a vista that also manages to incorporate a filmography of breathtaking beauty. The photography here is functional yet beautiful, which fits a repressed movie in an industrial and emotional wilderness. Amelio's attentive eye is an adult, disillusioned, but never a cynical or misanthropic. The masterful camera angles also often give a sense of Vincenzo's alien in the eyes of the Chinese, giving home a sense of objectivity and cultural impartiality that is very rare in films of a "well-known" Westerner exploring an "unknown" non-Western country. I can't recommend this movie enough.
