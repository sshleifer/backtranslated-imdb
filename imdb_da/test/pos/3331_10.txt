Come on. Anyone who does not understand the magnitude of this cartoon must be kicked from any critics panel. They should not be allowed to be heard because of course they have no humor at all. <br /> <br /> Anyone who does not love this animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery must be linked to a chair and forced to watch episodes in Huckleberry Hound for 20 years! <br /> <br /> The take and double take of the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy ever recorded on film. <br /> <br /> Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon. It's the best.
