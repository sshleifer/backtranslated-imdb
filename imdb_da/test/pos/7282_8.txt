I was pleasantly surprised to find a very entertaining movie that kept my attention all the way through. I'm a horror fan, and I see almost everything in that genre, but Dead Line managed to make me choke me. The pace is very wise, and Andr√©s Bagg makes a good performance as a desperate man. What is under the main plot? A trip to madness. How can you end it? Martin Sanders asks himself while he sees a homeless speaker to himself, alone on the street. Close to the end of the film, Aaron Mandel's character poses the same question while he sees another homeless who does the same; Not knowing that this homeless is Martin Sanders who answers the question of the movie's beginnings. The broken glasses in two are a clear symbol of breakage and division ... of personality. The ending is jaw-dropping and you just know that a sequel must be made.
