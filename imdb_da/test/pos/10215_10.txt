Nightbreed blew my mind the first time I saw it. And it has remained pretty good over the years. The sets and monster effects work are some of the best I've ever seen. No one I know seems to have seen this movie, which I think thought of in the box office, due to a lack of interest in horror in the early 90s. It plays like a dark, horrible adventure and is much deeper, so you think, with a strong message against bigotry, presented by a rich mystical past created by Clive Barker. What sucks is, the movie ends on a really cool sequel that we will never see. My only minor gripe is that Craig Sheffer is, at best, only an acceptable actor and the project could have benefited from a better actor in the section. Just a minor complaint though, as Sheffer does. I had a similar problem with Scott Bakula in Barker's Lord of Illusions, not really a terrible achievement, but I just didn't like him in the role as much as I wanted other people.
