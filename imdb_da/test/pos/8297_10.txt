Once a year in America, Saturday morning would make room for new cartoons, usually once in America. About the time the school started. <br /> <br /> I suppose it was doing not having school on Saturday, so more tolerable. <br /> <br /> A Friday night before the premiere of the new Saturday morning comics, a movie came on. <br /> <br /> "On Earth's Core" I had no idea who Cushing or McClure was. It was clear that they were not from the same country so I could not understand why they were traveling together. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the mechanism in the mouth of the monsters. <br /> <br /> What links this movie for me is the opening with molten metal and suddenly we get the band to play as we see the factory. How do you end a movie like this? The music again and two armed cops as the drill comes behind them. <br /> <br /> Whatever I remember, I watch the movie more Friday night than I do a new cartoon that came the following morning. /> <br /> It was definitely late seventies. <br /> <br /> It would be under Jurassic Park mania cicra'93, I think before I wanted to watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> Yes, people in costumes. There was the fire air again. <br /> <br /> Still loved the end with the two police. Finally, it would be almost a decade before I would send out the movie to DVD. <br /> <br /> Now I just wanted to see the beginning and the intro. <br /> <br /> Oh, I love the movie a lot. Of all these sci-fi Jules Verne, HG Wells, ERB movies, this one stands as my fave. What I notice now is that one of the police starts turning back a bit too quickly, then he and the other policeman are synchronized as they turn inward again to look behind themselves on the drill. <br /> <br /> Perhaps for me, this movie is the best of Saturday morning shows, which is why I enjoy it so much.
