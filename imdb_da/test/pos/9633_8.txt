Basically, this is a very good movie. However, it is very different from Seagal's other films, which unfortunately can turn off some of his fans. Unlike some of the other movies, it doesn't feel like a "Seagal vehicle". You will also see many of the other characters, and all of Mr Seagal's actions are not the same as we have seen before. The concept that he is "intellectual" in something other than bombs and other weapons is a good change. Although there are some unrealistic parts to the movie (some more obvious than others), you can generally let them slide as the movie is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> It boils down to this: If you see For a classic Seagal action movie sorry but you will be disappointed. See it anyway for fun. If you are open to seeing Seagal without the action, it is well worth a visit. Personally, I think it is some of the best work he has done for a while. <br /> <br />
