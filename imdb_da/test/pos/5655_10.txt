Every American who thinks he or she understands the Second World War should watch this movie. Few Hollywood films about the war have pronounced the stereotype of Japanese soldiers as numbies who obey orders without thinking. We like to believe that every Japanese man was ready and able to fight to death until we bombarded Nagasaki. "Fires on the Plain" shows another reality: troops pathetically underdeveloped, demoralized and starved for the point of cannibalism. They refer euphemistically to human meat as "monkey meat". The film and novel on which it was based also killed the myth that Japanese soldiers all preferred death to surrender. They had good reason to believe that their enemies were not in the mood to take prisoners. For me, it raises a question that most Americans would rather avoid: If the Japanese military was then knocked down at this time in the war, why was it necessary to nuke Hiroshima?
