Sorry about the "extremely clever" summary phrase. I don't know what I was thinking, but I really couldn't help. <br /> <br /> For a long time, I've seen the "Bloody Birthday" and I have to say it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this movie accidentally and at such a low price. And believe me, I live in a small South American village, and these things are very unlikely to happen. It is a shame that some of these "pearls" from the 80s are now almost completely forgotten. 'Bloody Birthday' is one of the movies that surprisingly goes well enough to remain observable today. Not a masterpiece safe, but still entertaining and guess what? ... it doesn't have unintentional fun scenes. I know it's a choke if we remember that this is a low budget girl from the early 80's on a group of evil children killing people. But trust me that the film is able to remain respectable and durable for the most part. <br /> <br /> In 'Blood Birthday', the story revolves around three children born during a total darkening. According to astrology, during eclipses, the sun and the moon's block are Saturn, which controls emotions. As a result, the three children being born that day eventually become unconscious and evil. Since they do not experience any sense of remorse, these 10-year-old children turn up almost everyone who stands in the way, including their own parents and siblings ... and kills them! The body count increases day after day, and police authorities believe there is a psychopath lurking around the place. Meanwhile, Debbie, Curtis and Steven do not hesitate to sustain people as no one seems to suspect the sweet angel faces (?) <br /> <br /> As I said before, 'Bloody Birthday' is surprisingly not fun. I know it before, but I'm really surprised at this. I had expected some hilarious bad scenes, but the movie showed me wrong. True, it is not exactly what most people will consider a "serious" horror movie, but if I should be fair, I would say that the story is decently executed. One of the main reasons why you would normally expect ridiculous situations (as I did) is due to the fact that in these types of movies, where the greatest villains are children, the young actors tend to be horrible and they do it all ridiculous. Let's see it: children tend to be horrible actors, which is understandable, and we can't blame them for that. But to my surprise, the three young actors who played the relentless killed in this movie were very disturbing and not at all funny. The rest of the actors are also good, and if you are a George Clooney fan, you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie. Yes, I know right? .. who cares? Also Julie Brown, the great actress, singer, comedienne and gay icon, gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and if anyone is interested in nudity: she also strips in one of the scenes and she looks good naked. Too bad she didn't have more time on the screen though! Julie is "absolutely fantastic": P <br /> So basically this movie is fine if you are in the mood for some modest horrors from the 80s. My only objection to 'Bloody Birthday' would be to justify children's motives. This is perhaps one of the lowest points in the movie. Let's see: if children born during an eclipse end up being heartless killing, how were these three the only ones who actually killed people? I am sure there were other children who had been born the same day ... and in other days with total darkness, too, oh yes! Overall, it's not even that, it's just a simple observation, it's all. I've seen worse, trust me. Take e.g. 'The Children' (1980), where the perishable murderer gets their evil after being turned into zombies with poisonous cloud. No, believe me, 'Bloody Birthday' is much more decent, and if you enjoy simple slashers, you will enjoy this much. <br /> <br /> Now you know: you are invited to the children's birthday party ... and the hosts will serve a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests. Come on, you can't miss it;)
