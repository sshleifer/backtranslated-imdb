When I sat looking for Greek for the first time, I didn't expect a show with complex characters, exciting plot lines and impeccable writing ... but that's exactly what I got. Greek follows several college students who are in the Greek system in Cyprus Rhodes University. Rusty Cartwright enters Cyprus Rhodes as a polymer scientist striving to be in brotherhood. His older sister, Casey (the show center and soon-to-be president of Zeta Beta Zeta, the most prestigious on-campus sorority), does not exactly support his plans. In fact, none of her friends even knew she had a brother until he put his foot on the college hall! On top of dealing with the fact that her dorky younger brother has been forced back into his life, Casey's girlfriend Evan Chambers (soon chair of the campus brotherhood, Omega Chi) celebrates her with a new ZBZ promise (Rebecca Logan ), the in-depth ZBZ President Frannie is pushing her to stay with him, and she still has feelings for her dormant ex-girlfriend Cappie (president of the campus campus, Kappa Tau). These characters are associated with Calvin Owens (an athletic, intelligent friend of Rusty's, who happens to be gay), Dale Kettlewell (Rusty's mortal Christian and possibly racist roommates and best friend) and Ashleigh (Casey's quirky best friend and confidant). During Greek two seasons (or four chapters), viewers are often reminded that university life is not black and white, but "in grayscale from here". Each character makes their fair share of errors, but each has redeemable qualities. Casey and Cappie have a complicated but beautiful relationship throughout the series. The friendship of Rusty, Dale and Calvin is not always perfect, but they are able to survive any obstacle thrown upon them. Even Frannie, Rebecca and Evan (the show's "villains") appear as human beings every single time. <br /> <br /> Greek shows college students at their best, worst and in between. It's a show that reveals college as it really is: a four-year adventure where your morals, beliefs and willpower are tested, compromised and sometimes even changed. Greek has at least one season left, if not more, before it ends. I can't wait to see where the characters come up next time. Greek is not your typical ABC family sitcom. If you want to tune into a show that shows the truth behind human motivation, Greek is for you.
