Many people make fun of Steven Seagal's play. And I can really see why, if I remember Fire Down below. Well ... ok his other movies are acceptable (regarding his acting!). <br /> <br /> After reading reviews about The Patriot, I didn't expect anything from this movie. I hardly came through Fire Down Below, and I read a lot that the Patriot was even worse. So I was really surprised at this one. In my opinion, this is one of his very best movies. If it had more action sequences and a few more battle scenes, it would be the best. I liked the story, the director and the actors. Cammilla Belle was just amazing. She wants a great movie career in the future. The few action scenes were very well made. And Steven Seagal was very credible in his exceptional role.
