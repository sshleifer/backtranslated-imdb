The standard bearer of all movie series, the particular good guy - Flash Gordon - versus Bad Guy - Ming the Merciless. Although the special effects seem horrible to today's standards, in 1936 they were top notch. But the essence of the story is the battle between Earthman Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe) versus Emporer Ming of Mongo (Charles Middleton). Crabbe and Middleton are amazing in their parts. And those supporting Dale Arden, Dr. Zarkov, Princess Aura, Prince Barin, Vulcan, and the rest are all very good. This series is far better than the 1980 movie because Crabbe is much better than Sam J. Jones as Flash Gordon. <br /> <br /> This series is the standard carrier for all movie series. No question about it.
