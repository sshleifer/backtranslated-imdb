This movie was filled with great actors, great musical sounds that blow you away completely. Larenz Tate, (Darius Lovehall), "Waist Deep," "06 was a sharp cat with the gall, and he soon met his Waterloo with Nia Long," Nina Mosley, "Big Momma's House," 2000. Nina puts her heart and Soul in this role, and when she meets Darius, the sparks fly first and then there is a kind of hate affair.The whole movie actor made this a very entertaining movie, with lots of comedy, drama and lots of loving and cheating on time. very down to earth movie and at the same time shows how everyone ultimately has their destiny in life and is placed in their little corner of this great world.
