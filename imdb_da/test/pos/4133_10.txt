Gary Busey did a fantastic job at rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly (1936-59). He has a saliva image for the man. Being a garage band in the 50s is definitely different from today. Having a group of three is usually simple back these days. I bet Buddy Holly (Busey) was a much better musician than most I heard. Since living in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet village since then. His parents were Christians, although his mother was a strong supporter of his son's work. That's one of the reasons he didn't act like Elvis. He got stuck on his baby's paths. It makes him really good! When he went to Tennessee, he saw how bad the producers were. They hated rock-n-roll that made Holly off big time. Getting used to the different atmosphere was a challenge for Holly and his friends. He came on tour with Sam Cooke, went to the famous Apollo, as the all-African American audience quickly accepted them, I liked it! And Sam Cooke made sure that Holly and his band were serviced. That's what I call tolerance. It is boring that he, Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson had their music career cut short by a plane crash in 1959, at least their memories will continue in our hearts. I don't know what inaccuracies were in the movie, all I care about is that Buddy Holly overheard the hurdles of music and politics of that time, and the music is almost perfect. For Gary Busey he was perfect in the role and also in the music. GOD BLESSES GARY BUSEY! 5 stars!
