The numbers don't lie, 109 people voted for this movie. It says a lot about standing by one of the most intuitive insightful comedians of the late 20th century. And for those of you who know Bill Hick's work if he lived today, imagine what he would have to say about the boy president from his home state? That his short career remains unknown is a sad situation, and this film, or rather, these two films explain why. First, you see how his talent was evident from the start, over and over again, those who knew Bill Hicks always say he wasn't just fun, he was also unique. The film also shows how the quality of his material was too challenging for many in the entertainment industry. His drink has also contributed to his career problems, but it is less evident in this movie. And then the other movie is a complete achievement. If you've never seen or heard Bill Hicks, this is a wonderful introduction to the person and his dark but intelligent humor. Especially because the topics are now almost 14 years old, but remain ironic, it is emphasized that many of the events took place during the first President Bush. <br /> <br /> See them together - first the biography and then the show - draw you attention to how much talented this young man was, how fast his life went, and how the American media sometimes act as the great big homogenizer . Let's make sure nothing is too provocative, nothing will be too interesting and the result? Well, as the man himself said, go to bed America, your government is in control ........... In his lifetime, at least in the UK, this artist was recognized for his talent and succeeded. 11 years after his death, 109 people on IMDb can say something about the film. Once you've seen them both, I hope you understand why more people should listen to Bill Hicks.
