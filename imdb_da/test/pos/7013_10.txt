Like most women, this movie is the ultimate chick-flick. With it's hot chemistry, sexy dance rountines and beaitiful songs, I mean timeless classic like (I've had). The time of my life and the wonderful she is like the wind make this movie. I love Patrick Swayze in this movie and he shows that he can sing and dance, it's so hot. He sings "She's Like The Wind" in the movie. The chemistry between Swayze and co-star Jennifer Gray is amazing. I love all the dancing and all that goes with it. But to say this Dirty Dancing 2: - Havana Nights is also great, but Patrick Swayze scenes do this. I love the songs, dances and everything about it, but it's not Dirty Dancing. As I said, this is a fantastic chicken. Let it be a 3rd because I love to see what happens to Patrick's character Johnny. Jennifer's character could have been more sexy, but hey Patrick makes up for it if you know what I mean !!! Fantastic movie and I'm so happy Billy Zane didn't win the movie role. I heard whispering he was meant for the role, but they found out he couldn't dance.
