I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I was always enamored by Mrs Hayworth's appearance, so I thought I'd give it a try. <br /> <br /> This may be the best showcase for multi-talented wife Hayworth. She has never seen lovelier in a movie (with the possible exception of 'Gilda', where she is sex symbol par excellence). <br /> <br /> Rita is more than ably assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. The comedy can be dated, but it is still very entertaining. Kelly does one of his tour-the-force dances, dancing with the picture of herself from a window. <br /> <br /> But Rita runs this whole movie. An excellent cast with Otto Kruger and the always wonderful, clever crackling Eve Arden does not hurt. <br /> <br /> Drawing singing, drawing dances, all the time looking incredibly beautiful! The music may be a lack of classic, but the lyrics of most of the songs are quite wise. <br /> <br /> I find this movie works better than 'Gilda', which I consider a fake movie. To Mrs Hayworth's credit, she also runs 'Gilda', and Gilda runs any red-blooded male gal. <br /> <br /> The movie stops well after all these years. Much leg candy for the male audience is a good bonus!
