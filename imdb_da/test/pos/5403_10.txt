Just watched this movie, in Australia on satellite. Since I have escaped the news more than usual during the last week coming from the United States of A regarding the criminals, so good to be completely blunt, this film is a prescient gem. A great bravo to everyone involved. I had only a small idea of ​​what the movie entailed, which is usually the case for a good effect, and it certainly came with film articles. The scene setting is effective in the true sense of the word, with all the hard confrontational issues in today's world in relation to one's own failing family, albeit suburban. The first forty minutes put such a professional theater I wasn't ready for loud, laughing when they came. Although the cathartic moment was built through comedy and character, the family and neighbors came together in an extraordinary way. All in all, a prediction of who and what we are. A most meaningful movie and a must see. <br /> <br /> Please note the date of this review.
