I didn't know much about this movie going into it, but I found out that Kane was a wrestler who didn't strap me straight, but hey, I liked "Santa's Slay" and it had a wrestler in it, So what the hell. The story begins very strange and promising, but after a while it doesn't get much more than your typical teenage terrorist, even though the settings helped some. A bunch of criminal young people are rounded off and taken to an old hotel that used to be a luxury palace, but are now a dump to clean it up to prepare it as a homeless shelter. The driver is a man with a prosthetic arm who is a veteran of the opening film in this movie, where he meets this great gal who had just killed his partner and dazzled another woman. Of course, teens, all of whom are punk-smart asses, are against having to do any real work, but they are part of a unique co-ed work program, yes, what a good idea, of course. Somewhat someone thinks there is someone lurking in the hotel that in his own little way will save the taxpayers of that state some money. It is, of course, the guy who likes to collect eyeballs and he has a really good collection. There won't be much here that horror fans haven't seen before, but there are a few brutal scenes and enough to satisfy the hard core fan. The setting of the old hotel is also a perfect place for a slasher flick, and there are small sub-stories, such as. The search for an alleged safe full of money and the search for babes, as this co-ed crew member is consistent. Most teenagers are also delicately hit, so it works well. Not great, but far better than Silent Hill or when a stranger calls, and maybe better than some of the other crap I wouldn't bother to see. 7 out of 10
