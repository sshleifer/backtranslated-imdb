This movie was bombed at the cashier's office and in the vote here, but I loved it. A goal for a movie is worth it, how much of it you can still remember after 25 years. I don't want to drill you with a list, but there are dozens of deep comics, also a good story and great casting. The innocent robbers are a hoot. See it and judge if it ever comes on TCM.
