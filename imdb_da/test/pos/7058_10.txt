Yes, it feels, and mostly plays as an "after school special", for a slightly more adult audience, maybe a teenager. But add Bill Murray (who already shows some dramatic as well as his usual comic talent), a nice backing and an unexpected sweetness to grow up and remember the big or not so good days at the summer camp, and you get a heart-warming, fun, sleeping hit. <br /> <br /> It gets a little too smarmy for its own good, but it is also one of its charms. When you hear the title "Meatballs" and see the poster, you expect a teenage sex body, but what you get is a central but sometimes sexy look back in the formative years at the summer camp. The sentimentality and remberances of simpler times remind me of "A Christmas Story" which I also love. The housekeeper's memories were never so well-defined. The only movie I've seen that comes close is "Indian Summer", which I like almost as much as "Meatballs" and also stars Matt Craven. Let's hope he completes the trilogy. Maybe he could come back to "Return of the Meatballs" and bring some dignity back to the franchise (Meatball's 2 to 4 bar did not resemble the original classic). "Meatballs" are easy on my Top 10 Guilty Pleasures of all time (not really guilty). It's a wonderful little movie that always makes me smile.
