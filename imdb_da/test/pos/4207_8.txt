*** SPOILERS *** Although the movie "They Made Me a Criminal", it's not as good as the later John Garfield antiques like "Body & Soul" in 1947 "Force of Evil" in 1948 and his last and very underrated "Han Ran All The Way" in 1951 is the film that defined his career from this point until his incredible death on May 21, 1952 at a young age of 39 years. <br /> <br /> Garfiled plays the part of the Light Weight Champion Johnnie Bradfield and later the refugee from the law Jack Dorney, who is innocent of the murder he is accused of, even though he has been declared officially dead. Jonnie's manager Doc Ward, Robert "Doc" Gleckler, who, during a drunken victory party, killed reporter Charles McGee, John Ridgely, who was going to exhibit to the public, his fighter Johnnie Bradfield is lying that he is a woman guy and not drinking mommas boy. Doc Gleckler smashed a bottle over McGee's head and killed him when Jonnie was almost dead and full of a number of women who stuck in his hotel suite. <br /> <br /> Doc was later killed in a car accident with Johnnie's boyfriend Goldie, Ann Sheridan, but Doc burned to a sharp and Johnnies watch, he was wrong for Johnnie. Told to be dead and buried by his lawyer Malvin, Robert Strange, who took $ 9,750.00 of the $ 10,000 of Johnnie's money he had for this good advice. Malvin told Johnnie to take over a new identity and call him now from Jack Dorney and get hell out of New York state; Talk about sleazy shysters. Johnnie Now Jack Dorney travels the rails from New York down to Arizona, ending at Rancho Rafferty Date Farm, where most of the movie takes place. If it wasn't for John Garfield as a leading role as both Jonnie Bradfield & Jack Dorney, the movie would have long been lost and forgotten. Garfield, who was only 26 at the time, made the most of everyone in the movie. Although they transported Dead End Kids, we assume that we can call them The Arizona Kids here, and the actors were joked about what you would have expected of them, and they came across as genuine and sensitive people not a bunch of clapping clubs like in almost all their movies. All this is due to being on the same scene or movie scene with John Garfield. <br /> <br /> "They made me a criminal" is a good story that has the underground master acting as something other than not paying attention to himself and ending up not only behind bars but in the electric chair. In the end, Jack showed just what kind of man he is by not fighting the big fight and against all the odds that dramatically win at the last minute, but by going four brutal rounds to get the money for his new found family on the date the farm including his girl Peggy, Gloria Dickson, to open a gas station with it. <br /> <br /> Giving the European champ Gaspar Rutchek, Frank Riggi, the fight in his life and getting $ 2,000, it's $ 500.00 a round to do it. Jack showed everyone who looked up to him as "Arizona Kids" that sometimes taking a stroke is far more courageous and courageous and throws away. The fact that Jack could have easily patted Rutched, but not to avoid exposing himself to the police as on the murderous Johnnie Bradfield. But instead went as far as he could take whatever Rutchek could throw at him to help his friends show more than all the battles he won in the boxing ring that was put together. <br /> <br /> I didn't find the end of the movie at all, but fit right into the story. Police Morty Phelam, Claude Rains, who came to Arizona from New York to arrest Jack, had to live with for many years that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair. We got to know all this right at the start of the movie. Why did Jack / Johnnie know he was innocent of the murder he was accused of and not knowing if he would be found innocent of it in a court, would he like to make the same terrible mistake again? I can easily see this happening in fact why not in the movies.
