An interesting movie based on three of Jules Verne's novels. Given the special effects and computer-enhanced animations today, this film stands as a historic marker of cinematic resourcefulness and imagination. Karel Zeman has brought the lithographic images of the original Jules Verne texts to life. This is a must see for classic science fiction and history buffs. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 9 out of 10. Enjoy !!
