I'm a big fan of Lonesome Dove and all the books in the series and I love the movie. I was glad to see that they were finished with Comanche Moon. I have been a fan of Steve Zahn for a long time and was eager to see him in a serious role. Personally, I think Steve Zahn has done a great job of restoring Gus. I can't think of another actor who would have been better. He has the voice, the way, the pronunciation of words right down to a T. Granted, no one could ever hold a light to Robert Duvall as Gus, but I think Steve Zahn has done a good job. Karl Urban works the same in all the films he has been in, so he has made a good match for Woodrow Call. As for the movie itself, yes it is a bit corny, but can you really beat Lonesome Dove? No, I think not.
