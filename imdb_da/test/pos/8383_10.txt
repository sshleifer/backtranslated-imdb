I must admit, when I saw the previve to "Inglorious Basterds", I gave myself great expectations. This movie was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Rarely when I see a movie with such high expectations, I have met or exceeded these expectations; This movie did it and more. Even more rarely do I pat the end of a movie, I and everyone else in the theater did. <br /> <br /> I have to say I am a little biased towards Quentin, I grew up with "Pulp Fiction." I saw it when I was 12 and it's still my favorite and most influential movie. Since then, Quentin has not really lived up to its billing. His style was a little predictable instead of familiar, the quality was honestly not there (I never saw Jackie Brown and then there is Grindhouse). It's up to "Inglorious Basterds." What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a spaghetti-western feeling that could only be performed by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but when he saw how Leone died, Tarantino is the self-proclaimed guy in this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> So let's look at the movie I won't give away. The script was spot on, a beautiful transition between not using one, but four different languages ​​in this movie. Not to mention this movie was created in the classic Tarantino mold, amazing scenes of rich meaningful dialogue and sudden shocking action. <br /> <br /> The action was amazing !! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, seriously. I do not say that often, but honestly you have to get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie and delivered with such great touch and poise. He stole the show in a movie, all of which was amazingly impressive. <br /> <br /> I have no problem building this movie because this movie is the best movie I've seen all year and probably all next year. Frankly, the more I think about it, this movie can break my best movies all the time, and is Quentin's best movie since "Pulp Fiction." Take it from me, watch this movie. I loved it not making this movie enough justice. <br /> <br /> I saw it yesterday and I'm still blown away. Thanks Quentin from the bottom of my heart to make this movie. You're back on top again, buddy. I can't say enough for "Inglorious Basterds!"
