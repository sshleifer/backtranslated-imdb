American-made last entry in the "Blood Island" series of Filipino horror films relates to Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley), ruler of a fictional country. He dies of cancer, but it has figured out how to bring him back: put the brain in a donor body. The evil doctor responsible (Kent Taylor) puts it in a very unlikely body: the face-cut giant servant named Gor (John Bloom). A doctor-friend of the ruler tries to remedy cases and put an end to the plans of the evil doctors. <br /> <br /> Film-making partners Samuel M. Sherman (producer) and Al Adamson (director) correlate several actors they've worked with before, including Taylor, Adamsons sexy wife Regina Carrol, Angelo Rossitto, Zandor Vorkov and Vicki Volante. They tried to go to the feeling of the earlier "Blood Island" entrances, but one could tell this was made stateside. Although not necessarily a "good" movie, it has a bunch of fun items to add up to an entertaining, trashy whole. A vicious dwarf (Rossitto), gory operations, a pretty convincing makeup job on Bloom, the political intrigue subplot, caves full of cobwebs, etc. The story is actually quite coherent, with plot angels thrown here and there. I think it could have been trimmed a little; some scenes draw. But it has its fun moments, and one end does not expect. <br /> <br /> For this kind of thing, the play is not that bad. Both Taylor and Rossitto are funny; the latter seems to have a good time in its role. Volante is appealing enough, and Williams is O.K. in the heroic role. In any case, it is great to see all these familiar faces in one of these movies. Absolutely nothing special, but like a blurry B "horror" (I use the word loosely, none of these are exactly scary) movies, it's definitely fun. <br /> <br /> 7/10
