Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of the movies I grew up hearing about, but a copy could never be achieved so far. I just watched this movie on DVD and thought it was a lovely and charming movie with wonderful animation, a good plot and good songs. If this movie was made by Disney, the movie would be considered a classic, but because it was made by a well-known movie studio that has been a long time, the film has slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The movie was made by Max Fleischer studios on their Miami, FL studios and released through Paramount Pictures. The film had its premiere on December 7, 1941, the date of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. While this probably hurt the release of the movie, the movie played in some cinemas for up to a year as shown by some studies. The film was called a family favorite among most American American newspapers. The film continued to be re-released every year or so, usually around holidays as Easter, at least in larger cities. In the mid-1950s, this film was re-released under a new name "Hoppity Goes to Town", named after the main character of the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is a true piece that captures a piece of Americana as it was back in the late 30s and 1940s. The animation is fantastic and many of the characters are very cute. The animation of the people in the movie is via the rotoscope process, which means that the actors were filmed, and then these recordings were tracked by animators, giving the movement a really good appearance. <br /> <br /> Fleishcher studios were one of several animation studies that make animated cartoons back in the 30s and 40s. While some of the Fleischer characters like Betty Boop, Popeye and Superman comics are better known, the studio's work is more or less forgotten. <br /> <br /> Almost as a whole, Fleischer Studios is in the public domain. All the superman comics are publicly available, but one of the "Color Classics" series is public domain, and the movie "Gulliver's Travels" is also publicly available. This movie never seems to have been released in the US on VHS or DVD, but was released in Europe. But some looking around the internet can very quickly produce you with a copy. I recommend the search.
