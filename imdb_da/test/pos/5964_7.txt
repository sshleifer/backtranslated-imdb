The frogs who wanted a king or frogland are Ladislaw Starewicz's most cautious tale of people who want the government to solve their problems that I have ever seen. The irony is that they pray to God Jupiter for their answer. Jupiter reacts first by sending a tree stump and then a stork. It doesn't work either, and the stork is especially dangerous for amphibious creatures! The frogs have some human qualities when we see them dress in today's latest fashion and we see some take pictures or use a movie camera when the stork arrives! As I said, this brief lot is a political allegory more suited to adults than children. In fact, I first saw this on Rhino VHS, who had Bambi Meets Godzilla. It alone should tell you what to expect here!
