This was on Saturday before Halloween this year (today at this time) and it has to be the best horror anthology out there. I'm not usually a fan of horror movies - largely because of the amount of crap that has recently been released. However, the director of Campfire Tales has the Hitchcock esquire thrill - unlike other contemporary films, it doesn't take every opportunity to scare you stupidly, instead of using foreshadowing and 'near-misses' events that resemble the moment Climaxet will. occur at the moment before but turns out not to be. <br /> <br /> I didn't catch 'The hook or the first main segment, but from what I've read here, they were the two you can afford to miss. <br /> <br /> 'People Can Lick Too' was full of excitement - this brief keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen to the little girl as she walks around her farm and house manager after his football and later his dog. She encounters so many near misses that the tension reaches heartbreaking proportions before the climax of the short when the girl gives up and goes to bed, thinking she is under it. She reaches her hand to let him lick it, and she feels a heavy touch on her hand ... before you notice it on his mirror, written in blood, "People can also lick". I leave the last few seconds to find out my reader, because at that time the short could have taken any number of turns. <br /> <br /> The 'Locket' was the unarguable masterpiece of this movie. It starts with a man on a motorcycle, simply driving ... against what he does not know, but he can feel closer. When he drives together, a storm breaks out and he is forced to find shelter in the house of a dumb girl. The two quickly cozy up to each other, but before they can do everything besides kiss, the girl reveals by writing that ghosts reside her house. They start packing up quickly to leave, but they are caught in the midst of a reenactment of a scene decades earlier - a father who comes home to her daughter and her boyfriend who is preparing to elope murder the two and then commit suicide. I have to leave you to discover the end here too - I couldn't hope to do the story justice anyway, and what I have said so far is just a brief summary of the story - I couldn't hope to convey the nuances and sensual details that add it. <br /> <br /> "The Campfire", which is the link between all the stories, is a rather interesting recreation of the car accident theme, and the girls are very attractive - in fact, most of the girls in this movie are great. Yet, despite being carved out, history is given justice, and the end is hard to predict if you are busy with the other stories. But if you pay enough attention to the camp's segments scattered throughout the film, it is probably possible to predict the end, especially if you have seen movies based on the same premise. (MST3k fans, remember Soultaker? Same assumption, but without god horrible writing of Vivian Schilling and the bulk of the movie. If you've seen the first 30 minutes of it, you should be able to predict the end.) All in The Best Horror Movie, have seen for a long time, and the only horror rhetoric worth buying.
