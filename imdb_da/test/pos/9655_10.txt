This is a great movie, a must have. I really liked every aspect of it, from the sword fight, the romance, the costumes were really well finished and put together. The landscape is absolutely beautiful. I also loved the mystery and the magic. Also, the message of the power of love, that love is the greatest power there is. I really like the king's heart in the sense that he wants peace instead of bloodshed and hatred. I wish I could live in such a world with flying ships, to castles in heaven. I also think it was really nice how they took the animals into the movie. I also thought the chef was really fun. I've seen it many times in a day and still never tired of it. Only wish they would bring it to a DVD.
