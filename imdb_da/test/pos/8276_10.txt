I was - Unlike most reviewers - not born in the 80s. I was born on May 14, 1994. Despite this, my life was very much like the 80s. Since other kids had playstations, I played Zelda on my NES etc. Now this movie has a special place in my heart, although I am only 15 years old at the time of writing this review. Because of my 80-year-old style, early childhood began many television shows and as many movies as other children did not see, and this film was one of them and one of the greatest. <br /> <br /> It starts in Los Angeles home of Alvin Sevilla, Simon Sevilla, Theodore Sevilla and David Sevilla. David, Chipmunk's adoptive father, is busy getting to the airport as he travels around Europe on business. His taxi is almost there and The Chipmunks help him pack. While speaking, Alvin expresses his willingness to come with Dave and to see the world (Although Dave only technically goes to Europe, then to Alvin, it seems only America and Europe are qualified as '' World ''). David leaves the Chipmunks in the care of Miss Miller, much to the boy's dissatisfaction. Soon, Dave is away from the airport and Chipmunks are left at Miss Miller's home. Later at a local cafe Chipmunks plays a game '' Around the World in 30 days '' against Chipettes (Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). After losing the game to Brittany after getting his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile, Alvin gets an argument with Brittany about who really would win a race around the world. Two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, Klaus and Claudia Furschtien overhear their argument and need a safe way to transport their diamonds all over the world, deciding to trick the kids into delivering them to them. They create a race around the world where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness (Secretly filled with diamonds) on drop offs all over the world and receive a doll in the equality of opponents (secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds) to "determine that they were there". The winning team will then receive a $ 100,000 reward. They do it because they think Jamal (an Interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some time now) would never suspect them because they are just kids. (However, this seems superfluous because the children on their travels do not have to undergo any security controls and are never even questioned by the dolls, I suppose it would not be Klaus or Claudia if they had taken the diamonds themselves.) And Then a great adventure begins. This movie is a classic and I see no reason anyone didn't like it. It has great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention Kick-ass music (Pardon my French: P). My favorite song is undoubtedly '' The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll '' A great rock song that can't be top. It's also my favorite moment in the movie. Other notable songs include '' Getting Lucky '' 'and' 'My Mother' 'and' 'Wooly Bully' 'and' 'Off to see the world' 'Not to mention the main theme of The film was heard during opening credits by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with '' My Mother '' still brings a tear in the eye. In relation to the song '' Getting Lucky '' I didn't think about it, but when I got older and learned about life, it became clear that the song was a bit suggestive. It sang along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience who knows the color of the Chipettes panties. This is especially evident on the stage in Egypt when the chipets are being chased by the Arab prince's men when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt can withstand gravity altogether. Though it doesn't matter to the film's overall quality, it is one of the inexplicable things like why no one in the world seems to be aware that there are 4-meter-long Chipmunks going around talking in incredibly high votes and treats them like they would any human being child. Yet, just after that scene, Chipette discovers the diamonds in the puppets and decides to find Chipmunks and come home. The direction of Janice Karman completes this movie when she and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr., know the characters better than anyone. They even make the voice of Chipmunks and Chipettes. Ross makes the voices for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice makes the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore. Talking about male characters spoken by female voice actresses, Nancy Cartwright (The Voice of Bart Simpson) appears in this movie. She plays that part of the Arab prince, a very small but important role. Of course, the end is a happy one. Crooks have been caught, the loose ends tied up and the movie ends when the kids, dave and miss miller run into the sunset, Alvin complains about not having received his $ 100,000 reward for winning the race, which annoys Dave until he finally shouts' 'ALVIN! '' And the screen falls to black <br /> <br /> Classic ending, by the way. I hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven't seen this flick, give it a watch, it's worth the money. This nostalgic 80s classic gets a solid 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> '' Headin 'to the top, you don't know! We never stop believing now
