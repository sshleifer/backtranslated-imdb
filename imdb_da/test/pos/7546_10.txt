This comic classic of English schoolgirl antics is and was one of the great art house classics. Then the art house disappeared with the arrival of videos. And that made the audience for this movie. The loss is not to the art houses or to this great movie. The loss is those who will never have a real opportunity to see this memorable, grinning, filmed masterpiece. But I preach to the reverse is not I. Who else would look for this flick?
