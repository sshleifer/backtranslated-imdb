I think there are two angles to the story. Firstly, the world-secular view, presented in a prominent kafkaesque way, emphasizes the horrific spectacle of some of life's most common, but also pleasurable or pleasurable moments and elements that are usually enough to keep the man in society. Like: a good job, a good home, a good wife, a good car and even a good mistress. Apart from this so-called common bliss, there are some who cannot help asking themselves more unpleasant questions, such as where they come from or weather they can have other kind of bliss, weather could be a reason to be or weather there Could be something they missed, or even more creepy weather could be something that the system itself is reluctant to do with them. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think the most interesting aspect of this movie is the fact that it attacks the head of this natural compulsion to dissect the world around us, ask it by our personal judgment and condemn it as rule, because it does not make us better, because it is not tailor-made to care for us as a person. <br /> <br /> I believe the symbolism behind the train accident is that our own will can be overestimated by fate or another universal power, even in the light of our so-called power to decide when we want to go. Instead, the man is dismissed by this greater power (let's call it the SYSTEM, because the authors clearly avoid calling it GOD, perhaps further stressing that the SYSTEM is MAN-created and therefore capable of man, unlike FATE, which is a concept closer to religion) on its own terms, not killing him, but showing him that there is a place for the man who asks / wants too much, and may suggest that true fulfillment does not come from the outside world, But from within, and if the outside world "decides" to give you some comfort, you should learn to accept it without questioning the substance of every little aspect of it. <br /> <br /> Uncomfortable, but re-examining some existential issues that have become mainstream in the last century, like what can be done in a world that is increasingly drained by matter, a consumer-driven world where man can be exchanged without making a difference to the larger picture, but only as long as he needs the system.
