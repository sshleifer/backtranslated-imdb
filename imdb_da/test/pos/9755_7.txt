If "Love Me Tonight" is "musical for people who do not like musicals", it should be said that "The Gay Desperado" is certainly not a musical for people who do not like opera. In fact - despite apparently being based on a comic operetta - it is not really a musical at all, but a spoofband story with interpolated non-related arias to show off the voice of a character; and what voice it is. <br /> <br /> Nino Martini, as the young singer Chivo, joins the bandit squad to get a place on the radio (no, that doesn't mean that the listing later makes sense either ...), has a wonderful golden tenor whose style has not dated one day since the era when it was recorded. Vibrations and warblings from some of his musical contemporaries belong to a difficult way, but it is very easy to see that Chivo belts out "Nessun Dorma" to a World Cup audience and on top of the charts in the process. Unfortunately, while having an exciting laugh and a decent dramatic reach, he is totally incapable of acting and singing at the same time. The result is that the otherwise fast-paced movie laughs at a shocking stop every time Chivo puts his hand on his chest and begins to scratch, and the viewer's tolerance of the result is likely to depend on his appreciation of operational performance. <Br /> <br /> Apart from this drawback, the movie is an enjoyable broad brush satire on Hollywood Conventions and especially the Mexican bandit stereotype that achieves the vital goal of all such spoofs so that they make their characters engaging enough for their own right to hold the viewer's interest when joke would otherwise have become obsolete. The bandwriter and his sidekick have the traditional double-acting relationship that is an enigmatic peon with a carved teak face and a spiritual heroine (a young Ida Lupino) who performs the generic "you say you hate me but you really love me "routinely with a refreshing twist. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie is entertaining and pretty fun, and I feel I have got my money's worth - but it cannot be denied that musically interluding while admiring in their own way introducing serious pacing problems.
