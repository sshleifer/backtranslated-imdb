I can't believe it's not a big cult hit. Perhaps people in 1968, thought of Monkees as a stupid factory-made pop band rip-off of the Beatles, refused to see it. This cynicism probably covered it from sight since then. Don't make this mistake. _Head_ is a great movie that the most open people will appreciate. It is very fun and very intelligent (and very trippy).
