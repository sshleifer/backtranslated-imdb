When you think of brilliant Australian comedy, you're not thinking of Skit shows (although I'm quite a bit 80's and 90's full frontal) or even Sitcoms - you're thinking of SATIRE! Something that we Australians really know how to do well. (For example: Front Line, The Micallef Program) We know how to take pi, and The Chaser's War on Everything is a classic example of how to do it and how to do it really well. <br /> <br /> I've been a big fan of Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel for a long time. I remember listening to them at Triple J's afternoon show. They were and remained two of the funniest comedians. <br /> <br /> Although I was sad when they left Triple J, I was excited to find out what they invested so much time in leaving them. (They do CNNNN and Triple J at the same time, so I figured this was something much bigger) And what a fantastic HILARIOUS show Chaser is. I am also happy to say that it has recently received a much better time game than Friday night and has been moved to Wednesday night just after Spicks and Specks. THANK YOU ABC !! Finally, I don't have to lose it! :)
