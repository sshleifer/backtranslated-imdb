American war movie fans may be bored with their skulls of this movie, but the boredom is born of ignorance. Guerilla suppression operations are always so. Sit around waiting, get some hookers, get drunk at the bottom, wheel and handle the businessman, save a prison around and cover the street of the street trader of the green private. Then the boom goes with two fuel trucks, and for 10 minutes there is a handgun fight with a high caliber machine gun. So wait for brass to plan a way to knock out their stronghold and then kill some civilians doing it. If reality does not work for Western viewers, there is always Top Gun or Rambo (Top Gun realistic? Nope) The best part of Afganskiy Izlom's realism was the way in which all aircraft fell flares like confetti. They had to do it because Carter and Reagan gave Mujahedin so many missiles. The wave of Mi-24s was also excellent, a better helo attack than the apocalypse now. The sight of their missiles fell and shoot was a scene with impending "death from above" for the one they were targeting. It's fun how the Soviets could make an honest Afghanistan movie within a year of their departure, but it took the United States six years. Afganskiy Izlom is just as true if you apply it to NATO occupation as well. Someone will always pick up the gun and shoot you because they care more about the ground. It's a movie, Westerners should see. Unfortunately, I don't think anyone ever made English subtitles; Maybe I have to do some.
