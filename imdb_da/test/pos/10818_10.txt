I saw Bon Voyage 2 days ago and I found it an excellent production. The movie has to entertain and it does! It emulates the style of the American screwball comedies from the 30s, but Von voyage is more refined. Adjani and Depardieu are simply excellent in their roles. The reason is simple. The movie starts with people involved in many situations that apparently shouldn't have anything to do between them. It is very fun how these situations are connected during the film. It is good to see a French movie with this kind of sense of humor. I find it, mainly a movie where love is the main theme. Peter Coyote as the German spy in France again shows to be an excellent actor as well.
