I was really surprised when I came across this movie on cable TV a few years ago. History is a wonderful example of how our country continues to change and struggle to cope and use it as needed. Conflicting desires of the "people" and the government. The actors were amazing in their depictions, and I fell in love with Tantoo Cardinal - she is so trustworthy and was such a sign in this movie, which was Rip Torn. The story was also a love story about the country, the past and between the two main characters. I have tried to buy this movie and have not been able to locate it - but I would love to own it.
