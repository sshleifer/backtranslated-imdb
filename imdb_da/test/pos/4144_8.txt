I liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in a plane crash. He wasn't in the old rock-n-roll class, let's say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how great his legacy would have been, he had been singing for decades. Almost every one he put out was a hit. So I was very pleasantly surprised at how well a job Gary Busey did by playing him and imitating his voice. He made Buddy proud, like the actors (Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith) who played Holly's backup group, The Crickets. <br /> <br /> There are some of Holly's better-known songs at the beginning of the movie and its really good with a strong finish at the end as Holly and the boys are shown in Iowa in their last concert ever. Busey doesn't sing just as Holly, he's a dead call to him in the look. Some things were the actors' best performance ever, and you get no argument from me. I'm also happy that they ended the movie on an optimistic note with the Iowa concert, instead of living on his tragic accident. The finish could have been a real downer, but they didn't.
