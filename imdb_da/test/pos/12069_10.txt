The war at home is so good it has become my new favorite show.Me and my neighbors Carly and April see it together every Sunday and laugh at how true it is. I love how everyone is so sarcastic and so worried and they live on every little problem. When someone does something stupid, they never live down and it's sooo how the family is. The father always harps on all three children about every little thing. I love how the parents have no idea how to handle the kids. It is so true with true family life, and the fact that parents are so overwhelmed and have no idea how to solve their teen's problems just puts the show over the top. The war at home is so brutally honest and so true to the world we live in that it has become a milestone for sitcoms to come. This is not Happy Days or The Brady Bunch this is real life.
