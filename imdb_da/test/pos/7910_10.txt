Finally, I discovered what I thought I remembered as a four year old. Having seen the 1960 color version on VHS, I said I remembered seeing it in black and white 2 times before. Now, IMDb has helped me know the truth that it was broadcast twice (2 productions) in black and white in 2 successful years 1955 and 56. These are the ones I remember best as a four year old. I didn't realize the 56 broadcast was not the same as 55. In 1960 I was 9 and the color production just didn't make me. The black and white version was great with as much awe and speculate influence as today's high-tech movies, even without any computer effects. You should have been there! Please comment if you had a similar reaction to the b & w version.
