Especially after watching THE MATRIX RELOADED !! * SPOILERS * <br /> Having seen Matrix with everyone, it's the ridiculous fantasy make-believe-robot character with their superpowers, it was refreshing to watch an action movie with real people in situations involving real risk! I cared about these people, and although some of the stunts seemed a bit much, it seemed to me that "it is possible" verses "what stupid video game" (like Matrix) <br /> <br /> , it is very straight forward. Some things are predictable - like knowing someone is going to be a backstab and someone is going to die early. Pretty obvious, but then what? The first 15 minutes set our grounds, our motive, our main goal. <br /> <br /> I liked that Theron and Walhberg didn't have any make-out scenes. I'm glad they didn't go there. They kept it funny fun ESPECIALLY SETH GREENE. That guy is FUNNY! <br /> <br /> This is a movie I wanted to buy when it comes out on DVD. It's fun, fast and entertaining. The only thing (and I think it's a big thing) is that we really are - rooting for the evil ones. This group of protagonists is already on the wrong side of the law. Not a good message for the kids - parents, please explain this to them. <br /> <br />
