This is one of my favorite westerns. What a cast! Glenn Ford plays its role in its usual mild, controlled but firm manner. Ford plays one of the smaller ranchers in the shadow of the mighty anchor runner who wants to swallow the whole territory. Edward G Robinson plays the stunted patriarch of the anchor rope, and Barbera Stanwyck plays his sweet scheming wife. There is lots of action In this Western, quite impressive, the scenery is delicious and the letterbox's reach photography takes the weather and the soundtrack is stereo! I would say that this western had a big budget. It looks expensive. One of a series of great Glenn Ford westerns.
