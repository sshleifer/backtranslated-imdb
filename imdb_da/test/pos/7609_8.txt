I watched this movie for the first time years ago when it was still new and I was happy. It's a great Hollywood make-belief story for teens. But it is not lifelike. As much as you want to believe it, these stories never happen. Therefore, it is annoying to watch movies like that. They play with teenage minds, just imagine how many girls still in high school believed in that magic and were disappointed. I would not recommend this movie to my little sister or my cousin. The director should have spent a little more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about actors. Yes, they (actors) were good, but the idea is not worth 10. There are many films about teens. So why don't we make a better one?
