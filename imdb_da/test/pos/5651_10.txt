This movie is a knockout, burning on the plain being referred to (burning at the end of the harvest time). A happy memory for Tamura, He revives this in his thoughts many times, and at the end of this grim movie looks like a man who dies of thirst, he thinks he is at home, and this last illusion is all what he left. Billy Wilder's Big Carnival (Ace in the Hole) is the only movie (to think) that is as bleak as this little masterpiece of Kon Ichikawa. While I think the whole movie is brilliant. Two scenes that come to mind are when a peloton of Japanese soldiers trying to escape (crawling at home the stomach) is surrounded by Americans and massacred True Horror. And as an American soldier and a beautiful Filipino girl the soldier has a cigarette on the side of the road, she smiles as she blinks with the yank, so her face turns into rage as she sees two Japanese soldiers trying to figure out she is take a gun and kill them with pleasure, the US soldier is trying to stop her, but has no chance for me this speaks volumes of the cruelty committed by the Japanese in the Philippines, all in all a good movie if you have the stomach to the.
