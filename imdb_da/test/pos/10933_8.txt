8 points to go on for sure enough, what really kinda might be more what it was like then. American Indians probably stole more than killed. Who really knows? Nice slower odd pursuit means it has a pace and ... interesting and unique. Fortunately, no other thoughtless shoot em up. I thought this would suck in the first place, I quit being wrapped ... lovely treasure ... good job! I hope no one dissects this movie. When the whole movie unfolds, you have many unique phrases, impossible to determine what will be next. The characters are human and have either honor or not ... passion or not ... forgiveness or not. Settled on loving the white horse, the Indian, Sheen even the damned desert. All good.
