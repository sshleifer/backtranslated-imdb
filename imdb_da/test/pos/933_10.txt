The last part of Kieslowski's trilogy based on the French flags colors finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent character of the cinematic image. In Red, imaging is crucial, as well as the obvious but clever color coding. But instead of complying with empty aesthetic contrivances based on the 'cinema you look', Kieslowski's Red is a multi-layered, closely planned meditation on the nature of fate and love. In red, love and destiny are intertwined but complex notions dictated as much of human whims as the invisible parallel associations that seem to pass us by. You feel Red is really an allegory, a resumption of Prospero's ubiquitous movements in The Tempest, but it's more than its history is shown. Red requires countless prospects, and in each view something new is seen that winds itself into the already immaculate plotted structure. <br /> <br /> Although Red stands alone as a masterpiece from Kieslowski, it is best seen as part of the trilogy. Elements of Blue and White are referred to in Red, which celebrity viewers will enjoy.
