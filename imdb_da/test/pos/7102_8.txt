I liked the House of Dracula much more than Frankenstein's house. Carradine is much more acceptable & his acting is not as ridiculous and overboard as in the HOF. The actors deliver solid enough performances. The subplotters (eg the monster, the village mobsters, the village idiot, the hunchback nurse, etc.) blend well together so that no one becomes an odd splinter as in the HOF. Better run than the stitched-together HOF. The Hunchback nurse is as good as the hunchback in the HOF. The doctor is very good. Likewise, Lon Chaney adds a classic touch to her wolfman. Worth seeing twice. A classic universal horror with the typical 1940s, far lost flair. Especially good is the doctors' performance before / after his blood was contaminated with Dracula's.
