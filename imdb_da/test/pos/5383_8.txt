Bravestarr was released in 1987 by the now-defunct American animation company Filmation at the back of He-man: University lords and She-Ra: Princess of Power in 1983 and the 87s. The character of the comic was about a native American cowboy named Marshall Bravestarr, who possesses the bears' strength, the ear's wolves, the speed of the puma and a hawk's eyes and his faithful sidekick, a talking horse named Thirty-Thirty, who carried him a gun titled "Sarah Jane" and with the help of Deputy Fuzz and Judge JB serves to protect New Texas from the evil Tex Hex and his band of forbidden. <br /> <br /> Seen in futuristic Texas, this was and still is to this day, one of the very few comics set in a particular city, in the United States - therefore in the thousands of light years ahead the future. Considering this was created in the 80s, the creators made an impressive job trying to recreate the wild western look, but from a sci-fi based perspective. Bravestar did not only evoke morality and good verses, but also taught children about life, but it also highlighted themes of culture and society and that we should not take things and life for granted. And despite the fact that this was an action adventure cartoon, many of the stories lines, themes and issues, it is discussed with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them. In addition, Marshall Bravestarr was one of the very first major cartoon characters from a (ethnic) minority background to influence television. <br /> <br /> The sound effects were amazing, the music was amazing, the theme song just as memorable and the animation was wonderful. The characters were well designed, and the stories were different and taught children's morals and the importance of what is right and what is wrong. Something like the same cannot be said of today's cartoon, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> While being overshadowed by the success of He-Man, Bravestarr is still a personal favorite for many 80s cartoon animators. Suffice it to say, I preferred Bravestar over He-man because of the diversity of story lines, signs and that the depth of the situations and problems faced by the characters were more what I would say realistically and identifiable in contrast . For some reason they reasoned more with people, for example, as in "The Promon", where a child dies of an overdose of drugs, it was important that when there was no happy ending, it was important that when the children Seeing the episode well, anyone who sees that episode will realize for themselves the devastating consequences of drug use and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs. Bold, brave and sometimes thought-provoking, Bravestarr is certainly so brave, brave and thought-provoking. A cool cartoon classic for many years to come, it dared to take some risks, but it had good and really paid in the end. It will be remembered by many cartoon fans as one of the most interesting as well as the best 80s cartoons ever, and rightly so, 8 and a half out of ten
