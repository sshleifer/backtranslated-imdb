When I first saw this movie about 6 months ago, I found it interesting, but a little more. But it's stuck with me. This interest grew and grew, and I wondered if my original boredom and response had more to do with the actual VHS quality rather than the film itself. I bought the criterion DVD box set, and it turns out that I was right the second time. Alexander Nevsky is a great movie. It is encouraging and I am sure its main goal was: Propaganda against the Germans. It is the most common criticism of this film, and against Eisenstein, that it is only propagandic and nothing else. It is uncertain. He is a fantastic film artist, one of the most important who lived. At present, the world is far enough beyond Joseph Stalin to see Eisenstone's film as art.
