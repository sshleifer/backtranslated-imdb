Lemuel Gulliver (Ted Danson) is a doctor who walks off the sea, leaving the pregnant wife Mary (Mary Steenburgen) behind. Eight years later, he turns up engrossed and apparently sour - babbling about his adventures in the small liliputian countries, the gigantic Brobdingnags, the floating island of the intellectual Laputa and Houyhnhnms, a race of intelligent, talking horses dealing with Yahoos - a race of bestial people - among many other adventures. The not so good Dr. Bates (James Fox), who has design at Lemuel's wife, has Gulliver jailed in a mental institution, and Lemuel, Mary and son Thomas (Tom Sturridge) have to find a way to prove their sanity. <br /> <br /> An amazing adaptation of Jonathan Swift's satirical novel, this movie is a magnificent adaptation to so many levels: the story, the satire, the characters, the visuals, the brilliant cast. It is simply a good experience to look at, and it is almost amazing considering that it was a movie for television. <br /> <br /> The movie does a brilliant job of capturing Swift's evil satire, which cuts like a hatchet through British society, but still resonates today. The wise Brobdingnags and Houyhnhnms are almost perfect individuals who find it almost impossible to understand why Gulliver speaks with such pride in his society's loads and disturbances. The scenes where Gulliver struggles to prove himself differently from Yahoo's are perhaps the best, with bitter satire in describing how they choose their leaders ("they seem to choose the worst among them ... who regulate until they find someone yet worse ") go to war (" We only go to war for a very good reason - as they are weaker than us, or we want their whole country "), etc. Also the scenarios involving Laputa are done - the intellectuals are so wrapped in their specialized areas that they do not have time for anything else and have really little sense. And the addition of the asylum plot increases history a lot - Dr. Bates is really scary, and when he gives a speech to the investigation of Gulliver's alleged loads, it is quite clear that he describes his own mistakes. <br /> <br /> The film uses beautiful and quite convincing CGI effects that depict the very different settings of the novel with great effect. Contrast of sizes is done in a very skilled manner, and all the worlds depicted in history are convincing in their own way. The camera (especially asylum) and costumes are excellently done. Editing the present with Lemuel memories is a device that could be awkward but works very well. Cast is really wonderful; a genuine who is of British and American talent. Ted Danson provides an excellent, multi-layered performance like Gulliver, which effectively shows his transformation from a person confused by his strange surroundings, to the lunatic state he was in when he returns, to his rational intellectual personality at the end. Most famous for his work at sit-com, Danson shows that he is more than just Sam Malone with this wonderful comic performance. Mary Steenburgen is effective as her wife, and James Fox is absolutely repulsive as Bates. The rest of the casting consists mainly of cameos, with Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Warwick Davis, Kristin Scott Thomas, Geraldine Chaplin, Alfre Woodward, Edward Fox and Sir John Gielgud as the most memorable - but even the smallest parts are much well-maintained. <br /> <br /> Although not 100% true to the book, "Gulliver's Travels" is a triumph of history and images. Don't miss it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
