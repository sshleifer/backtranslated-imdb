The red circle (Jean-Pierre Melville - France / Italy 1970). <br /> <br /> This is perhaps the coolest movie ever made, in the most literal sense of the term. The men here never lose control and never - not even - show their feelings. No dramatic outbreaks in this movie. Everyone is tough all the time. It is an abstract dream world where the men live by their own code, a gangster code with the values ​​of the outside world conspicuously absent. In this masterfully filmed heist story Melville tackles the American criminal thriller in its distinctly dark and desolate style, yet made in grand fashion with a massive $ 10 million budget and with four of the largest French stars at that time. Alain Delon who champions the thief, Yves Montand as an alcoholic ex-cop, Italian star Gian-Maria Volonté as a escaped criminal and André Bourvil in an atypical role as the cynical police chief. <br /> <br /> Melville described LE CERCLE ROUGE as his penultimate movie, and is actually a masterfully stylized politician. He also claimed that he wanted to shoot a film noir in color and in many ways he succeeded. The two primary influences for this film were John Huston's 1950's film THE ASPHALT JUNGLE and Jules Dassin's RIFIFI (1955). But unlike these films, where we learn a lot about the background of individual gang members with all their petty needs and concerns that motivate them, it makes clear that these are not only ruthless underworld types, but ordinary individuals engaged in a world with everyday worries and human efforts, Melville tells us almost nothing about his criminals. Why was Corey (Alain Delon) in prison? Why was his associate, Vogel (Jean-Marie Volonté) arrested in the first place? Or why ex-cop Jansen (Yves Montand) left the force, was it his alcoholism? We never learn the motives behind their actions and never find out what drives these men. Women are even more absent than in his previous film, with the "emotional" ties only between men. They don't even seem to have personal life. A kind of emotional twilight zone and although the setting is not as abstract as in his former LE SAMOURAI (1967), Melville still draws a very creepy world. Melvil's favorite actor, Alain Delon, is perfect and he is almost indispensable if imaginable. <br /> <br /> Deliberately the pace and with a length of over 140 minutes, Melville takes its time to tell the story, but it's slow pace and length seems like a perfect way to show off the desolate world these men live in. Nothing is always out of place in Melville's movies, and here it is no different, every little detail seems to be crucial to history. Although LE SAMOURAI is my favorite Melville movie, even with the biggest movies ever made, it also belongs to the very best. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 10/10
