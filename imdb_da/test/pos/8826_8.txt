Every time the supposed explorers and we, the audience, are primed to set their first sights one of the wonderful new worlds, for some unnecessary reason, the filmmakers decided to distract with an "emergency" or some false alarm or a little artificially dramatic excitement. <br /> <br /> Instead of quietly enjoying the surface of the Io or standing over Saturn's rings or concentrating on flying with a comet or an asteroid, we are distracted to worry about the well-being and survival of the characters. Big let down !! <br /> <br /> The filmmakers seem to be unsure of what they want. A documentary for the natural wonders of our solar system, or an exciting thriller, where the viewer cares more about the characters than the subject. Come on. <br /> <br /> Hi. If I wanted excitement and excitement, I would see a real Narrative sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> Sure it's a docu drama. But the signs and their survival here (the risks of such a mission - must be secondary to the subject). Wait. Yes, the risk of such a mission is an important part of the topic - since it is essentially a movie about a space mission, not just about the solar system. But it was overplayed and greatly distracted from the discovery of new worlds we should enjoy. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the film was remarkable in giving a very realistic feel to the human elements of a space mission, the disparities, the tensions, the weight of responsibility, the almost deadly mistakes, the victims, etc. It would also fit very well into the underlying sci-fi subgenre - it would actually be one of the best, for here science was almost adhered to. <br /> <br /> But the distractions were terrible. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I missed the effects of being in space for years on the astronauts after landing on the ground. Also not
