I just discovered this movie and love it. Just the right mix of fast-paced moves, entertaining characters, fun moments (but not overloaded with stupid jokes) and fun performances by Kelsey Grammar, Harry Dean Stanton, Ron Schneider, Rip Torn and more. Buckman is particularly good and I really enjoyed watching the guy who played Stapanick. I also find it interesting that they used a real submarine, Pampanito, to run on scenes and imitate it almost exactly for their set. The decorated decoration is really impressive if you make a digital tour of Pampanito online and compare it to scenes in the movie. They did an excellent job on this movie. <br /> <br /> What a light entertaining and really fun movie!
