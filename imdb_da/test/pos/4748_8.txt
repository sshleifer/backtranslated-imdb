I recently got THE SEVEN-UPS on video and I have to say it was a very enjoyable movie. Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are good as a policeman and a young Richard Lynch is great as a psychic henchman Moon. The late Bill Hickman is pretty good as his associate Bo and creates a brilliant car hunting sequence that will get you on the edge of your seats. The other three members of the Seven-Ups team are pretty bland, but that's only to be expected. <br /> <br /> I'm happy that many people on this site have supported this movie. I think it should be a movie to be released on DVD and not just forgotten. I certainly enjoyed every minute of it. The final scene between the two leads is excellent as the bad guy must face the consequences of his actions. The seven weeks do not disappoint.
