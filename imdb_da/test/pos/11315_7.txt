Seeing this movie brought me memories of 9/11. The first thing I remember in the morning was watching TV pictures of a plane flying into a big building, and my immediate thoughts "Must be an example of a new Tom Clancy movie". <br /> <br /> This was not a Tom Clancy movie. This was certainly not a British version of "The sum of all fears". The typical Tom Clancy movie or novel has a relatively small casting, a linear plot and usually a kind of resolution. This movie had neither. What I saw directly on the screen was a small casting, a plot and a vague resolution, but as if it were 9/11, reality was so much larger and more complex. <br /> <br /> I work in system planning and the reality of disaster preparation and the disaster itself is painfully obvious. It is impossible to prepare for a disaster like this, nor will it be possible to handle this when it happens. From the argument between the police (not enough is done to prepare) and politicians (If you give everyone on the pipe a gas mask, it will cause panic), to the constant speaker messages (You have no danger to your health, but do not go home before we decontaminate you) and (Don't eat, drink, or smoke before we decontaminate you), I was on the verge of the whole movie. Not the least urge to surf. <br /> <br /> This movie was 90 minutes long. It could have been twice that and still not shown every possible detail. Instead, it left uncertain to let each of us imagine the details, each of us in our own way. It made it so much more true to me than any Tom Clancy movie. <br /> <br /> I lived in London once and right on Edgeware Road. And I took the train from Waterloo station many times. When I saw Dirty War, I told myself that this is only fiction. Right now. <br /> <br /> Allah and Jehovah will, this movie remains fiction, and once in 20 or 30 years my nephews can watch this movie and remember the early 21st century, and the panic we felt too much. Hopefully, to the same extent as I currently feel, looking at the cold war memorabilia with the evil Communist regime in the mid-20th century and remembering "Drop and cover" exercises in school.
