After 10 views for 20 years, I also think this was Crazy Gang's best bet on film, with more coherence in the plot than their second best, "Alf's Button Afloat". They were actually a crazy trio of dual actions that were thrown together mainly on stage, sometimes in front of royalty, until Chesney Allen retired in the "40s through" ill health. He survived them all over the years. just as crazy outside of "work", and they regularly played practical jokes on each other. <br /> <br /> Six Wonder Boys troupe head for I will tell her (Alaska) to dig for the gold found There seemed to be a better idea than going to Mansfield ... because they had been there. When they came to Red Gulch, they found that they were only 40 years old - they thought the chips were in it Guilty newspaper they had read tasted fun, but then it does not matter as they all fell in love with Snow White and will help her grandfather find her much-lost stash of gold. Baddie Bill "M" McGrew wants it himself. br /> <br /> The number of verbal and visual words is amazing, but they f read will probably only make sense (?) to Britons and ex-pats interested in watching '30s British b & w comedies. Imho almost all the gags and routines work, including the Gold if tits between Bud & Chesney and the "Whistle While You Work" pastiche - even the "Always Getting Our Man" Mountie bets. A wonderful little movie, in a pretty tired-looking state, but totally recommended.
