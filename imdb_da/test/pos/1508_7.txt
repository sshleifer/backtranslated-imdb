Anyone who says Lucio Fulci is not one of the most important names in the splatter story is probably sour. The Italian director is a legend among hardcore horror fans, and his work exceeds the barriers of the genre (which can forget his western, crime or fantasy flicks). This is probably his most entertaining movie, and unfortunately the last one begins. A horror director (Fulci as himself) hallucinates cruel murders. He goes to a psychiatrist who makes him believe he is a criminal. During this time, the doctor begins a long chain of serial crimes. With such a plot, the film must have been filled with something. And there are rotating bodies, broken or melted heads, stabbings, beheaders, chain stores and many others. Kind boring sometimes, the movie is saved by the exaggerated violence that will surely delight the gore addicts.
