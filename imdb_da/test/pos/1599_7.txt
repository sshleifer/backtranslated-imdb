I'm not sure where to start with this. In short, it was a disappointing movie. After learning the novella I was aware that it would be a difficult story to become a movie. The film has a couple of interesting lines (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach), but it does not represent the debate on art that basically constitutes the novella. <br /> <br /> For one I expected an older Aschenbach and a younger Tadzio. In the book, Tadzio is fourteen, but he is described as pure, ideal and innocent, while in the film is sexualistic and is a teasing. He is accomplice to Aschenbach, he always looks back to him, almost provocative. In the book, Aschenbach steals glances at the boy. As for Aschenbach, I imagined something closer to the professor-turned clown in the Blue Angel (based on a story from Thomas Mann's brother Heinrich) than this petty-bellied with almost no gray hair. In all fairness, I think Dirk Bogarde did a good job, but either one should have done it, or he should have made it look older in the beginning. <br /> <br /> I know the discovery of homosexuality is important to history, but the film minimizes the talk of art and duality between the apollonian and dyonistic inspirations, and instead focuses on Aschenbach's occupation of Tadzio and does not justify it. I liked that Mahler's music was used because he ultimately inspired Mann to write his story. I'm not sure to make Aschenbach a particularly good movement for a musician. Or the creation of Alfred, which I cannot remember in the book. <br /> <br /> And one thing that really came to me was the sound and how it didn't match the actors' lips. I wondered if it was dubbed because I was expecting to be in Italian. But then I remembered that every Italian movie I've seen has this problem. It bothers me just because these directors (Fellini is the other person I'm thinking of) need epitomeric perfection in Italian movies, and here their characters suffer without sound, so you hear a sound that doesn't match their faces (I think The scenes when Aschenbach almost collapsed and started laughing, this scene could / should have been the strongest, but it was annoying instead).
