This movie was recently shown subtitles, not called, on Australia's Special Broadcasting Service. I thought I read here that sometimes there is an assumption that * Revenge of the Rats * is a successor. In fact, the rats become revenge for something done within this film or in human history. There is no prequel as far as I know. <br /> <br /> Now let's get Hamelin Pied Piper out of the way. Maybe this story crossed me when I saw the movie, but it is all. There was the use of the word "coffers" at the end of the movie. A dazed mayor tries to justify her actions by saying "the chests were empty". "Coffers" is not a word you hear much about these days unless you read peoples stories to your children as I do. Since I've seen * Revenge of the Rats *, I've read two versions of The Pied Piper of Hamelin. Now I see the comparison. A metaphorical fat but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford to get rid of the rats. This is about as far as I can follow the analogy. The kids are not led to a door in a mountain, with a lame boy left behind to tell about a country with winged horses and fountains, where it is always spring and everyone is always happy. <br /> <br /> There is a lot that is pretty mainstream about this movie. Romance and decision especially. The female characters have potentially powerful roles in society, but are really quite impotent. Where this movie is rather rebellious (compared to American cinema) is that it is anti-authoritarian. The helicopter pilot is fired by the mayor to do it well. The mayor and the local government are portrayed as corrupt and pandering for big money. Finally, it is left to a doctor in Frankfurt to solve an epidemic of a fatal and contagious disease. Apparently, there is no national infectious disease authority to coordinate things or send in backup. <br /> <br /> I'm not a horror aficionado, so any horror I see is usually mixed with humor. Right from the rat in the bloodstream, you can see that this has the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers. The huge number of rats is impressive, and horror fans also seem happy.
