I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what holds the power it has! It was fun and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It's right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was happy to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot for those who do not have today's cartoon for children. Today's cartoon seems to push the idea that you need something special, some magic formula or talent to cope with evil or dangerous circumstances. Although the early cartoons did not react very badly - it was a much milder and safer time - they allowed us to develop our own talents and character.
