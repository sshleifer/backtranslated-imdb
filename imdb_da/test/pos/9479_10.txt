If you like Cagney, you like this movie. It has an incentive for American integrity at all costs, personal or social. Cagney plays head of weights and measures in NYC. Cagney is up against crooked politicians, the criminal underground, a prominent philanthropist and simple merchants who add a few ounces to the price of a chicken. The chicken scene is fun, where Cagney finds a weight placed in the bird cave of an unsuspecting butcher. The chicken is thrown around the store in a hilarious scene about who controls "evidence". If you like old phones, there are interesting scenes with calls, phones and even bizarre telephone lines. Compared to a lot of movies made today, it is pure entertainment and includes mystery of comedy and a message that honesty above all should be mankind's guiding principle. Made in simpler times reflects a world we cannot find today. Fashion (especially hats) outwear and cars all play a prominent visual role in defining this small movie.
