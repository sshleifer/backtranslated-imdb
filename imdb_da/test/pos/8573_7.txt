If you saw this movie for nudity (as I did), you won't be disappointed. I could have done without bumbling crooks or the bear myself. Some bottomless nudity could have been shown, but for what it was I thought H.O.T.S. must be the best of its genre. It's not the kind of movie that could have been made today, which is a shame because it is the kind of movie that is worth looking at in these times. <<br /> <br /> It would be a shame that the DVD has no extra features but since they did not have DVDs as this was filmed, which is understandable. I would like to know more about the film's recording, especially where they shot the football game at the end.
