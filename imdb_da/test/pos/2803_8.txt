In France, Xavier (Romain Duris) is a young economist of twenty and some years trying to get a job in a state department through a father of his father. He is advised to have a specialization in Spanish economics and language to get a good position. He decides to use in a European exchange program called "Erasmus" and move to Barcelona to improve his knowledges in Spanish culture and language. She leaves her girlfriend Martine (Audry Tautou) and promised to keep in close contact with her, and once in Barcelona he was temporarily filed by a French doctor Jean-Michel (Xavier de Guillebon) and his young and lonely wife Anne-Sophie (Judith Godrèche) he had met at the airport. Later he moves to an apartment with international students: the English Wendy (Kelly Reilly), the Spanish soledad (Cristina Brondo), the Italian Alessandro (Fédérico D'anna), the Danish Lars (Christian Pagh) and the German Tobias Metschurat). Then the Belgian Isabelle (Cécile de France) and Wendy's brother William (Kevin Bishop) join the group, and Xavier learns Spanish language and finds friendship and love in his experience living abroad. "L 'Auberge Espagnole" is one of the movies that the viewer gets sad when it ends. The story is a wonderful and fun story of friendship and love in a globalized world and a united Europe. This very charming movie made me feel good and happy, although I have never experienced living in a republic of students. Newcomer William evokes the funniest situations in history with his big mouth and short brain. In addition, it is great to see a fresh approach to students living together differently from the stupid American brothers and their stereotypes that are common in American films. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Albergue Espanhol" (Spanish Auberge ")
