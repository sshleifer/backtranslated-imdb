I was very impressed with what Eddie Monroe was able to achieve with regard to its overall impact on me. I say this because I know that this independent film had a limited budget / resources, but in spite of this it is convincing as a compelling and well-crafted work. From start to finish with several relatively unknown actors, whom I can't help believing, will make a big noise in the industry in the years to come, Eddie Monroe omitted to keep my interest engaged and my emotional gauge dancer. It is a well-written story with an amazing ending despite my efforts not to be guarded. Many of the casting names listed for this movie are names that should be taken care of in the future. Someone told me that Paul Regina recently passed by, and if that is true, it's a real tragedy when his stoic performance in Eddie Monroe is remarkable. Kudos to Fred Carpenter who really has drawn a winner with this one!
