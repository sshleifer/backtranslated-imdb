A murderer in Mold of Jackal's form, In Fire Of Fire, has added the twist that Eastwood's old-fashioned bodyguards Frank Horrigan are worried about past job flaws. Chase becomes personal when John Malkovich's reptile murder Leary tells him about this neurosis - with the rather lumpy exception for the love of a good woman (Russo's Lilly Raines) nothing will silence Frank's mind and take Leary down personally. <Br /> <br /> Malkovich is a fleeting presence - not just on the screen, but also a switchable actor. This is one of his great films, focused and playing director Petersen's games. Eastwood is too old, but a) the audience doesn't care because it's him and b) his age is written in the manuscript, not just in the story but also as a recurring joke. Almost much like you would expect, but well handled. 10.7
