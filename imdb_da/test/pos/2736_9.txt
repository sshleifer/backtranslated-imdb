If you repeat a lie enough number of times, will it become the truth? 15 Park Avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The film is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen provides another masterpiece. Every single actor in the movie was better than the other. Concern Sen looks incredibly convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is amazing as usual. She plays the dominant and fiercely independent eldest sister of Mithi, who takes care of her dizzying sister and aging mother. She refuses to accept it despite all her strength and courage, she still feels lonely at times. This should have been a very light movie for Rahul Bose. The role was least demanding and someone could have done the role. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie was the most surreal part of the whole park's adventure experience. It took me a while to digest that movie was finished. It left me confused and maybe even a little disturbed. But later it began to sink. My eyes are black. But if everyone says they are blue, I still believe it is black!
