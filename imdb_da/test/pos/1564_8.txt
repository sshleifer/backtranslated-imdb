A good performance by Emily Grace! I stumbled upon this movie as I looked at my satellite charts and was curious about the summary of the plot given by my satellite provider. I was very entertained and had a lot of compassion for the character "Alice" played by Emily Grace. The story had me guessing what would happen to Alice and was not predictable. The overall story was refreshing and had some nice phrases for the supporting characters. The end of the story ended in a fairly fair manner. I want to buy this DVD to add to my library. I'm a new fan of Emily Grace and I expect to see more of her performances.
