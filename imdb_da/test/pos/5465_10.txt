I just returned from Santa Fe. NM. I visited Loretto Chapel. As I looked around this building, which was acquired by a private owner, I revived the movie version of the staircase. It is an overwhelming mystery that occupies this building. It's about what can happen if you really have faith. The bookstore has a story about the subject, which is the story of the stairs. I read the story in its entirety. I was absorbed by the atmosphere around the people there. It was as if we were completely closed in a time chain, all with the same thoughts and awe. When we left, the wife was overwhelming. Everyone should visit Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe. NM.
