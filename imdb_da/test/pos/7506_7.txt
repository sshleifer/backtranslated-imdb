GREAT SPOILERS !!!! Dr. Boch (George C. Scott) is the head of medicine at a large NYC hospital. He has left his wife, his children have despised him, he is impotent, drinks a lot and considers suicide. There is also a killer roaming the hospital. Then he meets VERY strange Barbara (Diana Rigg) and falls in love. She wants him to run away with her - but can he completely give up on his old life and start a new one? <br /> <br /> Very strange movie with an Oscar-winning script by Paddy Chayefsky. It presents a suicidal protagonist and shows us a hospital full of overtime nurses and doctors who are incompetent. It manages (in some way) to actually make this seem quite fun. It's not laughing loud humor - it's very black humor. The play is also on target - Scott is just fantastic (and Oscar nominated) here. You see him try to keep his beauty in a completely crazy situation. Riggs character is more than a little strange, but her material way works and she is also incredibly beautiful. Scripture is strong and brutal - but never too much. I think it fumbles the ball at the end with a situation that goes way above the top - but it's still worth seeing. If this had been done very seriously, it would probably be impossible to take. Also look for Katherine Helmond in a little bit and Stockard Channing and Christopher Guest in unknown bits. I personally had trouble taking this seriously. From what I have heard hospitals this was bad back in the 1970s but no more. Watch it for acting and scripting. I give it a 7.
