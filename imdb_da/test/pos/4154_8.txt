The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man hoping for a more fertile life, persuades his family to leave their homeland in Sicily, take the hard journey across the raging sea and inhabit a land whose rivers seem to flow with milk. In short, they believe that risking everything for the New World will fulfill their dreams of prosperity. The image of the New World is optimistic, clever and very imaginative. Silver coins count from the sky over Salvatore as he expects how prosperous he will be in the New World; carrots and onions twice as large as humans are shown to be harvested to suggest prosperity and health, and amounts of milk swam in and flow through the minds of those who expect what the new world will provide. All this image is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps to compliment the gritty realism that history unfolds to the audience. The contrast between this image and the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps to give hope while aboard the ship to the new world. Travel to the New World is shot almost in full darkness, especially when the ocean currents roar and almost kill the people inside. The dark reality I mentioned is the old world and the actual journey to the new world. The Old World is depicted as something rude and primitive. This appears as Salvatore's scrambles together to sell the few possessions he has left (donkeys, goats and rabbits) to get the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the New World. I thought it was quite interesting that these people believed they had to adhere to a particular dress code to be accepted into the new world; It was almost that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold to be recognized as a moral form. The most powerful picture in the film was when the ship left their homeland and sailed to the new world. This shot shows an overview of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from each other, depicting the separation between the old and new worlds. This lap also suggested that the peoples were torn away from anything that was once confidential, would separate from their former dark living conditions and wanted to enter a world that had more promise. <br /> <br /> As later opposed to how the new world visually looks, the old world seems dark and gloomy to the bright but unclear new world. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty never appears through the fog on Ellis Island, but has remained hidden. I think this was an intentional leading choice that seemed to reject the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty stands for: "Give me your poor, your tired, your hungry" seemed like a joke in what these people might go through when arrives in the new world. When they arrived in America, they had to undergo fairly humiliating tests (ie, delousing, math, puzzle, etc.) to prove themselves fit for the new world. These tests completely changed the prospects of the Sicilian people. In particular, Salvator's mother had the most difficult time to submit to New World rules and laws, feeling more offended than treated with respect. Where their dreams once created hope and optimism for what the New World would provide, the reality of what the New World required was divergent and rude. Salvatore does not change much more than his attitude to what he felt the new world would be as opposed to what the new world actually seemed to disappoint him. This attitude was partly offset by most people traveling with him. Their character arches are more about a loving dream that is greatly disturbed and a dark reality that must be accepted. The film seems to give a strong comment to prepare to enter a heavenly and civilized society. Cleanliness, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. Compliance with these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. Perhaps it is a comment on how America has learned from other nations in deficiency, and so it was purposefully established to ensure that these plagues did not attack and destroy. Although the rules were rigid, they were there to protect and help the people flourish.
