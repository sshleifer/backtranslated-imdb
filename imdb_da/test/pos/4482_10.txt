Passion in the desert exemplifies spatial neighbors. It is a visual narrative, illuminated by the magnificent filmography. Passion was filmed on the spot in the deserts of Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Namibia and Tunisia. <br /> <br /> We are in Egypt, 1798. Augustin, a Neapolitan soldier, escortes author and artist Jean-Michel Venture De Paradis on an official mission to document, measure, draw and paint the cultural landmarks of Egypt: its dunes, stupendous ruins and mysterious people. <br /> <br /> But can you really "document" majestic truths, broken buildings and wild Bedouins? Can you really capture the essence of Egypt, nature, man and time? Jean and Augustine are lost in the fascinating sparkling gold desert, whose greatness overwhelms their senses. <br /> <br /> "You can't get lost in Egypt! There is the Nile, and there is the sea!" says it dried out Augustine, and soon he discovers an old winding cave leading to a palatial ruin. <br /> <br /> Delirious and near-delusional, he tries to rest; a confusing sound praises him; His eyes, body and emotions become hypnotically locked in time as he stumbles into a sensual, sensual experience. <br /> <br /> A wild, slender female leopard stares back at him and their love affair begins. ... <br /> <br /> A bold love affair, a daring movie.
