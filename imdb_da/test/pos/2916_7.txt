I start right at the beginning by saying "I like this movie." It's sweeping, it's magnificent, it's poignant, and it's fun. The Sinhue doctor sits in front of his little stone hut, writing his memoirs. And what story is it! Taken from a river and bred by an older couple doted on him, he becomes a doctor to the poor. He turns to Horemheb, who sees glory while Sinhue sees healing. And both run into the future pharaoh Anchor (forgive my spellings), which triggers an epileptic fit. <br /> <br /> And this pharaoh has another "error": He believes in a god instead of a gods pantheon. At that time, this was completely revolutionary. Sinhue and Horemheb grow up. One night, Sinhue sees a woman who makes him lose her senses. He gives his practice, sells his parents' home and even their tombs to spend a night with her. Does he? I don't want to tell you. Meanwhile, Merit, a girl with sweet simplicity who bent the strength of Jean Simmons, fell in love with Sinhue. She falls under his magic and under the belief in faith in a god. Victor Mature perfectly suits Horemheb. Edmond Purdom is sincere as Sinhue's lost doctor (he finds redemption? Be reconciled). Even Bela Darvi, the woman who steals Sinhue's heart, is not as bad as everyone has said. The fact that she was Daryl F. Zanuck's mistress had nothing to do with the casting - right? Yes, really ... still, she wasn't that bad - I've seen worse. I think she did better in "The Egyptian" than many of today's young actresses have done. I said it before and I say it again - I like this movie. I recommend it. It makes you believe despite some hammy acting. Have fun with this movie; it is worth it.
