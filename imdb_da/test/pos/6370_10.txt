Michael Ritchie's "The Couch Trip" is a wonderful anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. It is so subtle and painful that you begin to realize what a stinging satire really is. It is also Dan Akyroyd's best film, made in a particularly good film year (1988) for him. First, "The Great Outdoors" and now this. <br /> <br /> Akyroyd stars like John Burns, a career villain who fails insane to escape the prison. Now, a stupid comedy would just be about this. But "The Couch Trip" uses this as a springboard to everything else. Beverly Hills psychiatrist George Maitlin (Charles Grodin, subtly hilarious here) has a nervous breakdown and a replacement is chosen: Lawrence Baird, who happens to be Akyroyd's psychiatrist! You can basically guess what needs to happen, but the good thing about "The Couch Trip" is not what happens, but how it is done. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" gives Dan Akyroyd the best role he has ever had. His John Burns is one of the truly original comics in film history. Wicked lines and physical humor are part of it, but what makes it special is that Akyroyd makes Burns a lovable character. We support him and grow to like him a lot within 98 minutes of running. <br /> <br /> But Akyroyd is not alone here. He gets strong support from other great comics. Walter Matthau joins the hilarity as a constitutional minister who catches on Burns' secret and commits a massive extortion. Charles Grodin "slow burns" his way to another great comic role as the burned out psychiatrist. Grodin has been one of the most underappreciated actors in Hollywood. It's criminal, they haven't used him more often. Richard Romanus plays Grodin's slimball lawyer to perfection. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" is one of many films made by the current Orion Pictures Corporation, which is currently invisible. MGM spent a fortune buying the Orion library, but has not yet really cash in on their acquisition. "The Couch Trip" joins "Dressed to Kill", "Blow Out" and countless others in gathering dust rotting in the vault. Shame on the MGM for their lack of action. Hopefully, with the new management, "The Couch Trip" will find the audience and respect it deserves. <br /> <br /> **** out of 4 stars
