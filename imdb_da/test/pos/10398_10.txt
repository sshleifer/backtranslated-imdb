Here is another Antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or DVD. I saw it a couple of months ago when it ran for the first time (even in the capital city capital LA!) For a few weeks and then disappeared (the art house's audience seems to have chosen their own special area where older favorites like Antonioni and Resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosity). <br /> <br /> I was first disappointed, thought the pace was unbearably boring and that the man had lost a chance (for years Antonioni had difficulty finding finance) at an advanced age to add another masterpiece to sin canon; But when he knew Antonioni for what he was and how I had first responded to Blow-Up and Passenger, I refused to give judgment until I had seen the movie again. I went back the next day and I should not have been surprised that the movie kept me from making me aware of things I had thought of and lost control of my entire life, driving home in a modern setting, pointer exposed to First Once 40 years ago in 'L'Aventurra', an environment of subtle moods formed so distinctive and fascinating alienated in tone (and quite comedic indeed) that I couldn't get enough. The scene with Malkovich sitting on the fancy colored oscillations on the windy beach, with the weather so beautifully silver-plated, and the Eno / U2 track in the background flowing through just its rhythm, had been my favorite; it was still, but now the whole movie was just as big! What a strange phenomenon, the complex simplicity or the invisible complex that Antonioni's eyes alone seem to be able to retrieve and communicate. The odd thing is, although it looks at first glance as a softcore porn of some sort, and it has lots of sex and the divinely beautiful Sophie Marceau and plently of other international stars to distract you, this film is unmistakably Antonioni's core, but You will not notice which deep extent until you have seen it a few times and get used to its rhythm. For example, it is quite a fun movie with a deep sense of humor, something I did not notice at first, but was turned on by another critic and noted much pleasure from further considerations (4 before they drew it and would have gone back for more). If this film had been promoted right and people to some extent controlled how to approach it, I have no doubt that it would succeed on the circuit of the art house as most of Antonioni's 60s film. But the 60s are no longer, and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen, where half of its beauty will be lost, even in a bookbook DVD version (if and when released). I urge all movie nuts in general or esoteric to see 'Beyond the Clouds' and add a piece of magic to the tragic.
