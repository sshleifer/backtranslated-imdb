I feel very sorry for some of the people who have gone through this movie. It is clear that their standards are so high that they will never enjoy a movie just for the sake of enjoyment. Or maybe their enjoyment is derived from the action of picking movies apart; Looking for some reason not to like them? <br /> <br /> The Long Kiss Goodnight is an action movie, in every sense of the word. Sure there are holes in the plot that are large enough to run a semi-through, but none of them is enough to stop the flow of the movie itself. I've never been a great Geena Davis fan, but I was impressed with how she could create two very different characters, Samantha Cain and Charlie Baltimore. In my opinion, it was not even necessary to have changed her physical appearance to distinguish between the two ... her plays were more than enough to make art. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, this movie was Craig Bierko's. In the hands of others, Timothy's character could have been just another interchangeable villain. His decision to play him with a more relaxed approach was just the right counterpoint to every action scene. It's not often that you find an actor who can express himself so well with just his facial expression ... pointing to: the scene in the freezer with Charlie and her daughter. Where most movies would have cluttered the current "revelation" with unnecessary dialogue, Bierko's eyes told the whole story. <br /> <br /> The basic plan? Thin, to be truthful. An apparent average housewife suffering from amnesia slowly discovers that she had been an assassin. As her memory returns, they make people who want the killer dead. Is she really Samantha, cookie baker or Charlie, the cold-blooded assassin? Or maybe a little bit of both? For me, The Long Kiss Goodnight was an enjoyable journey to find out.
