I don't know how I would feel if I lived in the United States. I would see some examples scenes, commercials, I would know, Sidney Pollack directed it, Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas starring in. I would watch this movie as soon as possible without reading any bad review. Would I be disappointment? I read a lot of reviews that say how bad this movie was: This is boring, long film without passionate feelings, and it's not interesting. Harrison is wood, cold. Sublots must be cut. Too serious, especially for Harrison Ford. I'm interested in the subject and I like Harrison Ford in the movies that aren't acts. I also like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas. So I read the reviews on the IMDB website, since in other places, so in February in the Hungarian film magazines, I wondered what the film was. Still, there are movies, directors, stars, what / who I want to see despite reviews. <br /> <br /> I can understand people who think this movie is boring and cold and has no passion, but I feel different. That's right, I liked shooting doors, the forbidden woman (this is a French movie, I don't know what its title is in English or in French). The basics of these films are the development of a love. <br /> <br /> I think Random Heart is a nice and interesting movie in its own way. It may be true that sublime congressional elections and police investigations for a corrupt policeman - not well written, have not been detailed, but add something to the leading woman and man's character. After his wife's death and treacherous feelings, anger at Holland comes to the surface during his work. He will be suspicious and almost lost his best friend (also the woman). The film shows two ways to survive the tragedy: our wife / husband's death and cheating. One of them is the woman's: this is tragedy, but life continues. She will not mourn forever. What she wants to know - what her husband's boyfriend - the policeman's wife - was thinking of her, she will never learn. She is forced to behave this way. The election has come and everything about his husband can be scandalous. She wants her daughter not to be disappointed with her father. The man is a policeman. He suffers from the fact that he lived in lies. He wants to know - maybe all men would like to know in this situation - when his wife began to cheat him. How long had she loved? He needs the help of the woman, but she does not want to, but the guy is stubborn and stable / persistent. The woman can't stand him because he always goes into her life and she can't forget. Their relationship is tense at the beginning and then slowly the development of a kind of silence, which prefers an alliance against the outside world, the tragedy. (I said, despite the fact that they loved themselves in bed) But the policeman can't stop investigating, can't stop close and can't allow the woman close to him, but he starts the "love" and the woman wants their relationship continues. But it can't. The woman realizes it. The end is a little sad, but logical and beautiful at the same time. It was pleasant for me to see again Peter Coyote-I like this man's face - Sidney Pollack. I hardly knew Bonnie Hunt, but she was good. <br /> <br /> I think Harrison Ford did an okay job. His eardrop is unusual, but in the beginning I finally thought that the woman liked to be with his company despite his temper. It was a pity that he had no joke. But Ford has a good sense of humor. One reviewer noted (in Hungary): "Ford is charismatic towards his hairdresser and eardrum, and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic message. But Dr. Jones does not smile at us". But he smiles at the end and it is so good. With the rest I agree. I like him in this role - he is good at acting a little rough, cool but somewhere in his soul smart politician. The character of Kristin Scott Thomas is a determined, confident woman, but she is enclosed in an ivory tower, and she refrains from her feelings. But she is a real woman who becomes indecisive and finds support on the police. The two cool, reserved people find each other. Maybe the script is not good. It's full of common, banal sentence, but there are some humorous phrases from the woman and the movement, especially from the man. It's a good movie, but not for everyone, not for the general big audience. I saw the women under 18 and men over 45 liked this movie better. About the latter, perhaps Sidney Pollack made this film to his age group, which does not go to multiplex. Anyway I advise the people who like energetic plots with action scenes that only like Ford's action movie miss this movie.
