Along with the army, this is one of Pauly Shore's best movies, if there is such a thing. While the entire West Coast-meets-Midwest culture clash is nothing new, this movie shows the story a little more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antics of such a fresh Shore. While the change in value would probably have gone in the other direction, the whole concept was quite entertaining. Not only was Shore's interaction with the family hilarious, it also had Carla Gugino and Tiffani-Amber Theissen (she will always have Amber in my book) in two careful and early roles. One of these movies I have no problem seeing when it is on TV.
