This film immediately catches the eye, with atmospheric aerial images of a very beautiful Hong Hong. Filmed in the rich colors of 1950's movies, which modern blockbusters never seem to catch. Probably a sign of these times because this is not a high powered, seen it all before movies, full of chaos and violence. However, the turmoil and violence are in the background of thousands of refugees trying to get out of China. This is a very moving and convincing story, full of hope and love in a tragic time in recent history. The story of two people from different cultures falls in love. And the build-up of those trying to overcome this is the heart of this very fine and moving film.
