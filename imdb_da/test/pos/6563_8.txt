Wow .. I just watched this movie on the Sundance Channel and it's really bizarre. I can't be a movie expert, but it's probably the most bizarre movie I have seen as an average movie fan. The one who came with it had a fantastic imagination. I'm a bit of a fan of Japanese dramas, and there are often actors from dramas in film. (Matsushima Nanako, for example, the Ringu leader, is a great j-drama star.) But it seems this is the first movie for Kirie and Shuichi's portraits. I must say that if they really debut here, they do a good job. <br /> <br /> Kirie was a very nice character, I thought she was easy to relate to. She was kind and kind-hearted, perhaps not the most popular girl, but nicer than some of the other attention-seeking girls. She was also beautiful in a classic way. I hope she does more movies, but it has been a few years, so maybe she has no plans. The end was strange. I'm not going to give anything away, but the rest of the movie's bizarreness was a little shame. <br /> <br /> Very bizarre but very imaginative and unique movie. I would recommend it to Japanese horror fans, though I will warn you, it is much more bizarre than Ringu. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I will give it a 7.5 out of 10, for originality, imagination, good characterization, above average seems, and just being plain thrilling.
