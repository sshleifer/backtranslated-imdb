I love this movie .... one of my all-time favorites !!! This was the first big screen movie my mother took me to see when I was 9. I highly recommend it to all African Americans. This story is about love, trust, challenges and everyday life for a black family. All the actors worked well together. I wish it was on video, but from then on it is not available as I know. I caught it on TV a few years ago and registered it, so when I want to see it ... I got it! The soundtrack is great too! A must-see!
