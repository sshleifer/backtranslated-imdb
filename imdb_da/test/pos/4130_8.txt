Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock'n'roll. The young singer / songwriter from Lubbock, Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting for the system to record his rock-a-billy sound. Prior to his early death, he mixed lush strings with rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voice of teenage anxiety. <br /> <br /> This easy-to-see bio is not without errors. Some situations, events, locations and even names were not correct for various reasons. What makes this movie so believable is that Gary Busey made his own song in Holly's part. A well-produced soundtrack became a multi-million seller. <br /> <br /> Busey was nominated for an Oscar. Other stars of note are Don Stroud, Conrad Janis, Charles Martin Smith and Maria Richwine.
