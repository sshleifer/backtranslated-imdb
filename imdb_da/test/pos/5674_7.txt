"Black Water" is a movie that somehow surprised me and definitely exceeded my original expectations. "Black Water" is really a very well-structured, unpredictable, exciting, well-oriented and well-scary movie. The reason is actually something original and will definitely keep you fascinated with it. One thing I love about this movie is the direction because it is primarily about how it exceeded my original expectations. My original expectations for "Black Water" were that it was a crappily made, acted, directed, paced and boring movie. It really wasn't. Well the play is nothing to praise because there were times I felt they didn't show enough emotions and there are some lines that are just so scripts. But I love the direction, because all its shots seem predictable, but it's not. Like when you look at it, the camera says a slow shot of the water, and it goes completely, you're like the hook by attacking. But the hook's attacks are very unpredictable (which was bad for me, who doesn't handle movies like this too much) and that makes you jump. And I just love being one of those horror movies that doesn't rely on the sudden big sound blast to make you jump, but instead of the actual movie. I also like how the story is about people who are trapped in these trees, it made it work very well and certainly kept their eyes on the screen. I have to say that I didn't believe the opening 20, so minutes were done well and I think they made the boat a little heavier than it would have been in real life. Plus I didn't like how they tried their absolute best to make the character's situation seem completely hopeless as it really wasn't. Again, I just don't think some of the character acts were realistic. For example, I would not have gone anywhere near the water knowing they were a crocodile in it, let alone a killer. But these problems are really not that big and I could still enjoy the movie. All in all, what movies go, I've seen it better, but as far as animal attacks are concerned, horror movies (a genre I can easily scarred on) are one of the better ones you want to see. And it's not perfect, but that doesn't mean it's not worth a shot.
