This little card absolutely fascinates me. The only thing I've seen as far as it is is Sam Brakhage's work, the creator of Dog Star Man. But where Brakhage is trying to unnerve by "getting us to learn to look again" and giving us a fringe of headaches that cause bright colors and flashes (which I still quite dig and embrace as high art ...) movies I would characterize as very relaxing and mesmerizing. Man Ray's general use of spinning objects / cameras does not create a dizzying feeling, but a warm flow of senses, confusion, and gravity in the moving world around us. <br /> <br /> An interesting objection to this very short work is that objects become more and more recognizable until we end up on a naked torso (which I feel are the least feminine well-rounded breasts I've ever seen). The shadows circles and spirals and light over the torso make it an object of surreal beauty, something that you could hang on your wall and thrust over forever. It is because of this and other images in this movie that I have to see it over and over again (ultimately a total of seven times) just because it completely fascinates me. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
