This was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid. It had it all - music, stories, a talking squirrel and chuckling daisies. I would be one of those hippie chicks who sang and swung a swing. I'm 35 and I grew up in South Jersey, but we have three New York channels with our cable connection, and I think it was on Channel 11. They just don't do that anymore (I know what does I sound really old) and it blows me that I grew up with only 9 channels on our TV, but I could always find something good to watch. I only talked to another person who actually heard about and saw this show. She is three years younger than me, and she grew up in North Jersey. I would love to watch this series on DVD so I could show it to my 5-year-old daughter and she could see what stupid (but great) things the mother used to see! I just found a VHS tape with a few episodes, and a music CD from the show on ebay, and I just bought them up, even though they were a bit expensive. I can't wait to get them to live the great memories!
