SPOILER WARNING <br /> We've all heard the "Boy Who Cried Wolf" legend. But what if the wolf was a person in the modern world. It may be something like Big Fat Liar. Fourteen-year-old Jason Sheperd (Frankie Muniz from "Malcolm in the Middle") always lies to stay out of trouble. One day he is pressured to write an English essay, but it gets in the hands of the shabby filmmaker Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti) who plans to make Jason's story a Hollywood blockbuster. Nobody thinks Jason when he once tells the truth and he ends up in the summer school. But Jason is determined to prove his parents the truth and travel to L.A. with his friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes). When Wolf refuses to admit that he was beating his story, Jason plans to make Wolf's life a living hell. B.F.L. is not a masterpiece, but it is a good way to spend 90 minutes of your time. I wished they could have done it a little longer though, and there aren't that many pranks even though they're smart enough (I like the pool dye the best). I might not have liked it as much as I do if it wasn't for Paul Giamatti. He is simply fun in this. If you have 90 minutes to kill, try it here. You can just enjoy it.
