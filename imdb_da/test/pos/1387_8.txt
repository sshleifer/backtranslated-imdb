Okay, I just want to disagree with the previous comments that criticized this show. I happen to think this show is amazing. (I mean when Jasmin Weber was still on, and Franzi was still alive, so addicting!). And I was surprised to hear that this was categorized as a soap because it just doesn't have the appearance of soap in America. Soaps here are absolutely horrible! At least GZSZ movies on the spot are real music and more plausible story lines. In addition, the action on GZSZ is mostly quite credible especially with Josephine Schmidt and Felix Jascheroff. (Plus soap actors are some of the hardest workers around the company as they have the most demanding work programs). If it's reviews that are so high, it must do something right; Soaps in America appear during the day and have historically always had rock-bottom ratings. Give GZSZ a try! Trust me, it's good!
