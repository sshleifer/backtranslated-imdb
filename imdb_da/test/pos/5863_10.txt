This movie may be one of the most creative works of horror ever. It has everything you could want ... excitement, drama, comedy, confusing subplotter, Native Americans, brain eating ... If you're looking for the very first, all brainwinding movies, look no further. The story of a man bent on revenge. And how better to get it? "I know I will suck their brains!" With great sound effects and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.
