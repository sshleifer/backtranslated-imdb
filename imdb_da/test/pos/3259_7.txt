I had never heard of this movie, but I like Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown, and the story was interesting so I figured I'd give it a shot. I found it very comfortable. Heath Ledger plays a 19-year-old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start making some serious doughs so he goes and asks for work from mobster Bryan Brown. I don't want to go into details, but it goes very badly for Ledger and comes in big trouble with Bryan Brown. From their on the movie, it just gets better and better, with a scene involving Ledger in conjunction with a couple of bank robbers. And let's not forget the beautiful Rose Byrne who plays Ledger's love interest. I would definitely recommend this movie.
