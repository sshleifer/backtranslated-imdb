Just watched this on DVD three times - When the "normal" way once with the scenes in sequence (in this doozy of a movie noir, the beginning, middle and end of the story coincide), and once with the director's comment runs . Absolutely amazing. A bare-eyed story that was told with more flair, energy and substance than most major budget-overriding features released today. <br /> <br /> I think this is an even more successful movie than the subsequent Memento, which initially showed me to Nolan. Can't wait to see what he's doing with a bigger budget (and bigger box-office stars) in his next movie, Insomnia.
