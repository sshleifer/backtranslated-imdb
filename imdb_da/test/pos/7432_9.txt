I'm an avid ff7 fan, for example I have the game so sell it (bad mistake), but then buy it again (good mistake ... erm) <br /> <br /> anyway, yes, this movie is very good , the games are very cool, music very good and cgi you can't fall. Only thing disappointing with the movie, I felt was the lack of other signage, it was almost all cloud, which though is a great character, you can't beat a cid and barret. <br /> <br /> but in spite of that the movie was great in my opinion and one should see. <br /> <br /> All in all, an amazing movie will give it 9/10 <br /> <br /> squaresoft, make more movies like this, and you'll be worshiped more than you already are! !!!
