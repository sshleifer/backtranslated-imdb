I loved that the atmosphere was light and airy. I loved that the protagonist wanted guarantees for his future, and that his roommate puts him "straight" of all people. I loved that they tackled the dynamics of how the members of the men's group treated each other, considering that this was directed by a lesbian, the whole theme of masculinity was put out there, ridiculed, dissected and asked. What does a man do? What do you do right, gay or bisexual? You are not really sure if our main character has decided who he really wants; he is currently living and throwing caution against the wind. These and other reasons make me like this movie.
