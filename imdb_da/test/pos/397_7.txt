One of the more unclear by Anthony Mann's Westerns, The Last Frontier, was also his only cavalry Western (except for a short episode in Winchester '73), although he obviously focuses on the outsiders and internal conflicts rather than offering a fortified festival of companionship and common ideals. Not seen in his beloved high country, but in the foot and forests it is a much more cynical view of the border, in many ways his Fort Apache without pleasing the legend: this outpost consists of misfits, failures, cowards and the odd competent officer ignored by his superior, poorly led, while civil war prioritizes and all the best the army has to offer. Victor Mature and James Whitmore are the free stairs that find civilization creeping up on them as they are relieved of their skins and pack horses by a local tribe disturbed by the extraction of cavalry in their territory. Instead of blaming the Indians for their losses, they decide to be the army's fault to build the fort and decide to demand compensation from them and end up joining their ranks as scouts instead. But in spite of Guy Madison's best and competent actress to bring fashion into the 19th century and enable him to wear the uniform, Robert Preston's humble colonel arrives to avenge himself on the tribe that drove him out of his own outpost ?? and matures clumsy persecution with Colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft, too much of an empty slate here to do much with the role of a woman tired of being rescued by men who think they know best for her )? Soon, things go into much darker territory. It is not long before some of the soldiers are planning to kill each other, both sides are trying to go their subordinates to do the deed for them: a little wondering that at some point mature throws the blue coat, he has long sought in disgust and screaming "I would have dead for this, but it's nothing but a dirty crazy blue rag! "Today's Stallone, Mature was one of the actors who could surprise you with the weird excellence here and there when it fits right and right director . This is not one of his better days despite having his most complex part, perversely enough as a simple man ?? Well-meaning but intoxicated, violent, uneducated and with a pristine, almost childish desire for life, the part seems to be designed with Burt Lancaster in mind with some striking similarities to his character in The Kentuckian. But Robert Preston's Ahab-like Colonel is clearly the best role determined to revive the career he destroyed in a single catastrophic suicide bombing of the civil war by launching another meaningless suicide campaign against the tribe that added another humiliation to the list that keeps him out of sight and out of the mind of the advertising card. In his occupation to redeem his career, he moves further away from any hope of moral redemption, driven so much by his shame over his wife's sympathy as by the advancement of former comrades whom he considers his subordinates. He is out of salvation, but there is still a recognizable person in there and one not completely without a sense of integrity ?? Does he really admire Madison's courage in making an involuntary attempt to get Preston's orders disproved by their superiors? Fat crooked, though it is. As its hero, the film is a bit rough around the edges (and boasts one of the most surreal and creepy titles of any Western), but it only tends to make it more interesting and there are plenty of Mann's typically elegant camera movements and plays on perspective, while the border setting is convincingly hard and primitive. Unfortunately, the shortcomings of the early CinemaScope lenses are very evident in Columbia's DVD, with the image often dark (2.55: 1 CinemaScope required a huge amount of additional lighting and early Scope movies show a lot of trials and bugs) and the grain.
