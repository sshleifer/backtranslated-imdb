Another "must have" movie. Henry Brandon is a favorite! I was so surprised when I learned years ago that he was from Germany because he sounds and looks so typically American! And wasn't he great in "The Searchers" as Chief Scar ?? !! Another of my favorites I have it and watch it over & again. Now, if I could add this to my collection, it would make my day! This is a great wildlife story and movie for all ages. The landscape is so beautiful and the situation of endangered snow leopards is told with such great feelings that it will spark the interest in endangered species in some, especially children. If I could, I'd give a copy for all my grands & great grands!
