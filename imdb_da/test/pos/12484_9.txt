Clouzot followed Le Corbeau, where no one knew who was in the poison, so everyone was suspected, with another masterpiece, Quai des Orfevres four years later, knowing from the beginning (or do we believe) what is known. Topbilled Louis Jouvet does not appear for forty minutes when Clouzot has established a rich environment of Music Hall, music publishers, etc. And a fine molded colorful characters; Angela Lansbury lookalike (Lansbury appeared in Woman of Paris that year) Suzy Delair scores as chanteuse whose desire to improve her party inspires her husband / accompanist Bernard Blier's jealousy that follows her into an older letch home to find he's already death. From here, things go seriously wrong, his car is stolen before leaving the premises, so his preset alibi is out of the window, while meanwhile, unknown to him allowing his wife to murder the photographer's neighbor, creating a lesbian in love with her who volunteers To return to the crime scene and retrieve Delair's scarf and as long as she is there, thought-provoking her prints of the murder weapon, a champagne bottle. At this point, the investigator Jouvet is involved, and from then on the case is to keep the plates spinning in the air. Clouzot's production was relatively small, but pretty much everything that Spencer Tracey said in another context, "cherce", with Le Salaire de peur and Les Diaboliques still coming. In short this is a must for French cinema buffs.
