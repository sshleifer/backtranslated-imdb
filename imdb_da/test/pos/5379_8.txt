This is a spooky understated gem with chilling performances and a fantastic finale! All the characters are good and the story was amazing, plus I thought the end was really cool! The reason was great and it never bored me, plus while the child's actors were bad, they gave me the cribs! This happened to be on the room channel a while ago, so I decided to check it out and lose it, I read some good reviews from other horror fans, I have to agree with them, it is very scary and exciting plus Strother Martin , was amazing in his role as Satan worships. It has lots of creepy atmosphere and it keeps you guessing all the way through plus all the characters were very sympathetic and you really start to mess with Ben and his family!. It has lots of disruptive moments and the movie shocked me at times, plus it's extremely well done on a low budget! This is a spooky understated gem, with chilling performances and a fantastic finale!, I highly recommend this one !! The direction is very good!. Bernard McEveety does a very good job here, with a good camera work, creating a lot of spooky atmosphere and keeping the movie at a very fast pace! Ther is a little bit of blood and gore. We get a cut bone, lots of bloody corpses, bloody slit neck, cutting and dicing, decapitation and an impaling. The acting is excellent!. Strother Martin is fantastic here! As Satan worships, he is extremely scary, very convincing, was quite chilling, was extremely intense, seemed to enjoy himself and did just a great job in general! Charles Bateman is great as a father, he was very caring, very sympathetic and gave a great show! I liked him very much. L.Q. Jones is great as the sheriff, he was fun, on top of things, so very young, had a cold sign and did just a great job in general! Ahna Capri is good as a girlfriend and did what she had to do quite well. Charles Robinson uttered himself as a priest and convinced me not a little! And that was ridiculously laughing at him. Geri Reischl is actually decent as the daughter, she was a little sympathetic, and only got on my nerves a few times, I liked her. Alvy Moore was goofy, but very sympathetic in his role as Tobey I dug him! The rest of the throw is doing well. Overall I highly recommend it!. *** 1/2 out of 5
