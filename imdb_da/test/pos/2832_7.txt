On the one hand, it wants this to be a better movie, but it probably flashes with intense power to make it a value. Peck made this film in the same period he made The Gunfighter before he apparently decided to be a monument rather than an actor. A shame! He was a fine actor, quite willing to tackle characters that were not very sympathetic and to make them very good. The character he plays here is driven and, when necessary, ruthless. On the basis of the mission, the character has been awarded, and the "men" with whom they do so are crucial to these characteristics. <br /> <br /> Without being a spoiler, think of this movie as an early, gritty example of The Dirty Dozen genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this movie is a bit ham but it is atmospheric and intense and certainly tells a story that is worth telling. It includes good work by all the character players, and even Barbara Payton becomes a credible performance. <br /> <br /> This is not often shown on TV, so your local video store can be the only place to find a copy. Continue! Spend an evening there. It's worth your time!
