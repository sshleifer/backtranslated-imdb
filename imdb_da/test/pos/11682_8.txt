Let me start by saying first that I have been a punk fan most of my life. I've always had a lack of respect for the LA scene in the early 80s, as Decline of Western Civilization documents, with the exception of X and Black Flag, are more of New York and English punk guy. After I saw this movie completely changed. The people shown can look like a bunch of idiotic, stretchy children who think they might do something beyond street-cree through their lifestyle, but it's a great show of hedonism at its best, coupled with a fun , high rock n roll. One of the best scenes, and in fact most insightful, is interviewed by Claude Bessy of Catholic discipline or 'Kick-Boy' whom he knew for Slash magazine readers. Originally from France, he ranks about punk as a dirty old Frenchman and traces the viewers to many aspects of punk or DIY, attitude to music, politics and life in general. Darby Crash of the Germs comes off as a complete idiot most of the time, but Germ's performance by Manimal is pretty decent, complete with a young Pat Smear. Black Flags performance with Chavo Pederast on vocals (it was filmed a few years before Henry Rollins joined the band) is decent, and X and FEAR provide the best performances in the movie. Watch out for interviews with the young punk children. You hear some of the funniest things you've ever heard in a documentary. Highly recommended.
