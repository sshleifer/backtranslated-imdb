Lubitsch's Touch is more than ever in this movie. Humor anytime and very subtle. The reason is simple, but it has been estimated by the director. The movie cut is very smart and adds to the comic book. A real piece of comedy that doesn't get so old for a XXI century spectator. The character is well-acted by Gary Cooper and especially Claudette Colbert so clever and believes in this poor Micheal in the movie. She avoids all traps from her husband and turns the situation into her favor, very fun. And no problem with Lubitsch, there is always a happy end. A movie for men with confidence with women. Don't let your girlfriend watch this movie ...
