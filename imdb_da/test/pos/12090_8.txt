A European musician and composer sets out to capture the musical diversity in Istanbul. A lover of experimental sound, Alexander Hacke (of the German avant-garde band Einstürzende Neubauten) strikes in the streets of Istanbul with his mobile recording studio and "magic mike" to bring together an inspired portrait of Turkish music. His journey leads to the discovery of a broad spectrum ranging from modern electronic, rock and hip-hop to classic "arabesque". As he walks through this seductive world, Alex gathers impressions and traces of artists such as neo-psychedelic band Baba Zula, fusion DJs Orient Expressions, rock groups Duman and Replicas, Maverick rocker Erkin Koray, Ceza (Turkey's response to Public Enemy), Breakdance artists Istanbul Style Breakers, digital dervish Mercan Dede, the famous clarinetist Selim Sesler, Canadian folk singer Brenna MacCrimmon, street performers Siyasiyabend, Kurdish singer Aynur, "Elvis of Arabesque" Orhan Gencebay and legendary divas Müzeyyen Senar and Sezen Aksu.
