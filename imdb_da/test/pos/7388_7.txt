Dark Harbor is a moody little outing in scary emotional waters that runs extremely deep. It is basically a 3-character piece with a finely crafted performance of the always great Rickman, with Polly Walker and Norman Reedus (also excellent) forming the other two sides of this weird triangle. A perfect late-night cable film, with a start-up surprise.
