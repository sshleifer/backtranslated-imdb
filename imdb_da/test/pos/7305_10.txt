I was very moved by the gentle power of this movie and the mood it created. I think it should have received a lot more credit than it did. I agree that Michelle Pfeiffer should have been nominated, but I think all performances were excellent and that Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange portrayed the sister's strong affinity and conflicts with great emotional depth and sensitivity. Although I didn't read the book, I found the modern King Lear concept very cool. I will definitely never look at the game in the same way again!
