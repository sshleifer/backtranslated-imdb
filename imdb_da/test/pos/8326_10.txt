When Jurassic Park first came out, it was revolutionary in movie footage and special effects. For the first time people went cold to a dinosaur movie and convinced that they were looking at real dinosaurs brought to life. But while some dinosaurs were almost perfect examples of what the actual creatures might have been like (T.Rex, Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, etc.) some were modified to fit the movie (Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus) and the movie now took place on a tropical island, where they were not in their natural habitat. Walking with dinosaurs shows us the real animals in their real-life habitats all those millions of years ago. The amount of detail and scientific information used in this is great. Now we can see sights like a nasty Triassic Desert, a whole herd of Diplodocus, an Icthyosaur birth, a MASSIVE sea monster, a pterosaur's eye, the dinosaurs bloom in the South Pole, two Torosaurus lock horns, T.Rex roaring on the camera and the effect of the comet, who spelled their death. These dinosaurs go, run, feed, fight, breed, hunt and swim. But the series also reveals the other creatures with which they shared the world. Two episodes are primarily focused on two different kinds of animals, the flying pterosaurs and the marine reptiles that lived under the waves. The location and stage are spectacular and look so much more unique when a CG Dino goes on the screen. And as far as CGI and animatronics are concerned, the CGI dinosaurs' movements look completely natural, the colors are bright and vibrant, and the crews have taken careful steps to ensure that the CG animals interact with their surroundings in a way that an actual creature would by splashing the water, brushing with bushes, kicking dust and molding shadows on the ground. Certainly, CG is not perfect with a few short cases where the animals look too computer-like, but the rest of the time it looks unreliable. The dolls are bad in some cases, but it has its moments especially the stage with Cynodonts in the first episode. Kenneth Branagh's story is quite good and also gives us important bits of information and drama at the same time. But of course, the true pleasure of seeing a living dinosaur is doing what they did years ago and also seeing some really sweet moments with Cynodont (mammal / reptile hybrid) puppies, Sauropodlets (baby Diplodocus) and T.Rex chickens (yes even T .Exex can be cute) and reminds us that nature can be brutal and even more so back then. All this adds up to a prehistoric natural masterpiece that lets you see a true dinosaur and take your breath away from the safety of your living room. If you like nature, dinosaurs, informative learning, amazing visuals or just to get a really good view and be entertained, then dinosaurs are definitely for you. Easily recommended.
