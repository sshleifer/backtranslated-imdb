Family Guy is the best show on TV. EVER. It has achieved good things that no other animated sitcom or any show has even come close to reaching. <br /> <br /> With regard to animated sitcoms, this era should be referred to as "The Era of Animated Sitcoms" because there are so many of them and almost all of them are conceivable being released on DVD. There are some good ones (ie South Park, Futurama and The Simpsons). Each animated sitcom has its own style / technique to create humor. For example, Futurama is fun because it always comments or deals with what has just happened with a touch of humor. The Simpsons is also a great show because it uses the same comic technique and style that Futurama does, but The Simpsons deserve the credit for it as it was on the airway before Futurama and still in the air using the technique. South Park, in my opinion, is the funniest show next to Family Guy, because it uses a clever mix of vulgarity and sadness, as it is the technique of creating humor. But enough about other animated shows. Let me tell you what makes Family Guy so much fun. Family Guy uses a comic style that no other show has ever used before. It uses a technique to have flashbacks occur after each joke. This not only reinforces the joke, but it seems more fun. It also moves at a very fast pace. These two criteria make it the funniest show on television. You must see the show to believe it, but when you see it, you will probably agree. (FYI, the two funniest moments at Family Guy were: 1) 5 minute chicken fight in "Da Boom" and 2) Dick van Dyke spoofed in "Holy Crap.") Also in my mind, Family Guy is a very modest show because others Shows create humor by becoming familiar with their shticks / routines and characters, most Family Guys jokes are based on the silliness of current events and pop culture. This also shows that Family Guy is intelligent, besides being modest, because it reveals that the show has insight. And this technique is extremely effective because they relate their pop culture references to the particular plot of the episode they are in. Family Guy can be enjoyed by all ages because while younger children may not understand pop culture references, they will be amused by the fun, Stupid antics of the characters, especially Peter. However, the show is a little more vulgar than The Simpsons and Futurama, but it's less vulgar than South Park. So in the form of vulgarity, Family Guy would go somewhere in the middle when connected to the above shows, but it would rank # 1 in terms of humor and intelligence !! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was canceled last year, not because it wasn't popular, but because FOX continued to change that time slot so no one knew when it was on. Fortunately, we have the DVD sets (which, by the way, sell like crazy) and restore Cartoon Network's Adult Swim available to us.
