Right there. Good, entertaining and precise era feeling for most scenes. Enough personality variations to cover the real people around these days without the distractions of the stories from the exceptions. The credits show Peralta from Mar Vista, California .. up the hill from Venice and south of Malibu. I stayed there in Heartbreak Hotel Days, before Beachboys, in order to surf child Bob Cooper up on Wasatch Avenue, where the street was used to burn surfboards that didn't work. Old skatekey skatewheels were used on plywood cutouts to roll down the pavement waves. Things were different every succeeding decade, when the innocence of the full innocence broke into the Warmth of the Sun's white-water freedom and blossoming of the electrical frenzy and then into the unusual innovative playtime and inventive evolutionary madness of the strange seventies. The movie gives you a piece of that kind of magical moment in time; in a place where the imaginary wave was real .. the source of culturally significant influences. And BTW, which is another movie that has a similar American street edginess to it, and has the same true unique goodness with laid-back justice that helps refine the elusive eternal sense of cool. "Two Lane Blacktop" (with one of the best examples of freesould's attitude in West Coast California history .. Dennis Wilson). As Monte Hellman did with one, thank you SP for being right there with this one. GWR
