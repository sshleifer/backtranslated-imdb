British noble Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene) decides to seek out his two best friends who have disappeared after visiting Count Karl von Bruno (Stephen MaNally), a vicious and powerful man living in Black Castle. Sir Burton travels undercover with another identity as he fought Count Count Bruno in Africa with his two missing friends, and the counter lost an eye in a fight. When he enters the castle, he is invited to hunt in the Black Forest around the castle with the census while looking for evidence that the counter has killed his friends. Later, he and Countess's wife Countess Elga von Bruno (Rita Corday) fall in love with each other and with the support of Dr. Meissen (Boris Karloff) is trying Sir Burton and Countess to escape from the clutches of Count von Bruno. "The Black Castle" is an excellent movie from a romantic time of action, romance, mystery and even horror. The story is poignant and is a good entertainment for any audience. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Castelo do Pavor" ("The Fear Castle")
