Farscape completely rules! In my opinion, it is very close to Babylon five, although there are only 7 main characters in the series (spaceship included). The mood is excellent and the authors manage to keep the show interesting even though just about everything happens on the ship. What I really love and appreciate in Farscpae is that they do not use CGI for the alien sign or if they do, it is unnoticeable. They use the lovable, crappy rubber animatronic dolls, similar to those used in the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> If you don't already have Farscape, you're sure to look at it.
