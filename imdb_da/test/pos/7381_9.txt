... this movie music set pieces suffer from dark sound (at least as shown on the insufficient equipment at both Seattle and Maine film festivals) and murkier plotting, while Rickman suffers from an American accent, old tennis shoes and baggy sweats. Nonetheless, he has moments of stellar scenery, and the film offers spooky ambiguity from Norman Reedus, the beautiful Polly Walker, and a surprise ending (telescopic to frequent movie players), while getting a beautiful look at both Maine and Rickman. Due to video release (after a cable vent) in March. Not to miss any Rickman fan. Ignore the amanita hooey.
