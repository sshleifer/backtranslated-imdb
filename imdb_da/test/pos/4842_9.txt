Being relatively young, I didn't know how bad anti-Semitism was in Brooklyn, where my family was originally. This movie scared me completely. I have seen many films about prejudice, racism and anti-Semitism, but it seemed to hit me harder than most. This was definitely one of the best indie movies I've ever seen ... I had to travel 45 minutes to see it and it was worth it. Almost everything about the movie was amazing. Sometimes it was a bit slow, but it didn't really bother me because the movie was very atmospheric. It took place in the 40s and it really seemed like it was the 40s. The action was great ... William H. Macy was as always wonderful, so was Laura Dern, and I was pleasantly surprised at Meatloaf's performance and played the evil anti-Semitic neighbor. <br /> <br /> 9/10
