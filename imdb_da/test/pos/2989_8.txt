I can hardly even remember what DECADE I saw this movie. That's when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started to see it as a sennat movie sometime in the middle to early 80's, and so much of it has been with me since then. See other comments, I had no idea that it was shown at theaters or that someone else was new. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone. <br /> <br /> But half-life later I still remember much of the movie I saw late in the evening long ago. I think the charactor's innocence, their situation, their mutual affection over a long period of time, left a long-term imprint of reasons that I do not fully understand. Maybe it's because I was a teenager at the time I saw it, and it somehow touched me ..... I really don't know! I also really wanted to know what would happen when the film's ending happened. Oh, the fear !! <br /> <br /> I haven't seen it before, or since, but I'd love to. I keep an informal look at it, but now I doubt that it will be shown and it seems to have faded into oblivion. But I would certainly miss it in the TV guide, even though it didn't come up. Pssttt !!! <br /> <br /> Reading reviews here has renewed my interest. If anyone knows about its availability in Australia, send me at any time and let me know. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Sean Bury ... nice to see you make the comments here. I've watched your movie story and noticed your last look in a James Bond movie. What are you today? Oh, and do you have a copy of the movie? Cheers !!!
