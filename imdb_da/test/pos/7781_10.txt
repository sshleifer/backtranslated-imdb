This is my favorite love story, it has every element that a good love story must have. Poetry, jazz, friendships up and down in a relationship. Finally, a film showing positive aspects of the black community. Larenz Tate was great, I can't see anyone else playing the role of Darius. He recited this poem as if he had written it himself and meant every word. I own this movie, and if I had the time I wanted to see it every day, it always made me feel better, and that's what a good movie should do. Also, the character Savon could not have been better at dealing with the subject of marriage. We all want to find a Darius out there, but most of us just settled down to watch this movie. My vote is 10/10
