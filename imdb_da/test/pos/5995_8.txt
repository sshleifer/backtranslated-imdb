<br /> <br /> This movie has some really impressive action scenes. Humor and action mix well, even if the film's intensity does not stick to the end. The last scene is a small anti-climax in terms of action quality and amazing explosiveness of the scenes prior to it. The mood doesn't seem to be as ridiculously lumpy as in many other Hong Kong movies, and this movie is quite different from most American action comedies in recent years. Lau Ching-Wan acts as a typical, intuitive policeman who is scolded by invalid orders from incompetent police officers. The film's dialectic is based on the superhuman coolness and recklessness of the drug band and humiliates the police force while providing a serious dose of lead poisoning with a number of machine guns. Leaving lots of corpse in it's wake. Yu Rong-Guang is particularly impressive as an ultra-light, ruthless gangster in this Woo-like piece of action, where the hard guy is really deadly.
