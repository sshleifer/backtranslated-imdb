For me, Tempest and its characters (which I think they admire) are like old friends. Ever since I first began to experience the game through acting classes (I played Ferdinand), I immediately found myself trapped in the amazing world that Shakespeare created. I can obviously remember a student who decided not to play Ferdinand after all, and then I took the stage and had the honor of playing opposite an excellent Miranda. One of the virtues that a great friend has is that you can never fully know them - there is always something you can discover about their character. A film production of the highest quality is thus like a visit to an old friend, dear to one's heart: each visit presents a new perspective on the memory we had of the work. With Prospero's Books, the ritual and elegance of the game was emphasized, the artificial exploding art of art. Here we see a vision as esoteric mystery, with lovingly designed interiors full of light and chalk diagrams on floors, more Aleister Crowley than Naples nobleman. It also made me reconsider - why was Prospero thrown out of Naples? His magic power is so tangible in this production that one wonders whether it was only politics that condemned Prospero to exile, but rather his difference from his peers. So in the real world he suffered. Was thrown out, powerless to change the wrong to the right. All the bad guys in this game, whether they realize it or not, are acting in a way to create a more painful hell in a world - it is always in the interests of oppressors to make life on Earth closer to hell. But Prospero manages to bring these earthly villains into his island, rich where he has (absolute) dominion. <br/> <br /> Shakespeare brings his audience to the theater, the kingdom where Shakespeare dictates the events, the words, the outcomes. Shakespeare is, of course, Prospero - but what this film adaptation does really honors is that the text is making Prospero so sympathetic for such a reason despite being surrounded by the society that calls irrational (astrological texts, alchemical symbols , magic charts, etc.). Is it more rational to be a man of the cloth and the murder, or to be heretics and work for the right to the clock? Prospero is a heretic because he refrains from his magic is not because the books will lose their value in Naples, but because they are no longer needed - the world itself - has become the magic of books. <br /> <br /> In Hamlet, Hamlet presents a game to his peers. The play accuses his colleagues of gathering against others for their own progress. The reaction of the audience varies: While Ophelia is confused, Claudius responds with stunned shock. This happens within the drama, and then Shakespeare has performed this game for the men of his time. Should Shakespeare Look After Their Reactions? In the storm, Prospero lives the game he constructs and we live it with him. How do we react? Do you react with simple joy to the happy ending? Are you disturbed and shocked by the inferiority of this production, which is perfectly appropriate in view of the source material? Are you sorry about the fact that this little life, the play, is rounded off with a sleep, as transient as it is eternal? The tragedy is that Shakespeare creates a paradise for ground and hope for the life of mankind on Earth, but man is weak and unwilling to realize it in favor of fighting small battles. We have Claudiuses. <br /> <br /> As a good friend, this movie is not without its faults. I disagree with the choice of painting some scenes entirely in blue. Maritime dance is rather tangential. But in the heart this is really The Tempest, and one of its many faces.
