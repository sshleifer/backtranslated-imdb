I can't believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all of you eighties in horror and I will certainly not join all my fellow reviewers here by saying that 'Bloody Birthday' is horrible view. On the contrary, I enjoyed it a lot and I was pleasantly surprised by the brilliant and surprising terms it offers. You should not just refer to this movie as "another 80's slasher" because the victims here are quite unlikely and that is also the killers. We are introduced to three cherubic-looking youths, all of whom were born during a solar eclipse. Currently, they were delivered, the planet Saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon, and therefore the children are numb and seemingly without conscience. This really starts to show up around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spree. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, these things are incredibly long-term and even slightly offensive, but seriously who cares? Unlike many other horror films from this period, it at least tries to bring something original and imaginative. For once, the children's play is good, and the whole movie has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music. The murder sequences are gloomy and tense, and it is always scary to see them being engaged by English faces. I don't know who hired the 3 kids, but they did a good job. Especially the girl and the child with glasses are very memorable. The grim images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights, such as 'The Dead Village', 'The Bad Seed' and 'The Dead Children'. This movie is not nearly as memorable as these milestones, but very fun, and not a scare law will regret seeing this. <br /> <br /> Blood Day was written and directed by Ed Hunt. Not particularly the greatest genius in the cinema, but a pleasantly horrible trap, which also brought us immensely entertaining cheese parties such as 'Brain' and 'Starship Invasions'. If all this is not enough to convince you yet, Bloody Birthday has a lot of nudity. And not just any nudity, but a topless dance act by MTV-VJ Julie Brown. Oh, and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by Joe Penny, later the star of the television series 'Jake and Fatman'. Check it out !!
