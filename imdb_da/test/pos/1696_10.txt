Of course I think it was a great movie. I recognized several people that I didn't see under the film as well. I was the one who played the guard about an hour into the film in the death tube, asking for a candle for a cigarette. I've also changed this scene. They had originally made it into the courtyard and straightened out the inmate and turned him around and walked him out. The director said, "It takes a long time, what would you do Gower." I said, "We must go in and jaw our arms and pull him out backwards. That way your camera can stay on his face when we take him off." I also lived in the same prison as a young child, since my father was the safety assistant's safety assistant. I am also a current employee with the Tennessee Deaprtment of Corrections as Supervisor at Riverbend Maximum Security Institution. Although much of the movie was a joke, the part I was in was real enough. Also in the bar scene, the dancer danced high in the air and left the stage an actual stripper I use to work with on a club called "The Classic Cat".
