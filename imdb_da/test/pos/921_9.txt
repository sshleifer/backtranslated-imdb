This is a classic sequel to Bleu, the same excellent movie, with Juliet Binouche as the star. In addition, she is a como look here, in Rouge, just a moment at the end. But this movie, really red and very cute though very sad, is a real winner. The main hero played by ever great Irene Jakob is a successful photo model. She leads a full and active life, only dark of her traumatic relationship with her odd friend Mike, who is in England. By a lucky chance she will be friendly with the old judge who spends time listening to his telephone conversations about his neighbors. History begins to weave even further, and we see him in court and is almost universally condemned for his pastime. She is the only one who feels sympathy for him, for his sweet dogs Rita and her puppies and for all the people who surround them. We are also witnessing the breakup of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady, and their disgrace is also driven by this phone scandal ... But the movie is not about this itself. It's mostly about loneliness and deep shifts between people, far and near. When she sails to England on a ferry, with the lawyer as a chance with passengers, as well as the formerly named Binoche, starring in Bleu, the ship sinks and we see the dismayed look of the judges as he sees the news trying to guess if she survived. She did, and we still feel very heavy. Mr. Kislowski managed to draw a great, subtle story of loneliness, misunderstanding, secrets and pain. Deep, dark personal pain in those who are lost and lonely. Brilliant movie.
