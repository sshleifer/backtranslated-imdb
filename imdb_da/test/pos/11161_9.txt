In complete contrast to the previous correspondent here, I thought the Shop Munich (as it was billed when it was shown with English subtitles here in London at the German Film Festival in November 2007), very fun, very well-acted and well written. <Br /> <br /> Designing a 100-minute movie that consists solely and relentlessly of talking heads is completely unpleasant. But I think Ralf Westhoff succeeded in wit and Ã©lan. No standard cinematic devices, such as Follows a character's soul-barring statement with some meditative less-seventh chord music and long-range natural scenes. But when someone said something that revealed their souls - well, we were driven by the man with the timer for another superficial introduction. That is, of course, the point: the fast tickbox superficiality of thirtysomething urbanites, where everything is down to a quick question and answer. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most movies are so clumsy and stupid that we English are ready to laugh at any vaguely intelligent and unconscious cinema, but I promise you that at the night of the Foreclosure (Curzon Cinema, Sunday 25 November 2007) followed the entire audience with laughter most of the way through. So I wasn't the only guffawing! My boyfriend (who speaks German and has lived in Munich) thought it was fun. I (who doesn't speak German and haven't been to Munich I think) thought it was fun. I would recommend the Shoppen (Munich) to anyone (especially couple ...) looking for a smart, witty, original, clever movie about the superficiality of modern relationships and the confusion of the generation who feel they have missed of the happy note: In the English subtitle view in London, the subtitles (which were very good) were shown completely under the slightly reduced image, not inside it. I thought it was a good thing.
