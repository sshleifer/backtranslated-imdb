I am surprised by the issues and problems this documentary has raised in the reviews here, especially because they are really interesting questions. Certainly, those who could best counter that would be the film's decision makers themselves. Nevertheless, I think I can shed some light on something I think has been overlooked, which in my opinion is the purpose of the movie, what it is about and what it is trying to convey. What is its message after all? With the risk of pointing it out quite obviously, I begin to say the filmmakers have an intention. They try to tell a story, extract meaning from it, and get a point across. With this in mind, we can shoot down many of the criticized points, especially those involving what people expected as opposed to what the filmmakers were really trying to show. Reasons and consequences of violence? The movie is not about it. Isn't the "enlightening non-Brazilian audience" about the Brazilian favelas' problem? Well, who would that? Is AfroReggae this or that and supported by whom? It does not matter in this context. Not enough women in the movie to your liking? It is not about equality or the feminist cause. Every little detail about Anderson's life, mother, son, family and all aspects and work of the AfroReggae movement? Well, don't be so fussy because it doesn't matter. There is only a long time a story can have before it can't become a movie anymore. If the authors were to show everything everyone expects, they have to make a 6 month TV show instead. If you expect all that, you approach the movie the wrong way. <br /> <br /> The movie is actually about two people who started a movement. Two people full of ideals. Two people who dare to change. Two people are trying to do something about all the wrongdoing around them. Individuals who went to the bottom and wanted to get up again. It's about finding purpose in life, drawing inspiration from misery, changing destiny and becoming something other than what they were meant to be - criminals and drug dealers for that matter. It is about achievement and hope and not about the violent reality of violence in Rio de Janeiro, although it is an integral part of the film, that is what the characters are always surrounded by. Unexpectedly and not without reason, the film ends much more on Anderson's course through difficulties in life. This is because they were confronted with Anderson's accident while shooting the movie. I'm not sure of this, but they might even have seriously considered ending the movie right there and leaving all the effort that was spent. But Anderson wanted to continue. And then they risk losing having a movie with a bit of identity crisis, considering the sudden change of course, but winning on showing someone to overcome such a devastating event. It is very clear who is watching the movie begin on AfroReggae and win over Anderson. It is very unique in this sense (the shift of history line). Perhaps their only sin cannot make it clear in advance, which can initially give rise to expectations that will be superfluous. <br /> <br /> As for Anderson's significance or ordinariness, I would say that not everyone will change the whole world, end all violence, feed all the hungry, be like Mahatma Ghandi, be as known as Mother Teresa or who else well-known personalities are. It is much easier to relate to and draw inspiration from someone who is like everyone else who is trying to transform their own hard life, raise problematic children, deal with permanent injuries or illnesses, and even manage to pay the bills by the end of the month. To understand the movie you are about to see, it's about leaving a past with drug and crime involvement, making up for it and trying to persuade others not to go down the same troublesome path. Although you can criticize the way they chose to do it is effective and doubt the ideology of the method, you cannot deny their intentions. <br /> <br /> Also, the notion that Anderson is special or a select one may have something to do with the fact that the filmmakers became very involved in the life of the characters they portrayed. As much as making friends with them. There is no way it would not thin the whole movie with a more favorable light on Anderson. If a dear friend gets paralyzed in an accident, it's not just a fact you make a big deal out of it. And that's not necessarily bad. It is not much that they treat him as "a chosen", as much as they go in great lengths, trying to show him as a seed of transformation and source of inspiration. In conclusion, one should not see this documentary for the scenarios of the reality of poverty and crime it contains, see it for much more, an inspirational story. <br /> <br /> Nike-Ad-like? Seems just wrong and professionally made for me and does not affect or impair the film's intentions. Romanticized? Wondering about its credentials as a documentary if you want to, but why not when it is to cause reaction and inspire? Not trying to improve people's lives through music and dance - the essence of what the topics are trying to do - does romanticizing its own reality? Excuse me, but showing just the common facts is what reporters do and you can watch it on television every night. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to be the movie maker, I would also be my first movie.
