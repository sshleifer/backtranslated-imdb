Well, the movie turned out much better than expected. It's not boring, and it's not unoriginal. It's really not a stupid romantic comedy. The situations in which the characters settle are very unusual, of course we are still talking about a movie, but the main characters are actually plausible. Of course, Donald is an exaggeration, but he's just a farmer in the movie, a means of proving something. The end is not one of those ridiculously happy, always the same, moral-containing pieces of crap you can usually see in genre films. I really liked it and I'm hard to please when it comes to this particular movie genre. It's worth looking at. Moreover, it is better directed than other movies, the story line always stands up, the characters themselves stand up. And they do not experience this miraculous change, and love is not revealed to them as a holy god given artifact, yada, yada. At the end of it, you see all of yourself through everything, the movie makes you feel something, you can even learn a thing or two. It is not the usual hope-producing, tissue moisture system. It's a good movie, not a consolation prize for towering women around the world.
