The story of Tom Garner opens with his great funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks told by his faithful lifetime friend Henry. Henry and his wife debate whether Tom was a great man and a genius or a completely worthless villain. The film is beautifully written, acted and directed, and I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Tom was the fabulous rich and successful owner of a large railroad that dominates his board and his competition, terrorizing his employees, slaughter strikers. Tom's ambitious wife Sally was responsible for all Tom's success. When he met her, he was illiterate and completely satisfied with his work as a trackwalker for the railway. Sally teaches him to read and take over his trackwalker job while Tom goes to school. He begins to rise one step at a time through the railway hierarchy until eventually he takes over as president. <br /> <br /> But as Tom becomes a business magazine, his marriage to Sally gradually breaks down. His pampered son despises him, and he deals with a much younger woman (the appropriate name Eve), with foreseeable disastrous consequences. In his business life, Tom is a total success; In his personal life, a catastrophic failure. Like the Hearst figure in Citizen Kane, Tom symbolizes the best and the worst of the capitalist system. Spencer Tracy is great in the role of Tom Garner, and the business scene calls with authenticity. Colleen Moore is also excellent as Sally; Both are beautifully aged in the history of generational history. The film was written by Preston Sturges, but is nothing like the scrub comedies that Sturges became known for.
