Let's get the bug from the road right from the top - the movie should have been much longer. Ray Charles was a brilliant, fascinating man, who leads a complex, challenging life. There was simply no way to take care of everything - or even touch it all - in a standard length movie. In light of this, the filmmakers did an admirable (and I'm probably quite agonizing) job of putting together a movie that couldn't tell the whole story, yet managed to present a representative slice of the man and his music. Ray Charles's forces were evident throughout the film, and his weaknesses were neither reinforced nor sugar-coated. We might have wanted another hour to discard his life after 1980, but I suppose it would tend to make the film a tribute, and even if it would have allowed several things to be resolved in the end balance I think it was better as presented. <br /> <br /> Now for the big question: What are the criteria for an Oscar? Wife and I have seen countless films in our year, but we immediately agree that we have never seen a performance similar to Jamie Foxxs. The line between actor and character was not blurred - but it completely disappeared. We had heard a lot of hype before we saw the movie, but it was scary. Foxx was Ray Charles. You didn't see the movie with the feeling that you looked at Foxx doing an excellent job of portraying Ray Charles - you somehow believed or understood you saw Ray Charles himself. I don't know how to put it. We were completely blown away. I admit that we haven't seen all the other performances for an Oscar this year, but that doesn't matter. Foxx took this to a nearer level, which we have never witnessed before and doubt that we can ever see again. I can think of no other movie I've ever seen where a person plays a role so completely and convincingly being the person being portrayed. We greet you, Mr. Foxx. We understand that the awarding of an Oscar has to do with much more than the performance, but whether you win, we want to know that you have done something that is in a class all alone and you should take big pride in your unmatched performance. <br /> <br /> PS The music was of course great. I noticed the wife that if there is a moment in the history of music that I could wish I could have witnessed, it would have been hissing (in Kansas City wasn't it?) What did I say? The movie did a wonderful job with it - just wish I could have been there!
