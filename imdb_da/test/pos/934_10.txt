This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colors trilogy, but also the best of the three and one of the best films from the 90s. There is hardly another movie that so wise and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being. <br /> <br /> Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva, where she works as a model. Although she has a girlfriend, she seems to be pretty lonely. One night she has an accident and wounds a dog and leads her to his owner, a retired juggernaut (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls. Pampered by him she can't go away and they meet again. Two lonely souls meet each other and they become friends and develop a deep love for each other. The story itself is too complex to be told, there is another connection between them in a young man representing both the judge and Valentine's true love, and there is more to their relationship than just friendship. The actors are wonderful, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant develop a deep and authentic friendship. <br /> <br /> The topics have an endless validity, fraternity, not only in contact with each other, but also in respect of the right to privacy. Alarmingly, we seem to loosen this dish more and more, making movies like this even more important than it could have been in 1994. Red is one of the strongest colors that exists that represent inner turmoil, love, anger and passion. Used here as another protagonist, it brings unparalleled depth to the movie. A masterpiece!
