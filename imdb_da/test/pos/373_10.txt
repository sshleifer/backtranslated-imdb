One of Alfred Hitchcock's three greatest films, along with "Psycho" and "The 39 Steps", "Strangers On A Train", is so brilliantly out of control as a merry round in Metcalf, and almost as deadly. It's the kind of movie you have so much fun watching, you can't even feel really guilty of it before you have the time to catch the weather. Top amateur tennis competitor Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets a particularly weird, louche stranger named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train. Thanks to the gossip pages of Bruno about Guy's problems with his non-good wife Miriam and suggesting they do each other a favor: Bruno will kill Miriam and Guy will kill Bruno's father who wants to put Bruno in an institution. Guy laughs it off, but Bruno is not funny, as Guy finds out his danger. It's a good prerequisite for a murder story, and Hitchcock gives "Strangers on a Train" a race for everyone It's worth using Walker in perhaps the greatest achievement in any Hitchcock movie, including Anthony Perkins in "Psycho". While Perkins makes his mark playing close to the grain, Walker, like Anthony, is at home, either crumbling old ladies at a celebrated dinner party or stifling a young woman in an amusement park. What does Bruno do? Many commentators suggest that his apparent homosexuality finds a match in beautiful Guy. Yes, Bruno illuminates the old gay dar, but Guy seems happy enough at love's rebound with socialite Anne Morton (Ruth Roman). Bruno's interest in Guy could just as easily become envious because someone makes a mark in the world while living at home, so Mommy sends his nails. "Oh, I really admire people who do things," Bruno purrs, looks like a cat with a mouse. "You know it must be quite exciting to be so important." <br /> <br /> Later, Bruno calls himself a "bum", exactly enough except for our rooting interest in him, even as he destroys Guy's life with his homicidal interference. It is the ultimate perverted underdog story. There is a sense of integrity about Bruno in his devoted dedication, which orders our respect and which Hitchcock plays so brilliantly. When Bruno flows away from the stage of his great crime, am I the only sick in this world who is actually fond of him? I don't think, but Hitchcock keeps the story on a really enough path to realize how low we've fallen. We don't want Bruno to win, exactly, but we enjoy his Ã©lan as he tries. Everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough to make every shot memorable. Hitchcock always managed at least 2-3 good seen sequences per. Movie; Here you get a score of them alone in the amusement park. ("The 20 Big Shows" neon side at the entrance says and they don't speak.) Script, camera work, a poignant tennis match, Ruth Roman's staggering figure, it's too much grandeur for a movie to contain. Even Granger makes it into his calf-youth stuff here with more risky plausibility than Gregory Peck ever succeeded. <br /> <br /> You can call this a movie-making clinic, but "clinic" sounds too boring. "Strangers On A Train" is good creepy fun all the way through and leaves you a nifty stinger in the tail as you realize you were rooting for the wrong stranger all the time. Heck, I'll take that trip again in a second!
