I have good memories of seeing this when it came out. It is one of the movies that you know is bad even when you are a child, but at that age you overlook the ridiculous play, special effects and plot (so there is a race of big-busted gossips living underground , huh?) And just enjoy the campy monsters for all they are worth.
