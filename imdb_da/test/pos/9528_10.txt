I try to capture this movie every time it appears on TV, which is happily quite often. But I keep forgetting to know it. As it is, I know virtually the script of the heart, but it doesn't stop me with a good cry, it actually adds enough to what I cry by knowing what's coming next. It's such a nice movie - well made, well thrown, good photography. I love it. One of my top ten films.
