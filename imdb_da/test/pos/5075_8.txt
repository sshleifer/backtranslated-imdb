Most of this political thriller presented, as most of the mill movie, a somewhat better development of many of the great characters that were greatly appreciated until the BIG twist and powerful climax reminiscent of phrases experienced in "the silence of the Lamb" or "the sixth sense ". Reese Witherspoon as the distraught wife of the missing Egyptian man and Yigal Naor as the strong armed interrogator offers strong performances. Jake Gyllenhaal is unfortunately entrusted with a more two-dimensional character and has to contend with a stereotypical presentation of the emotionally torn CIA analyst who has been presented many times before in other films. Early on, there is the fine scene with an explosion that looks like a scene at the end of the "Saving Private Ryan", the silent scene that was used so effectively in reflecting a consequence of violence. The script also gives a little more insight into the "enemy" mindset, but does not allow the audience really much understanding, which in turn allows the audience to shy away from stereotypical characterization. The cinematography and the photographing are also somewhat of a downturn, because unlike "Jarhead" or "Blackhawk Down" lacks the sharp, raw visceral presentation that does not really allow the audience to be there in the movie, there is a certain distance that keeps the audience from to realize the intensity of the emotions that appear on the screen. However, at the end, the film is redeemed by giving the audience a targeted look at the complexity of US use of rendering and the possible complications and consequences that may arise during use. Eight out of ten stars.
