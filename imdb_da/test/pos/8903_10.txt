wow! it is even better than expected! The best animated Astérix movie ever! and it feels so good to hear Roger Carel make Astérix's voice again! I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Astérix's comics! but I suggest you go to see the French version because it is probably the best and you hear the original cast! Did you know that Roger Carel has been playing Astérix for nearly forty years? I think he did a fantastic job! and the song from Céline Dion at the end fits well to the final credits! the music is good, the drawings are good, the actors are wonderful ... in one word: a masterpiece! go to see it! You will not regret this!
