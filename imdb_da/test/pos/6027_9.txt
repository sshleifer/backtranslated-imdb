I was lucky enough to see The Last Stop here where I live at the Moving Pictures Film Festival (for those of you who do not know, the Moving Pictures Film Festival is a tour of Canadian-made film in Canada). I was told just before the movie started that it was world premiere and that it was on the brink of getting a US distribution deal that added my excitement. <br /> <br /> I'm a big horror movie fan, and yes, I also love the Scream trilogy. So when I found out that Rose McGowan made a movie of ten little Indians, I knew I was a treat. Rose McGowan was the greatest name actor / actress throughout the festival. <br /> <br /> The best way I can describe it without giving away too much of the plot is that it's not quite like Scream. And it's certainly worth seeing. It is in the middle of a snowstorm (it was filmed in Vancouver, B.C., Canada) on a mountain top motel, adding excitement. Rose McGowan puts a great performance as the girl next door (?!) Along with the rest of the cast. And what happens at the end, yes, all I say is that you never guess the end. Unfortunately, it will probably not make it to the mainstream North American theaters because the only decent money maker in it is Rose McGowan. But if you get the chance to see it, I recommend you do it. And if worse comes worst, there is always video. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 9 out of 10.
