Tomorrow is another day not the sequel to Gone with the Wind, but a lover-on-the-lamb story, and a surprisingly alert and moving too. For a supposed hack referred to the B-minus features as The Devil Thumbs A Ride, Felix Feist proves he is capable of filling his work with unexpected, inventive details. Steve Cochran leaves prison after 18 years to kill his brutal father when he was only 13, and now he is still a preliminary gawky pubescent operating inside a man's hulky frame. Lonesome, he visits a 10-cents-a-dance palace and falls for brass, Ruth Roman grabbed. But the sudden admission of his police-bigwig girlfriend causes the unhappy couple to hit the road and end, like the Jews, in a camp in California migrant workers. <br /> <br /> Novel is the revelation; In her most famous role, as Farley Granger's fianc√© in Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train, she was ill and underutilized. Here, she convincingly modulates from the bottle-nosed taxi dancer to sacrifice wife and mother-to-be (and a brunette to start). Cochran is almost as good, weaving between the suspicion of a wounded child and the explosive reactions of an under-socialized man. And the end, while not convincing, is nevertheless welcome. Along with those living at night and gunfire, tomorrow is another day a redeeming sweetness and warmth that believes its film-noir pedigree.
