It takes a rare movie to get better every time you see it. O brother does it and saw some. The first time I saw it, I must admit that I had never seen anything like it. Then I would see it again, and now I'm up to two digits with this amazing movie, Coen brothers best movie they ever made, with Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy coming in a tight second and third for me. br /> <br /> George Clooney gives his career performance playing Ulysses Everett McGee, a fast-paced, all-escaped escape that really doesn't know much. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are the perfect sidekicks for Clooney, especially Nelson and his depiction of Delmar, a loyal yet uneducated colleague. John Goodman is my favorite piece of character as Big Dan, perfect. It reminds me of his role in Raising Arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. Coenbrother's favorites Holly Hunter and Charles Durning also provide memorable performances. <br /> <br /> Joel and Ethan Coen are the masters of their trade. It's not like they're trying to win the Academy Awards every time they make a movie, they just try to tell a story they want to tell and it's entertaining. It's a loose fit of the Odyssey, and I mean loose to all of you Homer fanatics. It's just amazing. <br /> <br /> However, the most amazing part of this movie is the coloring. I've seen how they got the dusty feeling of the movie, and I'm still in awe, just thinking about it. The coloring becomes an important part of the film. Great film.
