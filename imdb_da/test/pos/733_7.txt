This film, also known as "do not look in the basement" is actually not bad. It is a little-known movie to die hard horror fans themselves, but I found this movie quite entertaining. Don't make me wrong, it's certainly not without problems, but think more people should give it a look. The story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanitarium is certainly an appealing to me. I thought the play, which seemed to be forced to begin with, improved when the movie went together. It seems that the actors really got into their roles. There are some good colorful characters, including a guy who thinks he is still a soldier, one who thinks he is a judge, an adult with a child's brain and an attractive girl who needs careful attention to let go of her clothes when someone approaches her. The title "don't see in the basement" has as much importance for the story as "last house on the left" has on that movie. If you like movies with crazy characters in a mental department like I do, check this out.
