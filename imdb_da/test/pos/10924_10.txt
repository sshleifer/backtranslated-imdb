First of all I would like to say that before I saw this movie, I considered myself an accepting person. Someone who cared about others appreciated others, found no / hardly any judgment against other people, and this movie has (I believe) changed my life or point of view dramatically. When I looked at it, I didn't really know what it was about, I knew it was about a kind of forbidden relationship, but then I was unclear, and when I started to see what happened between those two wonderfully depicted characters , I was in shock, disbelief, confusion and surprise. The first time I saw it, I was blind. Blind to their love, to their intimacy, to their connection, to their purity as human beings, to their relationship. I saw it once again because I finally figured out how hypocritical I was and told myself and others: "Oh, I accept all kinds of people and try not to judge them" while still judging this wonderful and incredible insightful story, because of my fear I believe. The second time I looked at this movie, I opened my eyes that had been closed for the first time and really didn't look at the kind of taboo deal I had heard about my whole life, but simply in love with two people. And I loved what I loved the story, I loved the slightly broken, but strong single people in the movie, I loved the sharing of emotions, and I loved the strong ties that were created. It is a real eye-opening, beautifully made film that made me cry at times, and I hope people who read this and ultimately see the film, remember that everyone deserves love, no matter what form or form it is presented in ....
