I really felt the movie was before its time. The one potential daughter-in-law was such a strong career-oriented woman. She knew what she wanted and was diplomatic, but firm with the indulgent mother-in-law to be. The mother's role was played very well (you just loved to hate her). Her need to control her son's life was neurotic evil. If you've ever been in a relationship where you've been convicted and found missing (and everyone involved knew it), it could be too close to home. It's been years since I saw this movie and I remember thinking that this plot and dialogue would work in a 50's or 60's movie. It's hard to see because of the mother and son's dynamics, but I'd like to see it again. I hope to find it on one of the old movie channels, but so far not lucky. Attempting to buy it was also in vain (I don't think it is on tape or DVD).
