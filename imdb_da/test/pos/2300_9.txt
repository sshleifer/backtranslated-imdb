This particular title is very interesting. The whole movie was like watching a ninja RPG, which is really cool. three magic swords, three clans, a terrible demon, a political power, the yotod has it all. The animation is decent, but a little grainy, the story is top notch, and the battle scene is really cool. One thing that really looks good in this movie is monsters. They are pretty freaky. If you liked blood regulation and ninja scroll, the yotode is the one to see.
