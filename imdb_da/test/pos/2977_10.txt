I was drawn to "Friends" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John, whom I had seen in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of ​​emotion and influence the movie would do. Recently I was brought back to the movie with a song that Heart called "Seasons", then I found the Elton John song "Friends" that it was the same song ... it has been 35 years. Still, the flood of "Friends" emotions came back as seeing an old photograph of your first true love. I have more recall of how the movie struck me than I do with the actual details of the production, plot, etc. Then forgive me for a pretty bad review. I remember taking a few special friends on a date to watch the movie, and they are just as moving and tearing in the end as I was. I am both nervous and nervous about finding a copy and seeing it now. So many movies that saw me so important to me (ie "The Graduate" "Easy Rider") just seem silly, and I don't want this to fall into the same category. But I will find it, and if it turns out silly, then I will at least be able to turn my wife into a big ... no. Excellent soundtrack. When we met, we went through this with "Last Tango in Paris". The young people I work with (I am 56) respect my opinions, but it is difficult to explain the feelings of the 60s and movies and songs that reflect such strong emotions, but seem a little "aged" now. I just can't figure out if the aging process is the movies ... or me. "Friends" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful movie. It will cause many special feelings I'm sure. Whole or buy a copy ... Indians were not close to the strong genre as they are today.
