A rich old lady calls for a flirtatious divorce to wake a Lothario away from her stupid, soon-to-be-poisonous grandson. <br /> <br /> Let's be GAY is an interesting little home comedy that has some tart dialogue courtesy of famous screenwriter Frances Marion) and good performances. Although it may be a little mawkish at times, it may be due to the problems of early sound technology, which tend to restrict action and movement. Norma Shearer can be credited with appearing in this smaller movie, rather than using her undoubted clout as Irving Thalberg's spouse to insist on only A-grade images. She is especially effective in her first few scenes, where dowdy flat makeup makes her almost unrecognizable. Her extreme transmogrification from goose to swan could only happen in Hollywood, but spending a lot of time worrying about it is hardly profitable. Rod LaRocque doesn't look as good as Shearer's incredible man. Very popular in quiet days, talkies were not very friendly to him, and his career would suffer. Here his role is not at least sympathetic, and one must wonder which masochistic impulse moves women to want cad so much. Magnificent Marie Dressler is present as an eccentric Long Island dowager. As a great friend of Frances Marion, one can easily imagine that part was written explicitly for her. Full of cranks & steps, she is very humorous. But the enormous warmth and important goodness that very soon would make her Hollywood's greatest star lacking is largely. <br /> <br /> Among the supportive cast, Hedda Hopper is called a slimmed-down society's worm, just as Wilfred Noy plays a cartoon butler. Movie Mavens will see a little Dickie Moore as Shearer's young son and older Mary Gordon as her housekeeper, both unapproved.
