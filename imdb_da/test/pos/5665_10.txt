Giorgino is a long, outrageous journey from bad to worse in the protagonist's life, after which the film is called. Young demobilized, gas poisoned World War I Lieutenant for Highly Sensitive Health, formerly a doctor in an orphanage for children with some mental deficiencies, is searching for their new location and finds much more than he had ever imagined and totally different. The depressed atmosphere of ultimate despair, where the insane is much less horrible than the sane, where madness is a kind of poetry, will keep you mesmerized from the very first frames of this movie at last. And all the beauty: the beauty of the winter and the mountains, the beauty of snow-covered landscapes and wild forests, I do not even know how all the sorrow and grief of the last war day could be made so beautiful.
