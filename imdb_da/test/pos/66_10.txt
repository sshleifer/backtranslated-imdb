I first watched this movie when it first came out and also bought an LP recording of the soundtrack. I liked it so well I went back to see it several times .. can't understand why it was considered a flop. Julie Andrews was lovely in this movie, her voice was in top form and the costume was beautiful! <br /> <br /> The movie contains a bit of everything, and although some of the scenes were a bit cumbersome, they were still fun. <br /> <br /> I recently found that I could get a copy in DVD form and ordered it ...... I was disappointed that a few songs and sequences in the movie were not included in DVD version I ordered.
