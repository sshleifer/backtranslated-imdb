John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror movie ever made. Not only that, but it is also on my personal favorite movies all the time. What makes the movie so good? It's hard to put my finger on it. Everything seems to work in The Thing, it is one of those rare occasions where everything just seems to fall into place. The movie is even better than Alien in creating a kind of moody atmospheric hell. The fact that it is not just about gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is capable of creating a paranoia that is unmatched in film. A truly wonderful movie that is offered by all horror buffs and anyone who has good taste in movies.
