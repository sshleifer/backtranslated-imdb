This season 1 "TFTD" episode titled Ironically "Answer Me" is a pretty well-finished and memorable episode, and it takes a shocking twist at the end. You have Jean Marsh as one over the ground and washed up the actress from L.A. who has moved to New York City for an audition and she lives in an apartment provided by an old friend. Strangely every night, she has been awake by a ringing phone from the next apartment, but still the home, where the ringing telephone continues to ring, is unoccupied, as guests have been dead for many years. Finally, she has to give in, she should have been following along and not answering the phone with no one at home, as it is bad to be wrapped up in a phone of your own life! Overall a good episode a weird, but on a supernatural phone it is still exciting and it winds well at the end.
