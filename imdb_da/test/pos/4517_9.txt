Fantastic, amazing, brilliant, excellent. These are the four adjectives that adjoin my head when I begin to describe "The Kite Runner". Khaled Hosseini's book adaptation had already received many minds, it is actually rumors that he himself broke into tears after seeing the premiere. I have to say before I even start reading the book before I saw the advanced screening of "The Kite Runner". So my assessment and point of view can be a little biased. <br /> <br /> Let me first say that although the book is, in my opinion, better than the final product of the film, it is by no means a bad fit. I mean for a two hour movie, it has the deserved answer. Things seem to be a bit quick in the last 20 eight minutes, but apart from that, what the book did was successful. It has captured the mind and imagination of millions across the globe. The magic woven by Khaled Hosseini gives us a sense of joy of sorrow, sadness, pain, loyalty, is sparse in this adaptation. Especially in the very first scene when young Hassan says, "If you tell me to eat dirt, I want to. But I know you won't ask me about it." Such a touching line is bound to capture many people's hearts. The two young actors were brilliant, absolutely fantastic. Especially the boy who played the innocent but loyal Hassan, a boy who refuses to give up a dragon he caught because he promised his best friend that he would bring it to him, only to be abused by big bullies who beat up and used him sexually, then being disputed by his best friend as a sweep. The whole action is so touching that it can't, but wet your eyes. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is well placed, save the last bit. The point where Amir learns about his true relationship with Hassan and reads Hassan's first and last not to him when he breaks down tears that feel helpless, lonely, and annoyed, seemed a little hasty and felt that Amir was behind facade. In the book, Khaled Hosseini had dedicated some 10-12 pages to describe Amir's state of mind in that position. But he did so in the penultimate segment of the movie, when Amir stands up for Hassan's boy, his nephew, Sohrab in front of his future father-in-law. The end was well deserved and I am sure it will be appreciated. It felt like the torch went down from one generation to another. <br /> <br /> Get over to the technical aspects. First of all, the actor. Just a word Superb. From start to finish, young Hassan and Amir, their father, his friend Rahim Khan. Everyone has been fantastic, especially young Hassan. Second, the direction was fantastic, combined with a couple of brilliant cameras. The background score was also impressive. Right from the starting track to the final credit, and I especially loved the one when Amir is in the mosque in Pakistan, the Western and Islamic fusion made it extra special. <br /> All in all, this is definitely one of the better movies, and it is a welcome break from all the Iranian inspired films that we have floating over this year. 9/10 !!!
