I have never seen "American Werewolf in London" but this movie was very entertaining. When I rented it, I thought it was a horror movie, but it turned out to be more of a comedy with some horror aspects. I thought the transformation sequences were nicely done, but efficiently clever, the best scenes were those where the effects and lighting built each other well. The transformations reminded me of lots of werewolf transformations in other films, but the werewolves themselves are very beastly and not so much dog as. Gore: I think there is too much in this movie that really takes away the horror when every frame has blood in it, the violence takes seriously. <br /> <br /> J.Hurst (8th grade)
