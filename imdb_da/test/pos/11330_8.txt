Two hours ago, I watched this brilliant film that overwhelmed me with its captivating photograph. It is quite understandable how it won the Best Camera award in Cannes 2000. Close ups dominated it. Close-ups of walls, people and many other things. The warm colored lighting (which is also usually by the director) gave the film a warm atmosphere. Only two people are seen mostly in the majority. An interesting music and especially three songs or themes followed the film almost all the time. Each of these themes represented a certain atmosphere throughout the film. Silence and slow movements characterize the film. Some scenes were extended moments or serious close-ups. Not only Tony Leung deserves a prize for his amazing plays when Maggie Cheung was so brilliant. I wonder how many dresses she had on the different scenes. The story was also linked in some way to the history of Hong Kong and the region in the 1960s. This prevented me from understanding some details about it especially at the end. In short, I would recommend fans of artistic films to watch it in the cinema.
