My mother Frank begins as a warm, gracious comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank, short of Francis, played by Sinead Cusack) who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student of son's university. Most of her friends and family are horrified, especially her son (Matthew Newton), who is busy falling in love with his best camera boyfriend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile, Frank has grown up his deviant English tutor (Sam Neill). Matthew Newton is completely disarming as David; relaxed and natural in the role, even when the character is created. He creates valuable goodwill, directs the audience through some of the movie's more awkward, broad comedy moments. Not long after the halfway point, first-time writer director Mark Lamprell manages his film in darker emotional areas and gives Cusack a real chance to shine. <br /> <br /> The support molding is full of familiar and welcome faces (Lynette Curran, Sacha Horler, Nicholas Bishop) and all the main characters (including a more animated than usual Sam Neill) are excellent. While suffering a bit at the end, My Mother Frank delivers more than it promises and is a true Australian audience pleaser.
