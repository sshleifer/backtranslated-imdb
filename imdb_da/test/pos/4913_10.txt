You have to think of the last tango in Paris for this one, because the mood and emotions run in the same direction and maintain the same heights - the difference is that in this unusual, intense and fiery depiction of love among the ruins of a Dostoyevskyian taken away the setting a homosexual subcultural environment - perhaps even one that is still disappearing in time, and not the equally arresting but heterosexual context of Bertolucci's own film. The last third of this film depicts a passionate love never seen in gay. Talking about pornography or homosexual rashes misses the point and intelligence of this work. This film, although at first glance it seems to take us into the familiar and often depicted underworld of gay street life, goes ahead to undermine the rules of this genre by exaggerating it in a super-real degree. The result is a hyper-charged emotional boost - an extraordinary strategy that raises the drama to one of the great universal themes and gigantic movements. <br /> <br /> This movie snatches the high ground because of the amazing performances of its actors, especially a young Jean Hugues Anglade and the director. A tour film association. Excellent in ambition and it is incessantly plumbed into the depth of human emotions. As a contribution to the gay cinema, this movie conquers this difficult ground and makes it its own triumph.
