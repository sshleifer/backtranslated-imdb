In Mississippi, former bluesman Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife who has just left him. He finds that the city's slum and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road near his small farm, pulled, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, gives medicine and care, and nourishes her as a father, holding the chain to control her warmth. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is taken from the army because of his anxiety problem, he misunderstands the relationship between Lazarus and Rae and tries to kill him. <br /> <br /> "Black Snake Moan" is a weird tale of faith, hope, love and blues. The gifted Christina Ricci has an impressive performance in the role of a young tramp abused since her childhood by her father and has had sex with the whole city where she lives. It's amazing this actress's versatility, and that's probably the most mature work I've seen Christina Ricci perform. Samuel L. Jackson also has a fantastic performance in Lazarus role. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard in a movie with wonderful blues. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Entre o CÃ©u e o Inferno" ("Between Heaven and Hell")
