Yes, 2:37 is in some ways a rip off from Gus van Sants Elephant. It's about some students who deal with their problems, leading to suicide in one of them. Yes, it's full of clich√©s, but it's life. You just can't deny the creepy geeks, handicapped, or popular students who, despite their popularity, have problems in the real world. But it's not about what this movie is about. It's not about life in Highschool. It is not about the misery of life. <br /> <br /> If you look below the surface under the soap-like social relationships that appear, you will find a poignant, thought-provoking criticism of our society. <br /> <br /> Why do people care for suicide? Do we really understand their motives? Or are we just trying to understand after it's already too late? And why is it always someone you would never have expected to be? <br /> <br /> This movie does not answer this question, but it raises it. And it does so in a very intense way. The whole way it keeps you guessing if the blood it can be as you see in the beginning. You follow some student paths, everyone has a more or less good reason to end their lives just to be forced to see the cruel act of the finals. <br /> <br /> Did you know who it was? Or were you surprised as in real life? The message is verbalized by one of the surviving children in the end. We are always so firm on our own problems that we forget to see others. There may be someone, a colleague, a friend who will no longer live. But if you don't open your eyes, you'll never know until it's too late. <br /> <br /> This movie delivers well. It may have some errors, but they do nothing more when it is over. Either you see a reflection of society, or you are blind to reality.
