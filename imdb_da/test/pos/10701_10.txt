Sam Firstenberg's "Ninja 3: Domination" mixes martial arts with "The Exorcist" as horror.The horror elements thrown on the screen are simply ridiculous, but the movie acts as a mindless action / martial arts flick. The battle scenes are well-choreographed and exciting, and the movie is never boring. So forget the silly dialogue, the lame acting and the annoying soundtrack - take a beer and check this out!
