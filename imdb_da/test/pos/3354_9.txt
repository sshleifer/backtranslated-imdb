The first time I saw "Alice in Wonderland", an X-rated Musical Comedy ", was in the early 1980s in a movie theater in NY City with some friends. I remember actually enjoying it a lot, even if we were left wondering why all the "goodies" were covered in differently shaped colored patches and why the movie suddenly jumped from one scene to the next and left us guessing ... what we just missed. soft-core edited (chopped) version that left me wanting to see it again soon, but in its original integrated version, the more than 20 years passed by I forgot all about this movie and just a few days ago , I fell with a heavily used VHS copy (which had seen better times: slightly leached colors, scratchy sound and a few bugs), but guess what? It's the original unknown version and this time I really had a ball! , musical and porn can be an uncomfortable combination, but in this case work It really is, and it is unlikely that the vast majority of boring porn movies today are invading our screens. This is a really entertaining and entertaining sex fantasy that will not disappoint you. The direction is smart, the fast editing makes the movie fly like a bird, all the known characters are lovable or just funny, all actors seem to be well, the songs are captivating (worth mentioning it to grow up) sold by Alice in the beginning of the movie and the hilarious "What a nice girl you do on a knight like this"), the dance figures are well choreographed and staged (incredibly energetic Terry Hall shows that she can also "dance" and dances enthusiastically away from her intestine ... Don't worry, she also does what she was best known for ...), the play, the song, the set, the costumes are of a quality level and so ... there is Kristine "Blue Eyes" DeBell, in her career's first leading role and (oh boy!) Does she actually get HC sequences! Personally, I think they are absolutely not unpleasant, on the contrary, they are spontaneous and totally awake. She is young and (ohhh!) So very beautiful; With the help of her new friends in Wonderland, she discovers her body and her sexuality, so she sings, she dances and ... what do you expect? She also experiments sex! The final order, when she finally loves her boys, is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the movie. I think her "physique du roll" (the innocent blue eyes and captivating smile) and her abilities make the explicit sequences more than acceptable and in fact very pleasant. There is plenty of sex going on in (this) Wonderland and everyone seems eager to "get busy" with the first available boy (s) or girl (s), which means there are many core actions to be seen. On the other hand, some close shots, clearly "spliced" just to make "pornhounds" really happy, a little redundant for my personal taste. Generally, however, gender action is not offensive, as it is handled with a lot of humor, and it almost blends seamlessly with music, dances and comedy. If you think that you and your partner can handle graphic sex, you should see it together. Take my word, you want a half and a half good time (maybe also an extra-action action ...) This is "Adult Entertainment", so beware, don't let this video lie around or among the baby's videos. If your 10-year-old can put his hands on it, he can entertain himself, but you will be forced to give embarrassing explanations for the reasons why "this" Alice behaves differently from the one he called in Lewis Carroll's novel or he looked at the disneys video I bet you will not forget this "one-of-a-kind" very soon. It's a shame that they don't like such more ...! I give it a 9 out of 10.
