After a slightly slow start, I thought this film about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a very comfortable watch for a few hours, mainly two views. <br /> <br /> The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as trustworthy because I know it happened in different places during occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl who was married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the beginning, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went out to fight. After German intervention, Greece conquered and the island of Pelagia lives on coming under Italian occupation, where Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage.) This was, of course, a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied countries. When they got to know their crew members, they began to see them not as enemies but as real people, and at times they fell in love - often to their neighbor's disapproval. I just finished reading an interesting book about the German occupation of Britain's Channel Islands, where this was a major problem. When Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them. <br /> <br /> The other background perspective is the Italian occupation itself, which I thought was quite realistically portrayed. First, it was despised as the island treated their Italian occupiers. Greece defeated Italy (quite true from a historical perspective) and was truly conquered by the Germans. The city's refusal to surrender to the Italians and instead of insisting on surrendering to a German officer struck me as something that could have happened (and was quite funny indeed. I loved the line, "we would rather surrender to German Dog than to you Italians. "The depiction of Italian troops also hit me as credible. The Italian army was never enamored by their German allies, and never thrilled to fight with them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends, their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt. Here, the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting (as the German troops on the island simply cannot understand) and are ecstatic when Italy makes peace and retires from the war - until they discover that this might catch them off Germans It was all pretty well done, I thought. <br /> <br /> At the end, it falls a little too predictable but still deserves praise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
