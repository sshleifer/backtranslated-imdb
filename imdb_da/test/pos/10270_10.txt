This is a great comedy that highlights how it was to live next to racist bigot. But also shows that both main characters are actually as bad as each other. Based on the hit ITV comedy, this is very politically incorrect. And that's the better for it, comedy is to entertain. The film's only real drawback is that there is not much of a plot. But the throw is as big as normal. Jack Smethurst and Rudolph Walker make a hell of a team and play each other in a one-man kind of way. It has been many years since I saw this movie and last week could finally buy it on DVD. The fact that the movie still contains real laughs, means I can recommend this movie just as I would back in the 1970s.
