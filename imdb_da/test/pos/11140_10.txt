I'm awed by actress Bobbie Phillips and her amazing skill as an action star! This movie is driven by her wonderful acting and amazing acting power. I'm a fan of sci-fi, but I have to say that this movie exceeds most science fiction movies in its filmography, and mostly it's the use of an actress whose presence replaces the plot that's fine , but it's not new. Although it looks like this movie was made for television, I think it's better than most theatrical releases of its kind.
