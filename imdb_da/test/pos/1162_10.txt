This is one of my favorites all the time. All the actors do a good job. Comparing this movie with "Lawrence of Arabia" does not do justice to both films. "Wind and the Lion" levels a much lower budget with amazing actors showing cordial characters in a heart-warming atmosphere. Action and beautiful pictures are also provided, all of which guarantee a favorite movie to me.
