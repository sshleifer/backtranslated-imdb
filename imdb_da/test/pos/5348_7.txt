'' Wallace & Gromit in the Curse of Were-Rabbit '' is the same type of animation and from the same creators of '' Chicken Run '', but the story is now different: Wallace, an inventor who loves cheese and his smart dog Gromit who always helps Wallace in his problems, trying to keep the rabbits away from everyone's vegetables, as in their city is an annual Giant Vegetable Competition. But when Wallace tries an invention, he did to get the rabbits to avoid vegetable, the one being cursed is him. Before I watched this movie, I did not know that these two characters already existed and were famous. I loved Gromit and I think he is one of the coolest dogs I already saw. Aka "Wallace & Gromit -A Batalha dos Vegetais" - Brazil
