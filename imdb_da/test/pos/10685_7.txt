Okay, I give you that some of the science in "Doppelganger" (or "Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun") is kind of dopey. The idea of ​​a whole planet that exists undiscovered (because we cannot see it on the other side of our sun) does not hold at all - any Astronomy 101 student knows that another planet would cause the earth's gravitational disturbance in other planets' movements. After all, astronomers derived the presence of Pluto after all, and they regularly find comets and asteroids and moons. <br /> <br /> And the idea that a mirror image Earth somehow evolved in almost perfect parallel to our earth, down to English-speaking scientists and human counterparts for every human being born on our earth ... who takes things out of 'hard science' fiction and into 'Twilight Zone' territory. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it requires a great suspension of critical thinking to accept and enjoy. <br /> <br /> But man, this movie struck my socks like a youth. I was still accustomed to pretty cheerful, optimistic science fiction films, as the hero won through at the end - even "2001" could be interpreted as having an "optimistic" ending. <br /> <br /> But in this case: Thinnes tried to dock with his circulating meeting ship so that he could return to his own land, only to be bounced back out of his docking quay (something about "the polarities that Not to be reversed because his "doppelganger" did not do the same. Apparently, Thinnes' doppelganger had decided he was happy in his new home. Somehow, the damaged vessel would land safely and try again, armed with the new info that would make him and his backers succeed, he was the hero and the hero always wins eventually. <br /> <br / > Instead, Thinnes could not maintain control of the curly craft, and the subsequent crash of the ship at the launch site was so horrible and devastating that it killed everyone (except the top project manager) and destroyed all Projects of the project and Thinne Thin must never go home, and he did uselessly, his secrets never revealed. <br /> <br /> Aside from the Planet of the Apes series, I had never seen such a sad and eerie ending, and it is always stuck in my mind - especially the huge destruction of the crash scene near the beginning of the movement ( You knew that the spaceship would never fly again!) and one in the end. <br /> <br /> I would like to watch this movie again and see how well it lasted over the years.
