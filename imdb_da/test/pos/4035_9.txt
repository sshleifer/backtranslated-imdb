"D.O.A" is an engaging and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his caustic best; and Quaid is unfortunately one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His da beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as it is, it doesn't really matter. <br /> <br /> The film has been styled all the way through and draws on a number of influences to capture its "seamy" feel. Do you want to credit that it is actually targeted by two people? The answer is no. It's all wonderfully flat, from its innovative camera work to its inefficient use of black and white photography. All these elements help keep the process fresh. Really the greatest excitement here is getting the dialogue, it's snappy yet intricate, not wasting a word and yet being entertaining. The manuscript for this is like a pocket artwork. <br /> <br /> This went unnoticed by me for years before finally catching it late at night. If this is the first thing you have heard of, do not leave as I did! Catch it soon, it's really amazing !! <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a solid genre flip that surprises every time, this really fits into the bill. <Br /> <br />
