I am a professional musician who was inspired almost 20 years ago to start playing guitar after hearing Jimmy Page at Led Zeppelin II. While I'm not playing in the same genre or style, the impact of that man has been huge. Now, almost 20 years later, I finally got to see something more than that not so good. The song is the same. Again I have seen so many bands perform, some small - some the current 'gentlemen'. No band, no where has it never been possible to pull the magic you can actually taste by watching this DVD. <br /> <br /> Robert Plant can be a bit much at times, and you can almost feel Side's annoyance for him to forget about texts, but it wasn't something I guess - especially for the era. Bonham's genius shines more on this DVD, watched an album with Zeppelin, The Joy of Joy or Lord Sutch. JPJ is quite common - but the magic of this DVD is how well the four of them perform together. The world loved to imagine that they were in black magic (k), etc. - it was just a matter of interest to Page. The magic (note I say this very much) is that this DVD captures a rare look at the line of 4 young boys who can play brilliantly, no matter how sloppy they actually play. It didn't matter. <br /> <br /> A quick breakdown. The first of the two DVDs is where the true magic is. You should be able to sense the power and rahedess that Zep had in their early days. At the end of the second DVD page struggles with his sanity under the Knebworth songs. (It is no secret that at this point he was heavily dependent on heroin). So I would recommend the first disc to any music lover, and the other to the only genuine Zeppelin fan. <br /> <br /> I can go too far here for some guitarists, but I will say after seeing this, Page is definitely more creative and inventive than Hendrix. Yup, I said it. And if you disagree - see the DVD.
