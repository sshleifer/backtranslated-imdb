This is my all-time favorite movie ever !!! <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this when I was younger and since then I have been in love with it. I used to rent it so often from the one video store that used to carry it, and when we moved, I couldn't find anyone so I jawed back until he far away saved just so I could watch the movie again! <br /> <br /> Finally I found it for sale and I bought it and saw it again and again .... great movie! Since then, it was my very first DVD that I got after I got my DVD player ... ok, I got them at the same time, the quality of the DVD is much better I couldn't believe it! You must see this one!
