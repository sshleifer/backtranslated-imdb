The main criticism of the fact that the Earth's core is that it is cheap, the special effects are bad and so on and so on. Yes, some of the special effects are painfully bad, but what many people overlook is that it is actually quite fun, which is very important in my book. In comparison, just watch the latest STAR WARS movie: they have the latest, greatest special effects created by the latest technological advances that are capable of creating amazing visual effects as far as human imagination can imagine and yet With all the razzle glare, these movies were as exciting as a funeral. As Yoda would say, funny, they are not! In other words, who cares that FX is not the greatest when the film's spirit is fast, humorous and clearly put on the action side. I love everything about the core of the earth: The contrast between stodgy victorian england VS the second, world-famous, colorful setting of Pellucidar, cast of characters, the concept of a lost underground world, the telepathic pterodactyls, the human slaves rebelling Jubal the ugly (lol!) , the inspired collection of Peter Cushing (which is amazing!) and Doug McClure, the excellent music (it's really good), filmography of the amazing Alan Hume and last but not least Caroline Munro. She is sexy in this movie. One of the sexiest B-movie babes ever caught on the screen. <br /> <br /> Seriously, anyone who doesn't like this movie doesn't know what fun is. Gimme on Earth's core over any turgid STAR WARS predates! At least it has Caroline Munro, which no CGI can ever restore.
