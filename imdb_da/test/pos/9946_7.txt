Four or five episodes of Johnnie Socko and his Flying Robot edited together. Entertaining giant robot fighting giant monsters tale aimed at children. Parents will, of course, become insane as the action is fierce with the robot / monster battles that look like professional wrestling and man on violence by people, the kind of things you will find in Al Capone St. Valentine's Day School and Gangster Training Academy. I liked it, but then again I grew up on the series. If there are any problems, other than "men in suits", the movie plays as a series of episodes sewn together, with a climax that comes every 20 minutes. Recommended for those who have run out of Ultraman or Godzilla
