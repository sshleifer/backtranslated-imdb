I always thought my father had a different life and was eagerly awaiting the development of 51 Birch Street when I sat down and watched it for the first time. Amazingly, this movie took me to places I hadn't expected and made me reconsider assumptions and reviews. A truly personal remarkable story told in a smart but straightforward way. I especially enjoyed the movie maker need to pull out the type of his mother's daily diary - very effective. I read the previous comment and want to note that the sound was fine when I saw this and suspected that the movie was changing something or that the theater could have contributed to the inferior sound quality to the other author.
