This is really a Kung Fu classic. This movie seems to have influenced martial arts movies for decades. The Spanish guitar background music, the competing schools, the impossible high jump on the edges of rooftops, the prisoners threw spears, cheats in tournaments, the secret training for an exotic karate technique, themes of patience and endurance, and more were copied by many later films like " The Karate Kid "(1984)," Hero "(2002)," Kill Bill Volume 2 "(2004) and" Kung Fu Hustle "(2004). <br /> <br /> I feel lucky to have seen the first movie in 1972, shortly after it was released, just before kung fu movies became mainstream and before Bruce Lee became a household name. I saw it with two friends of mine in a downtown San Diego theater frequented by sailors, and although the scenes in the glowing red hands and wrinkled eyes got somewhat laughing, it was clear that the audience got into it as it did was our small group. It was a very memorable movie for me. Decades later I could still remember several specific scenes even after I had forgotten the movie title. This movie is extra special to me now because one of the two friends with whom I first saw it (sailor Kenneth Lee Hines from Kitty Hawk) since passed away so this movie serves as a heathen of the day together before we took judo and karate lessons in subsequent years. <br /> <br /> Compared to kung fu movies, I would rate this movie as 10/10. But since I have to keep the bigger movie album in mind, I will more objectively evaluate it as 8/10 due to obvious technical errors. I just recommend that neophyte viewers consider these technical errors to be proof of its vintage nature and its authenticity, and then pleasantly continue to enjoy its testosterone-charged chaos.
