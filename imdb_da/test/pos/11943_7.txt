This is a nice little lifetime movie about a guy (Peter Coyote) who lives the perfect suburban middle-class life when late one evening the police suddenly break into his home and arrest him for the murder of a guy 27 years ago. <br /> <br /> In his prison cell, Coyote tells his wife the fateful events 27 years ago and how he came in contact with Wayne Kennedy the man he probably killed. <br /> <br /> From here, the story is told in flashback fashion and the more you learn about Wayne and Coyote and how they came to meet and what happened when they made the more interested you get. <br /> <br /> The action is nothing to blame for, even though a guy who plays Wayne Kennedy is pretty scary enough. The real strong point of the movie is the mystery of what actually happened on the mountain. The wife uses the movie's races to dig traces to the mystery, and every time something new comes up, we are treated with another flashback that reveals more of the mystery. It's actually pretty good. <br /> <br /> As far as Lifetime TV movies are going, this little flick comes highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
