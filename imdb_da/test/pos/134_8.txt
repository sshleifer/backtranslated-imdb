(This has been edited for space) <br /> <br /> Chan-wook Park's new movie is a complex movie that is not easy to classify. Nominally a horror movie, the central character is a vampire, the film actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analog of virus invasion of a body), romance and get other things too. It's a movie that almost has too much on its mind. The film takes its own relationships and blends them with classical European literature, in this case Emile Zola's "Thérèse Raquin". It is a strange mixture that does not always gel, but nevertheless has an incredible power. Here it is almost 24 hours since I watched the movie at Lincoln Center (with a post-film discussion by the director) and I find that my cage is increasingly steering. It's not so much what's happening, it's annoying, it's more that its far-reaching history and its themes call many bells in retrospect. The movie's plot has a will loved priest who decides that the best way to help humanity is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease. Infected with the disease he eventually succumbs to and dies, but due to a transfusion of vampire blood (it is not explained) he actually survives. Hailed as a miracle worker returns to the hospital where he had served to the sick. Unfortunately, everything is not good. The priest finds that he needs blood to survive. He also finds that he has all the typical problems in a vampire, and it is not possible for him to go out during the day. Things become even more complicated when he is recognized with a childhood friend and his family. The priest is guarding some of his animal passions with his friend's wife. Then it goes sideways. <br /> <br /> An ever-changing movie is a story that leaps through a series of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who finds out that his life has been radically changed by a chance event and find that he is no longer as he thought he was. It's a movie you have to stick to the end because the movie is forever evolving into something else. It is also a movie that has a big role in the mind and the themes it plays with are constantly explored in a number of ways. The film has enough to do, you could, and people probably want to write books that discuss the movie. <br /> <br /> The two of the strongest parts of the movie are its vampire elements and its romance. The vampire part of the story is brilliant. There is something about how it puts the basic rules and nature of the "disorder" that makes such a perfect feeling that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside. Sitting in the theater last night, I was amazed at how impressed it was. I think the fact that it was playing more or less equally is what is the earthquake. Here is a vampire who just wants a normal life. It stands in contrast to what happens later, it makes it clear that living an existence of hunting people really will not work. It's not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys, rather it's something else. Personally, I think the movie changes the playing field from a hip cool idea or dreams into something more real and tangible. (The sequence in which power comes in is just quite cool) The romance is also handled wonderfully. Sure the sex scenes are steaming and well-finished, but it's the other things, the look, the talk, the movements outside the sex that does this particular. I love the look, the calm staring as the forbidden couple look at each other, starving each other and unable to act, fraud and fraud of betrayal, both genuine and suspected, and the horrible passion of possible enforcement. This is one of the big screen romances all the time. It perfectly captures the feeling and feeling of deeply passionate love (and desire). If you've ever loved deeply, I guess you will find part of your hearing on the screen, I know I did. The statement "I just wanted to spend eternity with you" has a sad poignancy to it. It is both a statement of what was the intention and the depth of emotion. The tragic romance will break your heart. <br /> <br /> I don't want to lie to you and say the movie is perfect and amazing. It is not as good as the pieces are, and almost everyone is great (especially the actors I have been unfairly hacking as great) are not always coming together. The different genres, thematic elements and tones occasionally glide against each other. I often thought where the movie was going. I hung in there, even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlessly. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie a lot. I loved the pieces more than the movie as a whole. It has pinged around in my head since I saw it and I guess it will do it for several days more. Like or love is irrelevant, as this is a movie that should really be seen since it has so much to do that it will give you enough material to think and talk for days after. One of the most boring and most complete films of the year.
