Two hard-haired but skilled ladies decide to act as HAVANA WIDOWS by sailing to Cuba to meet and harass rich gentlemen ... <br /> <br /> This was the kind of ephemeral comic frippery that studios produced quite effortlessly in 1930 's. Well made and very comfortable, the Depression audience couldn't seem to get enough of these popular, fun photo dramas. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell & Glenda Farrell are completely cast as the hectic, fast-talking women who will go in great lengths to make a little dishonest dough. Although Joan gets both top billing and the romantic scenes, both Gals are as talented and clear as they are beautiful. Handsome Lyle Talbot plays Joans persistent suitor, but he gets relatively little to do. Chubby, Cherubian Guy Kibbee appears as the girls' goal. Whether it's awakening to get into the wrong bed or being chased over a Cuban hacienda in his long johns, he's just as fun. Behind him comes a rank of character actors - Allen Jenkins, Frank McHugh, Ruth Donnelly, Hobart Cavanaugh, Maude Eburne, Dewey Robinson - all equally talented to delight the toughest crowd. <br /> <br /> Movie Maven recognizes an uncredited James Murray as the suspicious banker with the counterfeit control. This very talented actor was pulled out of complete obscurity for the star of King Vidor's The CROWD (1928), one of the silent era's most prestigious films. Hope was high for a good career, but his celebrity quickly faded with sound images. After a large number of small roles and bits and pieces, bread and poor, his life ended in a New York River in 1936. He was only 35 years old. <br /> <br /> While never first-rank stars, Joan Blondell (1906-1979) and Glenda Farrell (1904-1971), many scored movies on Warner Bros. through the 1930s, especially the eight where they performed together. Whether playing gold diggers or working girls, journalists or secretaries, these blonde & brassy ladies were almost always a struggle for what the leading man was fortunate enough to share equal billing with them. With a wisecrack or gaze, their characters showed that they were ready to take the world - and every man in it. Never as vicious as Paramount's Mae West, you always had the feeling that it was hard as they used to, Blondell & Farrell used their toughness to defend vulnerable hearts ready to break over the right guy. While many performances from seven decades ago can look campy or constructed today, these two lovely ladies are still tense and sassy.
