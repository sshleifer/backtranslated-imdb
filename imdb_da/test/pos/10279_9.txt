Several years ago, I watched this movie without subtitles on TV, and although I didn't understand a word of what the characters said, I still had the general idea, and the mood of the movie fascinated me no ends. <br /> Last time I saw it again a few weeks ago. My heart skipped when I saw the picture in the TV guide, and for 8 days until the movie was real, I told everyone I knew to go see it. The story reminded me a little about Alfred Hitchcock's dizziness. a slow, burning movie about a guy who one day thinks he sees the boyfriend who disappeared years before. What follows is a wild roller coaster ride of flashbacks, changing perspectives and really inventive twists in the plot, and at the end of the movie I was shocked. I certainly didn't get what I expected (and I had actually seen the movie already!). Be prepared to be confused. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
