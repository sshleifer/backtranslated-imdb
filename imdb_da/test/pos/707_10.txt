I read on the Internet that this movie is remade to a theatrical function. Finally!!!!! It's time Hollywood got their act together. The big studios always wrinkle on precious material, with Oscar written over it. Go figure !! <br /> <br /> JERICHO MILE was made ahead of that time. It is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Michael Mann, a true visionary, found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence. Peter Strauss' Emmy award performance is probably the best character role I've seen in my movie viewing lifetime. Any actor who touches this role will never be the same (unless an Oscar is already sitting on their mantle). The gritty multi-ethnic ensemble for THE JERICHO MILE makes one understand the delicate social dynamics of our world. It involves redemption without public validation, and the human spirit's power overcomes all obstacles. Imagine a prison jail when he was a teenager for life without the chance of parole, it doesn't know he might be the fastest runner in the world. ... what would you do ?? <br /> <br /> This movie makes you go away because you have not been cheated on any level. Exciting, engaging, emotional and a "Rolling Stones" soundtrack that kicks otherwise !!! <br /> <br /> I always thought this would be made for the big screen ... Can't wait ...! !! Meanwhile, I have to continue to look again at my weather-determined VHS copy I've had for many years.
