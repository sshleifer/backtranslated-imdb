I think Gerard's comments to the doctor hit the nail upside down. Interesting movie, but very long. It is definitely antithesis to the new school of flashy, sexy, Moore-style documents. There are no narrators, no facts or page info interlaced, and no other gimmicks. What you see is what you get - an insight into the vanishing world of Tibet's saltmen. As a great doc fan, I was surprised at how much I lost my attention to this movie, because of the length and lack of dialogue. Eventually I would recommend it if the topic sounds interesting to you. It is beautifully shot, informative and presents a valuable (and closing) window in the way of the life of the Tibetan saltmen (and women :) - all important features of a good doc. But put on a big pot of coffee that helps.
