I loved this movie !! Jack Black and Kyle Gass have probably made one of the best comedies since up in smoke. This movie has something for everyone: rock, drugs and satan. What more can anyone have? I suggest this movie to anyone who wants to sit back and forget all the problems in the world and have a good laugh. Although the movie does not perform well in the theaters, it is safe to become a cult classic. I suggest everyone will watch the movie download D's first album because many jokes are made more fun if you've heard the songs (like JB's obsession with Sasquatch and the epic battle against the devil.) The movie is still guaranteed to laugh even if you don't have heard their music, but the songs are so big that you can't pass them on.
