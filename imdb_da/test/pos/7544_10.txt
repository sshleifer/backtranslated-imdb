Alistair Simms is a marvel in this. He does such a good headman. The role given here for George Cole was made for him. Therefore, casting jobs on this movie were perfect. I think it was one of those rare occasions when everything was clicked. The story was good, the comic dialogue a scream and the older prefect girls a joy !! Every character you are endeared to, even villains. Why can't we make movies like this anymore. Basically, this is a very English comedy with good movement and fluidity.
