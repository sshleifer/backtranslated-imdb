Seeing this movie caused quite a emotional reaction. It's about today's documentary film. It is refreshing to see something so personal, honest and right. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and publication are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well-presented here. It is a fine line to go between personal truth and exploitation. This movie needs very carefully and successfully. <br /> <br /> One would think learning about how an apparently normal couple lacks the expectations of society would give pessimism ... but it doesn't. On the contrary, it made me feel good. I feel I now know more about marriage ... about women. <br /> <br /> Check it out, it makes you think - exactly what a good documentary should be designed to do.
