Crossfire remains one of the best Hollywood message films because, unlike the admirable gentleman's deal it beats for a few months, it chooses to send its message through the form an excellent noir thriller rather than having a furious Star that constantly says "It's because I'm Jewish, isn't it?" It's much easier to get the message that hates like a charged gun across, when the dead bodies are actually rather than metaphorical. Somewhat shamefully, the short featurette on Warners' DVD does not mention that novelist Richard Brooks disowned the film of the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti-Semitic, but it is interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is Jewish, there is no doubt Sam Leves performance, that character is actually gay too? Not a mincing caricature, but there are certainly two lost soul aspects to his scenes with George Cooper's confused soldier. There is not much of a mystery to who the killer is: although the killing is done in classic noir shadows, the killer's body language is instantly recognizable, but then the film has its characters to the same conclusion before the halfway point: The tension comes from proving it and saving the fallen guy. There is an element of Ealing Films for the soldier group that goes together to get their buddy out of solution (you can almost see this aspect as a blueprint for Hue and Cry), but the atmosphere is pure RKO noir. Viewed over a long night of swimming, the film has a beautiful look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born so much out of the economy in style (it cuts back on lighting time and allowed Director Edward Dmytryk more time to work with the actors) and Outstanding cast does Most of the fine script: a relaxed but quiet charismatic Robert Mitchum, Robert Young's Maigret-like detective, Gloria Graham's tramp and the perpetually scary Paul Kelly as her compulsive admirer, a guy trying on stories other people are trying to tire. But the lasting impression is Robert Rysy's excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone, as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man to death. A great surprise hit in 1946, as a reward, Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott found himself examined by HUAC, which in itself had a remarkable tendency to target Jews. So much for crusade ??
