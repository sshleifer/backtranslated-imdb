As most other reviewers seem to agree, this adaptation of 'After The Funeral' is very good. Always one of my favorite Poirot stories, I was worried that it might be 'messed with'. Well it was a little bit, but only a little bit, and the result was thoroughly entertaining. David Suchet continues to be very close mistaken as Poirot and (as others have pointed out) is the second star in this show Monica Dolan, who probably couldn't be better than Miss Gilchrist. I also really enjoyed Fiona Glasscott, who was spot on who cut Rosamund Shane, but really, the casting was absolutely impeccable throughout! <br /> <br /> A point is off because the adapters are unable to withstand cramming for many revelations in the last fifteen minutes. The company with will and house deeds were all a bit unnecessary, though I didn't mind how they tightened up Abernethie's family (in the book, the tree is really quite complicated). The last few moments when the killer is revealed, however, is really incredibly well done, and I found the very end when they all leave Enderby, quite touching. This is really one of the very best of the Poirot series so far.
