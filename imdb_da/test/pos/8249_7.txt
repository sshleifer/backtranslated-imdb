When Pinky, a qualified electrician, is released from prison, his parole officer has found him a job at a metropolitan bank. When part of the crime the underworld from its past learns about its position, they have plans to exploit it and rob the bank. Pinky is horrified at first because he really wants to go straight, but when a fate comes, Pinky begins to believe that you should not see a gift horse in your mouth. <br /> <br /> Also known as The Mayfair Bank Caper {among others!}, This is a very enjoyable piece that is the 1970s 1970s. London and all its highly dubious fashion is enlightened as a Christmas tree in Ralph Thomas and Guy Elmes' s wobbly capers. If the viewer can accept David Niven as an age crime gentleman with a certain eternity (it's not easy I can tell you) then A Nightingale Song in Berkeley Square could surprise you. The actors do not draw trees, but it does not hurt at all, it has an honest fun quality that is never less than entertaining. The scoring and soundtrack may be guilty of over-amplification during the dramatic criminal moments, but it is a minor complaint to let me believe this is a subject-matter British gem. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan takes Pinky's lead role (of course, hopes to lure in American viewers}, 70s heartbeats Oliver Tobias {a lot of hair} is in there to keep the ladies interested while the blocks get the pleasant view of Elke Summer and her lovely legs for business, decent enough clips and containing a seriously rewarding finale, A Nightingale Song in Berkeley Square deserves much better than the modest 5.7 rating here on IMDb, but how many people have seen what I wonder? , continue giving it a ride, if you chance, these are good things
