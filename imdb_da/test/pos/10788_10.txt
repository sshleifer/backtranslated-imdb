Talk Radio is of course probably not the most well-known of Stein's movies, but don't let it ward off you. This movie is ripe for discovery, I defy anyone who should not be attracted to it. Along with the best performance of the 80 cinema from Eric Bogosian, it is for me (along with JFK) what is Stones finest moment. Stone didn't seem to comment much about it these days and didn't make the director's comments on DVD like all his other movies. Stone has nothing to be ashamed of, most directors would kill to get a shot @ a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The claustrophobia of the study is intense, and the opinions of Champlain are still very crucial arguments for today. The speech "legalize all drugs" is powerful and you can find yourself agreeing with him. In my opinion, the film is about freedom of speech and how sometimes people don't like to hear things they don't agree on. Talks and conversations with the listeners are very convincing, even disturbing, a chill leaping into the back when a crazy man calls Champlain, saying he must rape again, because the city runs him crazy, is absolutely shocking. The excitement is sometimes unbearable with a scene when heavy metal Kent becomes unhinged, of course, Champlain doesn't even ridicule him. Champlain (or should I say Bogosian) is fearless in film and performance, absolutely fascinating, a shame th @ Bogosian's other great role was the villain of Under Siege 2 (dear god !!) A scene th @ did not call really, was then Barry's boss Dan (Alec Baldwin) makes him calm himself, Barry doesn't seem to be the kind of person who closes up and does what he has been told it seemed a little confused and clich√©. The scenes outside the studio are criticized for being too formal, it's true because Stone is trying to make the movie more cinematic and allow the viewer to see Champlain's beginnings, but it doesn't work altogether. <br /> <br /> It is a brilliant movie with extreme close-ups, deep focus, extremely fast cuts, an amazing 360 set that is used for the final breathtaking monologue. Must see cinema, it rarely does because it was ignored @ time, but now again gets attention as it really deserves. A classic th @ should be studied by generations of film students. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for inventive use of "Bad to the Bone" before T2, brilliant supporting cast including John C McGinley (Dr Cox from Scrubs) as the shabby Stu, Leslie Hope (24) as Champlains boyfriend John Pankow and Alec Baldwin as costume and Micheal Wincott, who plays three roles (a very underrated actor), the excitement between the listeners and Champlain, who is very heart-racing @ times and of course kudos to the stars Bogosian and Stone for such a fantastic piece of cinema. Enjoy!
