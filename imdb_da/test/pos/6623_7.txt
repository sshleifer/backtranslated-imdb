Anyone who wants to learn more about the development of skateboarding should find Dogtown and Z-Boys sufficient research material. This must not be confused with the rulers of Dogtown, sorry Hollywood is trying to deposit the success of the original Dogtown revival. <br /> <br /> Directed by Stacey Peralta, a former Z-Boys himself and pro skater and mastermind behind the 80s Bones Brigade and written with skateboarding photojournalist Craig Stecyk, this documentary tracks how a group of surfing children from Southern California's average streets (known as dogtown) that formed the Z-Boys skateboard team (actually there was a girl - Peggy Oki) revolutionized skateboarding. The movie contains interviews from almost all Z-Boys (Chris Cahill's whereabouts are unknown) with the most notable that bad ass Tony Alva and the youngest Jay Adams, who have talents (along with Perlata), seemed to exceed the rest of the teams. There are interviews by the team's (and Dogtown store) founders, surf burner Jeff Ho, Skip Engbloom and Craig Stecyk. There are also interviews of people such as Tony Hawk (of course), Ian McKaye (Fugazi) and Henry Rollins, who were young children in the 70s, when Dogtown influenced skateboarding (skateboarding was a completely different connection in previous years as a documentary explains). <br /> <br /> It not only shows you who the Dogtown team was and how they formed, but why their style changed not only skateboarding tricks (pool skating became immensely popular and thus allowed skating) but also relieved the sport (although it is not in the extreme commercialism it is today) as more than just the fleeting stick, it had been earlier, as these surfing kids, whose waves sprang out early in the morning, needed ways to use theirs time on and finally got into skateboarding. Russ Howell and Alan Gelfand's days were long ago, as Dogtown, at least through their skateholding advertising, paved the way for the new generation of skaters. Because Dogtown got all the attention, they could push the next step. <br /> <br /> It's a great documentary in the way it is put together, although Stacey Peralta always knew how to do this himself when producing Bones Brigade mini-movie / skate demos like "Ban This" and " Search for Animal Chin. " Sean Penn explains that the movie is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, features lots of great archive footage and lots of interviews to give you a true sense of who the Z-Boys were and how they made their mark on skateboarding.
