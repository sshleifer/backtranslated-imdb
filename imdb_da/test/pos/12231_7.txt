Most Christmas movies have a "redeeming" theme, but most are a variation on a very similar plot. This movie is wacky and has an unusual plot. You may have to hang in there in the first half where events may seem hard to believe in a movie (but not as incredible as real life - Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, says he has never done anything in any of His cartoons - they are all based on real stories told to him by his fans). The second half begins to fit in the plot. I enjoyed it. One reviewer noted that the idea that a person does not have money available is not credible in these ATMs, but it is entirely credible if you have lost your wallet - who carries an ATM card somewhere else while on business?
