This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is truly original. Just sharing porn, adventure and musical comedy - this movie is definitely a strange adult movie story. <br /> <br /> Alice is a sexually naive biblicist who ends up following the rabbit into "Wonderland", where she meets all sorts of "experienced" entertainments like the food hat (who likes to pull out his dong when it's possible), Humpty Dumpty (who broke his wiener with his shell), Tweedledee and Tweedledum (a brother / sister's sex-crazed duo) and the bi-sexual queen - among others. <br /> <br /> This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is actually pretty much of the standards of the time - a time when much porn was medium-spirited and nasty (as noted by "roughie" sub-genre) - this is actually quite fun and strange endearing. These are the kinds of things you want to show your children - if it wasn't for the graphic gender. A little slow to get to the "good things" ... but really entertaining. Oh - and some of the musical songs are actually funny. If you're a drinker - get a couple if you're a smoker - roll a pair and give it a shot. 8.10
