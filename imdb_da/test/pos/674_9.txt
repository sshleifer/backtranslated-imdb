The subject is World War II, and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as a craftsman. She's a warlord. <br /> <br /> The set is limited, but the play is here. Robert Ryan is in conflict: for a moment he feels good, so confused about where he lives. First, Lupino tries to help him. He seems uneasy but not more dangerous. But how do we know it? The suspension builds. I really enjoy movies like this that rely on the human element of excitement. What is this man capable of? There are some scenes with O.Z. Whitehead and Dee Pollock as an annoying merchant who sees something are wrong. We continue to think that she will be helped so ryan personality again. He becomes like a Jekyll / Hyde character and chasing Lupino with a knife. Worth looking at these two amazing actors. 10.9.
