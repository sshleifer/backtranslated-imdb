A gem from Japan where so many of the world's best movies are made today. Stylistically, this is not something special. It's just a simple drama (with some comic overtones) about recognizable people going about their lives. Yuko Tanaka, known for expressing the character Lady Eboshi in Princess Mononoke, plays a 50-year-old spinster. She is proud of her health and spends a lot of workout every morning as she delivers milk up and down the steep hills of Nagasaki. After finishing this part-time job, she works as a clerk in a grocery store (called S-Mart, who made this army of dark fan giggle). Along her milky way, a 50-year-old man lives whose wife dies. It turns out the milk woman and the man, a child servant, dated in high school, and each apparently still has some in love with the other. In fact, the film has some great narrative problems. When the screenwriter actually wants to combine the two effortless lovers, he uses a rather incredible deus ex machina technique. The climax sequence is also really forced. But most of the film is beautifully small and alert to the two main characters, as well as many side characters. The film also has several subplots that seem to eventually weigh down the film, but never end up doing it. I think that the best part of the film is Tanaka's heartbreaking performance as the lonely milk woman who has fired herself into being alone for the rest of her life. No matter what the problem was, the movie largely exceeded them.
