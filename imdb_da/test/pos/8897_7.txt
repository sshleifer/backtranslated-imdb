It's a shame that Asterix and his friend Obelix don't get worldwide recognition that other cartoon comics are getting. <br /> <br /> This is another fun Asterix cartoon stuck in entertainment. The animation is excellent and the voice characterization good, although the synchronization is a little out. The music and score fit well into the story, and the slot in some modern music tracks is a nice touch. <br /> <br /> Running time is short, and while it's not the best Asterix story or the most developed cartoon, it's good fun. The modern (Disney-like) animation will catch children, Asterix fans and new comers ... Enjoy the Gaul adventure!
