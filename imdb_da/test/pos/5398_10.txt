IMAGINARY HEROES is a nice little movie! Written and directed by Dan Harris, this story is classical theater, comedy and tragedy weaving together so closely that the film's climax separates you. <br /> <br /> The Travis family is a weird lot: no member is whoever seems to be. Starting with suicide from the reluctant 'hero' child's swimming master Matt (Kip Pardue), Father Ben (Jeff Daniels) falls apart and isolates himself from his family and himself, while mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) turns to the pot and rage and sarcasm , daughter Penny (Michelle Williams) comes back from school rejected by her family's behavior, and returning son Tim (Emile Hirsch) bases everything above by avoiding his classmates, girlfriend and team with his neighbor Kyle (Ryan Donowho) to jump into drugs and sexual experiments. Throughout the movie, Tim tries to hide bruises on his body that has a secret completely, yet lead his boyfriend to feel rejection, his mother shouting against the trailer park garbage bully she thinks is the cause, and finally opening the window to The depth of this family has been for years. Secrets and lies here, and their resolution is painfully dramatic. This may be Sigourney Weaver's finest role, though Emile Hirsh, Jeff Daniels, Ryan Donowho and Kip Pardue (despite his role) all contribute to top-notch performances. The story begins slowly and seems to meander, and the fact may lose some viewers' attention, but stay with this little power movie and the effect of the work will disturb you. Highly recommended.
