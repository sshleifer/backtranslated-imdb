This is one of my favorite horror movies all the time, and I used to think it never got its fault. That's until I read the glowing reviews here. It seems that many feel the same as I did when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> It's a crazy, crazy movie, and I've spent most of my life watching crazy movies. I've always found dolls, mannequins and such astonishingly scary! Check out the dolls in "Beyond The Door" and of course the big "Trilogy of Terror". And what about the amazing Twilight Zone episode "Living Doll". Hell, dolls are scary! And the Tourist Trap has some moments that will make your hair stand on the back of your neck. All helped by an excellent soundtrack that just makes Connor's performance even more heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> I remember watching the trailer of this movie on sennat tv and stuff, "Wow, I have to see it!" It was memorable. And it's one of the only trailers I remember seeing as a kid who shot me out. Took me years to see it, but it was a treat. <br /> <br /> Stephen King also mentions this movie in his "Danse Macabre" book and gives it a glowing recommendation. Very good company. <br /> <br /> This movie will always be high on my list of must-see. It is a really solid addition to the genre of the time and deserves place along with the best of the 70s schlockers.
