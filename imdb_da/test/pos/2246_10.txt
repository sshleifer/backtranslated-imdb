The slightly overstayed episode of the previous week renounced uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights. There was a definite deus ex machina taste for the cutter's resolution, but it was a good start for all that. As is common with this physician, the moral, ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were at the center. They were always there in the classic series, but they were a problem getting glossy over when the doctor was in the heat of battle. This regeneration even excuses a cyberman during the fight! This episode finally shows that Mickey mentions the heroic side that had been suggested in previous episodes. His journey from zero to hero is complete, and it has been quite convincing. With scares, humor and scenes that brought a lump to the neck, this episode had everything. After much consideration, I can finally say that the new series enters the classic series in all respects. Coming from a die hard whovian you can't get any better recommendation than that.
