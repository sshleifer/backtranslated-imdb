I felt compelled to comment on this movie because it is listed as the fourth lowest rated sci movie of all time on IMDb. WHAT!?!? Sure, this movie is crappy, but it's HILARIOUS! It's not terrible at Ed Wood level, it's more surreal and uneven. <br /> <br /> There are some classic moments in the movie. Brain surgery is rough and big - and even nuttier when you consider the movie was rated PG! Go hunting for his dolly before he gets battery acid dumped on his face - "My! Gimmee!" Zandor Vorkoffs speaks at the beginning of the movie - "Before Amir was Kali just another weak nation struggling to break free from centuries of stagnant feudalism!" Angelo Rossito also has some good lines - "No, Gor! No!" "You want those keys, not you, my beauty?" It is quite wrong that this is the 4th lowest rated sci movie on IMDb because it is entertaining. No matter how bad a movie is, if it still manages to be weird, quirky, disturbing or entertaining, it has merit and does not deserve to be dumped and fired. I don't want to defend most of Al Adamson's movie, but this with Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD OF GHASTLY HORROR are entertaining enough to make up for their horror.
