Many experienced and outstanding actors merged into an ongoing plot of an incredible part of World War II on the east side. Characters well portrayed and unforgettable. An episode leaves you wanting the next. Pay attention to the final credits where thousands of Shtrafbat battalions are listed. An incredible story involving hundreds of thousands of individuals. Sometimes brutal, sometimes romantic, always filled with real people and dialogue. Made with excellent sets and camera work. Heroes and villains, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. Portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome a most horrible time. I want to buy a copy for my own collection to enjoy the series repeatedly.
