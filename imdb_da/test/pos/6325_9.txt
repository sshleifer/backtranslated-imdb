The section begins with scenes of a dead woman rinsed on the shore, an abandoned Jim stroll along the beach lost in reverie and a night drive home ending in murder and mystery. Yep, this is an atmospheric little number with a super twist at the end. Jim does well to cancel what is an inexplicable case that a woman goes away 20 seconds after she enters her home. To be sure, the final explanation is somewhat overlooked. Why, for example, go to the length of replacing a woman midway through a road trip, when you just rub her and her companions out would have been so easy and left less of a track. But these niggles aside are a memorable TRF episode filled with the invention, even though YET AGAIN Jim is put in the frame of an ever suspicious Police Dept. I mean to say that the ungrateful is so ever down and spoken just how many of their files have been resolved by dear ol 'jimbo?
