I went straight to the big screen to see this kicker. This is the only flick I know that Tarsem Singh has corrected, but boy was it intense. This movie was a total stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind. The people were alive and and nothing less than creatures created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is frightening and interesting and completely bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no one else I've seen except the level of being beautifully odd. In this respect, it's a pretty big step over 'A Clockwork Orange'. Definitely watch this movie on the big screen and don't wait for it to come out on the tape. It won't be half as good on tape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not to freaked out easily. It will clutter your mind and leave you with pictures that take a while to forget. But for those who like to be freaked out ..... Enjoy!
