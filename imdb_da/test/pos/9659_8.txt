It is film about love, violence, illegal affairs and Romanian tycoons. A Romanian history combined with an occidental adaptation that results in a modern international film that can be understood both by Western audiences, but also by Eastern European audiences, which LANG has forgotten about the conservative comunist regime of film making. <br /> <br /> A movie full of fierce fighting scenes that are very numerous and create more and more exciting situations as the film continues. <br /> <br /> A story that impresses because of its view of the hard life of the neighborhood. Two young men make illegal car rows. They work together as a team and thrive on their occupation, but when asked by a local tycoon to lose a race, things get messy and the fuse from the bomb lights up to create a very tense movie that keeps you close On screen until the end of it, when you still want to ask yourself many questions long after that. Brilliant plays both by Dragos Bucur and Dorina Chiriac along with high quality management and screenwriting of the young, but talented director Radu Muntean also gives a unique charm to Furia. All this and many other elements that can be noted while you have seen, have created one, must watch movies of all the film laws around the world, and its message is clear to everyone, not depending on race, language we speak or country. It is a real hope for the Romanian cinema as it tries to follow the more advanced occidental cinema. I hope you enjoy seeing it as I am sure all the people who have seen it liked it and understood it.
