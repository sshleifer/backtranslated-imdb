If you like shoot em up westerns this is a keeper. I thought the movie was fun to see and see people I haven't seen in a while. I'm not an expert, but I liked to act. The city and the props, etc. Seemed to fit the period and the kind of city you would find out on the border. This is not a western, not enough people and budget. Costumes and firearms were correct for the time being! I expect to see the young actors in the movie again in the future. Rachel, Chance, Rebekah and Kirby were great. The SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) members who contributed to this effort were pretty good. Hope to see more.
