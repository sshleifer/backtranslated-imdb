"Icky Flix" is an excellent starting point for anyone with a vague interest in the residents. Most of their classic videos are present (although "Earth vs. Flying Saucers" and "Do not Be Cruel" are inquisitive), and the "concentrates" of their various CD-ROM projects provide exciting flashes on how the orbeders have Used their time since they realized MTV, they no longer put in strong rotation (or actually show video period). All the videos in this compilation feature hit striking images and idiosyncratic music (with a choice of the original tracks and newly recorded ones). And two of them - "The Third Reich 'n' Roll" and "One Minute Movies" - are in the Museum of Modern Arts permanent collection. Check out this DVD and find out why.
