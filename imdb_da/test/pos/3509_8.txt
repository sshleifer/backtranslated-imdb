The cover of VHS says it all: "Without a doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since Texas Chainsaw Massacre". I am a big fan of the 70's and 80's slashers, and I have to say I agree 100%. The characters are credible, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as a forest ranger). There is the twisted atmosphere that only TCM has, an astounding soundtrack that reflects the emotions and movie spots that are the most beautiful in the horror story. This must be one of the most beautiful shot horror movies all the time! Jeff Lieberman, director of this 1981 low-cost film making and outstanding work, added with his other works (Blue Sunshine, Wrong Turn), he must be one of the most underrated film industry directors today.
