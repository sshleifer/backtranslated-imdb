Better than it has the right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. Sometimes sophomoric, with others, bitterly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde are mostly just an almost perfect reflection of the times, laden with drugs and sexual humor, and reminiscent of one at some point of everything from Woody Allen of "Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sex" to Mel Brooks of "Producers", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong. Watch it, listen carefully because some of the jokes go by very quickly and remember a time when comedy was allowed to be offensive fun.
