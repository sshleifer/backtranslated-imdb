Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through. It describes the life of a strong woman named Rachel Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson). Rachel is called Nanny by anyone who knows her, but she might as well have been called Wonder Woman. She epitomizes strength, willpower, trust and loyalty. She owned a home, which she used to house, almost every type of person the community would reject. Her tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputant, and a number of other vagrants who made the home away from ordinary. Each subsequent event, Rachel took off and handled flawlessly. She was not a dictator without compassion, but in fact she was quite the opposite. She showed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to expand herself. <br /> <br /> Merkerson did a good job, but I think this role was right up in his alley anyway. The movie had a smooth club that never departed from Rachel. Of course, there were dramatic moments, but they were to be expected. Nothing was ever shocking or profoundly anything but Rachel himself.
