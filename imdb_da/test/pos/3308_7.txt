A very entertaining screen version of Rona Jaffe's best-selling boiler boiler about the trials and tribulations (and of course the love) of a group of women involved in some way in the New York publishing industry. Directed by Jean Negulesco, quite fresh from the success of "Three Coins in a Fountain" and the prototype of "Sex and the City", except that here is all about everything on the screen. <br /> <Today's bright young female talents (Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Suzy Parker, Martha Hyer) are all nicely thrown, while Joan Crawford appears as a Queen Bitch by an editor likely to eat Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly and spit her out; with absolutely no effort, she steals the movie. The men include Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan (if it wasn't Rossano Brazzi, it had to be Louis Jourdan), Robert Evans (before deciding to go behind the camera) and Brian Aherne. There are more suds on the display than you would find in your average laundry, but if you like "Desperate Housewives", not to mention Carrie Bradshaw and company, then you will probably love this. A very guilty pleasure.
