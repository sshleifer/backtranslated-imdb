Talking about competitive features at the Split Film Festival, we have titles from around the world. China, Korea, Canada, the United States and Australia, and many of these stories indicate that the world is really dull of tears. Modern love ... that's for sure. <br /> <br /> In the film by Alex Frayne, two younger married people and their boy travel from town to coast to visit the tomb and the house of man's uncle who raised him long ago and who died in mysterious circumstances. The coastal town seems like something in an American horror movie, where the village is bizarre and people are unusual mutants. But episodes in Alex Frayn's pastoral cannot be described as horror in the normal way. In fact, this is an extremely interesting drama where we see relationships and horrors through flashbacks and much more. In this story and through apparently psychological facets of the actors, we are shown a glimpse of films that are a charming eccentric Australian film production. Thus, this is the case with Frayne. Always something new and fresh. Visual intelligence and unique sensitivity among some Australian directors are amazingly good. Frayn's movie is super. There is something in the Australian landscape that shows their film as special as we see in FRAYNE's modern love and in the RAY Lawrence movie Lantana and Jindabyne. It looks like it will be the same in future titles by Alex Frayne.
