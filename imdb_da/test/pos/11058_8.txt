This was my first Gaspar Something movie I've seen, and I have to say I was shocked. I don't mind doing in general, but it's not even doing it, it's true slaughter. For some of you, a few scenes may be impossible to see and I mean really disgusting. The abandonment of these aspects, the main ideas revealed here and the dialogue are quite brilliant. When you get a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the way it is given, you can't stop and take a moment to think about it. The actors did their job well and represented ordinary masks of a hand-stick few people found at the bottom of a sick society. The movie is full of metaphors, but I let you find them out. Don't look at it if you want a little relaxing time. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants something to think about or just see something else on what you find in your average movie theater.
