Are the sea side resorts the sad, boring places they are always depicted as in movies and novels? Certainly this movie, along with the near-contemporary "Do Not Look Now", shows Venice as a particularly scary and decadent tourist trap (for more luminous approach, see "Just Married" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy). Never been to Venice, I cannot say for sure, but it makes a perfect setting for this gloomy but lavish play by Luchino Visconti, one of the great stylists of the world cinema. After watching the movie, which I now want, I had made myself read the Thomas Mann novella that it is based on (which also inspired an opera by Sir Benjamin Britten). Since I do not know the background and the film has suffered from plot or exposure, I leave myself about Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde) 's obsession with young Tadzio. Is he gay? A pedophile? Or is his longing for the beautiful youth something more innocent? Maybe Tadzio reminds him of what he might have been and now knows he will never be. Those complaining about the slow pace of this movie should stick to car crashes and kung-fu: in 2 hours and 15 minutes, it's not very far, and it moves in a relaxed but hardly slow pace. The film benefits from Gustave Mahler's fantastic music, on which Aschenbach's character is clearly based. Dirk Bogarde gives a moving performance, and the film is characterized by the presence of Silvana Mangano, one of Italy's amazing beauties, as Tadzio's mother.
