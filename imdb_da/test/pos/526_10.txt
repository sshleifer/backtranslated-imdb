Never have I ever been so impressed with a movie like this little piece of four groups of people facing a crisis or many. In some ways, like short pieces, but quite different at the same time. There is a pile of lead characters that we all learn to know very well when their stories unfold and they are, as people show their good and their bad sides, their weaknesses and their strengths, with lots of drama and laughter. <br /> <br /> I can think of the closest equivalent in an American film, which is so far weaker in all respects Royal Tenenbaums. <br /> <br /> The Four Shades of Brown, as the title would be in English, tells the story of a stressed hotel company and his wife and his older parents (who travel magicians); about the receptionist at an animal crematorium and his family's misadventures; about the members of a cooking course (who mostly talk about their excused life) and fourthly about the funeral of a female trotter jockey trying to continue orchestrating the family beyond the grave by singing and appearing in 3D during the funeral thanks to high-tech equipment that has cost its entire happiness (the family becomes zero, not even the famous horse is given to the family)! <br /> <br /> There is a warmth and compassion in this movie filled with sorrow and laughter that I have never experienced before. <br /> <br /> Most of the players were new to me, except Robert Gustafsson and one or two, but they all deserve the big slam film taken on the Swedish goldbag extravaganza (= the Swedish Oscar Awards) for a a week ago! <br /> <br /> Male, female and male supporting actresses went to this movie plus a few more to start! <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, go and see it - the hours flow very fast!
