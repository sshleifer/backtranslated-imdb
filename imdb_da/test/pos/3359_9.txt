25 sitcoms had large screen spin-offs. Most of these came in the 1970s. Here is a list of all: Are you served, black-eyed, blessing this house, the bottom, father's army, Daddy's father, for the love of Ada, George and Mildred, Lord of the Lord, love your neighbor, the lovers, the man of the house, Closest and Boyfriend, Never Mind Quality Feeling the Width, On Buses (3), Please Sir, Cry, Rising Steam, Steptoe and Son (2), It's Your Funeral, To Death, We Do Part (2), Up Pomeii (3 ) Whack-o, whatever happened to the true lads and the whoops apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Then there was a big screen jump from my ever-preferred sitcom Dads Army. What the film focused on was when the men were enrolled. It showed the difficulty of getting a uniform and getting weapons. It was a great summary of the first series of Dads Army. At the end of the film they catch some German spies in the church. The housekeeper is going to dress as altar servers and had bayonets with them and defeated the Germans. The best bit of the movie was when they showed an HG lecture and a German lecture at the same time: German: Head office on the phone, you would get 10,000 bombs (CUT TO HOME GUARD) GODFREY: Mrs. Mainwaring on the phone you would get 1 / 2lb Brussels Sprouts. <br /> <br /> This was probably the second best sitcom spin off movie, just by Till Death us do Part (1969). It would have been better if it had already been formed at the beginning of the film, it was halfway through the war. Although it is still an excellent movie, a good one for the family.
