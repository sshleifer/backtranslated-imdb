A small town school teacher (Geena Davis) slowly begins to realize that she has little amnesia and really uses to be a secret assassin! Soon there are men after her and a private private investigator (Samuel L. Jackson). <br /> <br /> This was action packed, with some great special effects and really fun single-liners (especially from Jackson). Although the action may be a little stupid at times, who cares? After all, movies aren't supposed to be a good time? Craig Bierko is fun as a ruthless villain. The movie itself was a good time. Just don't expect to think too much about it, because if you take it too seriously then the movie won't be fun, but stupid instead. This movie does not deserve to be called stupid or another bad name.
