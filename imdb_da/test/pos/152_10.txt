After seeing Oldboy, I was a little disappointed with the rest of Park's work, some of which is good, but it never approaches the level of humor and originality that Oldboy had. This does, it's not like Oldboy in plot or style, but the same level of quality is there. <br /> <br /> The action is good with Kang-ho Song, OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin delivering outstanding performance. In particular, Kim manages to switch from the horrible horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest mistake. The plot is weird with lots of twists and turns and takes a great twist on the vampire clich√©s. <Br /> <br /> The management is tasty with tons of pace and humor all over and some of the most memorable scenes I've ever seen. It boasts what is probably the weirdest love scene you will ever see. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie.
