Nana Patekar again shows that he is the best actor who works beyond doubt in Bombay. His latest film involved shouting his lines, which did not bode well for theater-educated thespian. One wonders why he does not always get his prizes during the prize period. <br /> <br /> "Shakti-The Power" was one of his flicks that was a complete disappointment with Kohram (an effortless chance to create screen magic with Amitabh Bachchan). <br /> <br /> But Patekar exudes a cool calm in this movie, which plays a policeman on a sort of social justice journey. Throwing the streets of Bombay by underground down in fake meetings, Patekar's character takes control of the screen (and viewers' attention) and never lets go. The editing is tight and there are no annoying songs to distract the story. <br /> <br /> Like the modern cult classic "Company", the movie is well-acted, directed and should have a long-lasting DVD. The last ten minutes that see Nana and the biggest villain on his offshore port are bound to be part of Hindi cinema classics. Will not be dissapointed with this police and robbers flick.
