Not only unique to its time, but one of the greatest science fiction movies all the time. Made without CGI on a very lean budget in today's adjusted figures. Stanley Kubrick made this film without the high shooting conditions he usually has. Stanley Kubrick is without a doubt the greatest instructor in history so far. <br /> <br /> This movie was cut from five hours to two hours and twenty minutes, and the art direction was amazing. Stanley Kubrick and the great Aurthur C. Clarke collaborated to write this time less classically. <br /> <br /> Foreigners have a special message on the ground with human birth and one on the moon as the modern man finds. <br /> <br /> Finally, People accompanied by the most advanced computer ever made for Jupiter find the next monumental message that turns out to be a gateway. Anyone who studied movies and / or wants to be part of the film industry or just enjoy great movies must experience this movie. <br /> <br /> If you don't like it, you belong to Bollywood or your real Aussie.
