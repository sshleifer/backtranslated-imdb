Scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years. The signs are interesting, although it is a little predictable. The comic timing written in the script is more than enough to compensate for a well-worn underdog plot. When you are sure at the end .... OVERVIEW! Recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate a galley scene in particular! Great film!
