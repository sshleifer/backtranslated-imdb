Comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years with Mike Myers' 'Austin Powers' and Rowan Atkinson' Johnny English ', and recently Steve Carell in the big screen version of the hit' 60s shows' Get Smart! '. <br /> <br /> Back in 1974, it was David Jason who had a shoulder hollow and had an attach√© case full of documents labeled 'Classified'. 'The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs' was his first lead role in a sitcom, after several years being a supportive actor in, for example, 'Six Dates With Barker', 'Doctor' series and 'Hark At Barker'. <br /> <br /> Humphrey Barclay had found him working in a brewing theater in Bournemouth and was sufficiently impressed to include him with Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Eric Idle in the children's comedy show 'Don't Adjust Your Set!' . <br /> <br /> 'TTSLOEB' cast Jason as 'Edgar Briggs', a well-meaning but incompetent Secret Intelligence Service agent. While John Steed had a Bowler Hat, Briggs had a trilogy. While Napoleon Solo carried a radio pen, Briggs owned a tube. Objects were broken in his hands. He read confidential documents in bed while his wife (Barbara Angell) went through women's own (on one occasion it would be the other way round). When he traced a few Russian agents to a heliport, he accidentally hit the airport's Tannoy system and sent his plans to catch them! When he hid on a train to photograph a meeting between a S.I.S. man and his enemy contact, moved it with him on board and took him directly to Brighton! When he tried to organize the absence of a female Russian scientist, he took a "shortcut" to escape his persecutors, only to close hopelessly lost in a parking lot. But as' Inspector Clouseau 'he always seemed to get out at the top at the end, much to his colleagues' dismay. <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, he was married. His wife Jennifer was understanding of the kind of work he did. Even though they once had a row that resulted in her shouting at him from the window on their high surface: "Secret Service this Secret Service that you never stop thinking about the secret service!". He shouted, "Think of the neighbors! Don't know I'm in Secret Service!" <br /> <br /> Briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included 'Coronation Street' villain Mark Eden (he was the psychotic Alan Bradley) as' Spencer ', Michael Stainton as' Buxton' and 'Doctor at Sea 'Elisabeth Counsel as the lovely' Cathy Strong '. They replied to 'The Commander', played by late Noel Coleman. The commander was kidnapped in an episode and temporarily left Briggs in charge of S.I.S. - which of course horrified everyone. <br /> <br /> This hilarious show was by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna who had written for the 'Doctor' series. Instead of forging Bond, it was more of a send-up of the serious spyware like "Callan" (although it had a Bond-style theme song). Furtive meetings in underground car parks, code breaking, stolen missile plans, such things. Jason put a lot of energy on the role and made many of his own stunts, which Briggs dropped from a ladder, decorating his apartment and tumbling down a hill in a trash bin and reminiscent of those found in 'Pink Panther' movies . <br /> <br /> 'Briggs' had all the ingredients to be a smash hit. Unfortunately, it was not networking. In the London area, it was postponed on Sunday at. 7.25 P.M. where it was trounced in reviews of B.B.'s soapy drama 'The Brothers'. It was then moved to Friday at 7 pm P.M. because I.T.V. wanted to showcase his latest US import - T.V. version of 'Planet of the Apes'. Briggs never found an audience. A similar fate found Jason's next big show: 1976's 'Lucky Feller'. It was not until 1977 and 'A Sharp Intake of Breath' that he found his first successful solo vehicle. <br /> <br /> You can see the title sequence (along with two short excerpts in German!) for this series on Youtube. Unfortunately, it's all you can see. Jason will not allow his early star play either to be repeated or released on D.V.D. A big shame. Currently, Edgar Briggs's life must remain secret. <br /> <br /> CODA: I've seen a number of episodes recently, and I'm delighted to say it's pretty good.
