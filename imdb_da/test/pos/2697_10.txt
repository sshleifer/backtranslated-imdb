I haven't seen a better comedy than King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz-turn and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thanks AA. The action from the whole team is top notch and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all the actual cast is actually the play fantastic. I love all they threw, they are so funny. There is a hard edge in the King of Queens that I love and rarely see in today's television comedy. Both Leah and Kevin play each other so well that every situation is trustworthy and fun fun. I just bought the 2nd season while I was in Az this week and I intend to buy the full set next time I'm in the US. My 20-year-old son also loves this show and its brilliance is that it has the magic of reaching out to different generations. I would like to thank all those involved in this amazing show - it is so appreciated to see this kind of TV show in what I believe is an era of poor TV show in general these days except for the re-runs of Seinfeld and such like ... thanks for a good show ..
