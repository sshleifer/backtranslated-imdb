This movie tells the stories of several couples who handle post-WWII life. Through many moving accounts, the audience learns how the war has changed people, while their human spirit continued to prevail. My favorite scene is where a young servant who came home as a double amputant (after losing both arms up to the elbow) is sure he would not be good at his treasure, who will still marry him. His girl simply said she would help him with the things he couldn't do, but that they would be fine together. Moved by this true demonstration of love, the man embraces his fianc√© in tears. <br /> <br /> The scene where a servant asked for a bank loan is also a highlight. When initially denied as a "high risk", a higher ranking bank officer takes over saying "You fought for our country and kept us safe - that's good for me. Your loan is approved!" "The best years of our lives" won 6 Oscars, including a special statuette for the disabled actress, who showed us everything life is going on and will continue to be worth living even with a serious handicap. This movie is a joy to watch over and over again. A true classic! Highly recommended!
