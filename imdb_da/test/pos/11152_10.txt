This has become one of my favorite films and certainly one of the best westerns I've ever seen. Having a soft spot for the genre (Western is or was, since they are no longer done very often? Moral plays too often rejected by critics with intellectual predicates), I bought the DVD, invisible because I had read enough about William S. Hart's work (much of which he wrote and directed) to pique my interest and thought that I should have at least one of his films in my video collection. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I was approaching the actual view with a little trepidation. My previous experience with quiet cinema "classics" had left me feeling let down. Chaney's Opera Phantom, Griffith's Birth of a Nation and Fairbanks' Mark of Zorro were fine, but not as good as their reputation would lead to an expectation. They were either too long or too theatrical or both. <br /> <br /> However, the customs gate arose as a pleasant surprise. It is a story told in a simple and straightforward way. Black Deering (played by Hart), head of a notoriously successful ban, believes that the time has come for the group to be resolved before luck runs out. However, he is contradicted by his supreme lieutenant Jordan, who spawns them all in a last wave of promising great wealth, but leads them to a trap where he is involved. Everyone is killed except for Deering, who is captured. When his prisoners recognize him as the man who once rescued a number of soldiers and settlers by warning an outpost of an impending Indian attack, they allow him to flee. Free, he tries to find honest work, but is stubborn and ridiculed and eventually has to rob again to survive. Soon he is not only pursued by the sheriff's poses, but also by the Jordan (now thriving on the reward he has collected) and his henchmen. His flight leads him to a remote cabin inhabited by a single mother and her little son. After some initial concerns, they take him into their hearts. Deering sees a chance for a new life, but with the realization and Jordan closing in you realize that this may not be possible. <br /> <br /> Hart was the first major Western star and the first to inject realism into the genre. As one of the pioneers in film making, he created many of the characters and situations that have become cliché in Western for more than ninety years. What keeps his film interesting, however, was his ability to go beyond the cliché (perhaps his imitators have not gone far enough), so the material appears fresh and innovative, even now. Three such cases in The Toll Gate illustrate this: <br /> <br /> 1) In a scene, his character shoots into a crowd in an attempt to kill Jordan and kill a bystander instead. A subsequent close-up shows that he is clearly frustrated. However, the frustration does not come from the fact that he has shot down a man who had so far not caused him harm, but that he missed his intended goal. <br /> <br /> 2) In another, as he flies from the possen, his "borrowed" horse enters a gopher hole and breaks a leg. Hart pulls his gun out of his misery, but before pulling the trigger, his head gives a dull, loving pat, as if to say goodbye to an old friend. <br /> <br /> 3) And finally, after he smashed Jordan and threw his body over a rock, he returned to retrieve his weapons and stains his opponent's gun lying on the ground nearby. He steps forward and gives it a quick kick before mounting his horse. It is a simple gesture, but it underscores the deep disgust he feels for the man who betrayed him and his companions. <br /> <br /> And I love the title, The Toll Gate. It is allegorical in its influence that a man cannot begin a new life until he has paid for the sins of his old man. Deering's payment comes in the form of victims. Today's more sophisticated audience should not buy into the voices altogether, but it can still work on you if you let it. Viewers who like their videos in pristine condition will undoubtedly object to the DVD's picture quality, especially the badly worsened final roll. I don't mind at all. The fact that a copy of this 1920's movie even exists at all is a miracle, as prints of so many other silent films have been lost. If you have that in mind and look at the movie as a piece of history, its visual error is not that difficult to accept. <br /> <br /> Born in 1870 in New York, William S. Hart grew up in Minnesota and Wisconsin, where he learned to speak Sioux and Indian sign language. He counted Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson among his friends and collected Remington paintings so his knowledge of the West was first hand. If his vision seems excessively romanticized by today's standards, it is still much closer to reality than the spaghetti westerns of the 60s and 70s and the revisionist works that followed. Both the star and his films are delayed for reassessment.
