This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs (though I openly admit that I haven't seen many others, anyway). It is very silly and thoroughly fun, which is hardly more than a few minutes throughout the whole two hours of running time, where you are not entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comic effect, few of them fall flat. I watched this movie right after watching and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two movie films, I realize exactly how high quality this movie really is. It's fun from start to finish, none of the comedy is exaggerated or boring. The music is fantastic, as is the choreography of both dance and struggle. The action is basically what you would normally expect from this type of movie ... Elwes is a great comedian and does a good Robin. The reason is typically Robin Hood, more or less everything from the legend is embedded in this movie (and spoofed majorly). If you like Mel Brooks, or you're just a fan of stupid humor, or you just die to see a good parody of Robin Hood's legend, it's definitely the movie for you. HBO First Look especially on the film is also worth looking at, and in that you may also want to keep an eye on the entire credit. I would recommend it to any fan of Mel Brooks movies and to people who enjoy silly humor. 10.7
