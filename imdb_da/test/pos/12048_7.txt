I've seen many of Shahrukh's movies, and it's a very good role for him. He has such versatility, but he remains largely in positive roles. Like Rahul, he is very dark and disturbing, but I found myself sympathetic to him much of the film. Otherwise, watch this movie for Shahrukh. He plays a very complex and genuine character very convincing. The story is very typical and has been done before, but the character development is very strong and entertaining. The opening is a little confusing, but in the end it doesn't matter. The songs I found very sympathetic and give insight into which characters are thinking. Very smart. I think this movie was very good and recommend it to all Shahrukh Khan fans. It's a must see!
