This is a black and white film from France, <br /> <br /> Simple plot, gangster on the run seeking and getting help etc. We have seen this type of movie many times over the years. What makes this movie different is mainly its play and style. All the actors perform quietly, no one shouts and hardly anyone loses their mood. There are quite a few deaths, some surprising. There are also beautiful women, but no sex scenes. No car chases either. <br /> <br /> Just talking / It's so refreshing to listen to people talking, and here we also read the subtitles. <br /> <br /> The action is almost perfect by everyone. especially the management of <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura & in a smaller but decisive role Jean Paul Belmondo. These 2 actors were among the best. I said above that the movie is defective. There are a few script defects in few points. They are smaller. The play is the case in this movie. Production is also first rate. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 4) 88 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
