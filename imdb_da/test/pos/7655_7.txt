Latcho Dream, or Safe Journey, is the second movie in Tony Gatlif's trilogy of the Romans. The film is a visual depiction and historical record of Roman life in European and Middle Eastern countries. Although the scenes are mainly planned, repeated and staged, there is no conventional story line, and the dialogue does not explain activities from scene to scene. Instead, the film allows the viewer sometimes to have a glimpse, sometimes a more in-depth picture of these people in different time periods and in different countries, from India, Egypt, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France and Spain. /> <br /> The importance of music in the Roma culture is clearly expressed throughout the film. It is a vital part of every event and an important means of communication. All they do is expressed with music. Dance is another important activity. Like Romany music, it is specialized and deeply personal, something they only know how to do it right. We get glimpses in their daily activities, but the film is not a detailed study of their lives. Rather, it is a testament to their culture, focusing on music and dance that they have created, and which have made them unique. <br /> <br /> Mr. Gatlif portrays the nomadic groups in a positive way. But we are also witnessing rejection, mistrust and alienation that they receive from non-Roman people. It seems that the culture they have developed in countless generations and inspired by different countries will fall into oblivion because conventional society has no place for nomadic ways. <br /> <br /> The other films in the trilogy are Les Princes (1983) and Gadjo Dilo (1998).
