This was a great surprise. I was up late last night and couldn't sleep. Not really thinking twice, I switched on my TV and HBO was on and this movie was just beginning. Luckily I saw it all, and I'm very happy about it. Because this movie was very good. The actors were well-groomed and they did a surprisingly good job. Kris Kristofferson delivered a solid performance, there was a lot of substance behind his lines. This movie made me realize that he is a good actor. Brian Keith was great as his father, just as Trey Wilson played the Colonel (this was Trey Wilson's last role before his incredible death. He was a quality actor and seemed like a good guy). Jobeth Williams also did a good job as Kristofferson's American wife. As for the direction, I had no idea that Franklin J. Schaffner was director until I read the review in the Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide (this was the last movie he ever made). Now I understand why this movie was so good. Schaffner also instructed Patton, a great movie (I haven't seen his other great movie, Papillon). As I looked at "Welcome Home," I told myself, "This director rightly knows what he's doing", without knowing that Schaffner had corrected it. There is a really beautiful scene in a Thai orphanage, enough to bring tears to your eyes. Not only was this sensitive, but it was also very economical and tight. There is nothing wasted in Schaffner's efforts. The script was a reason why this movie is so good. The author does not weigh the actors with too many lines. It was written very simply but very efficiently. It only shows you that much can be said in a few words. This movie also made me proud to be American while showing you how beautiful ALL people are.
