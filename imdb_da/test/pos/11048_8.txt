This movie is worth it, despite what you might hear. The performance of Marie Dressler (I hope I spell it right) as a drunk old soot is reason enough to watch this movie. It's a great achievement. She is in a drunk silly in three scenes for a good long time, and she never does the same twice. You can actually smell the alcohol when she is done. Amazing. And Greta speaks of course his first lines on film and shes well. The Eugene O'Neill story is solid and like most O'Neill stories, very deep and intense. This is not easy entertainment, but if you appreciate the big character actors from the 30s and 40s, you will like it. Some of the film is technically unclear, but all in all worth it.
