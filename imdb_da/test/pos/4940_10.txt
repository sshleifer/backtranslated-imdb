This just started on television when I opened it, and when I felt lazy to change the channel, I ended up seeing it. Man, was so lucky. <br /> <br /> This movie is more of an adventure than a demanding drama, and sometimes blatantly sentimental. It's definitely what one could call a good movie, and I usually find it either boring or annoying. But this movie is so well done that I couldn't help loving it. Scripture will not twist your brain; It is conventional but flawless. The actors are brilliant, each one is a perfect fit for the role. There is not much of a score, but the pieces of music increase the film beautifully. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate other things than expensive pyrotechnics, evil murders or save the world in a movie, see this if you ever have the chance. 5.5
