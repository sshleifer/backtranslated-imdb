I'm sorry to see that SURFACE has not been picked up for the NBC 2006-2007 season. I suppose the demand for inane games and reality shows on broadcast television, a reflection on our sense of culture, has captured a good story. I hope and pray that some networks will pick it up so that it will continue, just like STARGATE and it's spin-offs. <br /> <br /> I also hope the producers find a place where they can produce the level of Post Production they wanted in a TV guide interview. Right now, reruns on Sci-Fi, marathons, must do. I for one would love to see where the story goes after the tsunami ending episode 15. I would like to find out the mastermind for the effective effort to confuse the real identity of the creatures. <br /> <br /> FYC Morningbear
