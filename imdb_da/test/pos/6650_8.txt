I really enjoyed this Minghella epic, not thinking as much as "The English Patient" (a modern classic). The first 20 minutes or so feels awkward, but when Inman (Jude Law) starts the journey back to his love Ava (Nicole Kidman), the movie takes on leaps and bounds and it becomes a very memorable, thought-provoking romantic drama. It is apparently fashionable to hate Kidman at the moment, but I do not agree at all, and she does well here. In fact, I think the romance between Inman and Ada is poorly developed in the manuscript (they really don't get much time to develop a relationship), but Law and Kidman gives it their all and convinces. Ada's journey is the core of the movie - she becomes a strong woman who can carry almost anything. Zellweger initially seems all wrong as Ruby, but she grows at you at all and glitters in many of her later stages. The film has beautiful photography and set design, but never really captures the true sense of time. Jack White has especially long straggly hair and a pale rocker skin that looks completely out of place with the setting. Cillian Murphy fans will enjoy watching the talented Irish actor in an early part, and Natalie Portman actually proves that she can act in enough movie's most striking order. It's a shame that in "The Other Boleyn Girl" she is so inadequate.
