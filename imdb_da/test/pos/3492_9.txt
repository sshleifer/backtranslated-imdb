The way I found out if this movie was when I looked at American pie 2, at first it had a trailer for Ali G indahouse, I saw the trailer and it just forced me to buy the DVD, it looked incredibly fun! so the next day i went to my local store and picked it up to Â£ 3.99 (Bargain!). The film is about Ali G, who is a "gangster" of the western dye's massive crew member, whose rivals are the eastern colored massive crew member. Ali has a "Cub Scout" package with children, teaching them how to survive in the "ghetto" by teaching them to swear and steal cars after Ali finds out that the government is stopping the money coming to the leisure center. where Ali teaches the kids, he runs for MP for coloring and overturns another MP in his attempt to get rid of the leisure center to make room for an airport in waters. Throughout the movie there is laugh when Ali gets up to some crazy things! Borat shows a few seconds in the movie too, this is a clear must watch movie for all your Sacha Baron Cohen fans out there!
