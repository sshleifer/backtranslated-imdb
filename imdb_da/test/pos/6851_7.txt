More of a near miss than a flop, MR. IMPERIUM stars Ezio Pinza as Alex, heir to and later king of a small European nation who falls in love with a willing American actress and entertainer, Fredda Barlo (Lana Turner), but due to the machinations of the sloth prime minister Alex as king, beautiful played by Cedric Hardwicke, lovers separated for 12 years before being reunited in Palm Springs, where their love is revived. Director Don Hartman, who also scripts, is unable to fully exploit his talent for cunning dialogue because of Pinza's provisional English use, and the necessary rewrite combined with less than the overall report in evidence between the two stars results in a some raggedy tone to the manuscript, aggravated by the scary cutting of many scenes in the study, leading to a confusing ending. The overwhelming Pinza dominates her scenes with Turner, but both artists score with good work, while Marjorie Main is impressive with her poetry as written, with Debbie Reynolds on the course of Louis B. Mayer for SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN as a result of her strong performance here; Only Barry Sullivan is the victim of the fluttering cut. The film is beautifully recorded largely in Pebble Beach, California and in other Monterey County surroundings. Equipped with Pinza's strong operational basso in Solamente Una Vez, as well as with original songs by Harold Arlen and Dorothy Fields, with Douglas Shearer, who superbly manages the sound recording, and draws attention to the fine sets of decorations by Edwin Willis and the effective costume design by Walter Plunkett.
