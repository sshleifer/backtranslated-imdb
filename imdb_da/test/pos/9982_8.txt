Both Disney and Bill Paxton did a great job in conveying a story that is actually based. You don't have to like the golf game to appreciate the story of a man's battle to overcome the odds. It could have been based on any sport or simply on any other situation involving competition, even if it is just related to golf. The only problem I have with the story is that I wanted to look a little deeper into each of the protagonists, esp. Mr. Ouimet. Mr. Francis Ouimet is a typical young man of his times, the turn of the century America, where "class lines" are well defined, and how is it for anyone who dares to try to rise above his "class" standing. I did some historical research and my biggest question was actually answered to my satisfaction. Although the circumstances are slightly different from those depicted in the film, I got away with a sense of content. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I think you will too.
