For years I have had a distant memory of watching this movie, I looked online to find it somewhere and couldn't find it anywhere so I thought it would have disappeared. <br /> <br /> TO ... my spruce showed me a box she sent off in the Daily Mail and I probably won't be anything decent in there, but to my surprise there were jewels The Water Babies ! I hadn't been so excited for a long time! It's a big light hearted movie, the songs are not memorable enough, if I were a child during the time it came out, I would have stuck in my mind more. Unfortunately, it was just a movie I looked at my neighbor 10 years ago when I was a little spud. And looking back now, the animation is horrible! And the recovered voices they do to get a wealth for the sound of movies are all out! But who cares when your child you never think about the things, even if they lead a boy is about 10 and sounds like a boy in the middle of puberty. Great classic kids movie!
