Film noir meet anime ... brilliant! This was one of the highlights of the surprisingly creative Animatrix shorts. This was one of my favorites, if not my favorite (I also loved the world record). This is basically a reference to the classic film noir detective stories and films from the 40s unless it is animated and involves the Matrix. But by being animated, it is able to take the extreme camera angles, detective lifestyle, shadows and all film noir to a whole new level. Femme Fatale? Trinity. The detective in this story seems to live in the 40s of his mind, but firmly in a modern world, and everything becomes too much for him when his case suddenly involves science fiction and agents when a mysterious woman in black enters her office ... <br /> <br /> My grade: 9/10
