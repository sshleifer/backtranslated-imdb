This is one you can see again and again and laugh as much every time. We have been to a Keaton party around here after purchasing some of his films. In this one, Buster is wrong for a runaway killer, and there are plenty of hunting scenes and crazy scenes, but also what's best about Buster - his creativity. The opening scene is really fun, and it just stays from there.
