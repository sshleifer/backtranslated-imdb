If you are a child of the 80s and haven't seen this movie, you have failed to be a true child in the 80s. How can you not love the big chipmunks (don't forget the chips), lines and songs. Years later, I can still sing every word to each song. The story is amazing and much better than the movies for children today. It's just fun and worth renting, though everyone is adults.
