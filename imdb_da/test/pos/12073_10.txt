I have nothing but praise for this movie and cast, especially Ann Margaret. But more importantly, I praise my in-laws, who were (and were) adoption parents of Warren and Frank in real life. I met most of the "kids" at Warren's wedding in 1989. This is a great story and is even more incredible for me to know the family and what everyone went through. It is also fun for me to see how my parents were portrayed in the movie. It was pretty accurate. My wife even enjoys seeing some small details like a toaster that she remembered from her childhood. Yes, it is a hard movie to watch, but so wonderful and fervent. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this story for me is how many of the children went through my in-laws, and as a result of marrying their daughter and having Warren as brother-in-law, how many I've met in my. For the past 20 years, this story has been part of my life because of what my mother-in-law has shared with me. And know Warren. For what it's worth, Warren lives in California with his family. He married his high school sweetheart, which he re-enlisted at his 20-year-old high school. <br /> <br /> There was a show in the 1980s called "That's Incredible." They had a reunion of the family, who also had to meet with the show. <br /> <br /> For everyone's interest, the DVD is available in the UK and Australia. It's a hard video to get past here in the US, and I haven't been able to find a DVD here yet.
