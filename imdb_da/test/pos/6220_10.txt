Jäniksen vuosi is one of Jarva's most political films. It takes a strong stance on the authority status of today's society in the life of the common man, and how it has completely depicted men of nature. It challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society. <br /> <br /> The Vatican (Antti Litja) - smothered buys the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations - trying to confuse society's chains by escaping it all to the Northern Finland's desert - only to realize that the concept " free land "is not so clear, in other words, society has the common man by the balls. <br /> <br /> Still the thing that makes Jäniksen vuosi so unusual - in addition to the visual and humorous brilliance - is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere of Finland in the 70s, as well as the whole Finland's identity as a nation. Vatican is like an archetype of a classic find in its solitudeess and social abstinence. As nature has always played such an important role in our Finnish national identity, the whole idea of ​​being slowly removed by modern society, Jenkins vuosi is emotionally moved emotionally.
