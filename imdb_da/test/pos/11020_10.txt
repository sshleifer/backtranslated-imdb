I like movies about quirky people. "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is perhaps my favorite in all the time so you can imagine I had a blast with this one. It is certainly not one to see if you want to get away from smiling. This film is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are even frightening, even after several views (because this kind of thing can really happen). It will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire trip. And after you see the end, if you are not severely disturbed, you should really check yourself for a pulse. The action was phenomenal. Marcy, with her rather extreme case of tourette's, changes from quirky-cute to utterly scary, sometimes so out of control that she looks like undead. Seth was also great. The focus of the movie certainly does not matter as much on him as it does on Marcy, though he happens to be the one who gets the most momentum as a thriving character. <br /> <br /> It's a classic love story with some unconventional phrases, and it's also my favorite love story next to "True Romance". There are two bad reviews for this, but one of those people who gave such a review did not have its facts straight and did not admit to watching the whole movie while the other just searched for some Hollywood tensions without the deep characters (and perhaps a little was thrown by the blunt's obvious thoroughness, as the ultimate goal was to steal a black bobbi head from a toy store). The point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something "normal" or "idle". This one is messy and indie as it may be, and will not let you go to the heavy climax.
