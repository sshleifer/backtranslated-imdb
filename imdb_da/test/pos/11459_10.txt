I must say. This is easily one of my FAVORITE movies to watch on Halloween. The halloween party, the scary action, the guy dressed like and extra from Miami Vice. GREAT GREAT GREAT !!! <br /> <br /> ********************* SPOILERS ************** ****** ******* <br /> <br /> I have a big place in my heart for random 80's horror flicks, and this one came out and hit me by my heart strings. I always pass this flick on Blockbuster and always laughed at the box cover. Now every weekend I wanted to catch a random movie I had never seen before ... a weekend it was Angela's turn. She seemed to have scared me for months. So I took it home, put it in and spent most of the film under the blanket. <br /> <br /> For me, it was scary and rough. And not just the actor! Some of the things they came up with for this movie were AMAZING. I can honestly say that the best part for me was seeing Suzanne (played by a colleague iowan) holding a tube of lipstick through her nipple. It was random, and I loved it. Watch crazy Angela FLOAT through the hallways and hear her scary demon voice was enough to wake me up all night long! <br /> <br /> It's not one of the most clever or best-acted horror movies. But 80's cheese and it has all the items you need. Creepy Goth Kid, Virgin, End, Naked Girls, Scary House, Bad Acting, Oh and Did I mention Naked Girls? All the elements were there and were put together in such a way that one of my fave films was made. Kudos for the filmmakers.
