Seen in the 1970s Los Angeles, Christopher Boyce has just left the seminar school and returned home, where his father gets him a job where he monitors intelligence documents. His old friend, Daulton Lee, is a ratty dick drug dealer and gets trapped in a setup and has to choose between becoming a narcissist or facing a long prison prison. When he is on bail, he jumps and heads to Mexico City. Chris offers Lee in a partnership to be his messenger to sell secret papers to the USSR embassy in Mexico City because of the disgrace he feels about the US government's control over weak countries for their own gain. But over time, the two begin to clash with their motivations and find themselves somewhat larger than they originally intended. Director John Schlesinger has spun out such films as the respectable "Midnight Cowboy", "Marathon Man", "Sunday Bloody Sunday" and "Day of the Locust". While "Falcon and Snowman" may not be held up so high, there is no doubt that this deeper espionage drama (inspired by a true event) is an unfairly overlooked character portrait. Everything about it is a rather subdued affair with no true grandeur quality that hits a massive mark. The movie's driving factor should be the admirable, versatile lead performances of Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as the two ambitious young boys Chris and Daulton. Penn is particularly good with its unpleasant intensity, which works well with Hutton's super cool and gathering trip. What starts just as easily, we see the situation gradually crumbling as the two amateurs really find themselves out of their league. The highly detailed and symbolic (predatory behavior) plot is primarily centered on the couple's relationship and their thinking is for their actions, which ultimately shows us the knotty developments that led to their downfall. The plan opens up like a wound that can never be cured properly because of Daulton's drug abuse, which really causes him to get out of the rails and leaves Chris to pick up everything slack. The hurting political aspect is there, but it focuses on the themes of idealism (Boyce) and greed (Lee) to get its point across. Both do not mix and the results show. Suspension is justified by its stimulating pot-boiling script and character interactions than that of any visual gimmick. The action is very small, but there is still a pressure-induced style for Schlesinger's safe and realistic dark 'n' gritty direction. Pacing is mostly handled well, although some sequences seem to wake up for too long, but it grabbed you as it plays on its authentic paranoid tone to slowly build up to an exploding tight latter. Adeptly fluency in technical production is an airy harrowing music score and professionally exciting movie. The support molding is exceptionally fine with Pat Hingle, Lori Singer, David Suchet, Boris Leskin, Jerry Hardin and Joyce Van Patten. Also look out for Michael Ironside in a small part as an FBI agent. <br /> <br /> A most outstanding spy movie that is largely derived from talented lead performances and by not playing the usual stakes. It is more an emotional trip, so a complex one of the twists and turns. Recommended.
