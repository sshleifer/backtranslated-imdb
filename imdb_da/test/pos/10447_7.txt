Spoilers: This movie has its problems, but ultimately the message becomes cross. I liked it because it ends up with how things really do. The fine guy is trying and trying, causing the heart to break several times, but in the end there is no typical Hollywood end. It ends up that such things always end or at least always have in my own and friends' experiences. Anyone who thinks that the end of this is not how it really happens, as the first comment seemed to believe that the girl would come around, realizes that she is dating an asshole that treats her badly because he struggled Don't care about her is either naive or living in a more perfect world than I am. I give it 7/10, extra points simply because it was not afraid to end up on a down note, giving no real resolution, just the protagonist left heartbeat, confused and alone as so many men in countless generations have been before.
