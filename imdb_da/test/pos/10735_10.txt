No, it has nothing to do with sitcom "Seinfeld" or its eccentric and hilarious character Cosmo Kramer. In fact, Kramer vs Kramer is a fine drama movie, undoubtedly one of the finest of its kind and one of the greatest films ever. I'm glad it won more Oscars than "Apocalypse Now" because it really deserved such glory. "Kramer vs Kramer" is an excellent movie, so well made and so perfectly balanced that I wouldn't change anything in any way. There's nothing wrong with the movie. It is film production of the highest quality. And it's also the test of time. Not only does it appear to be dated, but its cultural effect is long-lasting, and its realistic story remains as great as it was when it came out in 1979. A timeless classic. They don't make movies like this today. This movie is dramatic, realistic, simple but brilliant, intense, powerful, sweet and even tragic and depressing sometimes. But it also has good humor. It has no special effects, but who cares? This is not the movie or the place to discuss such things. For a movie like this, such things would be meaningless and absolutely unnecessary. The story is very interesting. The actors' chemistry is just perfect. All the players are good, but the three most important are the very best. Dustin Hoffman, a brilliant actor, has her greatest achievement ever as the beloved but distant work colleague Ted Kramer. Meryl Streep is great as Ted's wife, Joanna. And cute little Justin Henry is great as the loving, but sometimes stubborn Billy, son of Ted and Joanna. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is all instrumental and wonderful. The opening song (by guitarist Frederic Hand) is brilliant. The rest of the soundtrack is mostly Antonio Vivaldi's classical music and is simply dazzling. <br /> <br /> This movie picture also has an incredible development of the characters. See the character Ted Kramer: a workaholic who becomes a great father after he has been overthrown rather than taking care of his son and trying to adapt these new responsibilities with his work after being left by his wife Joanna. With this, Ted learns about the most beautiful things in life, but also understands how even life is, with the problems of his job and the return of Joanna who wants the custody of their son. But even Joanna is changing for the better, and the end is an unexpected surprise when you see this for the first time. <br /> <br /> This movie also has some things though things like courtroom scenes where both Ted and Joanna face a brutal character murder solution triggered by the lawyers. Another thing to see is when poor Billy falls off a jungle gym with his toy (a plane) and is seriously injured on his face. But then again, the scene is very well made, and what comes next is very intense: his father runs fast and crosses several blocks and ignores the traffic to take his son to the hospital. All in all, this is a movie that is a good lesson in life. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be on the Top 250.
