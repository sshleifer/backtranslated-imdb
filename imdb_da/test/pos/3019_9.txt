*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** CELL / (2000) **** (out of four) <br /> <br /> Do you think that is part of yourself, deep inside your mind with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see the things. "<br /> <br /> - Catherine Deane <br /> < br /> And we do that too. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, "The Cell" is a love / hate movie, whether you love it or you hate it. I can understand the reasons why some people do not like this production. With a story combining disturbing serial killers with mind-probing, "The Cell" is too much for some viewers; others will not understand the film's complex actions and feelings. I think this is one of the most exciting films of the year. <br /> <br /> Making his feature film debut, Mark Protosevich creates an imaginative world of rich colorful images and provocative characters. The filmmakers take advantage of every shot. Protosevich devised ideas for "The Cell" in 1993 when he decided to combine two of his great interests, mind-searching and serial killers. He was reportedly influenced by such directors as Wes Craven, George Romero and David Cronenberg. They will probably be proud of such a fantasy. <br /> <br /> The film combines two great tales, one on the scientific exploration of the human mind and the other on a psychopath that kills young women for their own sexual pleasure. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), a child therapist, is part of a neurological study at Campbell Center, a research clinic. Because of her empathic personality, the researchers chose Deane to enter a catatonic preteen hoping to revive her brain to wake up. A sick, demented serial killer kills the streets. Within an abandoned rural house, Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) locks innocent female victims into a large glass cell, then drown them and perform sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies. The killer escapes from the FBI every time they approach, until now. A violent seizure makes him comatose. The FBI captures its eternally unconscious body. Unfortunately, he has already prepared the cell with his last victim. For forty hours, the cell will fill up with water, and Stargher is the only man who knows his victim's location. <br /> <br /> The FBI takes this situation to the Campbell Center, where Catherine enters Stargher's mind, hopes to discover the location of his latest victim before the cell fills with water and sends the woman to an aqueous grave. The science fiction of history is based on both true science and theoretical fiction in the creation of the neurological cartography and synaptic transmission system. The assumption takes a long time to develop, but it is worth the wait. It's far fetched, but it doesn't matter. The film makes us believe. Although you do not suspend disbelief, the visual enticement provides an exciting setting to enjoy. <br /> <br /> According to the film's production notes, Mark Protosevich was thrilled to work with the director named Tarsem because they both think visually. Tarsem Singh is known for his attention to detail, great artistic direction and highly developed abilities to tell a story. "When I wrote" The Cell "," explains Protosevich, "I surrounded myself with postcards or color copies of the painter's paintings or photographs while I was working. So I think visually, and Tarsem is a very visual director. visual references that made it a very smooth collaboration. "Vincent D'Onofrio gives the film a backbone and no actor could have achieved his character better. He delivers a mysterious, disturbing and engaging performance. "I think my character is somehow trapped in itself," D'Onofrio thinks. He also examined the serial killers psychology to help him get him under the surface of the character. His in-depth performance preparation pays off beautifully. <br /> <br /> While the actors, writer and director are doing wonders with their material, the real honor goes to the film's backstage talent. Director of photography Paul Laufer, production designer Tom Foden, costume designer April Napier, special effects coordinator Clay Pinney and visual effects indicative of Kevin Tod Haug. They bring the world of "The Cell" to life. It is an extraordinary world worth more views. Some movies you see, others you experience. "The Cell" falls into the later category. <br /> <br />
