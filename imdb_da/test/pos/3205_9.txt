I really like this show. It has drama, romance and comedy all rolled into one. I'm 28, and I'm a married mother, so I can identify both with Lorelei's and Rory's experiences in the show. I have mostly watched the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I'm not up to date on what's happening now. I think women want this show more than men, but I know some men out there would enjoy it! I really like it's an hour long and not half an hour since th hour seems to fly when I see it! Give it a try if you've never seen the show! I think Lorelei and Luke are my favorite characters on the show, though mostly because of their way of being with. How could you not see anything there (or take it so long to see what I think I should say)? <br /> <br /> Happy viewing!
