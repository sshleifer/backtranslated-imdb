I've seen this movie more than once. In fact, El Padrino was one of the best feature films I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> There was a great cast Jennifer Tilly, Faye Duanway, Brad Dourif and Damian Chapa who really shone like a real star in this part of Kilo. <br /> <br /> I heard this movie was shot for under two million dollars. I have seen movies shot at 33 million that are not comparable to the quality and the production value. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa why don't you get offers and more movie work !!! EXCELLENT JOB !!!!!!!!!! I can't wait to see the sequel and I hope it has the same action. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly has made a cool classic character with Sabeva. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa moves coolly in every scene like the movie stars of the 40s and 50s. So nice to see these non-charismatic actors like Ben Stiller get all those movies when there is talent like this that has something to show. a good movie. <br /> <br /> GO GO KICK NOW BUT IN SALE EL PADRINO !!!
