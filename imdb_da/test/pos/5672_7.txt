** SPOILERS ** Looking for a little more excitement as we see that crocodiles are fed by local game reserve sisters Grace and Pat, Diana Glenn & Maeve Dermody along with Grace's boyfriend Adam, Andy Rodoreda, decides to take a trip upstream in the desert and deserted, of human habitation, Australian Mangrove Swamps. <br /> <br /> With their swamp guide Jimmy, Ben Oxenbuld, at the wheel of his motor boat, they get up four of a huge saltwater crocodile that quickly grabs and pulls a frightened Jimmy down to the bottom with him. Grace Pat & Adam ends up stranded on a tree in the swamp with Pat hanging on for dear life on the nested boat. The rest of the movie has the hungry and targeted crocodile playing a cat and a mouse or crock and human, a game with the trio ending in a showdown on a mudflat, where the dead and worn-out body of jimmy finally came to rest. <br /> <br /> Both the director and the actors in the film take full advantage of the swamp, which sometimes makes it much more frightening as the giant crocodile swims in it. We're going to see the killer crocodile about half a dozen times in the movie, but all of them hit you and Jimmy Grace Pat & Adam right in the intestines. Still, excitement was held by the giant reptile that always does its damage during it, so unexpectedly, that, the crock attacks, have far more effect when you don't see them coming, as in the last ten minutes of the movie when you do. You wonder right from the start, who would eventually survive the crocodile attacks and eventually live to tell them. The end of the crocodile's human confrontation was about the weakest and most unrealistic part of the film. <br /> <br /> The crocodile, which was both so cagey and efficient in the previous scenes, seemed to have beaten or swam out, not having either the force or speed to intervene with its deadly jaws and ending the sole survivor of the expedition . In fact, killer crock was so ineffective that even after giving his victim or sacrifice, he just couldn't hold on to them. It eventually turned out to be fatal from his side. Much like the "Jaws" movie "Black Water", the killer crocodile, like the big white shark in "jaws", is more interested in killing its human prey and eating them. With all the food available in swamps and rivers that he inhabited the crocodile, only after the quartet, Grace Pat Adam & Jimmy, to invade his watery domain, which he felt was the great ruler of. And to be bold to do so, they had to pay with their lives!
