I watched this movie as Skywalker02 did, but when I managed it again and with formal movie experience, psychology and life, I had time to really take my hand and start beating myself. I really click the movie. I remember the payment for service cable channels played this thing almost to death, like poltergeist when it first came out and many other popular movies. I felt it again, it was not worth getting up and constantly "airtime" (I know cable not really on air) given it, but I was very young and adult situation drama would not have and should not have worked. But the latest display of the movie has informed me on the movie. I think Susan Surandon and Molly Ringwald would probably study the script together and I would be a little surprised if Surandon had coached Ringwald during this project. Ringwald's other projects, but good ones, have not shown her the potential depth as this role. Surandon nailed her, as did Raul Julia. Cassavettes and wife provided acceptable performances, but at times I admit that first-class plays turn to mediocre. A constant ebb and flow to the play takes place in many scenes, but generally I can see why the story may require the dynamic to become more subtle. <br /> <br /> Overall, I don't find this movie to be "take me out and drown me" kind of boredom party like Skywalker02 wanted you to believe. I think maybe with the right psychological training and a little more hardship in one's domestic life strategically placed with some movie courses, this movie may seem different. I would say if you feel a little melancholy and long for a simpler life and you have had your share of marital disagreement among dysfunctional family units then this movie might provide more insight and entertainment than you might think. I feel it's a classic and find it much more entertaining than mainstream movies that have to share many of the same elements, such as. Terms of Endearment that I could worry about could be removed by a few extraordinary notions by Jack Nicholson, then ceremonially burned until nothing is left. (How can a movie as such get more attention than this. Talk about boredom.) Best thing, don't take my word or anyone else, watch the movie and support our industry.
