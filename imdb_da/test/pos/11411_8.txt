The film is about a girl who is not just going to a bonfire because she is baby-sitting that night. Nothing weird about that, right? Until ... The phone is ringing. Until ... The phone rings again. And again ... And again. It's not some stupid prank calls. This is too real. To see how the girl responds, just watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Great atmosphere filled with scary sounds. Very well done by young Camilla Belle who got the lead role. I see in her a great potential for becoming a good actress. This is more than just a decent thriller, I have no idea why it is so undervalued. Anyway, in my opinion, this movie deserves more than just 4/10. 24% of all voters rated the movie with 1. Get serious people. You couldn't get a better thriller for a title like this one.
