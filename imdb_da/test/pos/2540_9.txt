In his descriptions of CAA, platinum briefly took lunches in Hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in Provincetown never, and free travel to Nicaragua, funded by Columbia images. It sounds narcissistic, but Spalding Gray (possibly because of his unusual personality) shouts the audience, laughs at himself (perhaps because he didn't take the Hollywood case so much) and makes us break. <br /> <br /> This monologue is not just about "The Kill Fields" or "Swimming to Cambodia"; It is more a pastiche of events that he sees them. Some of the lines are classic as when Gray meets the renowned talent agents at CAA. The conference table is ... "full of them, tanned, healthy, fresh from drinking blue-green algae from an Oregon lake ... There are no drugs now in Hollywood." <br /> <br /> This was before the tragedy occurred. Many of us will miss his off-balance humor. 10.9.
