This movie is amazingly free of storytelling. It is a pure experience where the music overshadows the visual impression. - Words cannot, of course, express what needs to be expressed, but it is the requirement of the chatter classes that chats be presented, enter into the production lines of mediocrity, and therefore a necessity to express any reasonable thought or meaning about something that should not be degraded of chatting. Therefore, these elaborate opinions are presented to satisfy the empty thoughts that must be filled with noise that you do not find difficult to try in this movie.
