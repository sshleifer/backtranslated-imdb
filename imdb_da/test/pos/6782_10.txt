This game is an action / adventure game. There are quite long periods without a fight, but other times you have to get rid of different kinds of monsters. The monsters are not something you would see in real life, and they must be removed to continue your quest. The whole game is a quest. You play Adam Randall, whose father contacts him from the other side and asks him to come and save him. The game is from the mid-1990s and must be played in DOS. I used Dosbox and was able to play the game quite well. The graphics are not as good as some games though time, mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes look pretty blocking, but others look smashed, but don't let it get you off the game. The game is very imaginative, it is long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters look like nothing. Not for young children who would probably not be interested anyway, but over 13 or 14 like this game. It's a horror mystery action adventure game combination. I thought it was a good game. Its had to find it now. Maybe Ebay. But remember it's a DOS game and you wouldn't be able to play it on today's faster computers. It would be hard to play on fast computers unless you use Dosbox. Oh, and the actor is also very good.
