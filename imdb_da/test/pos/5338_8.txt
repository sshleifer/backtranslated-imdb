If you haven't seen the movie yet, but you like comedy, go out and buy or at least rent it! The fact it won, the Oscar animation, is not a case! I have not seen many other Wallace & Gromit movies (in fact I think I only looked at someone else), but humor is very distinctive ... and some will say very British. In a good way of course! The story will only be an excuse for all the jokes coming, but even if it is not the most elaborate, it still seems (by the way, my niece seems to see one of the great surprises that come. I didn't do that, Kudos to her ; o)). I think after you see this one, you go out and search the other W&G movies out there. Have fun!
