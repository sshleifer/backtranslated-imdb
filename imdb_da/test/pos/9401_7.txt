I recently rented Twister, a movie I had seen several years ago on television, and it has been aged well; I found myself high and separated several times on it, and as weird as all these people are, in the end I deeply cared about them. This is the kind of little movie that is made for a cool audience, because it looks like Howdy's gazpacho (I think that's what it is), it's an acquired taste: you need to adapt to its own wavelength. The production values ​​can be called the charter cheaply, and the pace and atmosphere take a while to be settled, but the film has a "look", especially in some wonderful shots that contrast the dry flatness of the country with the eerie nouveau-rich opulence of the Mansion interior: Michael Almereyda had a good eye even then. The life of the soda magnate Eugene Cleveland (Harry Dean Stanton) and his household (two adult children, a grandson and a housekeeper) seems so detached from life outside that we could be in Gormenghast. Everyone in this movie is wonderful (especially Suzy Amis and Crispin Glover as the pointless genius siblings Maureen and Howdy) who inhabit their roles as comfortably after a while, you just buy the weird premise that somehow survived the tornado And apparently not being able to happiness, these people are fortunate and yet do not quite know what to do with their luck. There are some really amazing scenes: Eugene's sudden confrontations first with his gold-engraving children's television hostess Virginia (a sour pert Lois Chiles) and then with her children; William S. Burroughs takes aim in the barn and tells a story of a mysterious Jim; Maureen's boyfriend Chris proves himself by struggling with a shed full of wasps dressed in a tablecloth and doily and old fedora; Howdy, Violet, Maureen and Chris all sit on the couch (the last three in appropriate lightweight summer clothes, the former in a red blazer and black leather rock'n'roll gear) staring at pictures of deserts on the big TV and contemplating the future ( The pictures were made by Bill Viola, who made the video installation for Nine Inch Nails' last trip. Crispin Glover is predictably magnificent as Howdy: As always, he stays entirely in character. Howdy has made a cult of his misery and shine; He is like Oscar Wilde of Kansas, who strives to live up to his red velvet suit. Whether he's knocking off tuneless but still high on an electric guitar, breaking a full-blown bullwhip while wearing an all-black cowboy outfit, demolishing a room or even doing simple things like driving or pouring the aforementioned soup from a blender jar is he is fascinating. If you like his work, you like it here.
