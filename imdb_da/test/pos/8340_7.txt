This is one of the movies that look so "dated" that it's part of the fun to be like that. You see and hear things you would never see or hear on the silver screen today. Some of it is good; in some cases it is too bad for words, some of the bad (depending on your views on certain cultural issues.) <br /> <br /> In this short (68 minutes) 1931 movie, for example, you have: <br / > <The grandfather of the family, mentioned in this story, elaborates on the value of patriotism and why one should speak against criminals to the good in the United States (see picture in today's movie!) <Br /> A district attorney ( Walter Huston is almost begging for death sentences, and the people are shown to support it 100 percent (once again, the image in modern movies.) <br /> <br /> Along the way, you have some shocking violence like a young boy is sometimes retrieved and literally thrown his head into a closet, and his father is picked and swung repeatedly first to a wall. This is a hard thing to say the least. <br /> <br /> But the movie is characterized by comedy, mostly by the patriotic grandfather played by Charles "Chic" Sales. There are a lot of laughs to all those who see this unique crime movie. And for the soft hand, there are the two young boys, one of whom - Dickie Moore - became a rather famous children's actor of his time. Here he is just a little man of about 5 years, who understandably is not a polished actor, but you can see the star for him on the horizon. In fact, he did just the following year with a solid performance in "Blonde Venus" with Marlene Dietrich. <br /> <br /> Still, it's an entertaining movie because of an effective mix of violence, comedy and sentimentality .... and it has a good sense-good ending and a thought-provoking message. It was also an Oscar for "Best Writing, Original Story." I'm sorry to say it's only available for viewing on cable TV, as it has never been put on VHS or DVD ..... and that's a shame.
