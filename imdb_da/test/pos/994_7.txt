This movie flopped violently in Britain and it didn't deserve it. The trailer for this movie is a little misleading, and I think it deceives critics and audiences to believe it was "Reconciliation: Part 2". While the film was marketed that way to take advantage of the previous success of Joe Wright's BAFTA winning movie, it is very different in tone. It focuses on a fantasy of the kind of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas' life during World War II as the author of propaganda films for the war effort and his subsequent return to Wales. Director John Maybury quickly introduces Dylan's (Matthew Ryhs) childhood treasure Vera Phillips, played by Keira Knightley. She was Dylan's first love in their homeland, but the moment has passed and the singer Vera will only have it as a beautiful memory. Or does she do it? Vera unexpectedly arises closely with the other woman in Dylan's life, "Queen of Ireland, love of my life, my child's mother" Caitlin Thomas (Sienna Miller). The three constitute a kind of menage a trois in battle in London, but Vera then falls to a dashing soldier, William Killick (Cillian Murphy). They married quickly, with Killick leaving for war. A frightened Vera convinces Thomas to return to Wales, but the three face the reality of Vera's children's birth, Wily's jealousy and shell shock after returning home, and Caitlin realizes she can't share Dylan with her best friend . <br /> <br /> Filmed on a low budget, this is more of a mood piece than anything else. It seems best to realize that some memories and feelings must be valuable, but not renewed. The performance of Sienna Miller is extremely widespread (unfortunately, paparazzi nonsense degrades the fact that she is quite talented), and Knightley and Murphy are again very good. The slush is Rhys like Dylan, who, while the Welsh poet himself was not a bed of roses, lacks charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in Dylan. The scripture is very rude, some beautiful moments scattered by blur. However, it is worth looking at.
