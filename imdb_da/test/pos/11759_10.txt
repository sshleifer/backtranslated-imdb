Homegrown is one of the films that fell through the cracks, but deserves better. When I first saw it, I had a weed-warm reaction. But over time it has really grown on me - no saying calculated ;-). The more I see it, the more I appreciate it. The script is top-notch as it is acting. Throw a few surprising cameos and good direction and you end up with a big little movie. It's also good to finally see Hank Azaria get a chance to shine in a lead role. And Thornton delivers its usual quality performance. Even relatively new arrivals Ryan Phillippe delivers and plays a friendly innocent with white and subtlety. <br /> <br /> On a side message, Homegrown is simply a "must see" if you are a Billy Bob Thornton fan. It seems that Stephen Gyllenhaal was influenced by former Thornton projects such as One False Move and Sling Blade (although Homegrown is certainly much more heavy-in-cheek than either). And Thornton's role as a sophisticated and down-to-earth character is a perfect match for the actor.
