This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. I think it's an x-rated musical based on an actual book! There is a real plot for it and how many x-rated movies boast these days? This is part of an exclusive shortlist of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat and Bag the Green Door. I think the problem of "pornographic movies" these days is that it is about "pornographic" and not about "movies". Alice in Wonderland has graphic depictions of sex, but it actually tells a story at the same time. Not one of the typical "Oh, Mr. Police Man, don't write me a ticket" plots, it takes it another step further and makes it a musical! Fabulous! If you want to see an example of "good" porn, this is one of the best.
