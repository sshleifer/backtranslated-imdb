I like the movie, it's the best pirate movie I've seen so far (forget the silly Errol-Flynn stuff and the Pirates of the Caribbean). This movie is wonderful melancholy. I compare it to "Johnny Guitar" on the ocean side (but 3 years earlier), two women are fighting for a man where mad food can lead one. The female character (anti-) heroine, Anne Providence, is amazing, acting without compromise as a child, lost alone on her quest for her own female identity in a real man's world. She is quite a strange movie hero, not a fun pirate, like most of her companions in this genre, does not make jokes all the time, fighting for the poor and good and only kills the stupid Spanish or British soldiers or - better governors, but she she kills all the poor prisoners of war after she has taken a ship (look carefully at the beginning of the movie), she is primitive (she cannot even read), she is desperate and she is an alcoholic, she loses all her friends because of her obstinacy and she wears cloths most of the movie. This movie shows a pirate "totally" little (!) Bit like him (or in this case "she"), but there has been a female "Anne" buccaneer, Anne Boney) could have been in a brutal reality. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty short, and the story is told in a breathtaking way. A 1950's film certainly has no exciting special effects for the current time-warriors (the ships swim very obviously in a bath tub), but this real drama of love (which kills), trust, treason, revenge, hatred and sacrifice drove a hero game. Perhaps Anne should even be Judas Iskarioth and Jesus of Nazareth in a person betrayed by his friend (the French LaRochelle) as Jesus; after being disappointed with the friend, delivered him to a death penalty (like Judas); than to repent (as Judas commits suicide in accordance with Matthew's gospel); and ultimately sacrifice oneself to save the beloved enemy (like Jesus). But even if you are not interested in these philosophical issues of guilt and reconciliation, the film gives a lot of (cheap) action such as sword fighting and burning (plastic) ships in a very short and a half hour.
