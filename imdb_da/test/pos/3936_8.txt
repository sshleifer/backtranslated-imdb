The revelation here is Lana Turner's dance ability. Although known as private for being an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film. So viewers notice it! Here, MGM still tried to determine in which direction they would develop the still young starlet, and therefore sent her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire. <br /> <br /> In "Two Girls on Broadway", however, she gets an excellent opportunity to show her native rhythm and ability to change pace in the lavish production number, "My Wonderful, Let's Dance." devised and filmed as a kind of hybrid between a Busby Berkely style sprinkler and the kind of routines Hermes Pan designed for Astaire and Rogers at RKO. <br /> <br /> Thus opens the number with George Murphy and Miss Turner depicted as bar patrons (with full cows) before a curtain of black lame where Mr. Murphy croons number for Miss Turner. Then, the camera (on a boom) pulls back in a remarkable crane shot to reveal a huge stage and a rotating set equipped with steps, columns, enclosures, and sliding walls. From this point on, Murphy and Turner perform a fast-growing array of moods and attitudes, including elevators, spins, soft shoes, and ending with an electrifying series of conjoined pirouettes ending with Murphy both boosting and spinning Turner with exciting speed for a racing band . <Br /> <br /> Everyone told a dizzying feat that proves that Miss Turner was fully capable of more than keeping himself as a dancer, although I daresay most of her admirers would bow to abandon her from her throne as queen of the melodrama.
