I think several others have already commented on this movie, but I liked it, I just wanted to say how good a movie this is. I gave it a rating of 9 out of 10. It didn't get a 10 because it's very slow to start. I almost stop it, but I'm glad I didn't. Stay in there, it's well worth the wait. <br /> <br /> This is primarily a movie about relationships: fraud, trust and fraud. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer, Jessica Lange and Jason Robards all slip into this movie. <br /> <br /> Seen in midwest farmland, Jason Robard's character is a farmer whose grandfather first settled there. Jason's character grows older and he decides to create a trust that shares the thousand acres of farmland among his three adult daughters. That's when the plot of this movie really starts to cook. <br /> <br /> Sisters face each other because of misunderstandings rather than greed over the country. They also make some discoveries about each other's childhood and their present-day marriages, including an infidelity affair, while the father becomes more and more abusive, demanding and paranoid - until the terrible truth of all finally boils. <br /> <br /> This movie really got me emotionally, I got angry with some of the characters and sad with them. I could feel their pain because of the excellent performance that was given. The end was a little surprising to me, but in keeping with the characters' growth. <br /> <br />
