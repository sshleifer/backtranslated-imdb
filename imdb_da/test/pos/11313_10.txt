I really liked this movie. I saw it last night on the Public Broadcasting System. The part I liked about it was that they dealt with problems today not in the future or the past. They had basically some terrorists, took a van or two and rented them out to be car bombs. I think what the movie could have shown was people in different countries at the same time. It showed the fact that England or any other country is not prepared for an attack of the magnitude they showed. I've never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie, so I can't really tell if they are usually their parts. After the film, they had this expert panel talking about whether something like this could happen here in the US. It was a thought-provoking discussion!
