George Carlin is probably my favorite comedian. I have seen so many of his offers and even had the opportunity to see him perform live. He had some cynicism that always appealed to me. His last 2 offers (life is worth losing especially and complaints and complaints) have lacked some spirit and content. George appeared overweight, old and tired (not to mention coming out of rehab). "I said not to mention it"! Nevertheless. Life is worth losing was especially tragic when he was overweight, unhappy, came out of rehab (we go again ...) and extremely unfunny. If there was a way to be upset by a comedian without hesitating him from the scene, George gained life worth losing. It's like the new millennium and post 9/11 America trampled George's spirit. The B's had become too big to handle. <br /> <br /> The comeback is partially successful with It's Bad for Ya! This particular is transmutation completed. George is no longer trying to revive his honorable days. He fully accepts his age, is old, and deals with the threatening prospects of death. He has agreed to be a crusty old SOB and is relishing in it. This is better than his previous offerings, but far from Jammin 'in New York. It's a little tragic. His observations are no more advanced and seem more Andy Rooney than Lenny Bruce. George is not George anymore. He no longer criticizes us, but is the man in the high castle that points to how things were and how uneven modern life is. <br /> <br /> This is an improvement over the two previous offers, but George does not yet claim his old glory. He has been reduced from critical social and political commentary to mostly personal demands. When he goes politically, he still has something to say. It is highly derived (especially if you have seen any of his previous work), but it still somehow works in contrast to his random rantings lacking some relevance outside the baby boom generation. The last 25 minutes are the best this particular has to offer. <br /> <br /> For now, I will worship the Sun and pray to Joe Pesci that George can recreate as a crooked septum. It's a 50/50 chance. Life seems to be more boring for George, and his "art" is now his life. This is a step in the right direction from his previous 2 offers but is far from his old self. Where does he go from here? He can never regain, but maybe he can further metamorphize / refine this new ornery old man routine. Heres hoping for 7 more words, you can't say on television or at least a windmill he can handle.
