It would be great if a discussion about this medium-length movie was initiated with a brief tale of hypocrisy of Hollywood people. It was in 1988 that Chuck Norris watched this film at the Cannes International Film Festival. He made a silly remark by saying that the meaningless kill depicted in Decalogue 5 is far more effective than killing filmed in his Hollywood movie with him as a potent action star. He talked about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally disfigured in Kieslowski's movie of a ruthless psychopath hitting him cruelly with a huge rock. There should definitely be no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified human society. This is why Chuck Norri's statement appears as a cruel joke that defends violent means in a society that is becoming increasingly restless. An honest reviewer would not make a mistake if he / she states that Kieslowski's movie "Decalogue: Decalogue, Piec (# 1.5)" has universal connotations. This is because Events depicted in Decalogue 5 can take place in any part of the world. The best lesson Kielowski gives to us relates to levels of violence that are acceptable in a just society. This is why the brutal slaying of an innocent taxi driver can cause a sense of reluctance in us. We would not feel the same hatred of kills when seen in films with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme, as they seem to be much too artificial. One can easily understand the special effects and modern study techniques can charm only infants, but makes no sense to serious movie enthusiasts. Kieslowski also mastered helplessness in humans to save fellow human beings from the being of death and misery. This is particularly interesting as it is repeatedly proven that strict laws and capital penalties have not been able to prevent murder.
