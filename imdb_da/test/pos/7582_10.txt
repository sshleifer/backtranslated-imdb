I'm not a film producer, but I know it's hard to tell a story in seven minutes and draw your audience into the character. Horses on Mars do this and more. When you see a good movie, you won't end it. That's how I felt watching this movie. It is visually expansive, and the microbe takes on such human qualities that you feel you are traveling with him. <br /> <br /> Really looking forward to seeing what exciting adventures Mr. Anderson takes us in the future. Well done.
