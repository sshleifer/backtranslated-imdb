Cure is a great movie about a boy with AIDS. I've been crying 4 times on this movie and it's just so sad. I can't promise that everyone will cry to see this, but it will make you. Very emotional and very sad, The Cure is a must-see movie. It shows you the importance of friendship and love and is an amazing movie. <br /> <br /> At first I didn't think it would be so big and wondering why my mother was always crying to see it. But now I know it's a great movie that's so original and so close to real-life situations, unlike most other movies that don't make sense. Words cannot describe the greatness of The Cure, just watch it.
