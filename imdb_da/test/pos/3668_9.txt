UNCONDITIONAL LOVE is surprisingly entertaining. While the plot goes into perhaps too many directions, making it a feature film, it never manages to charm and intervene in itself. The many plotlines that are warmly reminiscent of SHIRLEY VALENTINE provide ample smile, grin, wisdom and tenderness. It should not work, and at times it surely collapses, but forgive its inconsistencies, sit back and feel good. It's a charm!
