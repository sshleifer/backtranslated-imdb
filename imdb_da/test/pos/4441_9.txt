Documentaries where sons and daughters try to understand a parent and in the process their own life is not so unusual. Also, uncommonly, results reflecting the lack of talent, a lack of introspection, an abundance of narcissism, and perhaps an unrestrained search for publicly spoken vengeance for countless past hurt, genuine and imagined. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and exciting portrait of a fascinating parent, and "my architect: a son's journey" is the rare achievement. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face is irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident. He and his parents settled in Philadelphia, where the talented young loved art and music. Soon he became enamored of buildings and decided only that an architect's career would respond to his creative abilities. <br /> <br /> Kahn became an architect, but as it appears in this movie, it took a long time before he attracted the leaders of his Mark. An architect suggests that he was the victim of the "yellow bracelet" that anti-Semitism, along with sensation towards women, was by far an incomprehensible aspect of the American architecture industry. <br /> <br /> Upon reaching notice, he was clearly regarded as a confident working-class prophet who proclaimed unpleasant demands for his vision and only his vision to be realized. This inflexibility was the reason why, while making wonderful plans for many buildings, he built only a few. The interview with an old gentleman who fired Kahn in Philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a transformed city center, where people left their cars on the perimeter and entered the city, is fun. <br /> <br /> Kahn was born teacher and some of the extensive archive films here show him with the students, his voice is stable but passionate, their gaze respects and intensifies. Many architects were interviewed by director, author and project console Nathaniel Kahn, the architect's only son. Some are world famous - I. M. Pei, Robert A.M. Stone, Moshe Safdie, Frank Gehry and the still active nonagenarian, Philip Johnson. Their comments portray a vivid picture of this idealistic, but ultimately economically unsuccessful, designer of buildings that blended castles, fortresses and large buildings from the past centuries to design for the present. Kahns buildings are shown, among the most impressive as Salk Research Laboratories in La Jolla, CA. For me, his style has a neo-romantic air deaden by too much empty space that is repelled rather than attracts human interaction. <br /> <br /> But Kahn's son was more than the story of his father, the architect. For many years, Louis Kahn had three families: a wife with whom he had a daughter and two long-term relationships, one of which produced a daughter, the other son. Kahn visited his son in the mother's home often, but at the end of an evening, mother and son wanted to drive Kahn back to the marriage room. Nathaniel obviously wanted to know about this unusual set of circumstances, but he doesn't seem to be scarred by what was definitely a strange affair for a little boy. <br /> <br /> When Nathaniel was a young boy, Louis Kahn died of a massive heart attack in the men's room in New York's Pennsylvania Station after returning from India, where he had put one of his massive projects, someone else who was never built. At that time, his Philadelphia firm was at least $ 500,000 in debt, and had he been on a trip to the federal bankruptcy court, was probably offshoring. Kahn left several monumental structures, which the government's building in Bangladesh is clearly the largest. A teary local architect greets Kahn for creating a building where democracy can (and hopefully) flourish. <br /> <br /> Medarch architect Moshe Safdie opines that there might have been something appropriate in Kahn's suffering a fatal heart attack in a train station given his incessant globetrotting. I disagree: unfortunately, it is ironic that Kahn should die in the faceless replacement of one of America's true architectural jewels, the old Pennsylvania Station, destroyed to make room for a sterile replacement without signs and no continuation of bourgeois memory. <br /> <br /> There are a number of emotional moments recorded during the younger Kahns journey, including with his peninsulas and his mother, but they are genuine and moving, not maudlin and staged. Historians will always study Kahn. His son found reasons to remember him as a flawless but very iconoclastic and ultimately private man. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
