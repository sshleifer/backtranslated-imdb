One of the great tragedies in life is that Disney is so much successful in everything they do. If they weren't, we could have more unique little gems of animation like "Wonder Curly's Curious Adventures." The story is that an evil king has unsurpassed the throne in a place called Up-Down Land (I could get the name wrong). He is hated by all. His favorite hobby is shooting birds, and at one point in the past he probably killed Mr. Wonderbird's wife (a bird played with typical flair by Peter Ustinov) and left him with four young chickens to rise. Meanwhile, we see another hobby of evil kings painting. In particular, he has made three paintings: a self-portrait, a painting of a shepherd (whom he is in love with) and a painting of chimney sweep (of which he is jealous). One evening the shepherd and the chimney climb out of their paintings and run together. The king's self-portrait also climbs out of his frame and does away with the real king (You think I'm doing this? It's the right plot) and sends the royal police force to the young lovers. Mr. Wonderbird then helps the lovers try to escape the king's forces. The plot is wonderfully surreal, and the Up-and-Down Country setting is an incredibly imagined place filled with towering buildings accessible only by lifts. It is an even mix of the worlds "Metropolis" and "1984" and the drawings of Dr. Seuss. <br /> <br /> See it for a very unique experience that doesn't fit the standard formula for most animated features.
