Coen Brothers has done it again. Three presidents who are depressed (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) escape a Mississippi chain and head in search of buried treasure that will finance their new life. Along the way, they sing on the radio and become coveted stars as well as flush. Big laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson / introduction to bluegrass music. <br /> <br /> Clooney is unique as the fast-talking, fast-paced Wly-Ulysses Everett McGill. Holly Hunter plays his alien wife. Turturro and Nelson are flawless stumblebums. Also in the cast are John Goodman and Charles Durning. <br /> <br /> Dan Tyminksi gives the song voice for George Clooney at "I'm A Man of Constant Sorrow", Soggy Bottom Boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also includes Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley , The Whites, John Hartford, The Cox Family and Gillian Welch. Toe tapping, knee slapping fun for the whole family. You'll be amazed at how relaxed and fun this movie is.
