This is my first John Carpenter movie, I must say I was very impressed with The Thing. Right from the start, the film pulls you in and never lets up the excitement. The film's special effects and models remain good today. Apart from Kurt Russell, I was not familiar with any of the cast members, but they were all unusual in giving fear, paranoia and desperation to survive. Universal DVD has a wealth of very interesting behind scenes extras. Highly recommended, 9/10.
