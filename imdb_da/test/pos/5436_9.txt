This movie is a great comedy drama. Christopher Walken is enormous in his supportive role as leader, and his commentary will keep you laughing. Robin Williams plays a big role as a quick white "Jon Stewart" and will entertain you if you are fans of Comedy Central. The show is good, because if the viewer has half the brain, they will see it as a very necessary subcultural attack on the current Republican government's policies and a criticism of the American democratic process ... not to mention the means most politicians become chosen for. <br /> <br /> I am amused at the subplotters and found the movie to be very fast and entertaining without any of the usual "oh brothers" I would agree with the movie is less comedy than marketed but no doubt better currently 90% of the waste in theaters. Just my thoughts ... Don
