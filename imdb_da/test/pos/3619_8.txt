As is often the case when trying to take a 400 plus page book and slamming it into a movie in two hours, much is lost. Here, John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) directs on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off. What we get is a charming and emotionally convincing movie that somehow seems incomplete. <br /> <br /> There's a lot about this movie that's amazing and amazing. The cinematography of John Toll (Cinematographer for Braveheart and Fallends of the Fall, winner of Oscars for both) is great. In collaboration with Madden, the choices for places on the Greek island of Kefallonia are excellent and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic places of varying light are lush and beautiful. Madden also uses many Greek actors as city citizens, giving the city an authentic feel. The soundtrack is also amazing, and the Italian soldiers' mandolin passages and vowels are wonderful. Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian occupation and romance that occupy the bulk of the film. There are many sweet and fun moments throughout this segment. But at that time, the serious battle drama is ready to unfold, there is not much movie left in the wheel, and this component is extremely rushed and shortened. While the battle scenes are well-finished, after the match, it is obvious that there is ever greater compromise to keep the movie from running for too long. When we reach the post-war scenes, the treatment is only the skeleton. Another negative is that the DVD is particularly scanty on features. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic leadership of the sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight. When struggling he must, Cage shifts the gears seamlessly to a man of harsh principle and solves and somehow remains credible in both personas. <br /> <br /> Penelope Cruz, which the camera loves, provides an uninspired performance like Pelagia. This is partly due to the fact that Cage dominates the screen, but Cruz just seems too calm in a part that must be emotionally violent and dynamic. She allows the character to become objective as Corelli's love interest rather than establishing her as a strong character in itself. <br /> <br /> John Hurt gives a great performance as the wise old doctor who knows so much about human nature as medicine. But Christian Bale seems a little exaggerated and stiff as Pelagia's fiance. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie an 8/10. Despite some drawbacks, it is a touching movie that is worth seeing. The photograph alone is worth the price of admission.
