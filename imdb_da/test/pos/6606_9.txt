A dozen bored surfers, mostly children in Venice, California, not only reinvent the skateboard, but once again relaunched a forgotten-around suburbs of the 1950s into an action sports revolution. Narrarated by Sean Penn, Dogtown portrays life in the more traveled "locals only" beach community around 1974, which consisted mainly of surfing in the early morning tides and loitering. The Zephyr team (or Z-boys as they are called) spend a summer fighting the boredom by building their own boards using a local owner of a surf shop. After entering new skateboard competitions in SoCal, they transfer it all to their own scene; one that praises a generation of skateboarders consisting of greats such as Tony Hawk, Shaun White and the creators of X-Games. <br /> <br /> Dogtown puts a chronological perspective on skateboarding and the up-from-the-bootstraps story you never knew it had. <br /> <br /> by Andy Frye at MySportsComplex.blogspot.com
