Create in 1928 and originally named Mortimer before Walt Disney changed his name (because his wife convinced him), Mickey Mouse has been attached to the Disney brand. I always thought that this cartoon was the first cartoon for Mickey, it's actually his third, but it doesn't matter, for a six minute animated card is fun. The story sees that Mickey controls a steamboat until Captain Pete takes him out of the bridge and stops to pick up cargo, and Minnie Mouse lacks the boat. When she is lifted, she releases her music records and a goat eats them, Mickey helps her crank the tail and plays the tune and makes some other animals percussion until Pete comes back to stop him, making Mickey peel potatoes. Mickey Mouse was number 53 on the 100 biggest pop culture icons, and he was number 31 on the 100 greatest comics. Very good!
