Set in a custody of California in an incoherent future, an English film crew initiates cases that young students and political dissidents are brought under trial under a fictitious 'Resurrection Law' that allows the US government to suspend civil liberties for its own citizens in cases of emergency without the right to bail or the need for proof. In such cases, the government is empowered to arrest and detain anyone who they believe may engage in future sabotage activities. The experimental group includes a feminist, a black panther and a folk song. <br /> <br /> Convicted by a conservative tribunal, they have the choice of a long prison sentence or three days in Punishment Park, where they can achieve their freedom by reaching an American flag in the desert. They must achieve this without food or water. They must also be pursued by armed national guards and police who can return them to the camp if they are caught to be punished by the sentence imposed on each sentenced person. The reality is different; Those who choose Punishment Park are hunted and killed or brutalized without any hope of getting their freedom after a policeman is found dead in the park. The park seems to be a training ground for the police and guards who need to master these repressive actions so they can be used for open American society. <br/> <br /> 16 mm shots and documentary film developed by Watkins, in his famous Culloden and controversial The War Game for the BBC; He interacts with the prisoners and guards and observes the unconstitutional lawsuit and cuts between them to create a completely convincing political film that is still crucial and relevant. With his knowledge of the medium, Watkins has produced a running, relentless and ultimately scary movie depiction of a completely fictitious American political detention camp that would not convince it was not for his flawless construction. Many of the actors are amateurs who improvise with wide figures. The sparks fly into the trial scenes where each case is heard, partly because Watkins kept trying them out of the jury until recording those scenes. Watkins also claims that the actors often express their own opinions, which certainly explain the speed and credibility of their performances. <br /> <br /> The film has been heavily criticized for polarizing the opinions of those who see it. It has been claimed that the film is reactionary and unambiguously represents that conservatism and war are the basis of America's social problems. While these criticisms may be valid, it is important to consider that the film works at a fictional, metaphorical level, and that is perhaps the realism that the film so wisely constructs that encourages such a heated opinion on the content. In fact, the film's main issue is the problem of polarization itself. The "conservative" judges and brutal lawyers are on the one hand, and the "liberal" prisoners are clearly on the other hand without concessions on both sides. This seems to be what the movie really is about. The new law and the park itself is the outbreak of a situation where mediation between the two political positions has been lost. <br /> <br /> Made during and in protest against the Vietnam War and the treatment of those who opposed the war In America, the film's main themes of state persecution of its own citizens and conservatism against civil liberties still hit the same chord in the patriot's action and craze. It also hits a disruptive chord with news movies by Guantanamo Bay and the treatment of Iraqi prisoners in the Allied forces. <br /> <br /> The threat of internal 'terrorism' is such a volatile problem that the film cannot fail to connect with current attitudes to the subject. Not surprisingly, the film has had a checkered distribution history, marginalized to an extreme because of its content, but the disturbing fact that this movie is still so relevant today suggests that the wait has not been for nothing. Punishment Park is a movie that has had to struggle to be seen everywhere and it requires your attention.
