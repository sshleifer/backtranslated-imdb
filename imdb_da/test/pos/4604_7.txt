Black Castle is one of the films that has entered a Boris Karloff collection, and is expected to be a direct horror movie. While there are some horror elements in Nathan Juran's movie, this is really a multi-genre piece that is closely produced and effectively portrayed. Connection to Karloff, in what is a small but critical role, is Richard Greene, Stephen McNally, Lon Chaney Jr., Rita Corday, John Hoyt and Michael Pate. It is surprisingly produced by Universal International Pictures. The reason sees Greene's English gentleman traveling to the castle home to the monstrous Count of Bruno {McNally}. He follows a study of the disappearance of two friends, a study full of danger and surprise at every turn. <br /> <br /> This has everything fans of the old dark house / slots sub-genre could want. Real good and bad guys, a fair girl, dark corners to make dark deeds, devilish traps, ticking clock finals, and we even get a good old-fashioned bit of swashbuckling in the bargain. The cast turns everyone into effective performances, especially Greene and the wonderful creeping McNally. While Jerry Sackheim's writing is skinny and devoid of the pointless filler that has so often knocked down similar films of this ilk. A highly recommended movie, provided that Karloff fans understand that it is not a Karloff movie, and perhaps more importantly, that horror fans do not expect blood to emerge as the order of the day. A fine atmospheric story with a sense of fear everywhere, The Black Castle is a great experience. 10.7
