The Argentine music poet, Atahualpa Yupanqui, once said that some folk are repeating on any country in the world. They look the same, but everyone sees them as their own folk music ... <br /> <br /> This movie, which I feel, is about the same music that repeats the world at some point in the history of each country . First, some listen to it playing and trying to get the others to hear it. So some think they hear it, but they don't. So no one says anything and some people seem to listen to it. And others recognize that they have heard it, but did not think that others could hear it. Finally everyone listens to the same music, and suddenly it no longer sounds ... Love and poetry, like a real nationalism and a father's legacy ... <br /> Why should he call the movie The Dead when no one dies? The Spanish translation of the title refused to follow the same rule, and we call it Dubliners, after James Joyce's title ... <br /> <br /> A lovely 1900 Irish filmed postcard!
