Hoot is a lovely young person's movie about a group of middle school children trying to keep a pancake house chain from bulldozing a plot that is home to some endangered owl. The action is pretty good and the fresh faces are nice to see. Many well-known comedians are in this movie and keep humor almost nonstop. It's a movie for the young audience, maybe 5 to 11 years. I thought it was a good change in the pace of the adult movies that permeates the screen these days. There is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or children. It's just a bunch of fun with a constant message to save the beautiful places of this country from being over developed. If you remember back to the day you did not fight for a buck, remember that money is not everything. Not many people over the age of 12 will enjoy it unless they really have a soft spot for the special school's special series.
