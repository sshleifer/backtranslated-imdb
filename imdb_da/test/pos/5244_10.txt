A heroic young trail scout carries a big party of pioneers along LARGE TRAIL toward the West, with Indian attacks, natural disasters and romantic complications all parts of the adventure. As sweeping and magnificent as its story, Raoul Walsh's BIG TRAIL is a wonderful movie that entertaining as it was more than seven decades ago. With very good acting and excellent production values, it lives up to its reputation as the talkie's first epic western. John Wayne, unclear to his first major film role, looks impossible young, but he immediately impresses with the natural charm and masculine authority he brings to the role of the heroes; He clearly dominates the movie with the attributes that one day would make him a big star. Marguerite Churchill, like a lovely southern belle, slowly warms the duke's attention. The dialectal El Brendel is fun as a Swedish immigrant occupied with mule and son-in-law; his appearance in a scene signal laughs at the viewer. <br /> <br /> Looks and looks like a human grizzly bear, Tyrone Power Sr., big and repulsive, making a wonderful villain. Slick cardsharp Ian Keith is a sophisticated bad guy. (His famous physical resemblance to John Gilbert is very clear here.) Silent movie character actor Tully Marshall is impressive as a wily old mountain man who helps guide the carriage train. Corpulent Russ Powell, as a friendly fur sealer, puts his vocal talent to make nonsense sounds good use. Sharp eyes movie mavens will see Ward Bond as one of Missouri settlers. <br /> <br /> What will surprise many modern viewers is that THE BIG TRAIL was filmed in an early-wide screen process called Grandeur. More than living up to its name, the image looks unrelenting, with Walsh showing a mastery of the new technology. He fills the screen, every part of it, with action. Note during crowd scenes how everyone is busy doing real work, adding so much to the verisimilitude of these sequences. Walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use the wide screen. In addition, the film is blessed free from the back project photography, which gleams so many older films. It should also be emphasized that it is only natural that the soundtrack sounds a bit primitive; talkies were still in their cradle. That Walsh was able to use a microphone at all, with most of the scenes shot out the door, is more kudos for him. <br /> <br /> BIG TRAIL was not a box office success. In 1930, William Haines' comedies were the big money makers, and the public was looking for fare than the intelligent westerns. Most of the cast slipped into turmoil, including Wayne. It wouldn't be until 1939 when John Ford rescued him in STAGECOACH that John Wayne's legend would begin seriously. And despite its large and sweeping outlook, it would be another 25 years before the wide screen caught on Hollywood, largely as a response to the economic threat of television.
