Charlie Wilson's war is an excellent example of how films should be made. This film is of the highest quality and is perfect. Tom Hanks plays the lead and delivers an outstanding performance. In addition, Tom Hanks is complimented by the incredible performance of the incredible Philip Seymour Hoffman. I have never seen him in a role so perfect for him. <br /> <br /> The film is witty, intelligent and well-written. Julia Robert's stars also in this movie, but are easily overshadowed by the other two leaders. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 10/10 and am happy to recommend this movie to anyone interested in quality cinema.
