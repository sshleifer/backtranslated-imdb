This movie is full of interesting ideas. Some scenes are really fun. The dialogues are witty and mentioned. The excitement of the movie does not come as much from the 'murder mystery' plot as the relationship between the characters. The film tells two stories in parallel. <br /> <br /> The first story involves the characters played by Trintignant and Kassovitz. Trintignant is an aging driver, with a slightly ridiculous macho toughness, followed by a naive young man played by Kassovitz with lots of good-natured smiles. Many good moments in the movie come from contrast between the two characters, for example, when Trintignant tries to teach Kassovitz how to scare. <br /> <br /> The second story tells how a salesman played by Jean Yanne gives up on his job and his wife to find the killer of a young friend. Yanne plays part with some kind of aggressive irony. I wish I could describe this better. After a while, the viewer understands how both stories are connected, and they eventually meet in a surprising but also logical ending. <br /> <br /> The movie is a successful blend of the witty but superficial gangster movies that the director's father (famous Michel Audiard) used to write and the "typical French movie" with lots of psychological depth and lots of care by showing emotions.
