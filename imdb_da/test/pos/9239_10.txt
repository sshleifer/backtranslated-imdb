After seeing a Texas Treason of Treason, Cox's abused correspondence efforts could not even afford the massive collision Stu directed without the budget. It tells a story of dedication, sweat, whiz, fire and punk rock. I love it! My favorite parts are interviews with Marci (she is such a treasure baby and she digs me, but she just doesn't know). The Japanese clerk muffled his lines, which blew me up. The six scene was really cool. I'll see if Stu will come over sometime and make the box light wave thing when I do it with my woman. Intro and of course my 5 seconds during final credits. I know I get some chickens. I hope to see more from Antstuie because I know I can expect the unexpected.
