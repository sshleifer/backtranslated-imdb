May I never go to this hospital [or hospice if I want to be politically correct] [which ass was this asinine sentence anyway?], Other than directions on how to get out of town. George C. did a masterful job of playing the burnt-out, over-work cynic, who came to the conclusion that his life has been waste, but is helpless to change his environment or relationship even when he gets a golden opportunity [ which was probably not so valid anyway]. I got several laughs out of this brutally black comedy, but at the same time it was so reassured and often chilled to the margin, because I fear this much atmosphere permeates most house houses, even though I write.
