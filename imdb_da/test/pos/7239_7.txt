A very bizarre to bring on the screen of William Shakespeare's tragic love story. <br /> <br /> The Que family and the Capulet family have long-standing hatred of each other, often resulting in violence. Hate has something to do with a movie company and the fact that everyone is pretty much crazy. In the midst of all this insanity is Tromeo and Juliet, the most famous literature of the "star-crossed" lovers, falling to each other at first glance, and problems arise when they realize whose family belongs to the other. <br /> <br /> The movie follows the basic plot of the original game remarkably well, and key scenes even use the original or close to original lines. But the infamous Troma bizarreness permeates the film from the beginning to the end. It makes for a movie that is certainly not for everyone, but it is nevertheless quite inventive. Tyrone (Tybalt in Shakespeare) has a special fun scene. 7/10 <br /> Many different edited and nominal versions exist. Each contains violence, profanity, drug use and sex, all with a large dose of bizarreness.
