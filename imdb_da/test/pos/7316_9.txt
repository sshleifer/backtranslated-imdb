Alder's favorite trio of bumbling imbeciles runs amok in a hospital in this incredible raucous and often hysterical fun skirt. These guys are undoubtedly the only most incompetent group of doctors who ever fumble their way across the screen. Comic highlights include Stooges constantly breaking a glass pane in a door, their meeting with a fake patient claiming that rats used to get out of his shirt shirthul, Stooges rides through the hallways of a giant bike, a big horse, and miniature race cars and our sublimely stupid triangle accidentally leaves instruments in a creepy patient's belly when they finish operating the poor guy. Director Ray McCarey relates the frantic comic shenanigans in an appropriate nonstop hectic pace and stages the wide slapstick gags with great gusto. Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard are all in the top loopy form, with sterling support from Dell Henderson as the suffering hospital counselor Dr. Graves, whipped Jeanie Roberts as a hissing nurse (the scene where Stooges makes an absurd impromptu group singalong with this gal is absolutely sidesplitting!), Ruth Hiatt as a whispering nurse, Billy Gilbert who ranting crazy patient and "Little Billy" Rhodes as a feisty little patient. The sprouted lunacy never leaves for a moment, making this beautiful amok child one of Stooges' best ever excursions.
