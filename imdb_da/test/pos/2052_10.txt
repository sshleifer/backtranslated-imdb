I thought it was a good action girl. A very good role for Geena Davis. She is a very versatile actress. One of my favorites next to Angelina Jolie. I actually saw The Long Kiss Goodnight just after watching the new Tomb Raider movie. That made me think, Charlie or Lara? Which would win in a fight ??? Either way, both women are very strong, intelligent characters who are fun to watch. Especially when they kick ass. I just hope to see Geena in another movie soon. It looks as if she has been out of the spotlight a little too long. It would be especially nice to see her in another movie with Samuel L. Jackson. Now they do a good duo. Watch this movie if you don't. You will not be disappointed.
