May contain spoilers <br /> <br /> This historic movie was so refreshing. Although it can exercise the actual events, it shows the heartless nature of the imperial Quis, which he later became notorious for. And there wasn't a single computer-generated person in it. I think it's great that China has produced such an epic movie. The costumes and options were beautiful, the show was also excellent. Dignity vs. Death is a major theme in this movie, and I think it reflects Chinese history and culture. I also enjoyed a small allusion to the terracotta warriors, a 3d map carved by the conquest of China with individual soldiers. Emperor Qui of course later as entombed with terracotta warriors in his lifestyle. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the stage with the dwarf, he was a very interesting character, even though he only had a small scene. <Br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
