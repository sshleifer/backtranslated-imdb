I blubed like a little girl at the end of this movie, and I dare anyone else hold it together without a string. Absolutely heartbreaking things, but even more uplifting on the core. A major effort by Ann Margaret's side, playing a terminally ill mother of ten who, knowing her arthritic steelworking man, will not be able to support the family when she is away, arranges the adoption of her children before she shuffles off . The role really deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> You really feel like this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to make sure her children don't end up in a poorly managed orphanage. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
