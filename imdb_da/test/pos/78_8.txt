Robert McKimson's 'Acrobatty Bunny' is one of the director's finest shorts. Although the circus-based setting can provoke hideous memories of McKimson's horrible 'Big Top Bunny', 'Acrobatty Bunny' is actually not as boring as the travesty. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a wild lion, 'Acrobatty Bunny' is fresh and fun from the start, not to mention very attractive to look at. There is a classic scene where Bugs take a swollen elevator ride out of his hole just to get straight into the lions' jaws. In a brilliant Disney parody, he pays "Pinocchio" into the lion's neck! This glorious opening is a sign of what is to come. There are some expert choreographed antics in and around the lion cage at first, followed by a hilarious grotesque and annoying rendition of 'Laugh Clown Laugh' as ​​a child I used to imitate regularly! All this culminates in a short acrobatic order that gives the comic its name. I have never been fond of circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes a boring and predictable set of gags, but 'Acrobatty Bunny' breaks out of shape and the result is an exciting fun card that stands among McKimson's best.
