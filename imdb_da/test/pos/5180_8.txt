This is a quiet movie. It is a simple story of a writer who cannot write his story back to his hometown to get started, but instead he becomes involved in a friendship with a strange elderly man whose life might represent the author's inner state externally. is a museum of unfinished ideas, outdated equipment and "useless" people. <br /> <br /> There are no extraordinary circumstances or any great moves in the plot. It's a film about internal changes. Being stuck in their lives that do not develop much, make the most important people help each other to transform, stop dreaming, and achieve something or at least get a change and give their lives the desired and longing new direction. /> <br /> On the film-making side, I can think of only a weakness that could also be considered a function - we do not get much of character description or inner world knowledge. It is very narrative on the side of thoughts and events, and we have to guess their true feelings that are pretty hidden, but you can still see them and that is what makes your own mind work, trying to figure out them, to understand the impressions made by these people, and it is not empty underneath - the actors certainly hold some inner states to their characters. It's close to real life where you mostly never know anyone good enough to understand them completely, and that reminds us of our own feelings and choices. What is most important to me is that this simple, almost flat story leaves you thinking of afterwards, whether your own life, your own dreams and achievements, is anyone or are we caught up in the routine and pleasures, leaving 100% or just dreaming about it, we could do more and move somewhere where we would rather be than just leaving ourselves and other stories like "i want to do this one day" - don't move a finger to make it happen or "I'm fine where I am" because it's easier to go by habits than to make a change? It's at least the impression it gave me, and it was very timely for me, which adds to my understanding of this far from famous movies. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the movies for the heart, but those who need events and actions should stay away.
