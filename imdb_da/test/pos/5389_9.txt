If you like Gary Cooper, this is one of his best roles. His gentle intensity rightly wrong is what made his career. "Blayde Hollister" comes to Dallas to avenge Will and Brian Malowe, who burned his Georgian farm and killed his family. Inept Marshall comes in Hollister's way and tries to arrest him when he is interrupted by a street shootout between Hollister and Wild Bill Hickock. The shooting is staged to get the law from Hollister and he takes "back East" Marshall under his wing to keep him alive in Texas as they change identity. <br /> <br /> It was a good start and the picture stays all the way through. The action can be a little "slow" with today's standards, but it is one of my top 10 favorite movies.
