This film is a masterpiece to put it simply. Especially the double exposure made by cameraman Julius Jaenzon. It is skillfully made even with the standards we are used to today seven and a half years later. Director Viktor Sjöström also plays the main character, David Holm. At night on New Year's Eve, he is killed in a fight, and the legend says that the first person to die in the New Year will have to work as a solar collector in the form of a transparent ghost. There is a new soul collector every year. <br /> <br /> The scene where alcoholic David Holm rises from his dead body (as the soul leaves its earthly body) in the cemetery (where the fight took place) is a real price for a film-loving eye. Also when the present soul collector comes with his horse and wagon is a beautiful but also a scary scene. David Holm recognizes this soul collector as a drinker from past lives. It is now his turn to take over. Like Scrooge in Dickens' story "A Christmas Gift", David shows what his life and actions have brought to the people around him. <br /> <br /> The film is about the danger of substance abuse, in this case alcohol. It is based on a book by Nobel prize winner Selma Lagerlöf. Viktor Sjöström filmed a few more of her books, but that is the best result, perhaps because this book is the most cinematic of them. <br /> <br />
