I remember seeing this series eagerly and being so disappointed when it came to an end. Over the years I have tried to find out if I could get a copy of it on either video or the like, to no avail. However, I was happy to find this site with details of it, to only be disappointed at the point of purchase, that the videos available are not played on English recorders! This production was so wonderful that it was exactly with Nevil Shute's novel and took the story through after the end of the war, along with Joe and Jean's subsequent life - absolutely wonderful - and I just wish I could see it again, since it's original screening, there have been no repetitions of it on British television.
