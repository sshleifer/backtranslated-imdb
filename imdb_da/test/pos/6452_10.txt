City Streets is astonishingly modern technically for a movie made in 1931. Also who couldn't be fascinated, thrilled by Gary Cooper's powerful magnetism and galvanizing the public's attention. The reason is quite comprehensive and clear. The scenarios, the decor, are unusual in every detail. All players are above average. I continue to guess how the director and his staff, including editing, sound, lighting, photography, could have been so brilliant. I couldn't find a mistake, understanding that the scenes in the road (bumpy ride) with the screen shot of the big movie images on the background were the best they could get in 1931. All in all, I found this movie fantastic and so much alive thanks to Gary Cooper charisma.
