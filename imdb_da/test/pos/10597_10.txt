haggard does not even have to be graded as it was never designed to be graded as an Oscar-winning movie, and it was never meant to have won an Oscar (of course). If you just look at some of the things that Bam and Bran tried, like fast motion pictures, it comes across as a movie that is more than just cky or jackass (even if it's cool). For pure pleasure I definitely give this movie a 10; almost every scene made me laugh until my pages hurt like the falcone's trail movie. If you haven't seen this then watch it and buy it. Personally, my favorite character is brandon (falcone), he is just so smooth and natural and random that it is fun, he freestyles great (with action figures) and constitutes the funniest stuff-lol a diamond mountain bike? haggard is definitely a movie that, in overall humor, is rivaled only by anchorman and napoleon dynamite.
