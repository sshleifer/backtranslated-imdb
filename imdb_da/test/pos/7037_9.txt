I can remember this in a similar vein for the young. We would stumble back from the pub and look at this or tape it and then spend weeks playing the lines to each other. <br /> <br /> We called one of our buddies "Zipmole Watkins" after the brilliant episode where Daniel Peacock has a bit of "restyling" on the back street of the Back Street Abortionist. <br /> <br /> Lots of beautiful lines "Remember at 5:30 in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man. It's light guy!" - Gandhi as a local store manager. Tony Woodcock was definitely there in the episode where they taught Ralph (Daniel Peacock) to be the barman "It's not good Amanda, I will never do it as a bar man" Helen Lederer teaches him to ask people about the fight "Watch the fight in last night? I thought Woodcock played well "After a series of failed conversations, the curly-haired Arsenal star sat in the bar:" Watch the game last night? "" Yes, I thought I was playing well. " <br /> <br /> We're still making odd stupid lines now - "Reg and Ralph ..... or ....... Ralph and Reg. Reg., Reg. very surreal silly moments and very surreal songs from Flatlets - The Back Street Abortionist a personal favorite with the big endline - "And he will mark your packages 'Return to Sender' <br /> <br /> Good old Danny Peacock - you have added a lot to some young drinkers' evenings gentleman. <br /> <br /> ** Update - I found a couple of episodes on tape - I'll upload the Gandhi sketch to Youtube **
