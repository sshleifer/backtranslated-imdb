I happened to catch the last 45 minutes of the movie, late night about 8 years ago. What a wild and fun 45 minutes. I was definitely knocked out of the chase-shoot-out at the end, which takes place at night, inside an old hotel torn down with a devastating ball .... Amazing. I remember vaguely Stacy Keach, stealing a police car, failing to be a policeman, and strong arming of some winos .... Wino to Keach "Hey, why do you have that for us? ... Keach," That's my job. It's right, they don't make them any more.Great movie.The Golden70 ... Hopefully it sees the light of day as a DVD along with other lost treasures ... Hickey and Boggs are such.
