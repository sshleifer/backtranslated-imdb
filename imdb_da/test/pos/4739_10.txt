If you want to see real evidence of what a misguided and uncontrolled government can do for "un-popular" people, this movie gives it. Read what some people say about the "Patriot Act" that has passed since 9/11 and then watch this movie. Is it worth it? Do we really want to give away our freedoms to these people? Whatever you watched on TV, you are not fully informed before watching this movie. I apologize for quoting another reviewer but it needs to be repeated: Roger Ebert from Siskel & Ebert said: "What is interesting is if you are looking for people who are imbalanced ... you will not find them among the Branch Davidians, you find them among the FBI and Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; these are the people of this movie who deserve to be feared, I believe. "I think any person responsible for 9/11 should be brought to the court, but I think the government has not shown a story of respecting its duty to protect people's rights, and this film proves it dramatically.
