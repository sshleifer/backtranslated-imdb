Life is crazy. You're crazy, I'm crazy, we're all crazy. We're all a little Minnie, and a little Moskowitz. Sometimes it seems best to be sensible ... but then what can you miss? <br /> <br /> You must be you. You don't have to park cars and semi-randomly shout at people, but you can't hide behind a veil (or dark sunglasses) and pretend it's all right. And sometimes you really need to take caution to the wind because why else do you live? <br /> <br /> I'm not going to "judge" this love over Cassavete's other movies because they are all absolutely 100% unique works and each their own individual expression and exploration of our lives. In that sense, they are all great, and comparisons are evil. This movie surely has one crazy, sometimes madman, but ultimately wonderful and free of quality that all his films have - you never know what will happen next time and you never know what the characters should think, do or feel next. Likewise, the characters do themselves - and do we really want to live our lives in some other way? Unlike Moskowitz, you can have a good job and judiciously put money into your IRA, but still live an adventurer's life within - in your feelings, your spirit and your life experience. Yes, we can get it both ways, that's what Cassavetes shows us. Thank God someone did.
