There are movies that make careers. For George Romero, the LIVE DEATH night was; for Kevin Smith, CLERKS; for Robert Rodriguez, EL MARIACHI. Add to the list Onur Tukel's absolutely amazing DING-A-LING LESS. Flawless film making and as secure and professional as any of the aforementioned films. I haven't laughed hard since I saw FULL MONTY. (And even then I don't think I laughed really hard ... So to say.) Tukel's talent is great: DING-A-LING-LESS is so shock full of double entenders that one should sit down with a copy of this script and make a line-by-line study of it to fully appreciate the width and width of it. Each shot is beautifully composed (a clear sign of a safe handler), and the performances around are solid (none of the overall scenes chewing one might have expected from a movie like this). DING-A-LING-LESS is a movie whose time has come.
