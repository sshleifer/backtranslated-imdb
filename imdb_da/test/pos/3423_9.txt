I was unsure of this movie before renting and assured him that Hilary Swank has always provided outstanding performances in her films. She seems to rely on restraint to get the emotional impact she does. And she didn't show me wrong in this movie. <br /> <br /> But the movie also had amazing performances from all the other cast members, both speaking and non-speaking. I have to appoint Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor - the two main characters - for their excellent actions and portrayal of true human feelings and mistakes. The whole movie ran almost like a documentary. I must applaud Tom Hooper as director and Avril Beukes as editor to keep a multilayer story revealed smoothly, while dialogue and action move together in an understandable fashion. The South African landscape opening line was striking and I had to push the pause button to enjoy the shooting. <br /> <br /> Why can't a movie like this ever be nominated for an international award. It seems to me to turn the speaker button on all counts. It was not just a movie, it was a true experience of life in a country coming out of apartheid. A poverty life was around, but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit.
