I miss the successors. I needed something to prevent me from going crazy with tensions, anxiety (what if it's not so good?) And constant lack of information. I needed something to calm me a little, something to pass the time, except of course The Matrix. It was just that. <br /> <br /> I found it informative (like the part about Keanu's neck ...) and some of it was fun. I hurt Carrie-Anne so much when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys. I found only one problem with that. Given that 95% of the people actually were male, they just sounded their mouths and there were languages ​​in it. It's not nearly as bad as The Shawshank Redemption's cussing runs, but one scene was Keanu describing a bad day, plugging your ears if you're small. > <br /> <br /> It was entertaining and was just what I needed. That's what all Matrix fans have to keep them quiet. They mention a little bit about the successors, and somebody gives away almost anything, but he catches up in time (shoot!). It gives you almost no spoilers, but it's great to have if you're a Matrix Head like me. <br /> <br /> There is no happening.
