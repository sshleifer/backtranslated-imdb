Luis Bunuel's "Nazarin" will always be remembered as a great movie because it is frankly in his presentation of comic attacks on religion. It is one of the great films to be shown to all people, especially young children, to familiarize them with the concepts of good and bad, holy and evil. The hardest question that "Nazarin" asks about the strengths and weaknesses of the organized religion. It has been handled by involving many common people who are not at all petty matters in their worldly lives, especially sins.Bunuel scores tremendously by showing us that various issues related to class differences deserve honest, honest, and reliable answers. Nazarin looks trustworthy as it has been made in a light, comical vein. This is the only reason that one can say that the history of an ordinary priest is true to the life of all the public. It's amazing how Bunuel approaches the search for true love problem in her movie. This black and white gem was shot wonderfully by Gabriel Figueroa, one of Luis Bunuel's favorite cameraman. Film critic Lalit Rao saw "Nazarin" at Trivandrum, India during the 13th International Film Festival in Kerala 2009. "Nazarin" was introduced by the prominent Indian cinema personality Mr.PKNair as part of a special package called "50 Years ago". is a movie that has to be with any discerning DVD collector.
