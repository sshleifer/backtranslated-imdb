This film is the Latin godfather. An unlikely mobster bridges the gorge to some unlikely alliances and forms an empire. I enjoyed action and pistols along with the brash and colorful characters. This movie is no Oscar winner, but absolutely entertaining. Hey, who still needs an Oscar? <br /> <br /> Chapa has got some balls to control and act (I think he produced it too?) this movie. Reminds me of another filmmaker who likes to do it all, Robert Rodrigez. Keep it up, is there a successor in the works? There are a lot of strings to be tied. Son coming back and dying death?
