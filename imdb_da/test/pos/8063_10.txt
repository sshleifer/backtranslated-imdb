Over the years, I have been very interested in this teenager's life, leaving such a big and indelible mark on the world. My fascination has also been born of fear, as in, it could happen again. <br /> <br /> And over the following years, yes, I fear it will continue to happen around us and of course it was going on long before Anne. It 'of course' can a so-called civilized society turn itself or on an innocent country / race / continent and murder the citizens in cold blood on the flaming excuse? I leave the question out there. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the documentary, there is a statement about the leader Adolf Hitler, as the one in-depth fact about Hitler, never mentioned, was that he was elected democratically and all of the atrocities committed were done as The result of a compatible poodle press and fearful propaganda played over and over again for a rich population. <br /> <br /> One of the atrocities was Anne Frank, who set a face to the death camps by the miracle of her diary's survival. Kenneth Brannagh does a wonderful job on the comment and interviews. He has the rare gift of minimizing his own persona so that the subjects can speak for themselves. Many new facts and people who have never been interviewed are brought to life in the careful research that I will not enter here as they add immensely to reality and the boys' grief in the film. /> <br /> Glenn Close reads diary and her choices The voice is perfect for the part she brings a na√Øve and freshness to the role. <br /> <br /> Anne's old childhood friends are being interviewed in the long run, and her last days before death are well-recorded and witnessed along with her lively and vicious personality. <br /> <br /> This should not be missed. A wonderful and respectful film about the rarely seen Anne. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
