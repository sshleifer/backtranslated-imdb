It was a surprisingly very good movie and an interesting idea. However, it was a little disappointing that "Twist" was a little too predictable and just a little too early in the movie. As you watched, it started to become a bit bizarre and confusing to the point that the only reasonable result was the inevitable plot twist, but it certainly didn't destroy the movie flow. There were fantastic performances that were never a dull boring moment, so worth looking at this one. It kept me interested right up until the end, and for me there aren't many movies that can do it these days. I highly recommend people watch this amazing little movie.
