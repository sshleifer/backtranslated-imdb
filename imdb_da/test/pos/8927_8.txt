I rented this movie with very low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. This movie is extremely good. And one would never guess it was low budget. EIGHTEEN, directed by 'Richard Bell' centers around an 18-year-old named Pip, who is played by the amazing 'Paul Anthony' who leaves his home due to circumstances surrounding the way his older brother died. He is overcome by guilt at this event and falls into a hard life on a running teen on drugs and alcohol. On his 18th birthday, his father tracks Pip and gives him a band left by his grandfather, whom he was supposed to hear on his 18th birthday. <br /> <br /> The way the entire movie is told is unfolding at the same time with two simultaneous stories. The current life of Pip and his grandfather's past during WW11, of which Pip listens to the tape. The three outstanding performances in this movie are those from 'Paul Anthony' as Pip and 'Brenden Fletcher' plays Jason, the young 18-year-old WW11 soldier, his grandfather. Also, the role of WW11 injured medic 'Macauley' played by 'Mark Hildreth'. Everyone puts in fine performances. A couple of worries and scenes that haven't been too good with me ... the pastor, Father Chris played by "Alan Cumming" who is gay and in the daytime picks up the local street hustler all over the neighborhood. And then we have the local store consultant named Jeff, a treasure played by the attractive 'David Beaszely' who just wants to be loved, and for some unknown reason is attracted to the very unacceptable and sleaze ball street hustler, Clerk, who sleeping with almost anyone and probably is a goose-toxic time bomb. On top of all, he is not a very sympathetic person. This part just didn't ring right. <br /> <br /> The parts I really like the most were flashbacks to the war. They were so well-behaved and very touching. There is a scene at the end where one soldier dies, and the other soldier, 'Jason', is there for him to comfort and show him love, as he hurts and dies. It's such a wonderful and touching scene that left me in tears. Beautifully traded. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. It is one of love, redemption and the human spirit's ability to survive.
