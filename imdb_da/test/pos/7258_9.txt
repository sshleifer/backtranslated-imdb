I don't want to write too much about the movie, but basically it's an action / comedy with a little bit of romance thrown in about two men coming together in unlikely circumstances and becoming highway men together. Fantastic performance by Robert Carlysle and everyone else involved. A brilliant 'baddy' that really makes you hate him. Some good comic lines - actually laughing loudly, amazing actions and a great plot. Choice of music and mood all amazing, basically brilliantly directed and brilliants written. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good British movie or a lot of action, I don't know why the movie never went off, I thought it wasn't as much recognition as it deserved. If you don't understand anything else, watch this movie for one of the greatest finals at all times. Not giving anything away, but this one really gets the heart to beat!
