It plays like your usual teens T & A movie, but the mood is incredibly gloomy. If it was made today, it would be considered an art house film. It goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to be laid, but the results of his efforts are hard and cruel and unsatisfactory. The whole teen-teen formula is adhered to, but nothing proves you would expect. Imagine a director's cut of "It's a Wonderful Life," where James Stewart was ultimately not allowed to return to the real world. An incredible movie that undermines all expectations of the genre. It makes you feel dirty afterwards: There is no redemption for the characters. I'm surprised it has ever been made. 1980s version of Detective Story.
