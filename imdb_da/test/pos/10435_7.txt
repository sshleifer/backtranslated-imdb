I see that there are already good reviews of this movie, I have few points to comment on why I thought there was something special about this movie ... above all, the movie is realistic. It may not seem realistic for an adult who has forgotten what it was like to be a teenager, but it is really the kind of super drama that is constantly happening among teenagers. Secondly, the good guy, the guy who treats women with respect, doesn't get the girls. That's how it is, in real life, the same! he is too good at his own good. people are just selfish. Third, it was nice to see a fat guy who had some confidence. I believe that this role already takes confidence from the actor, I am not just talking about the character. All in all, I thought the movie was a positive surprise, secretly hiding among crazy partyin 'teenage comedies on the rental shelter. Don't make me wrong, it's not all sad, it's also a good laugh.
