I loved this movie! Yes, it's pretty cheap and I'm sure lots of reviews will be snooty about it. But my goodness, how much they pack for the cash involved. I was reminded of Sam Raimi's early work. Yes it is rough but has good energy and lots of fun. The play ranges from the very good in Scott Ironside and Shawn Paul Hasser, to not so good in some of the smaller parts. Is it a cult movie? Now it grew on me. The first time I liked it, but by the third view I loved it. The movie is another 7 out of 10, but I give it 8 to pure cheek. Anyone who can pull this off for 8 grand is worth seeing. Almost makes me visit Scotland!
