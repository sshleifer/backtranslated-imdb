This is a beautiful, fun, live movie. It is even better than the "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" - as it is parallel but not replicating. The story completes a full circle and had the theater brilliant as the credits rolled. One hundred years after this story takes place, we are just as fascinated by flickering pictures in a dark theater.
