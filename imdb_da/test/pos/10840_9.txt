So far, only the first episode has been shown and a great deal has been done about the lesbian sex scenes. But for those who are disturbed to look past, they find an incredibly beautiful love story, and one who has in this episode ended up in a disturbing climax / cliffhanger. I have found the story so powerful that I am inspired to read the novel on which this amazing series has been based.
