"Disconnection" can be just as much in deriving a pre-ordained identity as in withdrawing drugs. As a nationwide guy coming to Beijing, class and success must have turned this young artist's face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far exceed his peasant parents' success success. However, problems arise when the new man is too new when it requires too much departure from family, history, nature and personal identity. The resulting divisions and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the tip of a gut control on one side or a complete escape from itself on the other. Hongshen slides into the latter, and his long and lonely way back to himself can be muddy. But what an exceptionally convincing feature, honesty and sensuousness director Zhang Yang and his actors brings to this journey. No clichés, no stereotypes, no rigid sex roles, no one required sex, romance or violence scenes, no necessary street languages ​​and, to start, no assumed money to float character acts and whims. <br /> <br /> In the mid-twenties, Hongshen Jia. He is a talented actor, impressionist, in vain, idealistic and perhaps emotionally hungry. The perfect recipe for his enablers. Soon he is the "cool" actor, idolized by youth. "He was warm in the early nineties." "He always had to be the most fashionable." He needs extremes, and advocates heavy metal, adopts earrings and a scarf. His plays mean art, friends and roles, but not the kind that gives any personal challenge or input. And his self-criticism, obscured by immediacy of success, opens the door to an irrational self-confidence, self-hatred - "I didn't know how to act" "I felt like a fake" - and readily available drugs to counter them. He says, "I had to be high to do what the director wanted." Then his superficial identity as an actor, through drugs, becomes an escape from identity. <br /> <br /> Hongshen's liberation from drugs and his fake life is very gradual, intermittent - and doggedly his own. Loneliness, space, meditative thinking, speech rejection, replacement of therapy. Abstract is out. And much of his change happens outdoors --- not in idealized places, but primarily on green patches under highways, bridges and high-rise buildings in Beijing. Physics is almost romantic, but it is not. The bike rides to Ritan Park, the long spontaneous walks, the drenching sun and rain, grassy picnics, sky patterns and dragons that absorb his musing are very specific. He runs to come forward and constantly records signals for a more real and realistic identity. "I started to open up," he says about this period in retrospect. And the contact seems to begin with his slender body performing a kind of dancer's positioning (clumsy, graceful, humorous, narrative) in a current situation. If thoughts or spirit are missing, his legs may force him to go all night. <br /> <br /> Central to his comeback is the rejection of fixed roles. To emphasize his end to acting and his determination for a new identity, he smashes his videos and television and slaps his head to bloody against his "John Lennon Forever" poster. He has turned down his iconic anti-establishment artist --- but he is the only viable guide he knows. He imagines himself as John's son (Yoko Ono) and adopts his "Mother Mary" as the intercessor in his "dark hour" and "time of trouble". (wrenching, appalling pains in the park - hallucinatory and skitzoid trials) "Music is so much more real than action," he says. And talk about Lennon's influence as "showing me a new way." In the mental institute, the life-saving apples (resistance, nourishment) reflect Lennon's presence, as does Hongshen's need to hang his hero's poster in his newly remodeled space. <br /> <br /> If Lennon's influence jumps, Hongshen's father's influence is grounding. Although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drink), the cowardice differences from his son are subject to change. For the father is more secure in himself: he accepts that he is Chinese, a farmer in a peasant line, a nationwide theater director. And he exercises control over both his habit and his feelings. It is this recognizable identity that drives Hongshen to treat him as a sound card, sometimes with anger and anger, sometimes with humor (the blue jeans, the Beatles) and the passivity. In his most confused and violent exchange with his father, where he accuses him of being a liar and a false one, he exposes himself more to himself than his father: "All the actions I performed before were scary ... life is scary "And to Hong Kong's emphasis:" You're NOT my father, "he replies gently," why can't a farmer be your father? " <br /> <br /> Under these two teachers and with much extra help from his mother, sister, friends, inmates at rehab inst., he makes a real connection to a true (not all) self. As the long-term drug effects fall, so does his old identity. Debt replaces pride, trust mistrust. Integrity prohibits its black cloud. All his edges soften. "You're just a human being", he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap-down to reject medicine. At home, the farmer's soap is fine with him now. And his once "rare and true friendships" begin again as it is so evident in the back of the exciting back-to-back fence scene with his musician buddy. Hongshen says about this movie: "It's a good chance to think about my life." And I can add, become a new actor, a tied to art and life. Like Lennon, he has achieved success without a loss of identity.
