Evocatively directed and licked-up psychological mystery thriller with an exceptionally leading performance by a gloomy Donald Sutherland, and powerful support roles from Donald Pleasence and David Hemming. The material decides to keep it all glum and moves from the investigation period to the victim's story. The rare and rather sweet nature of the study took me in, but when it was back to the victim's side, which showed her last days, was not so convincing, and something stodgy and store-like. While the script is highly detailed and to some extent complex in stretching together, but the final and surprising revelation should have been more bony, it is not helped by its blurry performance. Howard Blake's music tracks have an emotional stitch to his signals, which simply rests, and director Claude Chabril's helpful handling (mostly) has a strong stylistic and tight style that makes the best of moody places and flexible molding. The youngsters face Lisa Langlois and Aude Landry also do an incredible job.
