1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best stories about the horror of desert out there. It's one of the finest custom-made slashers in the 80's, and it's blowing light movies like Final Terror, Don't Walk in the Forest or Prey Out of the Water. <br /> <br /> A group of young adults came and check out the mountain feature that one of the groups just bought. But they are not alone in the wild. A sobbing killer who seems to be two places at once, lurking and apparently hating crimes. <br /> <br /> Director Lieberman, who gave us such great B movies as Squirm (1976) and Blue Sunshine (1977), does an excellent job with this smart thriller too. The film is nicely atmospheric, with an insidious sense of excitement and some strong tension. This movie makes even the open wilderness seem scary claustrophobic. Oregon places are beautiful and well-trapped by the captivating film. The music score is a genuine original and fantastic as opposed to the scenic images. <br /> <br /> Deborah Benson makes good management, her presence was captivating. Gregg Henry delivers a good performance as Benson's lover and Chris Lemon give some occasional charisma. The support model, especially veteran actress Kennedy, also does well. <br /> <br /> A real gem of the slasher genre that doesn't have to do anything for excitement. Definitely worth searching out for slasher fans and horror buffs alike. See it! <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 out of ****
