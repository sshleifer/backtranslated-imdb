I agree with the posters before the characters were exceptionally strong and credible and all the actors in their top form. I especially loved David Boreanaz, who stretches in a lot, so unlike anything else he played, again showing his amazing gift for comedy. The first part of the film was light and fun, the blackout part was a little surreal but interesting - and it was all downhill from there. I found it frustrating that at least two out of the 3 girls (Keira and Lisa) get out of blackmail and stockpile scot free, again a trace back on their psyche. I know the movie changed the darker end of the game - and I'm not saying I missed the murder part. But I probably needed to see these two get their comeuppance somehow and I was left groaning in frustration with the end. (That's why I only gave it a 9) <br /> <br /> But definitely an interesting movie.
