Gerry Anderson's first live action foray in the way of a big movie shot enjoying incredible model FX work and a great Barry Gray music score. The real-to-real analog computers, in the distant year "2069" (I think Anderson really wanted a safe date 100 years later!) Is a good idea to see, as guru-jacket fashion, but man could easily blame 2001 for the same offenses, but no one could have foreseen some things they were showing. This movie was the stepping stone for the UFO series the following year, and in fact not only had the same FX people and producers, but many of the players were regulars in that show. <br /> <br /> It always emerges as an "alternative story" future more than anything else - the "Apollo-like" rocket used in the lift-off, it always seems like this is a different planet than the earth. Considering the "alternative soil" plot, one would assume that it was the feeling they wanted. We end up with an end that asks more questions than the answers. That because "the other earth" exists every movement, event and thing has been duplicated as it happens on both worlds. Because of the given and the sun in between, the two versions of the same person (in this case Glenn Ross, astronaut) can never meet. A complete accident discovered the planet in the first place, where it probably remained a secret forever. Filmed mainly in Portugal with FX work in England, it is a must-own for any Gerry Anderson fan. I have Image Bare Bone's DVD from a few years ago out of print, but one hopes Universal will be republished with, perhaps extras and even a Gerry Anderson comment.
