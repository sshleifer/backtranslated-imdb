Slipknot is a heavy metal band from the big city of Des Moines, Iowa, where the rockers have their own upscale mask (I know somebody has already said this, but I have to fill the space for this review). The band members are Joey, Mick, 133, Sid, Clown, James, Corey, Chris and Paul. This band is one of the best new heavy metal bands in my opinion and should be heard by anyone who loves hardcore rock. Another good movie is called "DISASTERPIECES", which shows the band's performance at the London Arena. The "My Plague" video was shot there and is included on the DVD. The most kick ass song they made is also out there (Sic). So if you love the band, you should see this and if you love heavy metal music then you should hear this band.
