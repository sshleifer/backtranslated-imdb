This is one of the best episodes of Doctor Who Ever. We have the Cybermen, The Cyber ​​converters (can scare young children) and the rough doctor does one of his best actions. Bravo David Tennant. Good scenes as if it were a movie with exciting scenes in some streets, an invasion of Cyberman's base, and leaving the world different from ours, basically a 45 minute movie. <br /> <br /> Being part 2 of the Rise of the Cybermen, it would never disappoint. With it has a good structure for the final. The doctor plus an evil enemy (Daleks, Cybermen, Master, Sontarans, Davros, Autons or Macra) is a blow to death, just beware of young children who see this.
