As a great Dostoyevsky fan, I had always been disappointed with Hollywood's half-hearted attempt to enter Russian romantic aesthetics - the issue in point, Yul Brynner as Dmitri Karamazov. I thought the whole problem was a bad casting decision, but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and changed my mind. When he got an intelligent script to work with, he suddenly became alive and was so noble, sexy and conflicting that you would ever have a neurotic Russian officer to be! So he was a better Dmitri as Major Surov than he was like Dmitri. But this is because the author Tabori actually gave Yul as the conflicting Russian officer the kind of conflicting Russian officers' lines worthy of genuine literature and having real meaning and pathos in them. For example, a folk music suggestion, he musingly says, "You hear a man crying in the dark. And if you listen enough enough, you know what he is crying for. You look surprised, Lady Ashmore. Despite what you might have heard, tractors and marxism are not the only things that the Russians care about. There is always time for music. "<br /> <br /> Brilliant !!
