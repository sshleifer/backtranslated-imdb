You know people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead ... and it works. It doesn't just work, it works very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard, I think I hurt myself, but the protagonists were all so human, so honest and so very real. But isn't that where big comedies come from? Do characters not have real feelings, real feelings, and the ability to feel real pain? Well, they do in this movie. Unconditional love is a movie you should not miss, especially if you need a serious good laugh, or you are in general curious to see the psychotic dwarf in the red raincoat.
