Manna from heaven is heavenly. This is a movie for the family - teenagers and grandparents can enjoy it together. But it is not syrupy sweet or stupid. The characters are really "characters". The reason is somewhat complex and you have to be aware, but it's like putting a puzzle together as it all comes in place bit by bit. The beginning of the period is like watching an old photo album, or remembering when. It is extremely well done with very precise hairstyles and costumes. The story moves quickly along with twists, turns and lots of fun. <br /> <br /> A special treat is to see the great casting of familiar faces, many of which we have not seen for too long. Part of the fun is to recognize and name them mentally as they appear, although it can be distracting. Cloris Leachman at the end of the movie looks as if she has had an overpower on "Oprah". I had never seen Faye Grant in a movie - only knew her as Grace's mother in the TV series "Save Grace". She was great, even minus the southern accent. And I didn't even recognize Shelly Duvall. The five sisters who created this very nice movie are a very talented quintet and sister Theresa is a heavenly treasure.
