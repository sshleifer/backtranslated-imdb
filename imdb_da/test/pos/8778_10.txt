I consider Saboteur as Hitchcock's first American movie, because the story takes place entirely in the United States <br /> <br /> There are amazing scenes in this movie. The Statue of Liberty Scene, Barry Kane jumps into the water from the bridge, the waterfall scene is amazing. It is not Hitchcock's fault that he did not get the actors he wanted. Hitchcock originally wanted Gary Cooper for the leading roles in Foreign Correspondent and Saboteur. But Gary Cooper was not interested in making a thriller. Another reason why Hitchcock didn't get big stars was because he wasn't one of the top directors. Although Rebecca was a great success, most of the film's success went to producer David O. Selznick. For example, David O. Selznick received Best Picture Oscar for Rebecca. And Hitchcock didn't get a best director Oscar for Rebecca. Hitchcock began to get some attention after a foreign correspondent (1940). But Universal gave him a low budget for Saboteur (1942). Hitchcock tried to get Joel McCrea into this movie because he was willing to work with Hitchcock again with a low pay. He enjoyed working with Hitchcock in the Foreign Correspondent (1940). But he was inaccessible. So the role went to Robert Cummings. Hitchcock is called Robert Cummings "a competent performer." I thought he did his best. He was a lesser-known actor who was willing to play a role as many major actors refused to play the leading male role. <br /> <br /> As for the leading female role, Hitchcock wanted Margaret Sullavan or Barbara Stanwyck for the leading role. They were not interested either. So Universal decided to give the role of Priscilla Lane. I read in a book that this was one of her favorite films. <br /> <br /> I also liked the scene in Blindman's house. That's my favorite scene. If we listen closer to the dialogue in scenes happening in Uncle Philips House, we'll see how intense it is. Uncle Philip (Blind Man) studied Barry Kane's character the moment he entered his house. The moment Barry entered his house, he heard Barry's handcuffs. Through conversation, he realized that Barry Kane is not a criminal at all. We also see his hearing ability through these scenes. For example, Barry hears the sound of a car, says "Is that a car coming?" Uncle Philip says "I think two cars." Uncle Philip was right. We see 2 cars in the next scene. Priscilla Lane did a good job of playing her role. She wasn't a big star. But I thought her performance was really good. Another brilliant scene in Uncle Philips House is the scene where he asks Priscilla Lane (Patricia Martin) "Are you scared, Pat? Is that what makes you so cruel?" I thought Otto Krueger played the villain brilliantly. Hitchcock wanted Harry Carey for the villain. But he refused. Harry Carey is famous for his role Mr. President in "Mr. Smith goes to Washington." I'd like to mention more about this movie. But I think my post will be too long. <br /> <br /> Each Hitchcock movie is special in its own way. I'm sure Hitchcock fans will like this movie. I rate 10 out of 10.
