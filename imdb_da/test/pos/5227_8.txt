No one said it in "The Big Trail" and I thought it would be a natural one. Nevertheless, this was one of the best westerns I've seen, and I'm a big fan of horses and gunsmoke movies. The magnitude and feeling of this image is simply staggering, and as someone mentioned in their comment, it has the feel of the 3-camera triptych of "Napoleon" (1927). Today, the cost of production and especially the thrown of thousands would be prohibitive, but Raoul Walsh did it. <br /> <br /> The cast was excellent, although John Wayne was better when he had no lines and just swaggered around. Especially Tyrone Power, Sr. was a perfect villain - I had never seen him before, and that was his only talking picture. Ian Keith was a snake, but El Brendel is an acquired taste like comic relief. He can be fun or annoying, but mostly the latter - and he shows up at the most inappropriate times. <br /> <br /> It's a little too far, and it took some time for the Indians to show up, but this is so close to a documentary about Manifest Destiny and as true to life that you want to see and a must for movies fans regardless of genre preference. When the settlers came to California, I was exhausted.
