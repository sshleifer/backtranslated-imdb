17/02/09 "More" (1969) Dir: Barbet Schroeder <br /> <br /> For a movie that most viewers agree on is pretty average, I am impressed with how many different interpretations there are been offered. I have only cleaned the net quite briefly, and I have already been informed that "More" is: A 1900s romance, an explanation of the story of Icarus, a regular movie full of boring people and only of interest to Pink Floyd completists . It is fair to say, then the critical reception is mixed. I would argue that these wildly diverse readings of Barbet Schroeder's 1969 debut is evidence that "Mere" is anything but a beautiful average movie. Nor is it a masterpiece, of course. I approached "More" as I did "Easy Rider" and Antonioni's "Blowup" - as a "time-capsule" movie, a snapshot of an era - despite the differences in tempo, style and content between these films. They all have similar flaws - either vague or even odd characters that seem like a bit of a bustle of reality, casual editing and sudden inferences that have left viewers horrible. These movies never try to be convincing or meet the audience halfway - they are what they are, man. This in itself is not a problem as long as we are back with a souvenir of the experience. Fortunately, "More" offers more truly memorable images, sounds and suggestions to the viewer, and it saves it. <br /> <br /> Stefan is a young man who arrives in Paris fresh from his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of French hipsters, accompanying them to devastatingly cool and self-conscious parties and bars before meeting Estelle. The two characters become sexually and romantically involved, and he promises to accompany her to Ibiza, against the advice of his friend Charlie. This is where the Icarus case comes into play - she is the sun, he is pursuing her. You can now guess how all this ends. Ibiza is an idyll so far away from the crowded Paris hurry that the naive Stefan knows he must be on a good thing. Estelle remains elusive and irregular, and the island has a less desirable underbelly. So far, I have a little about any of these characters and their unfocused pursuit of a place to be really free, but when the action is paired with just these two, the movie becomes quite flat. During just one wistful dialogue exchange in the remote villa, the resident where their fleeting love crystallizes, I went away from seeing with a failing optimism to become completely enraptured. I can't think of many other movies that have done this. The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is genuine and human, because we can see it going from life-defining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel cold. They take a lot of drugs and cavort naked on the terraces, rocks and beaches. Their lives are about nothing but each other and the beautiful Mediterranean areas. In a moment, their situation is the very essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience for their own sake. But Stefan is not in control, and it is more than just his future in Ibiza. <br /> <br /> Pink Floyd's score is perfect for exoticism, intimacy and obstruction of "More". It is one of the most memorable inclusions, along with the mosquito nets around Estelle's bed and their hallucinogenic extent around the windmill (as evidenced by the soundtrack boom front cover). A scene where they take acid to escape from the heroin recording illustrates the couple's basic deficiencies - they cannot land without a breakdown. Perhaps they have come too close to what they wanted. <br /> <br /> Stefan never contacts any family or friends before arriving in Paris. We are back to assuming they have no idea where he is. While other 1960s counterculture films reside on debauchery, excess media, and voyeurism, Schroeder has instead presented us with a story focused on a man who sneaks into a little corner somewhere in the world and disappears quietly.
