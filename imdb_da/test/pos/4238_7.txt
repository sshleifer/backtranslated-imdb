This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie, and it's a good time hell. This is a John Hughes movie featuring The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again makes this movie shiny. In fact, they are the only good parts of the movie. I was upset by Katherine Heigl and Nick Stables scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a siding and a person to save the day. But Chucky and Tiffany were lovely to see and I really liked the black humor to it. I thought it made the movie stand out more. If you want a good good, be sure to check this out. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
