It has been almost 50 years since I saw "Jennifer" for the first and only time. I did not know the name of this movie until I looked at this site, but I have told many people (especially my grandchildren) how movies do not have to contain graphical details to scare you and leave powerful influence. The story skillfully introduces you to concepts that, if true, put Ida Lupino in a very dangerous situation. Every time Miss Lupino discovers a new "fact", she draws the viewer into her confusion and fear. This film has such an impact on me that nearly 50 years later I still mention it as one of the most scary movies I've ever seen. Nevertheless, this film does not contain the blood and gore which became popular shortly after this film was made. It's amazing what a good story and good actor impact can do.
