I really like the movie's opening when colleague Ted Masters realizes on his radar radar that four enemy planes approached from about 10 o'clock. The good news is that the film does not mention at first that the Colonel, along with a lieutenant flute fighter, tried to exercise a "freedom of navigation" exercise along the eastern Mediterranean, but also went slightly past the restricted airspace zone reserved to a villain Middle Eastern nation, as they unfortunately fly past it. <br /> <br /> I also like all interconnection on the Colonel's giant radar readings and computer monitors as the enemy aircraft aggressively select the two American fighter pilots into a commitment to offend their airspace. The first dogfight immediately reminds me of the famous fighter pilot film, "Top Gun". From the growth of the enemy bandits to the enemy aircraft's thirty millimeter rounds, which hit the Colonel's jet engines and force the plane down and force him to push out, all this reminds one thing ... Dogfight fighter techniques can keep you alive .. But a fake motion can get you shot down. <br /> <br /> The only problem in the movie was the "snake sequence" scene. It was a little too long. Yes, the movie's opening was great when you see the conflict ... which was dogfight engagement. Only when a boy tells Doug Masters that his father was shot down after the Cessna plans landed in the "snake" race, we are stepping back to the time the conflict already started. I assume that the hose sequence in the middle must be interrupted slightly by the Col. Masters are pulled by hand in the middle of the Bilyad desert on their way to the detention center ... while the order of music for the "snake" continues. The movie doesn't ... if it were, the details of the conflict would have been smoother at that time. Otherwise good. <br /> <br /> When words found out that Col. Ted Masters attempted treason (violation of territorial air sovereignty) was over and he was condemned for hanging on the gallows in three days, Doug Masters decides to go into action. When the Air Force has unsuccessfully attempted to rescue the man, Doug decides to withdraw his friends and Col. Sinclair (played by Louis Gossett Jr.) for a plan to save the Masters. The risk of a high chance of meeting a court battle and spending more than a year in a military warehouse is against the Air Force policy and making a plan to save Masters without the consent of the US government. <br /> <br /> Doug and his friends sneak into several classified areas of the base to get lots of stuff in the area where the Masters is held to the upcoming hanging and the surrounding area around Bilyad (which appears to be a fake Middle East country for the movie). A plan included shooting off firecrackers outside the Air Force Darkroom area as a diversion to getting classified images and maintaining stuff on fighter aircraft, fighter base, intelligence and all the other military stuff around Bilyad. <br /> <br /> When all was said and done, and Sinclair studied all intelligence, he was almost rejected on that level, because Doug was too cunning. Only until they got the two F-16 planes and tried a dry race over a firing area, I understood what to do abroad. I realized that Doug's giant shooter and bombing is not good until he hears rock music. I remember when he lost a Mach 82 bomb on a horizontal target and the bomb missed by 20 feet .... I realized Doug is unusual. He likes music when he burns the fighter ammunition. The last part of the conflict, the final dogfight action in the "Iron Eagle" was better than Top Gun's climax of the hostile dogfight sequences. I liked the way the final conflict unfolded, especially when Doug Masters is facing a Middle Eastern ace giant pilot who actually drove the trial of Ted Masters. Short but sweet, as Doug took the enemy out after a second attempt with a side-winder missile. It looks like this Bilyad Colonel was related to "Darth Vader" in Star Wars .... in the air he can be very vicious because if you saw Star Wars, Darth Vader was actually Anakin Skywalker, who was an ace pilot in place. Unusual connotation for this, but still works!
