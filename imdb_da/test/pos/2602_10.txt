This is my favorite Looney Tunes cartoon. It's a common plot: Daffy Duck tries to convince Elmer Fudd that it's really rabbit season and shoot Bugs. But you can never throw that rabbit! In addition to the usual comic book comedy, this cartoon is supported by a large word game that keeps you rolling on the floor.
