I finally received my DVD today so it and I are happy to announce that this is the original theater version of the movie. As you may have read in earlier reviews of "Rich and Famous", it edited for the television version of the movie, which somehow made it to VHS sometime in the late 90s, but now the WB has targeted the bug and deleted it on DVD complete with airplane stage, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt and scene in the hotel room, where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C ** t! It's all there and looks better than ever! A crisp, clear digital transfer, widescreen and special features that include original theater trailer and a vintage 1981 featurette called "On Location with Rich and Famous" with cast and director interviews. If you love this movie like me, you won't be disappointed to buy this DVD. Glad to finally get it on DVD ?? Worth the wait! Thanks Warner Bros!
