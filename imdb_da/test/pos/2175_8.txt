I recently read the story to see how these two matches, and if you can believe that, this movie improves on Balzac. The story has moved, I think, driving home the idea that Colonel Chabert is a man who has suffered a lot, and yet he comes home, not a hero, but as an outcast. As someone mentioned, I was initially confused if Chabert was related to The Return of Martin Guerre. No. It is stated by Balzac that Chabert is the right deal. What is interesting, however, is not he, he is not, but how his wife and society treat him. <br /> <br /> I think it's a timeless story of men going out to fight for their country, and when they come home, time has left them. Chabert is a tragic figure made more poignant by the amazing Gerard Depardieu. I don't care that he's been in 1 million movies, he's captivating. <br /> <br /> Fanny Ardant has a horrible character to play. Once a prostitute, Rose has used her feminine wiles to climb the social ladder. Is her feelings true to Compte Ferraud? I think they are and maybe pair it with her social standing at the time, and you start to feel some empathy for her. Fabrice Lucini slowly moves into my heart. He's unusual here like Derville. <br /> <br /> I think if you can get your hands on this gem of a movie, you won't be sorry. French cinema at its best.
