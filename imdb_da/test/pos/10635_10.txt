Michael Haneke is known for his disturbing movies as "Funny Games". This time, he adopted Elfriede Jelineks "Die Klavierspielerin", which is probably her best work so far. Jelinek always writes about violent behavior in families, and especially about oppression of women in a patriarchal society. <br /> <br /> Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) works as a piano teacher at the Vienna Conservatory. She still lives with her mother (Annie Giradot), they even sleep in the same bed (already a hint of something strange). Erika bullies her students the same way she is bullied by her mother and secretly watches porn movies and plays sadomasochistic games with herself. A student, Walter (Benoit Magimel), falls in love with her, but she simply refuses to sleep with him. She wants to play his games with him, but he is disgusted. He reluctantly follows her rules, which means disaster for both of them. <br /> <br /> Haneke has a very clear imagery, everything is filmed in an almost spartan way, improving the complexity of characters and history. /> <br /> People who don't know Austria very well may not realize how important the setting is to history. Jelinek (as well as other great Austrian writers such as Thomas Bernhard) suffer from cold and relaxation in Austrian families and communities. Austrians (at least Welsh people) are often incapable of articulating their pain, wanting to suppress their emotions, so there is often no true love, love, and closeness in their families. In a society where it is more important to show a perfect facade to society (though it means protecting crimes within families, as Erika and her mother protect Walters rape by Erika to avoid a scandal) than dealing with your emotional problems, It may not be surprising that Sigmund Freud founded the psychoanalysis in Vienna. Erika has a cold and distant relationship with her mother, the only time they share some feelings is very violent and not at all loving. Erika replaces her hidden emotions with desires for violence, so she can finally release some emotions. But she has no one who really wants to talk about her feelings, so she eventually has to stab herself to ease her inner pain. Isabelle Huppert shows her best career ability (of most other actors). With an unclear face, you often only see a glimpse of emotions in her face, a quick smile, a look with her eyes. And finally, her pain is masterfully shown without a single tear. <br /> <br /> Benoit Magimel and Annie Giradot also turn into powerful performances, but the film belongs to Huppert.
