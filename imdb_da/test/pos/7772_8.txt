From the opening sequence, full of black and white shots reminiscent of Gordan Park's photos, this movie draws the viewer into a sense of artistic renaissance. The background for a poetry cafe named "Sanctuary" gives just that. The jazz that permeates the movie and cinematography will seduce you. <br /> <br /> This story of love actually allows love to grow, evolve and eventually mature, a rarity in Hollywood. Everyone can identify with one step or another in their journey towards each other. This tale of two artists, who just can't quite get it together, was a debate among their viewers. Should she go away? Should he stop her? Who knows ...? Starring Larenz Tate (Darius Lovehall) and Nia Long (Nina Moseley) with a scene steal the performance of Isiah Washington (Savon) and Lisa Nicole Carson (Josie Nichols) as ultimate best friend, this movie is a romantic jewel. <br /> <br /> See this with a person you love (blink).
