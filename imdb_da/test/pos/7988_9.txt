When I first rented Batman Returns, I immediately thought it was less than unusual. I mean, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how could that be a good movie? Simple, throw in Danny DeVito. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns is a undoubtedly more dark movie than Batman. There are several villains here, less real dark comedies in many aspects and more nerve-racking problems. The music, however, looks like the first one, if it is not darker. The landscape is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail right down to the season. This movie follows the same comic-style format we came to love in the first Batman. <br /> <br /> Now for the performances. Fortunately, Michael Keaton returns as Batman / Bruce Wayne. He was great in the first movie and just as much in this sequel. There wasn't enough screen time in the world for Keaton as Batman, need more! Danny DeVito gave an award-winning performance like The Penguin, the most gruesome, disgusting, gracious, angry, evil, sad, pathetic villain ever to have a superhero movie. You hate him so much, but you feel so bad for him at the same time. And it also explains him in the last detail and makes it more contradictory. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman / Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. She actually got a good amount of back story. Christopher Walken did not disappoint as Max Shreck, the greedy, judgmental, self-employed energy company director. Fortunately, Michael Gough returns as the beloved Alfred, and he was as good here as well. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, even though I feel he was never in the limelight. <br /> <br /> With lots of beautiful twists and subplots, Batman Returns is sure to please any fan of the original. /> <br /> 9/10
