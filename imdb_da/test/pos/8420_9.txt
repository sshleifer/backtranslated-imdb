Captured this movie on DD while changing channels ... And sky, also when it just started. After studying in Pune, this movie touched many happy memories of the city ... which differentiates why more films like this are not made ... Each character is so well etched - grandfather, baby, doc ... except from the social worker who laughs a bit, the rest of the film hardly has a mistake ... one deserves admission to the Oscars, although it was not nominated ... definitely leaves a lump in the throat ... who do you need mushroom to tickle your liars? And to think that this movie needed Sachin Tendulkar to convey it. Despite being in Marathi, there was hardly a moment when I couldn't follow the movie ... the subtitles were good. One must look at any fan of good cinema.
