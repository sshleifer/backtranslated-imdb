It seems that everybody didn't like Steven Seagal: Just take a look at his nomination list, there are only raid nominations (with a win) for him, but I think he didn't make any of it. I saw great movies with Steven Seagal, I saw bad movies with Steven Seagal. And PATRIOTEN (1998) is one of his best films, almost as good as UNDER SIEGE (1992) or HARD TO DROP (1990). PATRIOTEN shows its activities to protect nature. Surely, this movie is not a big one, and I have to say that there is more violence than I like, and why should Seagal's best friend L. Q. Jones die the death of a victim? Dr. McClaren's role is one of Seagal's best performances. He always has a very good charisma. And in short, THE PATRIOT is good entertainment - and with an average rating of only 4 points, the most underrated movie is all the time. Regards Hans-Dieter
