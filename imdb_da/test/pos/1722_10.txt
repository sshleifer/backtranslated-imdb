I love Dr. WHO so much! I think David Tennant is the best Dr, the show has ever had, and Billie Piper the best companion! I liked the way Dr and Rose had such a connection and a good relationship, and Dr came close to a few times to express his love of praise! Unfortunately it ended after only 2 seasons. I will miss seeing the rose hopper and think the show will not be the same without Rose! But David is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to see him play this amazing role! I rate this show 110% it's FANTASTIC! The graphics and monsters in this show are wonderful and every story is different but somewhat connected, and I have actually learned something about love, the world and relationships from this show. Therefore, it must be one of the most amazing shows at all times!
