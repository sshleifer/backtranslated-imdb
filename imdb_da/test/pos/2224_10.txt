This is one of Peter Sellers best films. Why is it never shown on TVs or cinemas? Will it ever be released as home video? Is it also derogatory for the medical field? I would love to watch this movie again. I want my son, who is a doctor, to see it. Laughter is the best medicine, and Peter Sellers is the best doctor for this.
