I just love this movie and I have my TV programmed to record it when it comes back on November 2. It's a really good love story with a twist. The song played at the end of the movie is one you would not believe would be a big hit, but it is a song that stays in the head and I am now trying to find that song so I can hear it and play it. I really have no style with the shows I see or the songs I like to hear and there make me pretty open to seeing things new with an open mind. I would like to say that there are some parts of this movie that are not meant for the whole family to see. This film shows skin. It's a bit like a lifetime movie for women, about women. I say watch the movie and you just like it as much as I did.
