If you like your sports movies to be about dignity and the best values, then this works for you great time. Overcentimental in places? Of course it is of course - and proud of it. It is the biggest and best trip in Carnival and should be enjoyed like that. <br /> <br /> Large production values, simple narration, with creative images: It's not complex, it's a very nice and remarkably cute movie. It really feels like a love power from Bill Paxton; And I bet his son gets it. <br /> <br /> The build is slow enough to be enjoyed, the feisty conflicts, and the British vs Americans are dealt with a degree of vaudevillian villain, but the dignity of two main transatlantic protagonists is always in the foreground. I have less grip: the score will be James Horner but is too crowded and there are too many close-ups and panning shots in 2005, but if you want a straightforward, decent and nice sports movie then this is it. So here's the case, and I want to know my movie, but I really liked it more than Seabiscuit: Which movie is better, but the Greatest Story is simply Disney in its core and hugely entertaining!
