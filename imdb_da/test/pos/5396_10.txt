Some might think Imaginary Heroes is a movie like "Igby Goes Down", but it's not. In Imaginary Heroes, the instructor allows us to feel for the Travis family and the people around them. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is amazing and the play is extremely well done. Weaver and Hirsch's plays are credible and help make the movie what it is. The actors, director / author, Dan Harris, have made a movie that many people should see. Don't think it's just another teen movie, it's a movie about a family and their problems. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 10/10 because I think it's not the best movie that no movie can be, but it's the closest it can make perfect.
