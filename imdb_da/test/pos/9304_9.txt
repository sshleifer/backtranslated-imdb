There have been numerous productions that tell about the development of the atomic bomb. The Robert Taylor Movie NOTE AND BEYOND (if you believe in this, you think the Army Air Corps, in Paul W. Tibbit's person, ran the whole show!) Produced NBC ENOLA GAY (probably a lot closer to the brand) and BBC TV series OPPENHEIMER with Sam Waterston in the title role. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes the same approach as the BBC series did, but broadened it; it avoids the Manhattan Project's "Gee Whiz" technology and focuses on human aspects; the personalities involved in the work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a wide step of mythical but rather typical people who were part of it. <br /> <br /> With reservations, Dwight Schultz did a good job as Oppie, presented a dreamy, Ivory Tower academic struggling to relate his contributions as a physicist to his inclinations to see the world in a wider social and moral context ... only to get that battle won by an overall desire for personal power and glory. IN THE DAY AFTER TRINITY, it became clear that Oppenheimer regarded himself as a "superior being" because of his far-reaching intellectual skill. Eventually it was Robert Oppenheim's downfall; He saw himself as a kind of "Philosopher / King", a moral and intellectual superior who could (and rightly) "reasonably" prescribe what was best for the rest of the world. development of nuclear weapons and implementation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, wisdom does not dictate nations or events at global level. Wisdom does not give time power. When trying to exercise such non-existent power (as Oppie found when he opposed the development of "Super", the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and cursed by those who really have power. <br /> <br /> I found myself guilty of Schultz's character in a way; His Oppie puts himself too close and personal to the Manhattan project, despite doubts and fears that tore on his intellectual basis. The real Oppenheimer would have had to take another approach at first, he would have to come to the firm decision that the project would result in ultimate good. The cruelty that was created along the way would be a random price to pay for the ultimate good, and it must be ignored ... at least until the end of the project, when there was free time to assess gains and losses. Oppie made it clear, and it resulted in his controversial post-war statements that science had now known sin, and it was a knowledge it could never lose. <br /> <br /> As the project progressed, such considerations had to be pushed aside if he were to maintain his beauty. Because of this ambiguity, Schultz's character emerges as a weak, frightened little boy who could never serve as a "rapid rupture coordinator" when Oppenheimer unofficially called his post. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman takes the gene. Leslie R. Groves is fascinating and a bravura performance if possibly a little over the top. <br /> <br /> Groves was a civil engineer at training, but first and foremost he was a soldier and a general to start! He is used to investigating that things go HIS way ... intensely driven, a creepy mouth, spoiled child who has tantrums by a drop that honors his country and is not so proud of kneeling and praying. In other words, much like REAL (ie no civil engineer) soldiers, also George Patton! Grove's MISSION comes not only first, it's his only consideration ... emotions and egos are condemned, apart from his own of course! Groves couldn't admit it, but he knew he needed Oppenheimer; Military rank meant nothing in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds he had to straddle. <br /> <br /> Again ... I have to fault the script on this and for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In fact, Grove's owner is already Oppie; If he didn't, Oppie would never have been chosen for the position in the first place. The story tells of many cases where other researchers, some like the stars like Oppenheimer, simply went away from Grove's recruitment efforts. At one point, Groves was so desperate that he suggested drafting the physicists he needed! <br /> <br /> Grove's attempt to maneuver and control Oppie was unnecessary ... they only exist here as a dramatic entity that really helps make the atmosphere of the movie pretty ugly. Kusak's Michael Merriman is a combination of several real characters, but they come from a different timeframe. Several research accidents corresponding to the depicted occurred in POSTWAR weapons research. <br /> <br /> The Merriman radiation dose creates another horror in the movie, but one that is, IMHO, is needed and quite accurate. People with weak stomachs will find it difficult to handle the hospital sequences; They are too real. <br /> <br /> The main idea that comes across, but not enough IMHO, is the great truth in the Los Alamos experience. The researchers who signed up were young, idealistic and naive as well as talented. Most were on their first outing out of the campus house. For them, the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to carry out large-scale experimental physics without limitations on budgets or "excessive" bureaucratic supervision. <br /> <br /> It wasn't just their brilliance, but their youthful coverings that produced the atomic bomb. <br /> <br /> There are plenty here to make the thought-provoking viewer intensely unpleasant over this movie. Just the same, if you are filtering out in Hollywood BS (that's not that much of it really), this is probably a pretty accurate view of the Manhattan Project inside.
