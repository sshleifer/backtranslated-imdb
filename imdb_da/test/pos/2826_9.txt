Okay, where to start. Did you know that the leading robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Bet you didn't. But they knocked it down and complained about robot makeup. Then they faded into turbidity. Now this movie has everything. A crazy killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of great robots. It's fun, it touches, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first robot romantic comedy. Now, of course, very few movies are perfect and there are some character problems. But there is much less and can be overlooked. I think couples will enjoy this movie and would like to see it again and again. 9 STARS.
