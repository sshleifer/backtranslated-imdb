When I read synopsis for the "Messiah" in the TV guide, I was not prepared for what was in the store. The story follows DCI Metcalfe trying to solve a case of grisly murder being taken out of London. He quickly realizes a pattern that is a serial killer on the loose, killing people with similar names and jobs to the 12 apostles, and their killing is identical to their corresponding apostle. The two part series kept me right on the edge of my seat, with Metcalfe carefully pursuing the killer, but always missing him within a few seconds and discovering the cruel mess he has left behind by his unhappy victim. "The Messiah" is sure to cause a great controversy, but it is still the biggest drama the BBC has shown for a long time.
