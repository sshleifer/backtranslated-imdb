One of the funniest movies I've ever seen in the theater back in the early 70s, and unfortunately it has only been on television a few times since. This movie must be published on video. It is the salespersons of its toughest, slimmest best as a crooked hospital administrator. Great cast, great movie. If someone has a good VHS copy, I would like to buy it.
