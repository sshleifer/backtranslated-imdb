A mix of 70's drug music along with parody of medicine and classical history line. As I have often said about this flick - if you don't understand it - you're lama ..... Classic lines like (parapharsed) "I have this erection and it won't go away no means how many times I do it. You are a nurse, what can you give me to? "Nurse answer" All I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... "Great soundtrack. The classic "Hyde has nothing to hide". Surprisingly close to the original plot - not that the original gets in the way of a joke ..... Has not met anyone with an IQ over 115 who doesn't find it hysterical. <br /> <br />
