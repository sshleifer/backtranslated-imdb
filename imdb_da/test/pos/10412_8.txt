I think it's great how Chiller downloaded this series and shows it to this generation. Film production has come so far, especially with the special effects, and to see archived shows that they never knew existed, they will certainly be able to see the progress compared to now. MONSTERS is neither lamb nor spectacular, but it is entertaining. It takes creativity for the types of stories they came up with, and each generation seems to have its own horror series. This particular series was not as horrific as Friday the 13th, the series or as an adult-oriented as Freddy's Nightmares. It was something a whole family could see and still get a laugh and a scare at the same time. I'm glad Chiller Channel shows it in their line-up, I'm just getting caught on the episodes I missed when I grew up.
