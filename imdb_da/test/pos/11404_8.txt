I was skeptical before going to this because of the horribly mounted trailer that made it look like an equally horrible movie. I was pretty surprised at how much I did not waste my money. I think the movie's success comes from how scary it really is and how the environment in the house is. Small things like the sensor lights create a real uneasy feeling. The shadows and the incredibly cold feeling of the house make it easy to tell that no matter how much you know horror movies, something can happen in the movie. The action is in no way perfect, nor were they bad. The protagonist is convincing even in view of the annoying teen dramas surrounding her. In the end, I was thoroughly impressed with the film in most aspects. It is definitely a movie I would recommend.
