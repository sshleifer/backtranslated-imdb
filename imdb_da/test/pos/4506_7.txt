Guilt and redemption are two of the affectionate feelings and plural elements of the heavy, powerful dramas that the Oscar loves so much (which is fun when "The Kite Runner" was nominated only for best original scores - the lack of nominations might be unfair). While most movie adaptations of books (or other means) are usually inferior to their literary counterparts (and "The Kite Runner" is NOT an exception), Marc Forster's movie adaptation is a good one. People are familiar with the story, the book has been read by millions, so I will not go into the plot except to say that the book remains fairly faithful to its source. That said, if you don't know the plot, you can watch the movie, or even better, read the book. <br /> <br /> The best "The Kite Runner" is heading for it (other than its history) is director Marc Forster. Forster is a director with epic reach and unique vision that is perfectly utilized to bring Khaled Hosseini's book on display. A small part of me worried that he would use the same dreamy pictures that were included in one of Forster's previous moves, "Finding Neverland". Don't make me wrong, "Finding Neverland" is a wonderful movie, one of my favorites actually, but the visual trickery he used in there doesn't have a place here. Fortunately, Forster understands it, and the gloss in his direction shows his versatility. Although the lack of a Best Director nomination for his work here is not exactly a travesty, I see a number of statuettes present for him down the road. <br /> <br /> Also in the note is the manuscript customization. It is true to the source, but it provides space for Forster's vision of interpreting the material. The dialogue is not stupid and it is. Along with Forster's direction, moving at a steady pace. Like Forster, the lack of recognition at the time of the awards ceremony was not a disgrace, but I would not have complained whether it was at least nominated. <br /> <br /> The division between this movie is great and excellent lies with the actor. Most of the performances are solid, but there are some who do not do the right thing and it hurts the movie. The most notable weak performance comes from Zekeria Ebrahimi, who plays the young Amir. It's not that it's bad, it's just that it's not as effective as it could be. He just can't translate the blame that consumes Amir to the audience. In fact, I think I could have been a little lost at this time in the movie at this time I hadn't read the book because of this. He looks gloomy and sometimes wild, but we can't feel his feelings. It is a difficult part to portray, and for the most part, young Ebrahimi keeps her own, which is especially surprising as this is his first role in film. The best performances come from Khalid Abdalla, who plays adult Amir and Shaun Toub, who plays the wise Rahim Kahn. Abdalla may not be a well-known name (although he was in Paul Greengrass's "United 93"), but his work here is amazing. He is a quiet, modest man, and he resists perfectly when needed. A less accomplished actor could have made the character of Rahim Khan in a cliché, but Shaun Toub uses enough subtlety and care in his performance as he creates what the clichés are trying to portray. <br /> <br /> Forgive me if I'm going to run here, but that's something I need to address and that's the movie's PG-13 rating. The fact that this movie has received such a low rating is scandalous. There is no justification for that. Some might argue that the rating was bent due to the need for everyone to see what is doing in the "Saving Private Ryan", which some say should have earned the movie for an NC-17 rating. But this exception cannot be used here. The only purpose the scene serves is to tell the story. Forster (probably on behalf of the producers) tried as hard as possible to tame the film's most painful and disturbing scene to allow the movie to sneak with a PG-13 rating, but the subject matter is too disturbing to be depicted in any way and get less than an R rating, whether "tasteful" can be portrayed. Worse, this editing robs the scene too much of its power, and by trying it makes it less worrying to get the lower rating offensive. Moreover, some scenes of violence are also disturbing. Regarding how much time these scenes take off the movie, it doesn't add too much, but at least there is a deserved profit from an R rating. The MPAA, whose rating film system has always been corrupted, has been lowered to a new low by giving this film such a low rating. <br /> <br /> But you shouldn't miss the film. The film is a solid movie worth watching, especially if they are fans of the book.
