When I watched this movie at a festival years ago, I was very impressed and I started looking for it. Nothing to do, not in the cinemas or on DVD nor on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How can that really happen? The direction is impossible, the story is exciting and has been filmed in a very original way, the music is perfect and James Franco is hot as hell !!! <br /> <br /> Release this masterpiece and let it be real life !!!!!!!!!! This is really a great movie that people should see and it deserves a chance again !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Edvard
