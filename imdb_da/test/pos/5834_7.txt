This is a hard show to see. It's nothing to sit back and relax on. It kept me on the edge of my seat for several seasons. People get screwed over, raped, tortured and die like flies. There are male organs everywhere, there are excrement, puke and blood. Oz is a brave show. It brings problems like racism, homosexuality, the prisoner's reality and most of all; -capital punishment In my opinion, it has also succeeded in doing so, in contrast to, for example, the single-track "Medium". <br /> <br /> Sometimes I was bored. It had some weird history lines and they spent a lot of time on signs that just didn't interest me. Strangely enough, I found season 1 to be quite boring. If I had seen it while it was aired, I think I would not have continued to see it. I love seasons 2 - 4. Seasons 5 and 6 can be seen (although I think it should not be allowed to pronounce the words "Cyril" and "Death Row" in the same sentence) <br /> <br /> There are so many wonderful characters to fight for. The old boys Bob and Busmalis, whom I completely fall in love with from the first day. Said, Adebesi, Pancamo and Schillinger, four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way. Augustus Hill, whose monologues bound the episodes together so effectively. The staff with people like Sister Pete and Ray Mukada-also brilliant. Also small letters that were only inside a few episodes or a few seasons, but also a good impression. <br /> <br /> My favorites are the O'Reily brothers. Their relationship was the most gut-wrenching and warmest I watched on television. If there is something I will always remember about this show, it is them. There will never be another "mating" or what to call it, it will hurt me so much. That is why when the ends come for them, it does almost too much. I wish it would never have happened. I wish I had never seen it. <br /> <br /> But good a Fontana. I recommend it.
