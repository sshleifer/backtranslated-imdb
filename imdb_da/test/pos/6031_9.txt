I also saw The Last Stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival in Prince George. I have to admit, the only reason I went to see it is because I'm a huge Callum Keith Rennie fan. And he didn't let me down. He gave a good performance of a rather unsympathetic character and gave the only comic relief throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is the usual 'many bad people caught in a blizzard together' story, but it had a couple of phrases that kept me guessing. The characterizations were strong and the whole cast performed quite well. The only issues I had with the cast were Rose McGowan. She was so cold throughout the film that we didn't get any idea of ​​her character's personality or motivation. Apart from her and a few minor problems of continuity, this was a well-written, well-functioning thriller.
