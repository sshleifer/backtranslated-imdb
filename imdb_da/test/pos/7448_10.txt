I start with a disclaimer: This movie is NOT recommended to anyone who lacks interest or has never played the FF7 game before they see. The film is dependent on the audience's knowledge of each character in the game to convey the story elements of history. And that makes it so very subtle. Do your homework before you see this wonderful piece of CG movie and I promise it will be so much better. <br /> <br /> With that in mind, this movie has some of the most spectacular CG sequences I've ever seen. The whole experience felt like an extra-long FMV sequence from the game, on steroids. Yes. The attention to detail in each scene, especially in the heavy action-oriented, is so impeccable that it gave me a sense of awe. I think the soundtrack is simplified to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music. Again, for those who are familiar with the FF7 story and background, the music should not surprise anyone (though the timing and location of each audio track from the original accompanies each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation). <br /> <br /> Once again, I only once played the FF7 once, thoroughly enjoyed this art from Square Enix. And that is the feeling in most scenes, choreographed and organized. Like a dance. In short, if you enjoy the music or the game Final Fantasy 7, this movie will blow you out of the water. If you are in the unfortunate majority who have not experienced the goodness known as FF7 on the Playstation or PC, do it before watching the movie, allowing for an exponentially greater experience. Finally, I just want to note the quality of animation of this movie. Signs move with fluidity. Every scene background comes to life and tells its own story. For those who criticize the thinness and dependence on the story plot, I urge you to rethink the animation. Facial reactions, subtle traces that provide another level of entertainment over the typical narrative method of plot plotting. Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura have set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling. Advent Children has ushered in a new era for CG animations, so the subtleties of each character speak for amounts in themselves. <br /> <br /> Thanks Square Enix. The wait was well worth it.
