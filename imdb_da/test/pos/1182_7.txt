A competent comedy that delivers laughs to fans of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. I suppose this movie was made for those who enjoy the two GRUMPY OLD MEN movies, as there appeared to be a bunch of these buddy-team-ups who highlighted the comic duo in their twilight year. The idea is a sure guy: Matthau, a bumbling gambler who is thousands of dollars in debt, greets his unsuspecting friend Lemmon to take a free cruise with him to meet rich old ladies; The prisoner is, they have been signed as Dance Hosts, and Matthau cannot dance. <br /> <br /> OUT TO SEA is a fun movie and not all chuckles are found with the kindness of Lemmon and Matthau. I found Brent Spiner (best known as Data from STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION) to be very humorous as the snobbish ball-busting dance coordinator. As the splendid boss of the two aging actors, he manages to match them in the laughter section. Although the movie doesn't really need anything, there is also a love story or two that also exists here involving Dyan Cannon (which looks nice in its years).
