Meatballs work their way into conversations, like no other movie. Especially during the summer. Whether it's the song about the CITs (Counselors In Training) or the cuts or the inspiring Rudy the Rabbit or It Just Does not Matter talk ... it shows up! Poor Mickey / Morty, who knows where to wake up next!?! Such a great snapshot of the 70s and a cultural icon for my generation of those who understand the non-PC is really fun no matter who you are! Wheels and Spaz are favorites, like the hot dog's eating competition with the famous line "What ..? No Mustard?" Oh, how many times have I repeated that line and been the only one to laugh! Thank you to the authors, actors and directors! Applause, applause!
