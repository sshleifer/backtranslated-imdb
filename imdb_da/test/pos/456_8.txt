Yul Brynner is Major Surov, a singing, dancing, vodka-drinking Russian officer located near the Austrian-southern border during the Hungarian Revolt of 1956 in Anatole Litvaka's journey. Although the film is not yet released on video or DVD, it is still one of Brynner's most convincing performances. Due to the political turmoil, a group of travelers cannot fly out of Budapest, but become the bus to Vienna. However, before they can reach the border, their passports are taken and they are detained for the Russians led by Major Surov. <br /> <br /> The Major has reason to suspect that there is a Hungarian freedom fight among the group smuggled out of the country. In fact, Lady Ashmore hides a mysterious passenger, Paul Fleming (Jason Robards, Jr.), pretending to be American but fooling no one. She mainly helps Fleming repay a debt she owes because of the problems her previous association caused him. Among the other passengers is a British journalist played by Robert Morley, an American family played by E.G. Marshall, his wife Anne Jackson and their two children, one of whom is screen debut of little Ron Howard. Major Surov takes a romantic interest in Lady Diana Ashmore (Deborah Kerr) and a romance of varieties evolves between them. She offers him nothing but contempt and a stiff upper lip, although we suspect that under her heart still strikes. The cold war scheme and the powerful action carry history, but the romance is never entirely convincing. However, it is one of my favorite Yul Brynner films and deserves to be seen if it is only for his passionate performance.
