Nominated for Best Documentary Features at the 2004 Academy Awards, my architect's filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn follows in his quest to find out about his father, legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving an incredible but limited working group, unpaid debts and three separate families, all living within a few miles of each other. <br /> <br /> My architect follows Kahn's life by chronologically examining his buildings and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic but selfish and emotionally immature genius. As the son, whom Lou never publicly recognized during his life, Nate has delicately settled in the story without overcoming the main focus. <br /> <br /> As he examines the magnificent Salk Institute in California, Nate evokes his father's mythical use of space and light in his buildings, making it a peaceful and fascinating experience for viewers. The shot of Nate skates in Salk's smoky white central venue emphasizes the building's harmony with nature. It's breathtaking. My architect also covers the problem Louis Kahn had in getting his designs accepted. Several amazing buildings are only available on paper, dismissed by more practical architects and property developers. It was only before Louis Kahn went east that his visions were enthusiastically mentioned. In India, where he built the Indian <br /> <br /> Department of Management, a former employee describes him as a guru. In Bhangladesh, where he built the magnificent National Assembly, citizens consider him a father of democracy. <br /> <br /> Seeing my architect is a wonderful way to start or continue learning about architecture and the importance of space. But that's the irony of Lou Kah's selfishness combined with the transcendence of his work that will inspire you. 4 stars.
