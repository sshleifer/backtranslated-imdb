This version does not move me as deeply as the later Hollywood version with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. While it was beautifully recorded and superbly acted, the BBC version was more packed with dialogue that provided information that I found fascinating. It gave me a detailed glimpse of the intellectual, theological, and moral considerations that motivated C. S. Lewis. It was therefore more interesting and stimulating than the Hollywood version, but not so visually stunning or viscerally influenced. Yet I used one and at frequent intervals while I did not leave a heap of cold Kleenex in the theater. I enjoyed this movie as much as the Hollywood version, and was grateful for the increased understanding I gained.
