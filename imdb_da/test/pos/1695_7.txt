"Landscape after a fight" opens with escaped prisoners over a snow-covered area with fences - in quite fun moves accompanied by Vivaldi's Four Seasons. A moving opening. But we soon learn to know these prisoners as a mob, and when they (also treated humorously) commit a living man, the protagonist stops for a moment, but is soon more engaged in finding books from the discouraging camp than worrying about his neighbor. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is set in an American camp from which the prisoners are not released, in a kind of semi freedom, semiflod. A perfect set for a study of war crime, American camps, Polish nationalism, Catholicism, grief and human misery in general. <br /> <br /> Movies are an important tour. You come women, and with them, film changes light, color and temperament. At the same time, it turns out that these prisoners were slaves in the Holocaust. I believe that the film's main underlying political theme must be mankind's treatments for Jews during and after World War II, and not just Nazi extermination, but humanity allows it to happen - and even force them out of Europe after the war. At an emotional level, the film is about grief and the problem of letting grief come, how environment makes grief difficult, and how difficult it can be to share grief for people with different experiences. <br /> <br /> But the film is a blanket of underlying contradictions, humor, irony and sudden beauty. A few times during the film, a gypsy prisoner plays on a harp, an emotional melody brutally rejected (cinematically) by the protagonist. This example captures an important essence of the movie's style and theme. When it comes to humor, the very cartoon is how the protagonist constantly loses and finds his glasses, in crowds, in high stacks, etc. It's not hard to understand Spielberg's respect for Wajda when you see this movie. The great treatment of light can be compared to Spielberg at its best. Grunwald intermezzo speaks for itself. Narrativly only brings the movie out of the camp, but cinematically brings the film to dream and eternity with deep beauty. In any case, there is also another scene, I can't let go without comment. It's the Christian supper. Undoubtedly ironic, but at the same time deeply religious, we see transubstantiation currently, all falling to their knees, while the protagonist is saved from the isolation of the priest to serve as a comic altar boy. His watches mocking the scene, but also gives it feeling and love. When Nina gets her bread, the sunlight falls on her and the bells are ring-shaped, that is the film's vertex. <br /> <br /> Main players are excellent in their roles. Olbrychski as the perfect Wajda protagonist - the doubtful reflective mind, unable to put all aspects of his mind and emotions into life. Beautiful Celinska is with great body-acting debut in a character who cannot express her entire interior in her proud movements. Those who try to describe everything are often unable to take into account anything. That is what Wajda manages. His film is either very moving, deep or beautifully shot, but emphasizes the distinctiveness of life and society. A moment of joy for one, is the ironic moment for a second, the moment of sorrow for the third, a moment for nothing for the fourth. There are at least two reasons to be aware of Wajda's film during this period. First, the remarkable free expression of deep political impact. This country was the first to overthrow Communism twenty years later. Secondly, the development of a cinematic and narrative language that Kusturica has risen to greatness.
