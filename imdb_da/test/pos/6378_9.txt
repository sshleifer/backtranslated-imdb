I watched Teen Devian in 1993 telecasted in Doordarshan on a Friday night and could hardly believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in Bollywood. It was mind blowing? a movie with a "modern" story, great music, three lovely ladies and my fave superstar Dev Anand. In this unusual story, Dev falls in love with three women ?? the simple Nanda, the amazing Kalpana and the sophisticated Simi. They are also enchanted with him and will marry him. This puts Dev in a dilemma (which is the core of history) - who should marry? He is consulting a hypnotist who asks Dev to stare into a crystal ball. Dev finds the answer and marries Nanda. Beautifully directed (probably by Dev saheb himself & not by Amarjeet the official director) The B&W classic has evergreen music? some of SD Burman's (helped generously by RD Burman) best compositions. "Uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth" is probably the most sexiest song ever composed in Hindi movie. Credit must also be given to Majrooh Sultanpuri to cover the memorable texts. Teen Devian is a breezy musical style that perfectly matches Dev Anand's style, and he followed in full the role. Unfortunately, Teen Devian has never received the recognition and popularity it deserves right. <br /> <br /> A must see for any Hindi movie buff, I will judge the eternal favorite 9.5 out of 10.
