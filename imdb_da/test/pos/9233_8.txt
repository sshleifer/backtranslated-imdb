I'm not sure if the TV series discussion is exactly where the commentary should be drawn, but it is on television that The Lone Ranger really made a name for itself. I do not even refer to the original radio transmitter of this masked rider of the plains, although I am referring to a point where in a little boy, about 9 or 10 years old, I had to watch the movie "The Lone Ranger" and never forgot it. I remember being on a line or moving to the Paramount Theater Theater, if I remember correctly, the theater theater. It was directly across, going east to the west from the building that has the ball falling on New Year's Eve. This is of course if someone does not know New York City. High above the street on the roof tops there was a time, and perhaps even today, big billboards would announce what was shown, etc. It was at the time I looked up and was never again impressed as I was when I looked at the billboard to see the The Lone Ranger across the roof tiles - It was amazing - It was an impression and was never forgotten. That day we went to see The Lone Ranger-It was the story of how the Lone Ranger was born-The awful ambush that the Texas Rangers rode in and the subsequent rebirth of one of its fallen heroes. It was in this movie that we learn that The Lone Ranger will not shoot to kill but to hurt himself to let the law be the judge. This type of thinking is so worthwhile that we may be good at learning from history. This is where we learn that Tonto discovers the fallen Ranger and after seeing the symbol of the boyhood friendship, The Lone Ranger, established years earlier, as a younger person, he came to aide by an injured youth in Tonto-For the help given gave Tonto his faithful friend a symbol of his thanks, which was now part of a necklace recognized by Tonto. Tonto said, "You're Kemosabe". The Lone Ranger said "chemo-saze, it's well-known? Then Tonto tells the story of this t rusty scout" (the meaning of Kemosabe) I think that Lone Ranger is one of the true-to-life silver heroes and one of the great heroes on television. It should also be mentioned that these highly respected individuals Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels sought to live living in accordance with the legend of The Lone Ranger-It may well be that there is an inspirational story in Lone Ranger's story and his faithful companion Tonto . I was so happy with the ability to find and buy the DVDs that I held up on a Saturday morning and looked at the many episodes now available. Long Live The Lone Ranger and his faithful companion Tonto-Hi-Ho Silver-
