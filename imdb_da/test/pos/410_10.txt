While many pass this out as a B movie, it is actually a first-rate comedy that is well-written and acted. Red Skelton is great as Wally Benton better known for radio fans as The Fox. Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wally's fiance Carol Lambert. Conrad Veidt leads a very good cast of criminals. I read an account of this film, which states that Vincente Minelli directed this movie, not unless he changed his name to S. Sylvan Simon, who directed all three of the Fox movies. This is a very entertaining movie made when fantasy was encouraged. Then come across your black and white prejudices if you have one, sit back and enjoy a really good comedy. This was also Red's first lead role. Note during the climax of the reference to Orson Welles' War of the World broadcast.
