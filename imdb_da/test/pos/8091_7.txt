Fantastic comedy from Charlie Chaplin. I've seen Chaplin's 4 great movies (Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times, and The Great Dictator), and I think it's easy the funniest of the four. This movie made me laugh more than almost everyone else I've ever seen. From the very open statement of responsibility ("Any similarity between the great dictator and the barber shop owner is purely random"), the film is a laugh-minute with a mix of wonderful slapstick and verbal humor. And at the same time, Chaplin manages to portray the evils of totalitarian persecution. Maybe a little short on the final and lasting timeliness of the subject, but light a 9 out of 10 for me.
