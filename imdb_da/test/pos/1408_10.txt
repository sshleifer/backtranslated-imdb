William Haines sparks this tale of a brash cadet that believes West Point will really be now when he has arrived. Haines's amazing goony comic priest was his trademark - one that made him a top box office star from 1928-1932 and one of MGM's greatest stars. Joan Crawford and William Bakewell are also fine. And though this story may seem thin now, this was a big hit where Haines and Crawford were put in a college football (a national craze in the 20s). Once Haines blows off his big mouth once too often and almost cut off by fellow cadets, he becomes a wonderful achievement as he turns off his pride and enters the great game against the fleet. Even with a broken arm, he wins the game for the army and regains his place at West Point. It's easy to see from this movie and Show People (with the always underrated Marion Davies) why Billy Haines was a great star of the time. He needs and deserves to be remembered!
