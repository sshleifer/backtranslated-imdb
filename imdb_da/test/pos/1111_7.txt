John and his wife Emily, accompanied by their children Edward venture from the comfortable setting of suburbia to the village where the man spent some of his childhood. There has been a death in the family, and John is about to begin a procedure to take control of an old coastal cabin and once inhabited by an old man who apparently has committed suicide. <br /> <br /> Skeptical about Death Circumstances, John sets himself apart from his family and from reality, endangers his own life and puts on the old man's clothing, which is now dead. <br /> <br /> The movie is changing now - nothing It's what looks like - the people of his past look in full gothic / hillbilly glory - his wife cares about his mental state - and his son disappears into the reeds. John finds that the old man does not commit suicide that his death is far more mysterious and strange. In a spinal column final, we learn that the film's events have never actually happened, and that the whole story was portrayed by the little boy, Edward, who struggles to express himself with his parents' divorce. <br /> Modern Love is a macabre piece of high-art cinema, a puzzling and perverted piece of pretentiousness, full of vague suggestions and unexplored red herring. It is humorous and seemingly unconcerned with the current Indie trends, both of which validate its creators, but also make it pass√©. <br /> <br /> However, the weaknesses of this Australian film are completely offset by its sheer muscular cinematic vision, its bloody-minded and uncompromising precision and its oddball Euro horror. Bastardry of script norms and lack of smooth dialogue fall into insignificance towards a backdrop of noir and a lead performance to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> One of the most aggressively strange Australian movies this year.
