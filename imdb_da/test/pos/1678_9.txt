RIFIFI (Jules Dassin - France 1955) <br /> <br /> For me it seems a very risky idea to try a Hollywood remake of Jules Dassin's 1955 classic RIFIFI. Planned for release in 2007, Al Pacino seems to be playing the lead, taking on the role of Tony le Stephanois. Risk business ... How are they going to pull it out? <br /> <br /> Ironically, Dassin was blacklisted in Hollywood and continued to try his luck in France and made this little masterpiece, Granddaddy of all caper and hoist films. "In my opinion, it remains a unique classic, beautifully recorded With one of the most memorable finishes ever made on film, no matter what you think about the movie. <br /> <br /> Over the past few years, RIFIFI has been dangerously overstated. - classic is not forgotten, go see it before remake is out there to get some ammunition to compare the two. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
