This movie was just screened on Channel Seven - Australian TV - today. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was a very interesting starting point how the Nazis treated the Russian Jews as mercilessly as anywhere else. Kellie Martin did a really good job and her tears and frustration as "Frusia" was quite convincing. The Holocaust is part of our history, which we must not forget. Schindler's List was not the first - and it will not be the last - statement of survival and courage in the five-year nightmare. My family is Dutch, and I will always welcome any movie makers who want to keep living living alive by telling others the courage to get up and help those who were abused, violated and murdered to be "a Jew".
