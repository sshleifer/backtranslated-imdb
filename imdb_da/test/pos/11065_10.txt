I gave this movie a 10 simply out of my sick occupation with Ingrid Bergman :) lol. I really think she was the best actress to enjoy this land with her talent and all her movies are absolutely wonderful (even though they are terrible) because she is in them. If it hadn't been her and Vivien Leigh (as originally wanted, I hear) I would have given it a 9.0. Just because I love Viv, but probably not as much as I love Ingrid. And any other actress would have made it a 6. It's a good story that two wild people fall in love with a society where it's hard to be bad. Reminds me a little about GWTW except twisted with a more highbrow attitude. Gary Cooper is very pretty as usual and of course his voice never changes the whole movie, but hey Ingrid makes him seem so awesome and dashing and 20 times hotter than he probably should be.
