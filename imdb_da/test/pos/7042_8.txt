When I was younger, this movie was always broadcast Friday night in the summer on Channel 40 (it was the years before Fox was a network and took over the programming). I always looked forward to it. I wanted to go shopping with my parents and then sit down with my Swanson television dinner and a Lady Lee Cola (the only time of the week I was allowed to drink cola and enjoy. Of course, the script is predictably late in the 70s Little Darlings), but it's a fun movie and I loved Rudy and Tripper. Bill Murray throws some effort into the movie, but he is charming. Perhaps Spaz loves the taped glasses (before Nerd's Revenge). Chris Makepeace is basically the same character he played in "my bodyguard", but he does so well.
