As you can see, I came to this party quite late, but have the advantage of reading all the previous posts before I make my comments. I found this site by random coincidence as I was looking for other Marine Corps movies. So let me start by telling you that I played a Marine Boot in the movie, Pvt. Labarsky, stationed at MCRDep, San Diego at that time. Jack Webb and his crew chose 15 Permanent Personnel, some of whom had the talking parts, and another 15 Marines who had just completed Boot Camp. It was Plato and Marines who portrayed the various DIs. To the best of my memory, The Capt. And Pvt. Owens (Don Dubbins) was not in the Marines. We spent about three weeks in Hollywood (Studio City Film Lot), CA, who shot the part of the movie we were involved in, and then ended the other shots after we left. So as I ramble along here, let me clarify some of what has been questioned in previous posts as best I can. "Cuff Daddy" commented on our platoon's ability to shout "Yes Sir" without moving and etc. "Yes, we called on Sound Guys and it was shooting the scene at the same time. As you other colleagues remember when DI or who ever started asking a question and before they finished it, you had already taken the breath in the air so you could shout at the top of your lungs the right answer. That's how it was done. "74Sooner" commented to go through the same building on Paris Island, but as mentioned earlier, all the scenes were shot in Studio City, CA. They were built of photos taken on Paris Island and from on-site tours and Marine advisors from Paris Island. Sorry, you were in the right buildings, not the sets. <br /> <br /> "schappe1" brought up many good points, but if the incident with the platoon on Paris Island at that time said all that Jack Webb we were: "The movie came because of the accident and Marine Corps did not want to put something out that would affect any of the family members of the marines who died that night. Although the Marine Corps would give any Marines and help to a movie similar to the public, why a Marine DI does what he does. mentioned by some of you, I also took the time when we shot the scenes, caught my self-thinking this dialogue has been cleaned too much, and of course it is not how it goes down in real life. Back in the 50's, so it was. <br /> <br /> A story I'd like to pass on is about the interaction between us Marines and Movie Crew, and between Movie Crew and Jack Webb. From the start of the custom, the Marines replied "Yes Sir" to all who moved. Going into the second week it became more common to hear "Yes Sir" coming from all directions. On the scene, someone would bark out a request for something to do with the lighting and from outside on a catwalk over the seat would a response from "Yes Sir" sound. For all of this on one of our informal gatherings, Jack Webb said. "If I had known that I would have received so much respect from this crew member, I would have brought you here many years ago." There was an Lt that was brought up from San Diego to play the role of DI from the second platon, and one Jack Webb is struggling, but during a shootout he was up to number 32 and still kept Webb trying to work him through how he wanted it done and did not show any lack of patience with him. The next day they used the Paris Island counselor, who was a DI Sgt. from Paris Island and he worked fine. <br /> <br /> At that time, I was a bit of a camera buff and got to know Still Camera Man to get some pointer from him, and as it turned out, he would still give me shots and some of the 35mm film in the daily shooting that was not used. These film strips I cut up and made slides out of them. After the movie came out in VHS tape (The DI, 11706 B & W / 106 min.), My kids and the big kids have a blast when they try to see who can find me most times on the screen.
