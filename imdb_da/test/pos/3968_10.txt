When I watched this movie, I expected to be a cheesy American movie made on the cheap with horrible actors. I was really surprised to find out I was completely wrong. The film is centered around Bartely or B, which has been rejected from all his colleges. The actor who plays B is very natural and makes his character a reality - and decides to make a school so his parents stop harassing him. But lots of people see his fake website and participate. Feeling of their sorrows B cannot turn them far away to the fate of his best friends. The college is the ideal place for you to learn what you want or do nothing. The school faces opposition from the right college, which ends up closing it down. The movie ends high and I recommend you to watch it. Its got it missing, but it's a good good cheerful movie with a few unpredictable phrases.
