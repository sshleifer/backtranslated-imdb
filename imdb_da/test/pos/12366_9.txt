Not as well known as the English, American, German and French cinema, but cinema from sweden from the 20s was also pretty good, interesting and revolutionary. <br /> <br /> This is a movie made of its history. The story is told in 'A Christmas Carol' kind of way where death itself confronts the deceased with its past, present and what could have been. It is, of course, a story that focuses on morality and it does very well. The message comes across as very powerful and effective. This is of course also certainly due to the effective management from father to Swedish cinema; Victor Sjöström. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the novel by the other Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf. The story is adapted by Victor Sjöström himself, who might have taken out a few elements to let the story and the film flow better. It may take a little too long before the movie begins to take shape and the story becomes clear, but when the film takes shape and pace it becomes a truly wonderful one. The film not only has a great story, it is also a good look. The film uses some early and effective effects and uses some different color filters to create the right mood and indicate what it is passing, present and 'future'. <br /> <br /> Sjöström wrote not only and instructed this film, he also plays the main character. Of course, appearances in the movie are over-the-top at times, according to today's standards, but not as bad as in e.g. German German films were the case. And after all, this film is about its history and morals than it is about acting, so it doesn't matter much or distracts. A really good and effective undervalued sound film classic from Sweden. <br /> <br /> 9/10
