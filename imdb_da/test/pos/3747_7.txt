I recently watched this movie at a 3-D Hollywood Hollywood Festival. It was in polarized 3-D (Gray glasses not red and blue) It was so fun to watch this movie with an audience, the printout was excellent and 3-D perfect. The performances were over the top and it was added to the fun that the surprise ended (which we should not share with fellow players, at least according to the movie trailer and poster), people had howling with laughter. With today's standards this is probably more comedy than horror, but with the extra dimension of 3-D (complete with spider web and bats coming out of the screen), this movie was an entertaining drum in the 50's horror.
