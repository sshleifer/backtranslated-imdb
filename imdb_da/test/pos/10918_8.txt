I saw it because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding scenes. I read a place where Oz and Rudnick wanted to make fun of liberal movies, but the climax ends up being one of those movies. Also, some of the humor is a bit on the cloying side, Joan Cusack was too over-the-top for me and someone has a strange timeline re Oscars. Nevertheless, there were more than enough fun moments, like the kissing scene, the wedding that is not, and the stage with the principal, to enjoy this. Kline as always is good, but for me the real surprise was Selleck, which I am not a big fan of, but pokes fun on it fine here.
