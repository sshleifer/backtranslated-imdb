I love the other reviews of this movie. They reflect my attitude. I'm a 70 year old guy, minus the disco and "Star Wars" childhood. There was nothing good about this movie, except for a chase scene. Therefore, it was good because it was difficult, basic and economical. Roy Scheider brought the film, which was based on the crew, the 7 Ups who supported Gene Hackman in "French Connection". The people in it were trustworthy and average who burned and poured coffee, showed fear in the chase scene and almost lost it after a close collapse. Perhaps it would be easier to tell you what it was missing. There were no fancy weapons, just basic revolvers and raw sawn off shotguns. There was no hard guy philosophizing, ala Tarantino. There was no kung fu or samurai nonsense and no fancy trick shooting either. There was no wise guy doing a complicated scheme based on hundreds of things going just as he planned, including all others' reactions. The criminals were bad, but they didn't shoot people for hell. In fact, there was a body count of only three. something that the average movie these days would pass in the opening credits. It could be a G-movie today! No bus load of orphan school children was kidnapped, nor did terrorists threaten to kill half of the city. There were no high tech hijinks, nor were the crimes even very moving or brilliant, the highest tech thing I saw was a touch tone that was wall phone. It had no subplots or fun character development. Also no sex or women, except for a mobster's wife who screamed something like the Buddy our heroes had threatened her. <br /> <br /> It was a small undertaker who exploited his relations with the local mob and police to kidnap local mobsters for some easy payouts. The beneficiaries. Vito, was played by Tony Lo Bianco, who did a good job, as well as Roy Schneider, Buddy, head of 7 Ups policeman, whom he informed and exploited. What ever happened to Tony Lo Bianco, did he seem like a Pacino shoe in, handsome and talented? What it had was a great NYC backdrop for a simple crime story. Places that were gloomy and dehumanizing without being a sociological study. It had a simple plot involving this kidnapping scheme, where one of Buddy's police officers was accidentally involved, literally accidentally dragged in and then accidentally shot dead. When Buddy and his 7 ups are a hotdog unit, both NYPD Brass and mobsters seemed to be involved, as the kidnappers masked as ordinary garments to lure mobsters in line. It was clear that mobsters figured they had lawyers and rights to protect them from the normal police. Even the mobs were clear, old and ugly, no god family or soprano lift here. It's a good basic movie with a standout chase scene between two 70's Pontiacs. Even cars were clear and economical, not even a GTO or a Trans Am, like the play and the story. In the days of Batman uber-hype or "24" intensity judgment scenarios, this movie reminds that less is better. It should be shown to screenwriters and directors as a warning not to dazzle, entertain, and ultimately offend us with stunts, gadgets, and clown psychotic behavior to a large extent.
