Okay, I grew up on who, but haven't loved a doctor since Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston made me love who again and I will be furious with him forever to leave. <br /> <br /> The script is grand, the actress excellent, the direct (who was horrible in the old days) is just amazing. I was very skeptical about this program and just made it seem to be forced but now a big fan and love it (I have a ringtone of a Dalek screaming "Exterminate"). <br /> <br /> A few of the things I love about the new program - 1) people actually see when Rose (Billie Piper) disappears from the planet. Some of the old shows that an assistant would get rid of for a while and then come home as nothing happened, no one noticed. 2) Chris Eccleston's doc loves Rose - romantic or not will be discussed, but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares about his companion. He would destroy the world if he were to save her as the old show was missing - often a doctor would not care if he never saw his assistants again. 3) They speak and think like real people - when Rose is somewhat scary or new (like foreigners) she seems like a real person would - gobsmacked. I never liked it when an old show assistant who never saw a stranger would just fit in and adjust immediately. I want to see the surprise on Roses face when she sees a plastic dummy come alive. She gives it to me. <br /> <br /> The few things I don't like about this series: 1) Almost everything happens on earth (London or Cardiff), and I was kind of hoping for a more off-world kind of show. 2) That Eccleston left so fast, he really made the show brilliant. <br /> <br /> But I can let these few things go - I enjoy more of the series than I ever expected, so I don't mind if they have things put on the ground. <br /> <br /> Just don't take this show seriously - it's fun, it's smart, it's entertaining, but it's not a super-serious heavy duty show. It's pure fun, and pure British, and I can't get enough. Watch it with an open mind and put your brain in neutral and enjoy it! <br /> <br /> ps - don't see series 2 or later. Series 1 was brilliant, the first episodes of series 2 were good, but didn't look at it when it comes to Love and Monsters. Rolled up waste completely destroys the show.
