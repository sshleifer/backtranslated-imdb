I just watched Jean Renoir's wonderful movie, French Can Can. It is a visual delight and a good entertainment. The newly produced Moulin Rouge pales by comparison. I didn't quite get the praise the latest movie received. Now I am convinced more than ever that my assessment was correct after seeing a master movie maker like Jean Renoir's version of the same story. He managed to get good performances out of his overall throw, and the great French actor, Jean Gabin, was in rare form. The dance sequence near the end was one of the most exciting ones I had ever seen. It was a long time, but I didn't want to end it. This movie deserves to receive more recognition than it has.
