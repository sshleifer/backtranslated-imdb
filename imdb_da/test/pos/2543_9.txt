This is a wonderful movie about a soul of Ale. This is a journey to Ales heart. I found it fascinating. The director did a good job. He does the scenes. Especially on the quiet scenes. The Ale window is a great one. A scene when lying in bed is one of the best directed scenes I've seen. <br /> <br /> In addition to steering. It's been a good time, I didn't look at a movie about a soul. As a philosopher, I can say that this film shows that age does not matter about your soul. So like Anne's soul. <br /> <br /> As in Turkey, I don't care about the other side of NY. This is a universal scene you can see anywhere in the world. What concerns my opinion more universally than any other thing. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie. Otherwise you will miss a good thing about a soul. If you have one. <br /> <br /> Baris
