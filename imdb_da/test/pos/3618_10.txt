Being of the cephallonian lineage, I was fortunately surprised when I saw the movie. I have heard the true story of my relatives still living in Cephalonia, but when you watched the film and read the book, the outlined pieces of history were filled. It is absolutely true that the Italians would sing, the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often. The 1953 earthquake killed my grandfather and the book, and the films depict both the era's feeling with great compassion. If you haven't seen the movie go and see it and read the book, it's not just a love story, and yes, there were lots of Italians in love with cephallonian women, actually boat lots of cephallonian women were taken to Italy after the war it's a true depiction of the story.
