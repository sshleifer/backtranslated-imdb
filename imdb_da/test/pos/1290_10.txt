Christopher Nolan's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out. Shot at a micro budget of $ 6,000, this is a real class student movie. The film is shot in black and white and contains people you assume are friends of Nolan who appear in the movie. This is not to say that they are bad actors because they are quite good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appear in other projects, but unfortunately they have not since this was made 6 years ago. <br /> <br /> Nolan's thriller, like Memento, doesn't play chronologically, changing the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction. Scripture is amazing. It's a great twisting thriller, but because the time sequence of the movie is changing, it makes it even more interesting. I thought the last ten minutes, especially when everything is getting clear, was excellent. <br /> <br /> For a movie with a small budget and without recognizable names at all, it's so good. It's better than most Hollywood Studios offers, and Nolan after three films (this, the superior Memento and the not-so-good, but still excellent Insomnia) has cemented itself as the most exciting new talent of recent times. I can't wait for Batman. <br /> <br /> This movie is short and sweet and definitely a good watch. It is very professional and the twists are amazing and quite surprising. I also thought David Julyan's score was excellent, very atmospheric and had a cool quality for it. He has been composing Nolan's other films. <br /> <br /> All in all, I recommend this, I intend to get all of Nolan's movies. This is a low budget gem. ***** <br /> <br />
