The true story of a Spanish paraplegic, Ramón Sampedro, who fought for decades for the right to be euthenized. This film, along with the Best Picture winner of the same year, Million Dollar Baby, caused the same year with their portrayals of disabled people who wanted death. Both attorneys for the disabled and (unfortunately for the disabled) conservative pro-life groups protested both films and their Oscar nominations. The nominations also came during the entire Terry Schiavo debacle, just to put everything together in a historical perspective. The protests, especially from disability groups, against Million Dollar Baby, make no sense? The film showed clearly, without arouse, the life of a paraplegic as worthless. The film's central character, Maggie Fitzgerald, becomes a paraplegic, does not seem to get any advice at all, no help at all and will immediately die. The film is honest, pretty stupid and uncomplicated. The Sea Inside, based on the true story, is certainly much more thoughtful in the subject. It has probably got the railroad in the same category as Million Dollar Baby, without the protesters seeing it, an incredibly common phenomenon. The movie gives time for many different sides of the argument. And it immediately states that the desire to die is the sole and protagonist's sole. However, this is the cause of a few crimes and I still want to understand why disability groups may have a problem with it. First of all, the protagonist's meeting with a paraplegic bishop. I do not look friendly in the way he is depicted. His orally serviced wheelchair is depicted as absurd, and there is almost a comic book where his beautiful, boy-led servants draw him in the chair up the stairs. He can't even reach the room where Ramón is located, and one of the boy toys is forced to carry the conversation between them. I had to think about whether Ramón lived in a slightly more wheelchair-accessible house, he would not spend all his life in bed and perhaps find life more satisfying (who knows how close the film depicts reality). Director Amenábar (The Others) also contains some ridiculous scenes that attempt to make this film about suicide more life-conscious, as a cross-cutting sequence where Ramón looks thoughtful and his lawyer's baby is born. But besides a few nasty moments, the film is very good. It hurts that someone may die when they have the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others. But eventually our lives belong to us. Should we not have the right to choose? The movie's strongest asset is its supporting characters, and the actors who play them. It describes how Ramon's struggle and decisions affect them around him with a beautiful precision. Family members in particular are good, and Ramon's final departure from them is heartbreaking and tears. My favorite performance in the movie comes from Lola Dueñas, which I also felt gave the best, or certainly the most underrated performance in Almodóvar's Volver last year.
