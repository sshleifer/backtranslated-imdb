NOROI follows a documentary film, Masafumi Kobayashi, as he slowly discovers something mysterious and evil that leaves a trace of dead bodies in the wake. After interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud children's cries coming from the house next door (where there is no baby), Kobayashi heads over to talk to the neighbor. He is met with hostility by the outrageous, disheveled woman (Maria Takagi) who answers the door (and immediately slams it into his face) and looks at his 6-year-old son through a window. Strangely, both the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit (leaving a pile of dead pigeons on their back porch), and the woman who first complained of sounds, as well as her daughter, are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after. the. This piques Kobayashi is interested and he sets out on an attempt to find out what is happening. He soon discovers that those with mental abilities and extra sensual perception seem to be inclined to something scary, inexplicable, and possibly even apocalyptic. The well-known 10-year-old clairvoyant and TV celebrity, Kana (Rio Kanno) seems to think we can all be judged, but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of great help. Another female psychic / actress (Marika Matsumoto) gets involved, just like Mr. Nori, a mentally unstable cook / psychic who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and believes that people are eaten by it, he refers to "ectoplasmic worms." Clues eventually returns to the site of a small village now covered by a lake and the legend of an ancient demon known as Kagutaba ... Unlike many other handheld horror flicks, this one just as much depends on the plot as It makes reactionary first person scares. Fortunately, there is something of a story here, a very interesting and intricate one, so it does not rely on glimpses of horrible things through spastic camera work every single time for a while to keep your interest. The way Masafumi travels around, looking for the truth - with well-placed screws along the way - reminded me a little about the OMEN in its pacing. The film also does not consist entirely of footage shot of the documentary, but weaves in news reports and TV shows, as if what we see is an already completed documentary. It helps break up some of the monotony that is usually associated with movies shot in this particular style. The performances are good enough not to hurt any of the realism of the "actual" recordings. All in all, it is a suitable horror movie, with lots of plot changes, a little excitement and a couple of really scary moments that are worth checking out. My only real grip is that it could have used a little trimming here and there and seems to go a little too long. Otherwise, pretty good things.
