Gary Busey's best performance in a nicely flowing biography. The page had a musical background, he was able to make his own songs, and it really works. It's always good to see the fine actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith too. <br /> <br /> An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Fortunately, Mr. Busey Oscar nominated for this and lost Jon Voight in KOMING HOME. A pretty low budget flick that does not disappoint, with STORE SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope it made lots of dough. Busey was never so popular again for various reasons, but fortunately he has this unique on his CV.
