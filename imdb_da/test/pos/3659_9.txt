The opening night of the South Asian International Film Festival (SAIFF) in New York was an event that many of us were waiting for. <br /> <br /> I would finally see 'Hari Om' ?? I was tired of seeing the "promo" on a loop and the lingering taste of the song Angel of Nitin Sawhney in the promo, leaving me asking to hear the rest of it. I was impressed with visuals ?? and extremely curious about how the rugged-looking auto rickshaw driver would win the hearts of the amazing sophisticated French tourist! I remember being pretty fascinated by the theme when I read a line or two about it in the papers many years ago! Especially when I personally had been very fascinated some years ago when the flamboyant rickshaws in Jodhpur were! The snow and crowds outside the theater only raised my concerns. <br /> <br /> Once inside the theater, I found that the SAIFF organizers only presented disaster. I was uncomfortable and embarrassed about how little the event was organized and found myself in a difficult place, trying to explain and offering excuses to my friends (of mixed nationalities) whom I had invited to the VIP guest list. I was hoping to prove to them that Indian movies were not always about Bollywood ?? Finally and finally, the movie began to send fresh air in our way. Or did I think? Hari About ?? started with chaos and noise. Autorickshaw's honking, traffic and a lot of chaos. I found myself smiling when I felt a sense of "home" filling me. <br /> <br /> So the journey to Hari began ?? an auto rickshaw driver in Jaipur ?? The director could not have made a better casting call with this character. From Monsoon Wedding to Hari About ?? Vijay Raaz, in spite of his non-heroic appearance, carries this film exclusively on his acting skills, and he takes on the character, filled with all the nuances of a rickshaw driver in Rajasthan. He's a winner all the way. But how and where he learned to speak English even so fluently is the question! But his character depicts beautiful shades of humor and sensitivity. I love his innocent depiction of a simple guy from a village ?? who has high expectations of being famous one day ?? and yet know when to cut off to reality. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Camille enters the film wearing clothes that no one would dare to carry in one place. It's funny that no one really cares too much about her dressed like that. She looks very dazzling though! Especially in the last half of the movie, when she changes to Indian dress. However, her relationship with her boyfriend seems very vague. It probably adds to the reality of certain kinds of relationships. <br /> <br /> The movie takes us through the most beautiful parts of Rajasthan ?? The surprising part is that none of the sites have been portrayed other than what they really are. You look dirty, you see the primitive houses ?? you see Rajasthan exactly as it is !! Yet ?? There is only one adjective that it leaves you with ?? 'gorgeous'. <br /> <br /> This is the first instructor to probably know how to indirectly India exactly as it is - with dirt and noise and all the negatives that India is associated with! ?? But it looks like one of the most beautiful places to be in. <br /> <br /> Kudos! to him for that. <br /> <br /> The only downside of the movie I might see is the pace ?? I found it quite slow on some parts ?? But be sure you will never be bored. <br /> <br /> Nitin Sawhney's background score adds a classic international but very Indian flavor to the movie. The song "Angel", which plays at a very crucial time in the film, melts beautifully with the pictures. <br /> <br /> I've also heard that in addition to the protagonists, all the other actors are actually just normal people who had never ever faced a camera before !! It is legitimate to consider most of our so-called established actors ?? still cannot depict realistic characters on the screen. All in all, seeing this movie was a beautiful experience? It is a pot of emotion. It has romance, humor ?? realism?? beautiful visuals and places ..., good music, a great cast ?? A parcel store! When I left the theater - did I feel proud to be Indian? A few days later I asked one of my Bulgarian friends who had watched the movie with me if he wanted to see another Indian movie? and his answer was ?? "Is it better than Hari About? If it is, then I'll go? If not, I think I'll pass. Hari Om will now be the benchmark for every Indian movie I see." Mr. Bala, do you read?
