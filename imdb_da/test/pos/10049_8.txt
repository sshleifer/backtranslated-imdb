This is a wonderful movie as a movie - it becomes an 8 out of 10. Like a filmed piece of accurate history ... you want to be more loving, but it's a 5 out of 10. And I think I'm actually very charitable. What was he - the man of horse and saber who was the youngest "boy" general of the EU Army in the American Civil War and ended up dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes? Outspoken, militant, bumptuous, bloody, ambitious, clever, overly clever Indian-enemy, Indian-friend (?) And national hero. His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him to a fame position similar to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson and Grant / Lee and Sherman / Jackson. It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the over-ambitious hot-spur that his reputation fell. Still, George Armstrong Custer is still the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men at Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived March and World War II. <br /> <br /> Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals because of Western adventures and Little Big Horn. Too bad that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this movie. But even in 1941 the play was still strong. Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another movie review on this thread, survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later. Custer was regarded as our weighing but brave knight, and with the shadow of 2. world war threatening closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth. John Ford would have understood this fully and approved it. <br /> <br /> So we understand that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic. Although Custer was almost pushed out of West Point by demerites (which was true), Custer was in the 1861 class and it would have been really stupid to be fussy about such a fighter that year. You see, most of the so-called West Point military talent (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern and joined Confederacy. The Union needed all the northern "Point" men they could find. <br /> <br /> Custer's Civil War career should be further studied - he was attached to Secretary General George B. McClellan's staff and distinguished himself in the peninsula campaign and other Austrian warfare. But he was a cavalry man - and he would rise under Grant and Sherman's friend Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war. In particular, he served with hyphen and distinction at the Battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley. It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend Stephen Ramseur joined Confederacy and rose to a position as Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter last night alive). <br /> <br /> After the war, things fell apart. He wanted to make his letter - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't when it was a battlefield promotion). They only had one Lt. Colonel to give him in the shrunk army along the border. He tried to play politics, making the mistake of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political tour in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot. He apparently supposed the Indians (he was certainly eloquent in writing by them and the West), but he created a genuine military massacre in 1868 by Indian women and children who ended up with a court battle. Later in the 1870s, he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (who went up to the war minister, William Belknap), who bought and sold Indian trading items for profit. It destroyed Belknap and left a weak eye on Grant Administration. It put him in the dog house with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan hardly saved his career. Then he was sent on the final Big Horn campaign. And immortality arrived. <br /> <br /> This career is worth a real movie, but would it be too critical? Should we keep a man from the 1850s to 1876 to the standards in 2007? Would we like it for hundreds of years? It can certainly happen, but I'm not sure we will like it. <br /> <br /> Custer (1941 style) fits Flynn as a glove, giving the closest to a "dance" performance in any of his big movies. His final film with Olivia De Haviland is underlined by a melancholy because of the fate of the heroes. In support actors such as Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, enemies or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy). As an entertaining piece of myth it makes it loud - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
