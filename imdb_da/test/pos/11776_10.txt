<br /> <br /> Fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid. This short parody is at least as much a part of the Star Wars saga as Phantom Menace, and much more entertaining if you ask me. Hardware Wars was the first in a wide range of SW spoofs that form their own subgenre these days. I hate to describe it too much - it's so short that the premise is only about everything. Suffice it to say that many of the most popular and well-known aspects of Star Wars have fun on them. Household appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners depict spaceships and robots, and the princess Anne-Droid character wears real rolls on her head instead of the famous spirals of braided hair, and the Fluke Starbucker is even more dork than his original, if possible. Ernie Fosselius is a crazy son-of-a-buck-he's also the source of Porklips Now, Apocalypse Now spoof.
