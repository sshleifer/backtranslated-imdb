Feels like an impressionist movie; If there is such a thing. <br /> <br /> The story is well explained, very poetic. The characters are well developed and well behaved by the interpreters (or interpreted by the actors :)). <br /> <br /> The movie rejoices in its own lavish feelings at times and works well unless you hate such feelings in movies - It's not so in my case. It is a very humanistic film. <br /> <br /> The landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced chef is very poetic in itself. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> A great classic for any good movie collection.
