I honestly don't know why so many people hate this movie, I always thought it was one of my absolute faves. the fight with the tiger and his men rocked, the battle with the pirates with the axes rocked, the whole shit with everyone trying to avoid each other in the house is pure brilliant ... okay so it did not have the necessary kick ass final confrontation but the manchus was pretty good. I give it an 8/10.
