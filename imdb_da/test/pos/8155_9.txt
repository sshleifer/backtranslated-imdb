Hi guy, this movie is about choice. All the times in your life you have to choose something or it just goes away ... And this movie prove it! Of course, life is not actually a beautiful picture as this movie shows ... it doesn't show right, but some might count on it. I try to say it is full of pain, love, and deep lessons in life. Aaron, Mormon's missionary is the real shepherd who digs out the beautiful, deep inside Chisthian, the skin-feeling guy ... It's a good end and you always believe in fate because it will surprise you in a trip or in others of your life as last days ... Big deal see it !!!
