Okay, maybe it was because I happened to be in Yangchun China when I watched this movie. Maybe it was because I finally had something on TV, I could understand or at least read the subtitles, or maybe it was just fun. Whatever it was, this movie was worth it. <br /> <br /> I just got to my foot and head massage when they gave me the remote so I could watch TV. Normally I would turn off the darn case, but I stumbled across this crazy movie and got hooked. <br /> <br /> The reason, if you could call it a plot, was about a cooking competition and kind of is a love story and the food in this movie is the right star. If you like Iron Chef and many of the other cooking shows are currently in reality TV mode, then you will love the scenes of food in this movie. It goes fast and the subtitles are so fast you better pay attention to the speed reading for this. However, the action is mostly slapstick, so you don't always have to read the whole subtitle to get the idea. <br /> <br /> The greatest actress is lovely eye care and the main actor is not bad to look at either. They are both worth seeing. Finally, if you have time to kill and want a good laugh, this is not a bad choice for both. I don't speak a word of Chinese, but I could fully understand the cultural humor of this movie. For those who speak Chinese it might be even better. Overall, I give this a 8 out of 10, and at the moment I even look to find a copy to get while I stay in China, and hold on to when I return home, it will be a nice reminder to me about my time in Yangchun and a stupid afternoon at the massage salon watching a silly movie.
