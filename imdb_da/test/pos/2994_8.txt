First love. Teenage love. We've all experienced it, even though it wasn't as sweet as what the protagonists share. "Friends" could be considered an adaptation of the classic "The Blue Lagoon", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While "The Blue Lagoon" puts the two young lovers in a desert island without contact with civilization, "Friends" goes the opposite route, and it is certain that calling much more true and being a more difficult movie with modern audiences. Paul and Michelle, who for various reasons turn to the family and the adult world to end up living together in a small cottage in southern France. Having only one another and their childhood innocence slowly develop their friendship to much more, as they struggle to sustain themselves in this sweet forthcoming story. This movie even to this day is controversial as the actors are teens and they certainly see the ages set in the movie (15 and 14 1/2). The film contains a hint of child morality, nudity, teenage sex and teenage pregnancy. But the real controversy is not the object, but the fact that Paul and Michael's love is presented as a natural and healthy relationship. While this worked fine for stranded lovers in a different time and in a desert island, in a modern setting, they have some very difficult moral problems. Legislation prohibiting consent between minors is valid in almost all countries, and lack of sexual education in teenagers is seen as one of the causes of the increase in unwanted teenage pregnancies and abortions. Is a movie like this just child pornography or a blow to the face to make us meet our own hypocrisy about a modern society that does not cater to teenage parents and laws that are clearly against human nature and hormonal development, but it is necessary to prevent child abuse? Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth? These are not simple questions, and most of us will feel uncomfortable with them. As an artistic piece, this movie is really a forgotten and rough gem. The script progresses with extreme simplicity, albeit some sappiness, but never pulls to indicate its message, even though it is standards today, it is somewhat slow. The photography is beautiful and it has scenes of great beauty. The action of the two main characters varies from truly horrible in some scenes to wonderfully innocent and believable in others. Pop music, unlike most productions today, is used tastefully and sometimes the text speaks the main character's thoughts. Overall, this is a nice piece, even though the moral values ​​are not in accordance with your own.
