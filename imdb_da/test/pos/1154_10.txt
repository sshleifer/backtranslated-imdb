Okay, I'm a story buff, and okay, I'm an action movie junkie, so of course this movie is on my top ten all the time. I really love action scenes and the unique weapon of the period. I have no doubt fighting with two-handed swords from horse pants, and the Raisuli sword seems more katana-like than scimitar-like, oh, I never fought for horses back either. <Br /> <br /> I also love attempts at philosophical sayings. The typical desert man probably could not read the Quran so they would take his word for it. Common authors have criticized Connery's brogue, yes on vacation as a youth, I met a family of South Africans in our Western Dinosaur National Monument, and although they spoke African among them (yes, the second generation Germans can hear the difference), they spoke English with one scottish brogue.See what teaches you affects you your pronunciation.Shot missionary?
