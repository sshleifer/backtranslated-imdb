This movie I've seen many times. I read the book, Englar Alheimsins, which was written by Einar Már Gudmundsson, who received the Scandinavian book prizes for the work. The movie does not start in the same place as the book starts. It happens in Reykjavík and the protagonist, Páll is young and has a good life with his girlfriend. But when she breaks down the relationship with him, he starts to get some headaches that make him irritated and angry. And soon he starts to have great mental problems, and then the film begins. Soon he will be put on the Icelandic mental hospital called Kleppur, and there you will see some beautiful figures like Viktor, who believes that he is Hitler and Óli, who believes that he writes all "The Beatles" songs and sends them to mind transport. Ingvar E Sigurðusson, who has the leading role of Paul, is so good that it gives you breathing. Also the music in this movie is sour of SIGURRÓS and just for the music's price you have to watch the movie. Overall, a great movie meant to be seen.
