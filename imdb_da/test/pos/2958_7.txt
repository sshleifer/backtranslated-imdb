This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does not measure up to the 1956 classic, but is a fine film with enough coarse and tumbling action and moves along with a good clip. Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders that have a creepy pattern for those with peaceful Indians who are victims of a gang of hooded kills. There are more killings and violence usually associated with the Lone Ranger adventure, and the movie has an undercurrent of racist insensitivity whose remarks are sprinkled throughout the manuscript. Ranger uses aprons as the only thing he can do to summarize tracks and postpone the ban and bring them to court. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheel's star in a colorful presentation showing great benefit to the desert and cactus land of Old Tucson. The music score is good, but the well-known William Tell Overture theme is nudged aside by vowels that are interesting but lacking in the blossoming and beauty of Ranger's traditional theme.
