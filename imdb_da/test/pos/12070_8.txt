This is not a big movie as they cast (especially the kids) admirably helping to keep up with this very boring, but immersive plot, cliché-filled cliché. Bad family in the 50s in Central America, dying mother, alcoholic, 10 children (one of whom has epilepsy) and a horrible decision. It is very easy to see and some of the children's performances move without being sick or naff. And little Frank and Warrnen steal the show for me with the last scene that leaves me bawling, no matter how many times I see it. A great rainy afternoon movie I recommend to everyone. Only those with the hardest hearts could not be moved by it. Not on par with Sophies Choice, but a good TV movie equivalent !!!
