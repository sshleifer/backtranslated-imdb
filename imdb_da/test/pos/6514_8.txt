I love this movie, one of my favorites all along. Ann Blythe as Sally O'Moyne is sweet and hassle free. She thinks praying for Saint Anne will solve all her and her friends problems. The bad bad signature to get her father's property is fun and clever. Her brothers are what kind of brothers a girl would love to have. Also look for "Aunt Bee" as her mother, a strong Irish woman who will not leave her house as she brought her family in. They no longer make them like this, that's for sure.
