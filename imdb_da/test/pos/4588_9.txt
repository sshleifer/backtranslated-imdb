Mike Dommer's Idiocracy is an interesting movie and one that his fans will undoubtedly track and see. <br /> <br /> Before I start the review, I would preface it by saying that if you get a chance to see it, definitely do what it is worth watching and is not the easiest movie in the world to track. Let's start with the premise - Luke Wilson is Private Joe Bauers, an army librarian who is considered to have absolutely no outstanding features or clear defects, making him totally average in every way. This, along with having no live relatives, makes him a candidate for an experimental cryogenic procedure. Also frozen with Joe is a prostitute named Rita, who was bullied for the project by Upgrayedd, her fierce pimp. Unfortunately, a few days after they are frozen, the secret project is abandoned and they are forgotten. <br /> <br /> They wake up in 2505 and find it with the dumb down in society after the evolution of In recent times, everyone on earth is a little more intelligent than a chimpanzee. The way "allman" Joe Bauer speaks is seen as being "faggy", much like a person who speaks like Shakespeare would ridicule now, and a former professional wrestler is the US president (in fact, this is not so scandalous really) . The best show on TV is called "Ow! My Balls!", Which sounds pretty good, and not only is everything misspelled, but characters seem to have run out of space for wording, so they are bound up . <br /> <br /> It's a fun prerequisite for movies, but this is the problem - apart from the original premise, not so much in the movie is really fun. What I mean by that is that the ideas that come to mind reading the film's premise are probably as fun as the movie itself. Of course, this is not terrible, but it could have been more fun. <br /> <br /> There are some winners in the script that Starbucks now offers "happy ending", and people place their blind faith in the universally misunderstood "electrolytes", but they are just too few and far apart, unless you have to laugh hysterically every time one of the future idiots pulls out a slack-jawed profanity laden sentence with little or no logic and / or intelligence, then the laughter can be pretty well placed. <br /> <br /> It is unfair for everyone to compare it to Office Space because it is a very different movie, but as a movie, whatever came before it, Idiocracy is a fun concept that is likely to have you much more in the opening 15-20 minutes than in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I give it 5 out of 10 because it's fun but don't do it enough to raise it across the middle of the road.
