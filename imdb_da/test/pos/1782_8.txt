This is the episode that is probably most closely related to its partnership law, "Thou Shalt Not Kill," as it directly raises the ever-controversial issue "Why do we kill people killing people to show that killing is wrong?" This problem is presented in two parts within the episode: before the killing, when the film shows the dichotomy between the idealistic up-and-coming lawyer and the gadget so trapped in his ways that his life is merely a representation of what he is followed by the period after the trial and before the execution, when both are affected by the deaths they feel responsible for and thus share. <br /> <br /> One of the great things about how these episodes work is in both small and large ways the story is fully developed, so we understand both motivations and stories of characters we can only spend a little less than an hour with . For all his criminal intentions and mockery, the murderer is still very sympathetic and revolves around the most important part of his actions about a story of accidental death. His way of killing is more a desire to control death than it is a desire to actually destroy. Similarly, the lawyer's idealistic naivety shows a reluctance to allow death to happen in a world where he cannot control it. Your meeting is actually important; They both have to give in to it but not multiply it. As a side, it is interesting how much this episode affects the display of Rouge, Kieslowski's later end of the Trois Colors trilogy. One of Kieslowski's greatest influences seems to be the idea of ​​justice, and given that the decal is a meditation on something that represents divine justice, this seems almost the most self-conscious. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
