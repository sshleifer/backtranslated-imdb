I remember watching the trailer for this movie and I definitely knew I had to watch this movie. It looked like something that would be right up to my alley. <br /> <br /> The "USA of Leland" is a great movie. It is not someone who will leave you with a good, comfortable end, but with a sad, empty feeling instead. And when I say it will leave you with an "empty" feeling, I don't mean that as a bad thing. I think you are meant to fill the empty feeling with your own thoughts about the characters and the general motives of man and how they act as parts of society. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling is completely cast as Leland. He is intelligent, yet stoic. I like the way he tells the movie with his journal. The support molding is also fantastic. Kevin Spacey is very good as always, and Don Cheadle is great as Leland's teacher and mentor. <br /> <br /> This was a great story and is very smart and thoughtful. I highly recommend it.
