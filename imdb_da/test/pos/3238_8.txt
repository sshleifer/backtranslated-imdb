I just checked out Northanger Abbey from the local library and didn't expect much. Imagine my surprise at this gothic treat! Northanger Abbey is one of the most eerie places you have ever seen, with empty passages and ornate spaces full of hidden secrets. The film's honor is that it never reveals everything: Your imagination runs free, runs with the protagonist's imagination, a Kathrine M. She is a wild fantasy girl, a gothic fantasy reader that she brings into her (and our) real world . <br /> <br /> If I needed a word to describe this great movie, it would be surreal. Dreams are woven throughout the film, increasing the mood. Sometimes it is difficult to tell what is genuine and what is not; This is intentional, I think. Atmosphere rules the highest. The music is not what you would expect from a movie by Jane Austen: it is scary, flute and drum based, loud and joking with an undercurrent of fear. If there was a soft, pleasant tune in Northanger Abbey, inviting would be positive. Now it is vain, an ugly and heavily walled palace of goblins. (But! The characters! You have to see them for yourself!) <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a funniest evening, look no further than Northanger Abbey.
