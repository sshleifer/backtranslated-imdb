I remember watching this movie many years ago at VHS in a friendship. At first I thought it would be a boring movie. But much to my surprise it ended up being one of the best movies I can remember watching his time. It has a good history line and best of all it has some amazing Aussie cars and street racing. I really loved the Fox's car the most, which was a working Dodge Charger. The painting work done on this car was really excellent in my opinion :)! There is also a black two door blown 57 Chev which enters the movie later. <br /> <br /> I actually got a copy of this movie at VHS last year at K-Mart here in Australia. I was planning to convert this movie to DVD though, since I think it's a movie worth the conversion. But much to my surprise this weekend, while watching the DVD movie tray, I came across it on DVD. So of course I grabbed it while I could as it was the only copy there. <br /> <br /> Whether you really want to see some classic street racing with real muscle cars, including a great story without rice burner insight. Then this movie is for you !!!! <br /> <br /> Here are some additional information taken from the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> He will win at all costs Fox is a young man who lives in the fast lane. He thinks he's the fastest man on the road - but street racing is illegal. If he does not accept his latest challenge, he may lose his girl ... if he accepts, he could lose his life. Living dangerously, living fast and winning at all costs is their occupation. They do not return, they do not give in. And they don't ask for help.
