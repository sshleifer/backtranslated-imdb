This has always been a favorite movie of mine. I have owned a VHS copy, and a few months ago I found a DVD release that is also part of my video collection. I've also become a great baseball fan, and as part of my off-season reading, I downloaded a copy of Robert Whiting's excellent book "You Gotta Have WA", profiling in and out of Japanese baseball and the challenges of foreign players having experienced play in Japan. When I started reading yesterday, it made me think about this movie because it seems that the manuscript was based pretty much on this book. The parallels are scary. Jack Elliot's character looks very much like Bob Horner, an aging MLB slugger whose best days were behind him. Horner's teammate Leon Lee is also depicted in character Max "Hammer" Dubois, a Japanese league veteran who has enjoyed the frustrations of the Japanese game and helps keep his teammate sane. The Elliot character goes through the same order of meetings as Horner, from great fanfare signature, early success, burning an already ravenous sports media and the subsequent downturn that tracks frustration, alienation from teammates, fans and media, and the resulting disillusionment. who asks for a desire to go home to the United States. The only difference is that the film adds such Hollywood touches as a love interest and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> When I talk about love interests, I'm sure many viewers have come to this site (as I did) to look up the actress who played "Hiroko" (the beautiful Aya Takanashi) and what other work she has done It only shows this movie. It turns out on the basis of an article I read that the short love scene she has with Tom Selleck (a foreigner) in this movie (mild of our standards - they mostly kiss while he is in the bath and have a towel) an act of violence by the Japanese public (especially men) that she has never been offered another role of any kind, in film or television - mainly blackballed by the Japanese film industry. It's a shame when she (was) a talented actress in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie so much for baseball elements and cultural differences like I did - find a copy of "You Gotta Have WA" by Robert Whiting. A good reader and a great companion book for this movie.
