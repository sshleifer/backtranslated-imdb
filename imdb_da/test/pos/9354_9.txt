Outstanding movie that handles a theme with large proportions with a very well-balanced direction. Dmytrik was a very good instructor, at least from what I can tell from this movie and Murder my Sweet, but he was severely hit by HUAC as other film directors and actors. It is, in a way, ironic that Crossfire did not receive any Oscars because it is an exquisite example of how to make a good movie on low budget. Everything about this movie is extraordinary: a well-written script that utilizes extensive flashbacks, a great cast, great lighting that seems to tell the story more than the actions that are correct. What more can you expect from a top-notch movie? May I add that noir is used here for its stylishness and I can add economic benefits. But it shows once again that what was originally considered a B-movie may have more influence today, that most of the heavy-handed A movies that lost their audience over time. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a noir movie in itself, and it raises serious questions about what noir is actually. The style is absolutely noir in terms of sets and especially light, but the theme transcends the recipe to the "noir genre". You can see things from the opposite perspective and claim that anti-Semitism is only a pretext for the criminal investigation that the puzzle around the murder is the real focus. This would have been the case if it hadn't been for Robert Ryan in an excellent performance. In any way, the film has a lot to offer and it is really a pity that the director had to suffer so much injustice for his former belief in a truly "noir" period in America
