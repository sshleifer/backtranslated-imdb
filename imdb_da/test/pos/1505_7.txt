Lucio Fulci was one of the most prolific Italian directors at his death in 1996, but his career had long since come down to a downward spiral of increasingly incomplete genre entries that could hardly be shaded by his earlier work. In the mid-70s in the mid-80s, he excelled at such stylistically distinct horrors as "The Living of the Living Dead", "The Beyond" and the brutal giallo "The New York Ripper" remembered by fans like myself. And while "Cat in the brain" falls into the era of Fulci's decline as the film maker, it is a shocking, dark hilarious tour that a clear subordinate work (the framework, the effects and the play is under par) shows an interesting, open meditation on pop psychology and the film's ability to desensitize. Don't make a mistake: "Cat in the Brain" is a total gore party and disjointed like Fulci's previous movie, but it deserves credit for trying to be something more. Fulci plays in a delicious tongue-in-jawbone himself: an instructor in between to film another fierce horror girl coming down with perverse / murderous hallucinations; After visiting a shrink that puts him under hypnosis, his dreams and reality begin to cross to the point where the viewer cannot distinguish the two. The recent DVD from Grindhouse Releasing mentions "Cat" as an heir clear to this kind of "Eraserhead" and it carries a similarly unpleasant, awkward fun quality associated with the best surrealist art.
