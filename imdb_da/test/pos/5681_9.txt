I put this movie on not expecting much other than a B movie gore party. Luckily, I was presented with a very well-made film that built the excitement and managed to maintain it throughout its lifetime. This was an impressive achievement. The play was solid and created characters that you were worried about and related to; And while some may find the movie slow, it forced you to think about what you would have done in the same situation. Added to this was some fine camera work and the managers pulled it all together admirably. An excellent effort so it's worth your time if you prefer the development and excitement of gore.
