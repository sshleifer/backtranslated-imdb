Much has been said about this film and its important importance for the language of the film. If you are interested in movie history, to really understand the innovations that Eisenstein brings to the media, try to see Potemkin alongside most movies made before it (those of D.W. Griffith offers a good contrast). It should be allowed that Eisenstein was not the only mounting theorist and the principles of editing editing would probably have been discovered by another given time. But even today, few leaders have approached the skill with which Eisenstein created meaning through the combination of images at such an early stage in the medium's development. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in such things, potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made. You should see it, buy it and tattoo it to your chest.
