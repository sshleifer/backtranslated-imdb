The title does not refer to a questionable poker hand, but to six comics. They come in two years: Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland as a couple drive to California for another honeymoon, George Burns and Gracie Allen as another couple joining together to share expenses and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth as a sheriff and a hotel owner in a small Nevada town. No attempt has been made to design a coherent narrative. It is a collection of comics that are tense together. All the first couple wants to do is spend time together, but Burns and Allen's characters are not married, so the men pile together like the women. There's a bit of a plot: A poor guy plants $ 50k in his suitcase Pinky (Ruggles) goes out of town, but because the expedition is controlled by Gracie, the foliage can't be found. The bad guy appears in Nevada and Fields accidentally catches him. A bunch of comfortable pieces, Ruggles' confused expression, Gracie's sharp, breakneck talk and Fields playing billiards with a curve cross cue and making a fluttery, craven, back-stepping double-take when threatened, and his wonderfully distinctive way of lull word. And trying to remember the name "Gracie", he tells Skipworth, "Hmm. Starting with a K ... McGonigle." She replies, "Oh no, no no no ..." "Mmmm. Wangahanky!" "No, no no no no. Oh, Gracie." "Yes it's true."
