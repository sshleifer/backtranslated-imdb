If you take the film for what it is worth, you will not be disappointed. If you think Murray should win an Oscar for his performance and that's the type of movie you expect, don't bother. It was fun when I saw it in 1979 and has not lost its charm. Good clean fun for the kids and mindless entertainment for the older people. The story is simple and easy to follow. Murray has done better, but it's his first movie. The movie reminds me of a time when we didn't need blood and gut to be entertained. Morty is the head dunce and plays that part perfectly. The other advisors are typical revved up teens seem to have fun in the summer. A nice thing about this movie, it has a message.
