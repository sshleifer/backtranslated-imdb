A movie for mature, educated audiences ... <br /> <br /> I saw "Random Hearts" in an advance screening shortly before its North American release. This romantic drama was a pleasure. I am sure that this story will not be everyone's cup of tea, especially given the dark, untreated premise of the film. But the picture has some very uplifting strong points to its advantage. <br /> <br /> All-time Box Office Draw Harrison Ford ("Star Wars", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "The Fugitive", "Air Force One", "Patriot Games") is at the top of his games as the head and desperate interior minister, Dutch. Ford's very subdued, nuanced performance completely reveals the range he can achieve with class and determination to bring the audience into his world of loss and treason. This is the perfect complex role and very different type of movie for Harrison Ford to reach the screen shot between its action blockers. Next year, Harrison Ford returns to action, first to director Robert Zemeckis ("Forrest Gump") "Back to the Future") in his summer 2000 thriller, "What Lies Below," and reportedly later this year in the movie's adaptation of Tom. Clancy is "the sum of all fears." 'Fears' will be Harrison Ford's third outing as CIA operative Jack Ryan. <br /> <br /> Director Sydney Pollack ("Out of Africa", "The Firm", "Tootsie") has a supporting role in this function as a political adviser to Scott-Thomas Congresswoman. It is a very sharp and energetic depiction for Pollack. Not only is Sydney Pollack a gifted instructor, he is also one of the most credible, natural and charming actors around (see also "Eyes Wide Shut"). Kristin Scott-Thomas ("The English Patient," "The Horse Whisperer") shows that you should not necessarily be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy. This is one of her better films, and she provides a highly crafted and mellowed performance that works well opposite Ford's silent toughness. The subplots seem wonderful, especially the subplot, which involves Ford's character investigation of police corruption. Look for a chilling and effective swing of "Heat" actor Dennis Haysbert, who plays Detective George Beaufort, the obstacle to overcoming in Holland's investigation of police corruption. The rest of the support supports is a wonderful joy. Charles S. Dutton (whose long delay in a movie role) shows that he is one of the best character players around, and Bonnie Hunt, whom I find extremely solid in this production, steals most of his scenes with the wonderful, charming smile like Wendy Judd. <br /> <br /> The technical side of Pollack's thriller is top-down. From Dave Grusin's (Pollack's "The Firm") completely surreal sense of jazzy score to Philippe Rousselot ("A River Runs Through It") sharp photography to the sharp editing that keeps the movie fresh, despite the movie's unfortunate downer premise. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery, successful plot, character-driven stories and romance that all rolled into one. This is a great story of fraud and forgiveness. It also has one of the most surprising, yet exciting, and certainly controversial conclusions for a recent Harrison Ford movie. "Random Hearts" is definitely one of the best movies of the year. <br /> <br /> (*** 1/2 out of ****) or (8.5 out of 10.0)
