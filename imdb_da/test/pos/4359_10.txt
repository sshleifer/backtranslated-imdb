We see at the beginning of Little Dieter the need to fly Dieter Dengler, the subject of the movie, an obsessive-compulsive. Or at least it is what he seems to be at constant opening / closing of doors and with his large stock of food in the basement. In this way, director Werner Herzog poses a key question in a way to say why Dieter is such. Well, he is not necessarily obsessive-compulsive, as he is just well prepared. And why shouldn't he be after the life he lived? Apart from the juiciest, the darkest and most exciting and scary and just scary narrative story that is at the heart of the picture, the back story of Dieter is also fascinating. Dieter's own childhood, for example, had already struck from the start, in the post-war Germnay, poor in a family without much food or prospect, and ate the wallpaper to "the blue in the walls". But going into a passion, an un-yielding desire (which is, of course, part of Herzog's bread and butter and love of man in his film) flying, and for Dieter there was nothing but fulfilling this. What it ends up with being a US citizen is more than he could have negotiated. Dieter is one of Herzog's most compelling, quirky and compassionately observed characters throughout his career, a man who is memory shaken by brutal reminders that his time is a Vietnam POW, although at least it allows for some of the most compelling storytelling stories in any documentary from the last 20 years. Ironically, the story comes through - unlike The Wild Blue Yonder - mostly in masses and lots of Dieter exhibits on some of the most minute details of his time in the various prison camps (torture tactics, bugs, the brutal, miserable violence and threats as with the wedding ring) and leads into the most interesting and sad portions with his best friend Duane. They escaped prisons together, but found out that their trip to Cambodia would not be so easy. Now, for the most part, the speakers make something exciting, which is what Dieter goes through his stories and sometimes makes re-enactments (in fashion Herzog could only do when Dieter is already middle-aged in handcuffs and everything through the jungle) one can see all this in the mind. It all becomes even more alive to try to get these little details and the intensity of it all into a form of reality. Herzog keeps these portions simple and knows when to keep Dieter back in his responses, making him more and more a key figure of interest. He is never quite "normal", but unlike a Timothy Treadwell you will never think of laughing at him either. <br /> <br /> So along with his hero (whether war or not, it is hard to say, as Dieter disputes claiming to say those who died were the real heroes, typical, but perhaps quite rightly, Herzog stems his movie with a mix of old stock footage when he describes Dieter's early life (the period's recordings of World War II and after German ruins are always a captivating sight, and with Herzog standing up in his timing and assemblage with music) and in capturing Vietnam's recordings in the air of jungles and fields. Herzog is also very wise not to inject the policy at all in the case, there is no 'I was used by the Americans' or what was thrown into the mix. There is even a feeling that Dieter does not care too much about an angry with everything that happened to him, that is just what happens in wartime (and of course he went bombing people from his plane). Now, through many of these harrowing - and even in the smaller pieces involving what was happening in prisons, bathrooms and food debris, it's always harrowing - luckily Herzog also keeps a humorous level in check. One of my most favorite scenes in the movie, where Herzog breaks away for a moment from Dieter, is when he shows a "trainee" movie used for American soldiers, believed to show what should happen if left alone in the jungle . With all the tools they could possibly have with a knife, a flare gun and a very fast helicopter to get around (and this is set to hilarious dead-pan voice-over work). <br /> <br /> But even the moments when you laugh, only remember the moments of absurdity in a time of absolute crisis, and how to never ever imagine how it is to be alone in a foreign territory surrounded by humans That will do something to preserve that person as a form of security in wartime. Diets, apart from knowing that flight and airplane are the only way to live, he will ever have (and Herzog ends the movie on a wonderfully gloomy, elegant note where he flies over a vast area of ​​airplanes) knows what is to have to survive at all costs. But yet, as in many of Herzog's leading role-driven films, there is the almost immutable spirit that will remain persistent if you are strong enough, even through horrific moments (Dunae's fate) and problems right up to the helicopter rescue ( he American or a spy, they ask the helicopter). Dieter is such a man with a spirit, and through Herzog he is given a fantastic, tragic, creative, well-shot, though perhaps too short, tribute to his life. And of course it pumps me even more to the upcoming dramatization Rescue Dawn.
