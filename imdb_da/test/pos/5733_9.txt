The Elegant Universe generates many ideas about the universe and existence. Having seen this documentary, one cannot avoid taking a step back and reconsidering their view of the existence of everything. There is a large cast of scientists, mathematicians and others on both sides of String theory. It is constantly challenged as untried, untried and possibly dead wrong. The closest thing to proselytizing, as anyone does, is to explain that Quantum Physics, sets of mathematical ideas that provide extremely good approximations to what happens to subatomic particles, have never made a wrong prediction. Not so with String theory; No one is willing to say that the camera that String theory is the truth, and in that respect the piece retains some respectful distance from the subject.
