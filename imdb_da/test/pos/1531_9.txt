This movie surprised me. I only saw it 10 years ago and it still stays with me. It's got just plain boring points, and I would personally have finished it differently - at least it didn't deter me from seeing it again and again and recommending it to others. The action is _fantastic_. The play and the director do a fantastic job with the manuscript, and anyone who likes different movies who have the patience to sit and say, "What the hell is this?" And let's pull in, give this movie a chance. If you just want Alan Rickman to be goofy or to see things explode, it's not the movie for you.
