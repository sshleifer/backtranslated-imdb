It's hard to know which category to insert into this movie, most movies in this era of American history are westerns, but here instead of the wide open plains in the west, the action is almost entirely limited to a claustrophobic girls boarding school in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with Amy, a young girl who walks even though the forest picks mushrooms when she does, she stumbles across corporal John McBee McBurney, a wounded EU soldier whom she returns to school. We know he is not a very good person when he kisses her on the lips to distract her from warning a transient Confederate patrol, even though she told him she was twelve. <br /> <br /> Once again in school's opinions are divided on what to do with their new guest, some believe they should take care of him until his wounds are cured while others believe it is treason to Don't leave him to the Confederate forces on the first occasion. The former group reigns and he regains gradually. As he does, his presence has an effect on all the girls who have not had a man on the site for a long time, including a young teacher and the main lady, whose previous relationship seems to have been with his own brother. McBee sets out to seduce them emotionally if it does not physically lead to great jealousy among the girls. <br /> <br /> While this movie is rated fifteen, it's certainly not for younger viewers, both for the sexual content, how small is actually shown, but much is implied, and for a very cruel scene that got me to squirming more than any other scene in any movie I've seen for some time. It is interesting to see Clint Eastwood play against type, rather than being heroic, his character is both unpleasant and most of the time benefiting the women around him. The plot is solid throughout, not only from Eastwood, but also from all the actresses, including the young Pamelyn Ferdin, who played Amy.
